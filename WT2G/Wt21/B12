<CENTER><B><FONT >Appendix: The Private Monopoly Laboratory
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >Suppose that the monopoly laboratory has an
oversight committee. For purposes of clarity, naively assume that
the committee members are interested in maximizing consumer welfare,
and, therefore, political variables are ruled out. The monopolist
is assumed to be a standard profit-maximizer producing certifications
at a price, P. Price is a function of the number of new drugs
certified, ND, and safety, s, of the drugs. Thus, P=p(ND,s). Total
cost is a function of safety and the number of new drugs certified,
and increases with respect to safety. Thus, C=c(ND,s). <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The oversight committee is interested in maximizing
consumer welfare, W, and, therefore, would like the area under
the demand curve and above production costs to be maximized, i.e.,
it would like the monopoly to maximize:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (1) <IMG SRC="IMG00004.GIF">.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The first-order conditions are:<BR>

<FONT > (3) <IMG SRC="IMG00007.GIF"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >where subscripts denote partial derivatives.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The monopolist, however, is interested in maximizing
profits and therefore attempts to maximize:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (4) <IMG SRC="IMG00008.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Its first-order conditions are:<BR>

<P>
<FONT > (6) <IMG SRC="IMG00010.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >From (3) the oversight committee is concerned
with the impact of increased safety on all consumers (from the
integral), while from (6) the monopolist is concerned with the
impact of increased safety on the marginal consumer. Furthermore,
when <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (7) <IMG SRC="IMG00011.GIF"></FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00012.GIF">
<P>
<FONT >the monopolist undersupplies safety from the
oversight committee's point of view. The committee then arguably
orders the monopoly to increase the safety of its certified drugs
at the cost of reduced monopoly profits. It is important to note,
however, that it may not be possible for the oversight committee
to discern the consumer-maximizing output decision. The monopoly
may exaggerate the impact of increased safety on price, P<SUB>s</SUB>,
to the extent that the inequality in (7) becomes an equality.
In this case the oversight committee believes that the appropriate
level of safety is being provided, when in reality the level of
safety is not as high as desired. Even when the committee has
oversight on the level of profits realized, the monopoly may engage
in X-inefficiency, and thus still provide lower than desired levels
of safety.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Dorfman and Steiner (1954) modeled a monopolist
whose product demand is a function of price and advertising. Consider
this approach but, instead, focus on safety rather than advertising.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, the monopolist maximizes:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (8) <IMG SRC="IMG00013.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >where the cost function is now additive in
new drugs and safety and, as before, ND=N(p,s). Maximizing with
respect to p and s, the first-order conditions are:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (9) <IMG SRC="IMG00014.GIF"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >and</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (10) <IMG SRC="IMG00015.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >where, again, subscripts denote partial derivatives.
Denoting E<SUB>p</SUB> = -ND<SUB>p</SUB>[p/ND] as the elasticity
of demand with respect to price and E<SUB>s </SUB>= -ND<SUB>s</SUB>[s/ND]
as the elasticity of demand with respect to drug safety, then,
as Dorfman and Steiner showed, (9) and (10) can be rearranged
as<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (11) <IMG SRC="IMG00016.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This is a version of the Dorfman-Steiner condition.
For a given E<SUB>s,</SUB> the greater the elasticity of demand
with respect to price, E<SUB>p</SUB>, the smaller the safety to
sales of new drugs ratio. Given that the demand for new drugs
is highly inelastic with respect to price, which in the case of
life-threatening diseases may the case, safety relative to total
sales of new drugs will be high, other thing equal.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Nonetheless, given the simplistic nature of
this analysis, the oversight committee may get less safety than
the amount desired. This is the case when the marginal valuation
of safety to the average consumer is greater than that of the
marginal consumer. In an attempt to maximize profits the monopolist
undersupplies safety, according to the oversight committee. Also,
when the price elasticity of demand for new drugs is high relative
to the safety elasticity of demand, the level of safe certifications
relative to total sales of new drugs is low. And, as stressed
above, by exaggerating the impact of safety on price, the monopoly
can still maximize profits by undersupplying certification of
safe new drugs, and even if the committee regulates its profits,
the monopoly may still undersupply safety by engaging in X-inefficiency.
The point is simply that even with a benign oversight committee
bent on maximizing consumer welfare, regulation of the monopoly
laboratory easily becomes a quagmire. And, undoubtedly, the more
realistic the model is made, the deeper the quagmire.<BR>

<h2>Therapeutic Drugs and Biologics</h2>
by Henry I. Miller and William M. Wardell<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT >EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B></FONT></B>
<BR>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The goal of this proposal is to speed the delivery
of safe and effective new drugs and biologics to patients in need.
 To achieve it, the plan proposes changes in the current regulatory
system that will facilitate early clinical research, increase
the efficiency of drug development and its regulatory oversight,
and reduce the overall time and cost required for safe new drugs
to reach the market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >The Need For Reform</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The existing system for regulating drugs in
the United States has been fairly successful, as narrowly defined
by an assurance that products admitted to the market are reasonably
safe and effective.  By broader measures, however, it has failed.
The development and approval of new drugs and biologics is too
slow and costly.  The present system wastes the resources of both
the pharmaceutical industry and the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). In the name of safety and effectiveness at any cost, the
development of many promising new therapies is prevented, and
the availability of new products delayed.  An unnecessary burden
is being borne by patients, by U.S. industry, and by the national
economy -- unnecessary because safety and effectiveness do not
have to be sacrificed for innovation and the introduction of greater
efficiency. We need a wiser balance of objectives.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The total time required for drug development,
from synthesis of the molecule to marketing approval, has more
than doubled -- from 6.5 to 14.8 years -- since 1964.  The time
from an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing to a New Drug Application
(NDA) approval now averages 8 years.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >FDA has raised the regulatory burden on drug
sponsors by continually introducing new requirements and policies
without due regard for their potential to hinder the delivery
of new and innovative therapies to patients who need them.  The
drug-development system in the United States has become the most
ponderous and expensive in the world.  The cost of bringing a
drug to market now averages more than $350 million. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There has been broad consensus for nearly three
decades that reforms are necessary, but few have been implemented,
and none expeditiously or widely.  Occasional attempts by FDA
to streamline regulation are little more than window-dressing.
 The inability of the executive branch of government -- including
FDA -- to reform itself necessitates legislative action to change
the scope and procedures of oversight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Numerous official panels and inquiries over
the past 30 years have proposed remedies for the deficiencies
of the system.  The most important and consistently repeated of
these recommendations has been the need for <I>management and
structural reforms</I> that would transfer some tasks currently
performed internally by FDA to outside experts and organizations.
 While FDA has at one time or another delegated most of its review
and evaluation functions (except final sign-off for approval)
to outside experts or entities, the delegation has been piecemeal
and disorganized; partial privatization has never been integrated
in a way that could create an efficient overall system. The plan
proposal corrects that and creates a system with these recommended
management and structural reforms at its core.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Other reforms recommended repeatedly have included
a lesser role for FDA in the scrutiny of early-phase clinical
investigations and the wider use of accelerated approvals coupled
with continued post-market surveillance.  These recommendations
are adopted, explicitly or implicitly, in the current proposal.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >The Proposal<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >While rationalizing and enhancing the efficiency
of the process for developing, reviewing, and approving new drugs
and biologics,<I> the proposal maintains the existing legal requirement
for pre-market demonstration of safety and effectiveness</I>.
 Preserved as well are FDA's enforcement powers and the agency's
authority to issue the final sign-off approval for product marketing.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The key changes are these:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >1) Primary responsibility for managing the
Investigational New Drug (IND) filing, oversight of the clinical
program, and New Drug Application (NDA)/Product License Application
(PLA) review will be transferred from FDA to Drug Certification
Bodies (DCBs).  The DCBs, which can be private- or public-sector
(university) organizations, for-profit or non-profit, will be
certified by FDA and staffed -- as required by the language of
the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act -- with &quot;experts qualified
by scientific training and experience.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >2) The sponsor will submit NDAs (or PLAs) to
the DCB, not to FDA.  After evaluating the NDA, the DCB will submit
the results of its review (if favorable) to FDA. The FDA Commissioner
will then have a finite period of time in which to accept the
DCB's recommendation for approval (which, legally, is a &quot;rebuttable
presumption&quot;) or to deny approval. If approval is denied,
at the discretion of the sponsor and the DCB, a review may be
undertaken by an independent appeals panel reporting to the Secretary
of HHS.  All parties, including the FDA, will be expected to accept
the decision of the Secretary. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >These reforms will encourage greater efficiency
and cost-effectiveness via competition among the DCBs, improvements
which will affect both the tactics and the strategy of drug development
and approval.  DCBs' competition for sponsor-clients will favor
those that perform effective problem-solving for the client, manage
the oversight and review efficiently, and perform reviews in a
timely way.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Economic pressures will encourage the DCBs
to be competent and timely, and to cultivate a reputation for
integrity -- traits that will be most highly prized by clients.
 The enormous complexity and myriad alternatives at various steps
in the drug development process provide the DCB opportunities
to add value to the client's product.  Just in the realm of clinical
trials, the choice of endpoints, indications, and trial design
strongly influences the size, time and cost of development programs;
therefore, there is significant potential for savings of time
and money.  Subject to the legal standard of safety and effectiveness,
DCBs will be encouraged to devise innovative and more efficient
ways of developing drugs and getting them approved.  This strategic
competition among DCBs and cooperation between DCBs and sponsors
will transform the drug development and approval process and redress
the current trend of increasing time and costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >More efficient management of the oversight
and review process will reduce the time and costs required for
drug development and approval.  In this way, greater numbers of
new drugs will become available to patients in a timelier fashion.<BR>

<h3><FONT >REGULATORY REFORM:  IMPORTANCE,
HISTORY, AND GOALS</h3>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Need For New Therapies</B>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >American patients and physicians need and deserve
more rapid access to greater numbers of safe and effective drugs.
 It is clearly in the public interest to encourage pharmaceutical
innovation -- the discovery, development, and marketing of new
therapies.  Over the past 35&nbsp;years however, regulations originally
designed to protect public health by preventing the sale or use
of unsafe or ineffective products have themselves become impediments
to progress in the field.  The evolution of pharmaceutical regulation
has moved inexorably in one direction: toward more stringent,
burdensome, and intrusive oversight as FDA has assumed more and
more responsibilities and power.  As the Presidents Biomedical
Panel concluded in 1976, the delays and costs that the FDA's protective
systems impose on drug development constitute a &quot;hazard to
public health&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.  In 1973 the president's Science Advisory
Committee concluded that it may &quot;be worth adapting US regulations
so that not even a single important new entity introduced into
selected foreign countries during the previous year fails to become
available in the US.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This proposal seeks to restore a more appropriate
balance between regulation and innovation - but without jeopardizing
product safety - by facilitating the development and regulatory
review of pharmaceuticals.  Public health will be maintained and
even enhanced.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Why is Innovation so Difficult and Costly?</b></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is a fact that the development and approval
of new drugs in the United States takes too long.  The total time
for drug development, from discovery or synthesis of the molecule
to NDA approval, has more than doubled since 1964, from an average
of 6.3 years, in the period 1963-1965 to 15.0 years, in the period
1990-1992.  The time from IND filing to NDA approval (the most
highly regulated portion) now averages 8 years in the United States
-- two years longer than in Europe.  There have been dazzling
advances in discovery, such as the cloning of receptors and the
use of transgenic animals for both toxicology testing and human
disease models. But regulatory burdens have hampered innovation,
compromised the availability of new therapeutics, and wasted the
resources of both FDA and the pharmaceutical industry.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As the time required for drug development has
lengthened, the average &quot;effective patent life&quot; - that
is, the time remaining from NDA approval to expiration of the
main patent -- has declined correspondingly, a double disincentive
for sponsors considering drug development. Effective patent life,
nearly 14 years in 1966, declined to less than seven years in
the early 1980s.  The Waxman-Hatch Patent Restoration Act of 1984
restored, at most, half of this loss, and required other substantial,
costly concessions from the research-based drug industry, notably
earlier approval of generic drugs.  It is the effects of these
and other disincentives to research that are being seen in the
consolidation of the research-based industry today.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Analyses of innovation in the U.S. pharmaceutical
industry show that its research output, as measured by the introduction
of INDs for new chemical entities (NCEs), declined rapidly and
significantly after the 1962 law was enacted.  The decline occurred
in several phases.  There was an immediate decline (by more than
50 percent) in the early 1960s.  Then for a decade the output
was fairly constant, but in the mid-1970s it fell again by another
50 percent.  It recovered somewhat in the early 1980s.  However,
in the last decade it has declined again, although in the 1990s
the shortfall in NCEs has been compensated by &quot;new biotechnological
entities&quot; (NBEs), the corresponding biotechnology product
candidates.  (DiMasi et al, CPT 1994)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It would be overstating the case to argue that
all impediments to innovation derive from regulation.  The process
of innovation -- a lengthy and complex one involving discovery
and development, including clinical testing -- is formidably difficult
and expensive.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In addition to the scientific and technological
hurdles, there are new obstacles in marketing. Over the past decade
there have been fundamental changes in the nature of the market
for pharmaceuticals and in the product criteria needed to succeed
there. The days of the manufacturer selling a new drug directly
to individual physicians are rapidly vanishing.  Typically, today's
manufacturer of a new drug must convince a panel of experts who
comprise a managed-care organization's formulary committee --
a discerning and informed consumer -- of the importance of the
product.  Their evidentiary criteria can exceed those of FDA and
they may call for evidence (such as pharmacoeconomics and comparative
efficacy) that is outside the sphere of the drug-approval process.
 The utilization of new (and other) drugs is becoming more tightly
controlled, and the outcomes are being recorded and analyzed in
ways that were previously inconceivable. There is, for example,
a growing use of computerized control of patient selection, indication,
dose, and duration of therapy.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, manufacturers' products and claims, and
the evidence supporting them, must meet very high standards to
be accepted in today's marketplace.  In this exacting environment,
government regulation of the product-development process should
not add burdens that are no longer necessary.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One fundamental cause of the ever-increasing
regulatory burden in the United States is  that regulators strive
to avoid, at any cost, approving a product that might turn out
to be harmful, even if this policy causes them inevitably and
systematically to delay or neglect to approve products that promote
patients' well-being.  Consequently, FDA has continually imposed
new requirements and assumed new regulatory responsibilities that
have inexorably increased the length of the approval process and
the costs involved.  Because this phenomenon goes to the fundamental
malaise of FDA's monopoly over drug evaluation and review, it
is worth exploring further. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There exists a marked asymmetry, or imbalance,
between the two kinds of wrong decisions that a regulator can
make: (1) a decision to approve for marketing a drug or other
product that turns out to be harmful (an &quot;error of commission&quot;),
or (2) a decision to deny, delay or inhibit approval of a drug
or other product that would be beneficial (an &quot;error of omission&quot;).
 Putting this another way, it is the difference is between permitting
something bad to happen and not permitting something beneficial
to happen.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Several kinds of asymmetry exist in the two
situations.  Two classic examples of errors of commission are
the approval of the tranquilizer thalidomide by some European
regulatory agencies in the 1960's and the approval of the &quot;swine
flu&quot; vaccine by FDA.  Mistakes like these are highly visible.
 They bring down the wrath of the media, the public, and legislative
oversight bodies.  Often both the developers of the drug and the
regulators who allowed it to be marketed are criticized and punished
-- witness the modern-day pillories in Congressional oversight
hearings and the press.  A regulator's career might be damaged
irreparably by the good-faith but mistaken approval of a product.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Errors of omission, in the form of unreasonable
demands or requirements, can delay or prevent entirely the marketing
of an important new product.  But such errors of omission caused
by regulators' bad judgments, timidity or anxiety is often known
only to a few knowledgeable company and FDA insiders.  And if
the mistake precipitates a company's decision to abandon the drug,
both the regulatory misstep and the sequelae may be largely invisible.
 Moreover, there may be no direct evidence that the continuing
suffering of patients is avoidable -- or that the regulators are
culpable.  Too often FDA is allowed to &quot;err on the side of
safety,&quot; when that is merely a euphemism for committing an
error of  &quot;ommission.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The changes in regulations proposed here are
intended, in part, to improve the balance between benefit and
risk, and between safety considered narrowly and patients' overall
welfare.  The plan will shift the balance toward encouraging product
development and permitting patients greater and timelier access
to the benefits of innovation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Positive Features of the U.S. System of
 Drug Development and Regulation</FONT></B>

<P>
<FONT >In proposing reform, it is important to understand
and preserve the virtues of the present system.  Industry, government,
academia, and medical practice all play a role in the scheme of
drug development, regulation, and use in this country.  This system
has substantially achieved two major goals: <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >1) protection of human subjects of clinical
research (through the IND process); and,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >2) assurance that no product reaches the market
until proved reasonably safe and effective for its labeled use
(through the NDA process).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The major regulatory requirements governing
this process were instituted in 1962.  Over the past 35 years,
students of U.S. regulation have learned a great deal about the
nuances of the regulatory system and of FDA itself, including
which aspects work well and which need to be improved.   It should
be noted, however, that drug regulation, while important, is only
one of many important contributing factors in bringing new therapies
to patients.  Profound changes have occurred over the past three
decades in widely disparate parts of the system and in society.
Clinical research has advanced. The media has become more aggressive
and covered these subjects more fully.  Public sophistication
and awareness has grown.  Pharmaceutical marketing, tort case
law, and -- perhaps most important and powerful now and for the
foreseeable future -- the system of paying for medical treatments
have all changed dramatically.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Clinical research, for example, has many more
professional, full-time, career clinical researchers (including
MD/PhDs) than it did in 1962.  Since 1962, we have also seen the
advent of institutional safeguards, such as Institutional Review
Boards (IRBs).  Corporate operating procedures have been systematized,
as have corporate and government clinical-safety reporting and
analysis procedures. There is the new science of pharmacoepidemiology,
and innovations in patient care, such as skilled clinical research
nursing at research institutions, have provided yet another level
of expertise applied to clinical research. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In addition, various entities have become <I>de
facto</I> standard-setting organizations.  The newest ones, which
are rapidly becoming the most powerful, are managed-care organizations.
 As described above, these organizations exercise influence through
large-scale purchasing, control over their formularies, and drug
utilization review.  Formularies and drug utilization-review are
particularly powerful; physicians practicing within organizations
like HMOs are seeing their ability to prescribe increasingly constrained
or &quot;corrected&quot; by computerized &quot;governors,&quot;
in systems that perform overall integration of the medical record
for case management.  A physician might be prevented from prescribing
a drug if according to software filters it does not fit a patient's
listed diagnosis, or is excessive in dose or time of administration.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >While drug regulation has played a major role
in the elevation of standards to their present levels, these other
factors are essential and autonomous components that exist outside
FDA's  realm.  They are virtually independent, non-governmental
instruments that help to maintain research integrity, drug safety
and efficacy, and post-marketing surveillance.  Furthermore, FDA
is by no means the only world body that regulates drug approval
for safety and efficacy: a score of other countries (and now the
EU) have systems that perform reviews and achieve results that
are essentially similar to those of the United States -- and incidentally,
operate with staffs and budgets disproportionately smaller than
the FDA.  Indeed, as drugs become increasingly subject to these
various new controls before and after marketing approval, the
relative importance of FDA as a protector inevitably diminishes.
 This evolution must shape the reform of pharmaceutical regulation.
A regulatory system for the 21st century has to be different from
one crafted in 1962 when the problems were very different, and
the other elements of <I>de facto</I> regulation were almost non-existent.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The History of Regulatory Reform<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT >FDA is responsible for regulating the testing
and marketing of all new human and veterinary drugs.  FDA's basic
authority is embodied in the 1902 Public Health Service Act; the
1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and 1962 amendments
to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Public Health Service
Act mandates the <I>safety </I>regulation of biological drugs.
 The 1938 Act charged FDA with ensuring the <I>safety</I> of all
new drugs before they are released to the market (the NDA approval
process).  In 1962, partly in response to the thalidomide tragedy
in Europe, Congress imposed the additional requirement that a
new drug be shown to be <I>effective</I> as well as safe.  The
amendments also expanded the government's authority to regulate
clinical investigations of drugs (the IND process). Today all
preclinical and clinical research is conducted under FDA regulations
and policies.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is striking that for decades, debates about
regulatory reform have identified the same problems and the same
solutions have been recommended by panel after distinguished panel.
These eminent and expert panels, including the McMahon Committee,
the Lasagna Committee, the Edwards Committee, and the Council
on Competitiveness have recommended both broad changes and specific
improvements that would reduce the time, cost, complexity, and
unpredictability of the process, and thereby prevent the loss
of potential therapies.  Because the agency has been too slow
and obdurate in implementing most of these repeated recommendations,
reform must come from outside the agency, via legislative changes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A particular advantage of our proposal (to
be described in Section II) is that delegating a portion of the
oversight responsibility to non-governmental entities introduces
two basic improvements simultaneously: (i) an element of competition
among DCBs for drug companies' business, which creates pressure
for greater creativity and efficiency; and (ii) a more appropriate
balance between risks and rewards, incentives and disincentives
than presently exists.  These basic elements derive from first
principles of management and regulation.  The proposed mechanism
also contains safeguards to assure the integrity of the process,
including high-quality reviews.<BR>

<h3>THE PROPOSED NEW SYSTEM:  REGULATION
OF DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS</h3>
<BR>
<FONT >The goal of the plan is to speed the delivery
of safe and effective products to patients who require them. 
To achieve that, changes in current federal regulation are proposed
that will facilitate early clinical research; increase the efficiency
of drug development and the constructiveness of its regulatory
oversight; and reduce the overall time and cost required for a
new drug to reach the market.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >While improving the process for developing,
reviewing, and approving new drugs and biologics, this proposal
maintains existing safety and effectiveness standards by preserving
the legal requirements for pre-market demonstration of safety
and effectiveness.  Preserved as well are FDA's enforcement powers
and the agency's final sign-off authority to approve product marketing.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The salient aspects of this proposal are the
transfer of much of the responsibility for day- to-day IND oversight
and NDA review to non-governmental experts; support of the review
mechanism (DCBs) by user fees (via contractual arrangements between
sponsors and DCBs); and competition among the non-governmental
entities that will oversee the IND process and perform reviews.
 No single component of this proposal is completely new, but the
integration of these various elements into a drug oversight and
review system is accomplished in a novel way that is both logically
sound and empirically validated.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our plan proposes changing the system of regulatory
oversight of drug development by transferring the primary oversight
responsibility (but not the final approval step) from FDA to non-governmental
entities, Drug Certification Bodies (DCBs),that are staffed by
the experts that the law requires to make judgments on effectiveness
and safety.  This transformation of the IND oversight and NDA
review process for  individual products in development will be
more comprehensive than other, similar proposals that would, for
example, delegate piecemeal various FDA functions such as review
of NDA filings.  Competition among the DCBs to provide regulatory
oversight services, combined with safeguards against conflicts
of interest and overeagerness to approve products, will create
a more efficient drug development process and promote innovation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Drug Certification Bodies (DCBs)</b>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >DCBs will be certified by FDA to ensure they
have the technical, scientific, and managerial expertise necessary
to oversee and review particular specialties or categories of
products.  The DCBs' own imperatives to compete for clients, avoid
tort liability, and retain FDA certification are the fundamental
triad that will provide the impetus for high standards.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The corporate structure, geographic location,
and number of DCBs will be determined by market forces, as will
how many DCBs emerge and survive.  DCBs may choose, for example,
to be for-profit or non-profit; to be physically located in existing
centers of medical research or near centers of the pharmaceutical
or biotechnology industry; and to specialize in particular therapeutic
areas or drug types, or be  broadly qualified for a wide range.
 The regulatory process for obtaining licensure as a DCB could
be modeled on other complex health-related licensing procedures
such as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
(JCAHO).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >FDA will certify the DCBs to oversee most of
the drug development process (i.e., to evaluate and issue INDs),
oversee drugs in development, and review NDA applications.<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At the sponsor's option, the DCB may offer
advice on what is appropriate or required in a development program
to obtain NDA approval, but ultimate approval cannot (and should
not) be guaranteed. Nor should this be part of the contract. In
the end, the results of the physico-chemical, pre-clinical, and
clinical studies will provide evidence of safety and efficacy
-- and, therefore, an indication of likely approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Initially, DCBs will likely recruit from FDA,
industry, and contract research organizations (CROs) the scientific,
medical, and regulatory experts required for judgments on safety
and effectiveness. Experts may be needed in fields such as pharmaceutical
toxicology, pharmaceutical formulations, biopharmaceutics, drug
study design and analysis, clinical monitoring of therapeutics
and quality assurance, chemistry, and manufacturing.<B> </B> Because
these are specialized technical undertakings, the DCB will need
a broad range of scientific, medical, regulatory, and management
expertise. For this reason alone, qualifying for and retaining
FDA certification will be challenging.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Sponsor's Relationship with a DCB</b>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The product sponsor (usually a company) will
select a DCB from those certified for the respective product class
-- categories might include, for example, anti-hypertensive drugs,
psychotropic drugs, or vaccines.  Important factors in that choice
will include the perceived ability of the DCB to oversee a suitable
NDA program and the likelihood of a successful DCB review and
eventual FDA approval for its particular product.  Other factors
influencing the choice might include the DCB's geographic location;
reputation for service; experience with studies of comparable
size and complexity; and, fees.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Different sponsor companies will require widely
different degrees of interaction and service from DCBs, as happens
now with sponsor-FDA interactions.  Sponsor-DCB contracts will
reflect these differing needs.  The level of service required
will depend on factors such as the size and previous experience
of the sponsor (both generally and for the particular class of
drug); the intrinsic novelty of the product; the presence of difficult
issues of purity, potency, stability, or toxicity; and the size
and complexity of the clinical program.  Other issues will sometimes
be prominent; for example, in the case of important public health
products such as influenza vaccine, there could be a compelling
need for extremely rapid testing and approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The needs of the sponsor companies will determine
how many DCBs can ultimately be sustained by the U.S. drug development
process, and what their special features and location will be.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Role of DCB in IND Oversight and NDA Review</B>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because the DCB will have primary supervision
over the IND, the IND submission will be made to the DCB, not
to FDA.  However, FDA will maintain its role in the national surveillance
of clinical safety of investigational drugs, as part of its responsibility
for all drug safety surveillance, as described below.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The contact between the sponsor and the DCB
will normally begin during preclinical development, well before
the expected start of clinical trials, just as sponsor-FDA interaction
often does now.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCB will advise on and evaluate the IND
filing and issue the IND when it is satisfied that the risk/benefit
considerations are appropriate for the commencement of  clinical
trials.  Following the granting of the IND and the IRB's (independent)
approval, the sponsor will be able to initiate the study, as at
present.  The DCB's close involvement with the sponsor will encourage
the identification and solution of problems during the pre-submission
period.  Little or no additional time -- the current 30-day waiting
period, for example -- should be needed to obtain IND approval.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCB will oversee the testing of the new
drug throughout its clinical research phases, concentrating on
issues of safety and efficacy.  The DCB will ensure that the sponsor
is in compliance with the currently applicable regulatory standards
(including GLPs, GCPs, and GMPs). The DCB will be responsible
for auditing the sponsor to ensure that standards have been met
in all areas and for certifying this compliance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Once the sponsor and DCB have agreed that the
accumulated data on a product fulfill the legal requirement for
safety and efficacy, the sponsor will submit its formal New Drug
Application (NDA) to the DCB.  The DCB will be responsible for
certifying, through its regular site visits and audits of the
sponsor, that the original data are accurately recorded, analyzed,
and reported; that the data are suitably archived for future audits
if necessary; and, that the summary analyses and reports accurately
reflect the data.  The criteria for approval of the NDA will remain,
as they are now, safety and efficacy, as judged by experts (in
this case, the DCB's experts), according to the law.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because of the DCB's continuous involvement
as the data supporting the NDA are accumulated -- a process that
has in past reform proposals been referred to as a &quot;developing&quot;
or &quot;self-reviewing&quot; NDA -- the evaluation and review
of a straightforward NDA will normally be completed rapidly after
its submission.  Also, because the DCB's report, like the NDA
itself, may be written as the NDA data are emerging, even difficult
issues to be addressed in the report -- such as marginal efficacy;
low therapeutic index; or problems with safety, stability, or
manufacturing -- will often have been identified and solved by
the DCB in the course of the IND.  Thus, a DCB's favorable recommendation
may often be issued with only a minimal additional &quot;NDA review
period.&quot;  Thus, the system will encourage a high level of
problem-solving, as the market learns to favor those DCBs that
offer competence, predictability, and a reputation for high standards.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCB's recommendation to the FDA for approval
of the NDA will summarize the evidence supporting a positive recommendation,
similar to (but with more detail than) the current Summary Basis
of Approval (SBA).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Role of the FDA in IND Oversight and NDA
Evaluation</B>
</FONT><P>
<FONT >FDA will be responsible for certifying DCBs
and for overarching safety concerns.  The agency will not be involved
in individual IND programs unless there is a specific safety issue
that cannot be handled through the normal oversight of the sponsor
by a competent DCB.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >On safety matters, the DCB will oversee the
sponsor, but FDA will retain its responsibilities for national
oversight of safety matters, particularly those that involve information
outside the level of the individual drug, sponsor, or DCB, as
described in Section E, below. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >FDA will devote more attention than it does
now to clarifying, updating, and making public the criteria for
NDA approval in all therapeutic areas and indications.  As new
therapies and indications arise and as the old ones evolve, FDA
will participate in public forums with sponsors and DCBs to establish
new criteria or modify existing ones.  The goal of this important,
ongoing interaction among FDA, sponsors, and DCBs is to establish
and publicize the objective criteria for approval, and also to
foster a cooperative interaction among the parties.  The existence
of up-to-date, objective criteria will promote consistency between
DCBs for similar products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >During the evolution of the IND and NDA evaluation
and approval, FDA will not normally be exposed to the developing
project in any detail (except for major or unexpected Adverse
Drug Events (ADEs, see below)).  However, the agency will be kept
apprised of which drugs are being studied through periodic reports
from the DCBs.  These reports also will include information needed
to monitor safety information and allow general oversight, such
as: INDs issued (name of drug and sponsor); ADEs; and milestones
(dates and numbers of patients in the clinical development phases,
for instance).  During the IND phase, FDA will not routinely have
contact with the sponsor, but may at any time inspect or audit
the sponsor, DCB, or any other component of the drug-development
apparatus.  An FDA inspection might be triggered, for example,
by a suspected problem involving safety that has been inadequately
addressed, or information that raises concerns about the integrity
of data from an investigator or institution. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Once the NDA has been sent to FDA with the
DCB's recommendation for approval, the agency has a fixed period,
for example 90 days, to review the recommendation.  During this
90-day period, the Commissioner can approve the drug or reject
the NDA for a specified cause (which, in effect, rebuts the &quot;rebuttable
presumption&quot; of the DCB's recommendation). The 90-day period
of review is not extendable and the Commissioner's failure to
act during this period is deemed to be assent to the drug's approval.
 If the NDA is rejected, the DCB or the sponsor can appeal the
decision (a process which in turn must be completed in a further
90 days). The appeal mechanism is described below.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Clinical Drug Safety Oversight During the
IND</B></b>
<P>
<FONT >Safety oversight is largely unchanged in our
reform initiative.  We propose to keep intact the present national
system of pharmacovigilance administered by FDA, above the level
of the DCB. The current requirements and schedules for submitting
expedited and periodic safety reports will be maintained.  Under
the new system, reports will be submitted by the sponsor to the
DCB, which will transmit reportable ADEs to FDA.  FDA communications
(including any alerts based on safety data received by FDA from
U.S. or international sources) will be made to the DCB with a
copy to the sponsor.  In this way, the DCB will continue to have
primary oversight of the sponsor's handling of safety issues,
while FDA will maintain a broad purview.  In addition, FDA will
be able to obtain the safety data necessary for compliance with
international agreements on the reporting of safety data.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To aid FDA's safety oversight, as already described,
the DCB will inform FDA periodically of the status of the INDs
it is overseeing.  The objective of these reports is primarily
to provide FDA with information necessary for its oversight of
the safety of human subjects -- not to allow the agency to create
an active or primary role for itself in the routine oversight
of clinical programs.  (A secondary objective is to permit FDA
to plan its review of DCB recommendations.)  It is expected that
most issues that arise in the course of drug development will
be resolved by sponsor-DCB interactions without involving FDA.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<b><FONT >Status of the Regulations Implementing the
Law</b></b>
<P>
<u>Safety and Effectiveness</u> 
<FONT >Currently, a drug's sponsor must demonstrate
its safety and effectiveness through controlled clinical tests
that are themselves closely regulated by FDA.  Before a new drug
can be marketed, FDA must determine that -- based on the data
submitted -- the drug is effective and reasonably safe for use
under the drug's labeling. It is important to note that Congress
did not create exact definitions of what is meant by &quot;effectiveness&quot;
or &quot;safety,&quot; and that the law does not supply such definitions.
 Rather, the law provides for these judgments to be made by <I>experts</I>
&quot;qualified by scientific training and experience.&quot; 
Nowhere is it specified that such experts should be exclusively
FDA employees, although that is how the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act has come to be interpreted.  This interpretation is, in effect,
just a custom that the FDA has imposed and the industry has come
to accept, even though it was not the intent of Congress as expressed
in the law; in fact, this interpretation goes beyond the letter
of the statutes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our proposal for reform conforms more closely,
we believe, to the original intent of the existing statutes and
regulations governing safety and effectiveness.  Some proposed
changes, such as the identity and location of the &quot;experts&quot;
required by law, will prevent the statute from being distorted
or over-interpreted.  No change is proposed in the existing legal
standard for premarket approval, which requires evidence of safety
and substantial evidence of effectiveness derived from adequate
and well-controlled investigations as evaluated by experts qualified
by scientific training and experience.  The DCB experts' recommendation
that a drug should be approved will be, in legal terms, a rebuttable
presumption that the drug meets the law's safety and effectiveness
requirements.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<U><FONT >The Regulations That Implement the Law<U><P>

<FONT >We believe that the current set of regulations
that implement FDA's enabling statutes, and the agency's interpretations
of them, are in many places unnecessarily complex and extend beyond
what the law -- and scientific principles -- require.  These can
and should be simplified, to be made more consistent with the
intent of the law.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In order to provide for an orderly transition
to the new system and to maintain consistency with internationally
harmonized formats, the current regulations will initially be
retained.  However, as experience is gained with the new system
during the transition period, a standing committee with representatives
from FDA, sponsors, and DCBs will revise and simplify the regulations
in order to streamline the IND/NDA process while keeping it consistent
with the requirements of the law.  Such revised regulations could
be converted to a status in which adherence to them by a sponsor
would be sufficient, but not necessary, to meet legal requirements.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As discussed above, there must be ready access
to up-to-date standards of evidence needed for NDA approval. 
For the proposed system to work effectively, FDA, working cooperatively
with DCBs and sponsors, will continue to produce and update the
standards that apply.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Appeals Process</B><P></b>
<FONT >Two major problems have systematically prevented
industry from voicing complaints about the process or content
of FDA's decisions.  First, there has been no venue of independent
appeal for a party with a valid complaint; and second, there has
been a justified fear of agency reprisals.  Although there is
an FDA ombudsman, he currently reports to the Commissioner. Some
would look to the FDA advisory committees, but they are selected
and managed by FDA and address only issues presented to them by
FDA staff. There is no independent forum.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our proposal creates an appeal mechanism for
DCB-FDA disagreements on product approval  -- an independent,
standing advisory committee of experts, the Committee on Medicines
Oversight, at the level of the office of the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  It will have approximately
10-15 distinguished members representing patients, medical practice
and medical science, and the drug and device industries.  The
members of the committee will represent a wide spectrum of scientific,
medical, and regulatory expertise, and ad hoc members can be invited
as necessary.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The committee will hear appeals of FDA rejections
of a DCB recommendation, and will advise the Secretary, who will
instruct the Commissioner on the committee's decision.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Facilitating U.S. Approval of New Drugs
Approved Abroad</FONT></B></b>
<P>
<FONT >The efforts at international harmonization
of drug-approval standards and registration packages among advanced
countries implies that, in the future, other countries' evaluations
may not need to be completely duplicated in the United States.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >We propose to allow the direct submission to
FDA of an approved registration package from Europe (the European
Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) or certain national regulatory
agencies, such as Great Britain's Medicines Control Agency). 
A foreign agency would function like a domestic DCB in that it
would submit summaries of the data on which its approval was based,
and the 90-day time period would apply for FDA to review and approve
or reject this package for the United States.  Alternatively,
the sponsor of a drug that had obtained (or was en route to) foreign
approval could contract with a U.S. DCB to review and submit its
NDA.<BR>

<h3>ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF REFORM</h3>
<P>
This
proposal outlines necessary reforms in the system of new drug
approval. It takes into account the need for high standards of
public safety and also the often-ignored need of patients to have
access to beneficial, sometimes potentially life-saving, new therapies.
It preserves some of the salient features of the present system,
and changes those that have become inefficient and unnecessarily
burdensome. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The existing system 1962 and, resistant to
reform, has become more complex and troubled over time.  Fundamental
changes have taken place in government, industry, and society
that call for a new, less antagonistic and monopolistic system
that fosters innovation, without sacrificing safety.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At present, approximately 85 percent of New
Drug Applications are ultimately approved. However, given the
staggering costs and the length of time invested in drug development,
that 15 percent failure rate is extremely costly.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This proposal offers a constructive approach
to responsible and responsive regulation.  While retaining responsibility
for the oversight of safety, the FDA sheds its day-to-day involvement
with the development of specific new drugs, leaving that to government-certified
organizations, the DCBs.  The new role for FDA emphasizes clarifying
and developing criteria for various categories of new drugs; monitoring
the DCBs; and working with the DCBs to eliminate wasted effort
and assure that when the recommendation for approval of a drug
is made to FDA, the agency will be able to approve it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Under the proposed system, the spur to greater
efficiency and cost-effectiveness will be competition among the
DCBs, which will affect both the tactics and the strategy of drug
development and approval.  DCBs competition for sponsor-clients
will favor those that perform effective problem-solving for the
client, manage the oversight and review efficiently, and perform
reviews in a timely way.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Economic pressures will encourage the DCBs
to be competent and timely, and to cultivate a reputation for
integrity, because these traits will be most highly prized by
clients.  The enormous complexity and myriad alternatives at various
steps in the drug development process provide the DCB opportunities
to add value to the client's product.  Putting this another way,
just in the realm of clinical trials the choice of endpoints,
indications, and trial design strongly influences the size, time
and cost of development programs; therefore, there is vast potential
here for savings of time and money.  Subject to the legal standard
of safety and effectiveness, DCBs will be free to devise innovative
and more efficient ways of developing drugs and getting them approved.
  This strategic competition among DCBs and cooperation between
DCBs and sponsors will transform the drug development and approval
process and reverse the current trend of increasing time and costs.

<h3>APPENDIX:  DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATION
-- THE CURRENT SYSTEM</FONT></h3>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>How a Drug is Developed</B>
<P>
FDA does not test drugs itself.  The development
of a new drug is undertaken by a sponsor, which -- because of
the time, complexity, and costs of the process -- is almost always
a pharmaceutical company.  (Occasionally -- in about 5 percent
of approved drugs -- a federal agency, university, hospital, or
research institution may discover compounds, obtain patents, and
start development, but such entities almost never have the resources
and specialized skills to take a drug through the full development
process to obtain NDA approval themselves.) <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Development of a new drug generally begins
with the testing of a great many chemical compounds in in-vitro
screens. (In the case of biologics, fewer substances are screened).
 Then they are screened in laboratory animals in order to determine
possible toxicity and therapeutic activity. These preclinical
investigations define the pharmacological and toxicological properties
of the agent and help to predict the initial dose range for humans.
 Many of the agents screened are eliminated from further development
at this stage, usually because they are ineffective, toxic, or
not absorbed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
When animal studies suggest that a compound
may be therapeutically promising, the sponsor moves on to Phase
I clinical testing, which introduces the drug into humans for
the first time.  The sponsor must submit to FDA an application
called an IND (Investigational New Drug filing).  FDA has 30 days
to review the submission to ensure that the product is reasonably
safe for research in human subjects.  If FDA does not formally
object, the sponsor may begin clinical testing after the 30 days.
 Uncertainty at this stage about whether FDA will object, request
more data, or require different test procedures is highly disruptive
and has often caused U.S. companies to use more predictable locations
abroad for initial human testing.   (Currently, a significant
fraction of U.S. companies' Phase I testing is performed abroad,
mainly in Great Britain and elsewhere in Europe.  This has occurred
to such an extent that the Phase I testing industry in the United
States has collapsed; many facilities are now closed.) <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Clinical studies are loosely divided into three
phases that represent a logical progression, or scale-up, of study
size and complexity.  Phases I and IIA, together considered to
be early clinical research, involve, respectively, the first administration
of a drug to normal human subjects and the first test of efficacy
in patients.  Phase I may involve as few as 20 subjects, and Phase
II a few dozen to a few hundred.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Usually after early Phase II (Phase IIA), a
decision is made as to whether the drug offers sufficient promise
to warrant larger-scale (Phase IIB-III) clinical trials in order
to develop the product for marketing.  Only about a third of the
drugs that start in human testing survive to enter Phase III.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In Phase III, research expands to examine the
following:  (i) the drug's effectiveness and side-effects in a
larger number and varied types of patients and, often, a wider
range of disease conditions (&quot;indications&quot;); (ii) the
types and incidence of side-effects; (iii) the potential for long-term
use and interactions with other drugs; and (iv) other information
useful for drug labeling. Phase III trials may involve from several
hundred to several thousand patients.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Although Phase III trials cost more money and
take more time than any other single component of the development
process, the earlier phases -- and the effect of ponderous regulation
of them -- are perhaps even more important in determining the
time and cost of drug development.  There are high attrition rates
(failures) of drug candidates at the early stages when little
is known about them, and there are far more products under investigation
at the early stages. These facts are often overlooked, but they
underscore the key importance of obtaining greater efficiency
and cost reductions in the earlier phases of the drug development
process.  Such improvements would facilitate early decisions to
drop compounds that will ultimately fail (that is to say, the
majority), in order to focus resources on the few that will succeed.</FONT>
<P>
 </FONT>
<P>
Although the process is described in terms
of phases, development is really a continuum of research.  In
practice, the phases of drug testing are not sharply differentiated.
 Often, studies described as Phase I may have to be done or repeated
after Phase II -- or even Phase III -- has begun. For instance,
after advanced clinical testing in adults, the sponsor might seek
a pediatric indication; new Phase I and II studies might then
be needed in children.  Often, many different types of studies
are done simultaneously for different purposes; they are not neatly
divided into phases.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The distinction between &quot;early&quot; and
&quot;later&quot; clinical research, is the junction between Phase
IIA and Phase IIB.  Through Phase IIA (sometimes called &quot;exploratory
development&quot;) researchers are looking for evidence of &quot;clinical
proof of concept,&quot; and expenditures through this point are
generally less than about $15 million per compound, most of which
fail.  After Phase IIA, drug testing enters an intense program
focused primarily on amassing evidence of efficacy for ultimate
NDA approval.  Expenditures for Phase III programs are in the
tens of millions to  hundreds of millions of dollars.  (One cardiovascular
drug reached the quarter-billion dollar mark in a multicenter
Phase III clinical trial -- and failed).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>The NDA Submission and Review Process</B>
<P>
When the pre-clinical and clinical testing
demonstrate that a drug is effective as labeled and reasonably
safe, the sponsor files a New Drug Application (or Product Licensing
Application -- PLA -- in the case of biologics) with FDA, seeking
approval to market the drug.  The NDA, which consists of many
volumes and often hundreds of thousands of pages, describes fully
the reports of all investigations and statistical analyses performed
to demonstrate the drug's safety and effectiveness.  It also includes
a description of the drug's composition, the methods, facilities,
and controls for the manufacturing, processing, and packaging
of the drug; samples of the drug and its components; and a draft
version of the proposed labeling.  NDAs are reviewed by the Office
of Drug Evaluation in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
(CDER), and PLAs are reviewed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research (CBER).  The reviews are performed by teams consisting
of physicians, pharmacologists, chemists, statisticians, and other
specialists.  By statute, FDA is required to approve or disapprove
an NDA within 180 days, although this rarely happens.  The 180-day
period can be extended by &quot;agreement&quot; between the sponsor
and FDA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Ultimately, most NDA submissions (at present
85 percent; DiMasi et al., CPT 1994, 1995) are approved by FDA,
but frequently final approval comes only after considerable time
and negotiation and requires additional submissions of data. 
Also FDA may narrow the sponsor's initial request, approving fewer
indications for the drug's use and imposing more restrictive labeling
requirements. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
After passage of the 1962 Amendments, the time
required for FDA review and approval of NDAs rose from six months
in 1962 to an average of three years in 1975 and remained there
throughout the 1970s and 1980s (ranging as high as four-year averages
at times); after years of protest by the industry and efforts
by FDA and industry, the time required has now been reduced to
two years or less.  The sharpest reduction occurred recently with
the implementation of user fees (but before most of the additional
personnel approved by PDUFA -- the User Fee Act -- had been hired
by FDA, suggesting that most of the effect was due to a management
change that could have been implemented at any time during the
preceding 25 years).  Much has been made of FDA's efforts to reduce
the time of NDA review, but even substantial reductions, while
desirable, will not greatly affect the overall 15-year total time
required for drug development and review.  Provided gross excesses
in review times do not reappear, the proper focus now should be
to reduce the time and costs of the total development and approval
cycle, and this will need more strategic attention to the endpoints
required for approval, as well as to the tactical efforts needed
to achieve them.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Meanwhile the number of new INDs has continued
to rise, but the trickle of products approved for market that
emerge from the end of the pipeline has remained stagnant at 20
to 30 per year since the 1960s.  In 1994 the FDA approved only
22 new drugs (compared to 25 the previous year).   The numbers
of applications submitted to FDA for marketing approval of biologicals
has been declining.  Thus, the flow of products from the first
clinical trials through to ultimate marketing approval has slowed.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
These are some of the reasons that this proposal
seeks to make improvements throughout the period of regulated
clinical testing, rather than focusing predominantly on expediting
NDA review and approval.<BR>

<h2>III. Medical Devices</h2>
by Ralph A. Epstein<P>

<CENTER><B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<b>Operating Plan for a New Medical Device
Certification Process</b>
<P>
The new plan involves the interaction of three
groups: the manufacturer who bears the ultimate responsibility
for their product; a private Device Certifying Body (DCB), engaged
by the manufacturer to provide independent certification of critical
manufacturing processes and of products; and, the federal authority
(FDA), which maintains responsibility for public safety by ensuring
the competence of the DCB's, keeping the system honest by enforcing
compliance with law, and by maintaining a universal system of
postmarketing surveillance. The system is characterized by the
reliance on objectively defined law, clear standards and well-defined
responsibility. It relies, as far as possible, on private, non-governmental,
organizations. The plan follows in most details the workings of
the European Union medical device regulatory system.<BR>

<P>
<b>Basic Principles</b>
<P>
All medical devices are classified, using clear
objective criteria, into one of four classes (I, IIa, IIb, and
III). Devices presenting the highest level of risk and complexity
are placed in the higher numbered classes. Devices may be marketed
only if they conform with a comprehensive series of &quot;essential
requirements.&quot; As far as possible, such conformance will
be ensured in practice by adhering to relevant internationally
agreed upon objective standards. For all classes of devices, except
Class I, a DCB must audit the manufacturer periodically to confirm
such conformance. The number of areas audited and the stringency
of the audit depends on the class. However, in all cases, the
manufacturer has a choice of methods to demonstrate conformance.
In general, the manufacturer can either demonstrate conformance
of his quality assurance systems or conformance of the product
itself. Combinations of these two routes are permitted. In all
cases the manufacturer must have a system for monitoring and acting
upon reports of a device malfunction after sale. In addition,
the FDA acts as a central repository of such information when
it involves a serious threat to patient safety as it is in a position
to monitor the investigation of such events, especially when it
involves similar situations arising with several manufacturers.
The FDA may, for cause, require that a device be withdrawn from
the market if the manufacturer has not ensured that it meets the
essential requirements or if the DCB has not acted competently.
In addition, criminal charges may be brought in the case of fraud
or criminal negligence.<BR>

<P>
<b>Self-certification by Manufacturers</b>
<P>
Device innovation is often characterized by
many small incremental changes. A method of rapid certification
of new products facilitates this. For Class I devices, the manufacture
may self-certify conformance with the essential requirements.
Manufacturers who maintain a total quality assurance system may
self-certify new Class IIa and IIb products between the periodic
audits of their DCB. Class III products always require premarketing
design approval by a DCB. In addition, for Class III devices,
the FDA must be notified 90 days prior to marketing to allow time
for the FDA to elect to review the appropriateness of the certification
process.<BR>

<P>
<b>Good Manufacturing Practice Inspection</b>
<P>
The FDA's current auditing of manufacturers
for Good Manufacturing Practices would be replaced by the DCB's
certification of the manufacturer's quality assurance systems.
Such certification would often exceed FDA standards as it could
include certification of design quality assurance. It would also
be done far more frequently than current FDA inspections. <BR>

<P>
<b>Labeling and Off-Label Use</b>
<P>
Currently, a new application to the FDA is
needed whenever the manufacturer claims a new use for a device,
or even if the manufacture wishes to distribute reprints from
the scientific literature concerning a new use. This is often
so expensive and time consuming that the manufacture &quot;ignores&quot;
such clinical practice, resulting in widespread &quot;off-label&quot;
uses. In most cases, in the new system, the manufacture will be
able to self-certify such label changes (subject to the unusual
monitoring by the DCB).<BR>

<P>
<b>Timeliness of Approvals</b>
<P>
The current system has been characterized by
such slow approvals that venture capital has become scarce and
manufacturers have been forced to relocate critical operations
offshore. Approvals under the new system should be expeditious
as competitive forces will only tolerate DCB's capable of responding
to the market.<BR>

<P>
<b>International Harmonization</b>
<P>
Since the new system will be based on standards
and procedures virtually identical to those of the European Union,
it should be possible for a manufacturer to obtain both U.S. and
European approval using the same documentation and inspections.
In can be predicted that organizations will be certified both
as U.S. DCB's and European &quot;notified bodies.&quot; <BR>

<P>
<b>Transition</b>
<P>
A two to three year transition period is envisioned
so that devices under current review can be approved under the
existing system, if the manufacture should so elect. After a suitable
period, only products certified under the new system would be
allowed access to the market.

<h3>AN OVERVIEW OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE
INDUSTRY</h3>
<P>
<FONT >The medical device industry has been dominated
by the United States for many decades. American medical devices
are recognized world wide for quality and innovation. Of the approximately
50 billion dollars in United States production, 20 percent is
for the export market, producing a positive balance of payments.
Nevertheless, the industry's competitive position is very fragile
and our world leadership is now seriously threatened -- not from
external competition but from internal policy. Not only can this
have serious economic consequences, but the quality of our medical
care itself is now in jeopardy. A review of the unique circumstances
of the medical device industry, with an emphasis on the factors
which have fostered innovation, is useful in order to appreciate
how we have come to this state.<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In sharp contrast with the pharmaceutical industry,
the medical device industry is composed of a very large number
of quite small companies. In 1993, 88 percent of medical device
companies had less than 100 employees.<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup> Although there are a few
companies with sales exceeding a billion dollars, the typical
medical device company has sales in the 50 to 100 million dollar
range. Of the over 7,000 domestic medical device manufacturers,
approximately 1,000 are development companies with no sales at
all!<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup> There are only about 150 firms with sales exceeding $100
million. The very largest medical device companies have total
sales equal to that of rather small pharmaceutical companies.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One reason device companies are small is that
the market itself is extremely fragmented. For example, the total
U.S. market for anesthesia machines of all types is only about
3,000 units a year with a total value of barely $150 million.
 In contrast, the United States market for systemic antibiotics
or antihypertensives is five <I>billion</I> dollars per year.<sup><a href="foot.html">4</a></sup>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Medical device companies aggressively pursue
research and development. In 1993, while the median R&amp;D expenditure
as a percent of sales for all manufacturing companies was 4 percent,
it was over twice as much, 9 percent, in the medical device industry.
For companies with sales in the 5 to 20 million dollar range,
it was over 20 percent.<sup><a href="foot.html">5</a></sup> Not surprisingly, a very large proportion
of significant innovation occurs in the smallest companies with
the least sales. Venture capital is generally attracted to these
companies in the expectation that the product or the company itself
will be sold to a larger company in 5 to 7 years. While radically
new technologies attract public attention, much of the long term
improvement in medical devices comes from a myriad of small incremental
innovations which cumulatively, over time, have great clinical
relevance. The FDA is required by current law to review over 6,000
applications for such &quot;new&quot; devices a year, representing
the entire range of modern technology.<sup><a href="foot.html">6</a></sup> Much of the impetus for
such product improvements comes from physicians in the field.
Unimpeded communication between physicians (and other health care
personnel) and manufacturers is a requirement for much of this
activity. Likewise the ready availability of sites for device
testing in a clinical environment, generally in our academic health
centers,  is essential for innovation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Finally, the relatively small size of the market
for any given medical device and the need for specialized material
for many of these devices results in device companies being critically
dependent on suppliers outside the medical device industry. Thus,
the device may be dependent on a small amount of a specialized
plastic, an esoteric metal or an electronic component. The device
company seldom has the resources to develop such materials, and,
because of the small amount needed, there is little financial
incentive for the supplier to provide them. Their availability
is a byproduct of a larger, non-medical, market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The medical device industry is thus dependent
on multiple factors beyond its direct control, and any breakdown
of these complex relationships will threaten innovation by the
industry. Time is the biggest threat. Small companies have little
reserves and are dependent on fresh infusions of capital or on
current sales (if they exist) to finance innovation. Delays, or
the fear of delays, or even the unpredictability of delays, can
lead to financial disaster and frighten off venture capital. Such
delays can be related to the time required by the FDA to approve
clinical trials or to approve the device itself, among many other
causes. The delays interact. Thus increased FDA requirements for
human investigations, as the FDA attempts ever more to force the
device industry into a pharmaceutical regulatory model,<sup><a href="foot.html">7</a></sup> make the
system more sensitive to delays in approvals of such investigations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are other delays in a new product's revenue
stream, not directly related to the FDA, that are very hazardous,
particularly to small companies. Since many innovations are incremental,
it is often good medical practice to use the device for routine
patient care while it is still the subject of human investigation.
If the investigational nature of a device prevents payment for
the device by government or private payers, the financial integrity
of the company may be threatened. Furthermore, if such use threatens
payment for any associated hospital or physician care, the health
care facility and physician may find it impractical to continue
interacting with the manufacturer, destroying a relationship needed
for continued product improvement. Finally, as U.S. academic health
centers come under more financial pressure, the opportunities
for clinical investigations decrease. The result of these forces,
coupled with FDA delays in approval of clinical investigation
protocols, has become  a potent incentive for American companiesto transfer some or all of their advanced research and development
offshore.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The product liability environment further discourages
innovation. First, many companies simply will not support the
development of new products in those areas of medicine most subject
to product liability suits, such as contraception and implantables,
as well as in entire medical specialties, such as anesthesia.
Where there were once many companies competing in the anesthesia
machine field, there are now only two significant U.S. based companies,
both of which are highly dependent on the export market. If, as
is the case, companies are liable under the doctrine of strict
liability (i.e., for any harmful event) rather than for actual
negligence, many companies will avoid intrinsically high risk
areas of medicine. The problem is compounded by the prevailing
doctrine of joint and several liability. Even if a company's actions
are only slightly related to an injury, it can be held liable
for the entire cost, if others sharing the liability have inadequate
assets. For this reason, a company producing a high-tech material,
(e.g., a plastic), which is used mostly for non-medical products,
has a huge incentive to prevent medical device companies from
having access to the material. The potential profit from the sale
of a small quantity for medical use is far less than the potential
liability or even the costs of litigation.<sup><a href="foot.html">8</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Finally, third party payers are limiting the
technology for which they will pay. To survive in a managed care
environment, the industry must have the flexibility to turn its
innovative energies to developing products which, if they do not
dramatically improve health care, lower its costs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Currently, innovation is threatened by all
these factors simultaneously. The industry is over-regulated and
preyed upon by the plaintiffs' bar. Hobbled by these forces, it
is threatened by a new payor environment which has redefined what
sort of innovation is valued. The result in the last several years,
has been a decrease in the availability of venture capital; a
decrease in new product introduction in the United States; a trend
toward moving research and development as well as some manufacturing
to Europe; a decrease in the traditional growth of employment
opportunities in the United States; and, ultimately a delay in
the availability of medical technology needed by American patients.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Current market forces seeking to rationalize
health care costs should, if anything, provide new opportunities
for innovation in all areas of medicine, including medical devices.
Innovation would simply become more related to optimizing the
relationship of benefit to cost. Innovations in medical technology
can just as easily decrease as increase costs. The current revolution
in minimally invasive surgery and the consequent decrease in hospitalization
and time for recuperation is just one example of the potential
for technology to significantly decrease costs. Such market forces
are simply part of the environment that normally modulates the
growth and direction of an industry. Government regulation has
the perverse effect of constraining industry from rapidly adapting
to this changing environment.<BR>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATION OF THE
MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY</h3>
<P>
<FONT >Close government regulation of the medical
device industry is a relatively recent phenomenon in western democracies.
In the United States, there was little regulation before 1976
aside from laws that ensured that devices performed in accordance
with their labeling<sup><a href="foot.html">9</a></sup>. In Western Europe, regulation varied from
country to country. There was little direct governmental regulation
in some countries, such as Great Britain. Even in those European
countries with a long history of regulation, such as Germany,
regulations existed largely to ensure that manufacturers met standards
which had been approved by a consensus of the relevant manufacturers
and users.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >All this radically changed in the United States
with the passage of the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The law first provided for <I>general
controls</I> which would apply to all devices. This included control
of labeling (and, by extension, advertising and all other communication
between manufacturers and users) and manufacturing (and, by extension,
design) practices (GMP's- good manufacturing practices). Devices
whose safety could be assured by general controls alone were to
be placed in Class 1. The law envisioned that the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) would devise a process to approve many hundreds
of <I>performance standards</I>. Devices whose safety could be
assured by their also adhering to such performance standards were
to be placed in Class 2. Finally, Class 3 was reserved for those
few devices which would require a case by case prospective analysis,
as their complexity precluded assurance of safety by adherence
to performance standards and general controls alone. A manufacturer
wishing to market a Class 2 device needed only to notify the FDA
90 days in advance of its intention to sell the device and document
that it met the relevant performance standards. Marketing was
permitted if the FDA did not formally object in this time frame.
Only Class 3 devices required explicit premarket approval. The
premarket approval (PMA) application was to be acted on by the
FDA in no more than 180 days.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >All existing devices (preamendment devices)
were to be temporarily approved and placed, by category, into
one of the three classes, as determined by broadly based panels.
Section 510(k) of the law allowed the manufacturer to petition
the FDA to approve a new device that was &quot;substantially equivalent&quot;
to a device manufactured before 1976 and place it into the same
class as the predicate device. It was permitted to demonstrate
that a new device was substantially equivalent to a postamendment
device which in turn was substantially equivalent to a preamendment
device. At some future date, Class 3 preamendment devices and
new devices which were approved under section 510(k) as being
<I>substantially</I> <I>equivalent</I> to Class 3 preamendment
devices were to be subject to a PMA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Finally, new devices which were not substantially
equivalent to a preamendment device were automatically placed
in Class 3 (thus requiring premarket approval through a PMA process).
There was provision in the law for reclassification to a lower
class if it could be shown that compliance with general controls
alone, or general controls and performance standards, could ensure
safety.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The intent of this somewhat convoluted scheme
was to exercise no more governmental control than appeared necessary
and to avoid delays in introducing useful products to the market.
In fact, in the early years of device regulation, expeditious
approval was the rule.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >However, the system contained the seeds of
its own destruction. Congress and the FDA grossly underestimated
the complexity of the very heterogeneous medical device industry.
Although the formulation and approval of performance standards
were the foundation of the classification system and thus the
heart of the regulations, the FDA approved virtually no performance
standards. The reclassification process for new devices proved
so cumbersome that the FDA essentially did not implement it. 
Although Congress had provided no guidance as to how to determine
&quot;substantial equivalence,&quot; the 510(k) process was heavily
relied upon and the FDA made every effort to stretch the law to
the breaking point and accept claims of substantial equivalence
in order to allow manufactures to bring devices to the market
quickly and predictably. The FDA apparently gave little or no
thought of ever requiring PMA's for preamendment devices. In summary,
the law was &quot;working&quot; because FDA did not implement
it as written<sup><a href="foot.html">10</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The dissociation between the law as written
and as applied became more and more apparent throughout the 1980's,
resulting in major investigations of the FDA by congressional
oversight committees, the General Accounting Office and the Office
of Technology Assessment<sup><a href="foot.html">11</a></sup>. With the law clearly not being implemented
literally, it was easy to reap political benefits by criticizing
the operation of the FDA. Scandals at the FDA concerning generic
drugs compounded the problem and the prestige of the agency fell.
The FDA became more cautious, approval times began to lengthen
and enforcement began to take on an arbitrary character. However,
the 1976 statute, even though it was often vague and incomplete,
precluded serious governmental abuse. By 1990, Congress was ready
to act. It appears that the possibly of deregulation was not considered.
Instead, the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 vastly increased
the power of the FDA over the device industry.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Several aspects of the 1990 act require comment.
The FDA was granted the authority to impose large civil penalties.
The act required postmarket reporting by users, distributors,
importers and manufacturers of device failures which did or might
cause harm. This requirement for redundant reporting of even the
suspicion of device failure resulted in the FDA being inundated
by more data than it could analyze or even catalog, especially
as the fear of penalties created a great incentive to complete
reports of marginal events. More fundamentally, the 510(k) process
was significantly modified. No longer could a company, even in
principle, market a device 90 days after submitting a 510(k) &quot;notification&quot;
(unless the FDA formally objected). Now the company was forbidden
to market the device until it received explicit <I>premarket</I>
permission from the FDA, in the form of a formal &quot;order.&quot;
The act defined &quot;substantial equivalence&quot;, the basis
for a 510(k) decision,  very broadly and explicitly allowed a
device to be placed in Class 2 on the basis of &quot;substantial
equivalence&quot; even if it had different technological characteristics
from its predicate device. The lack of FDA approval of performance
standards to allow for an objective approval process was implicitly
acknowledged by simply no longer requiring  them. However, these
provisions, rather than liberalizing the process, further constrained
it as the FDA was given the unlimited power to devise any &quot;special
controls&quot; that it deemed necessary for Class 2 devices. The
combination of these changes effectively removed any difference
in principle between Class 2 and Class 3 devices as now premarket
approval based on the judgement of FDA reviewers, rather that
conformity with recognized standards, was needed for both.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Further medical device amendments followed
in 1992. They were for the most part technical corrections or
provided time extension for the FDA to complete previously required
work. They did not change the essential character of the power
of the FDA.<BR>

<h3>THE CURRENT STATE OF THE MEDICAL
DEVICE INDUSTRY</h3>
<P>
<FONT >After many years of healthy growth, the medical
device industry is approaching a crises. Although the difficulties
that some companies are having are the result of their inability
to adapt to the new market realities which require more cost effective
solutions, much is due to misdirected governmental policy. The
direct and indirect effects of inappropriate product liability
policies are very important but are beyond the scope of this paper.
We will concentrate here on the consequences of FDA regulation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The time it takes to obtain FDA approval of
a new product and the perceived capriciousness of the process
is perhaps the greatest concern to industry. The 1976 law envisioned
that the 510(k) approval process should not take longer than a
total of 90 days.  It is actually quite difficult to interpret
FDA's own statistics concerning their review times. Their preference
for using median times masks the fact that the time is skewed
sharply toward long reviews. Often they cite time at the FDA rather
than total elapsed time, not counting the time the manufacturer
needs to provide additional data required by the reviewer. Finally,
the FDA may &quot;stop the clock&quot; and this may not be noted.
Although the FDA believes that only counting the time at the FDA
is &quot;fair,&quot; the essential point is that if the entire
process is slow there is a severe disincentive to the development
of products in the United States. By 1992 the <I>median</I> elapsed
time was 90 days. The median then increased to 164 days by 1993,
dropping back to 155 days by 1994.<sup><a href="foot.html">12</a></sup> However, by definition, half
the approvals take longer than the median. In 1994, 5% of the
510(k) applications were taking more than 613 days, or almost
2 years.<sup><a href="foot.html">13</a></sup>  The net result is an increase in R&amp;D costs and a
costly delay in the time needed to develop a positive cash flow.
During early 1995, it was apparent that the FDA, under extreme
political pressure from a wide variety of sources, had reassigned
resources, softened their policies and made a significant effort
to decrease review times and introduce more reason into the process.
It is difficult to predict how long this will last.  However,
it should be noted that there is now nothing in the statute that
requires or provides an incentive for  expeditious reviews<sup><a href="foot.html">14</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >&quot;New&quot; Class 3 devices require that
the FDA approve a PMA. The 1976 statue allowed for a 180 day period
for FDA review. In 1990, the mean total elapsed time for an FDA
decision was 609 days. By 1993 it had climbed to 823 days. This
represents an extraordinary delay and has been a principal reason
the number of PMA submissions dropped from 78 to 40 during that
period<sup><a href="foot.html">15</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Most PMA submissions and an increasing number
of 510(k) submissions require the generation of clinical data.
The law requires approval of clinical protocols by an Institutional
Review Board (IRB). For clinical studies posing potential hazards,
the FDA must also prospectively approve the details of the study.
There have been many anecdotal reports of long delays in such
approvals. As such clinical studies, by necessity, take place
before submission for device approval, these delays are additive
to the delays in the 510(k) and PMA approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There have been some attempts to quantify the
costs of these delays<sup><a href="foot.html">16</a></sup>. The Western European regulatory system
has been used as a benchmark. In general, our best estimate is
that European approvals require less than half the time of American
approvals. In fact, in many circumstances, European companies
which have demonstrated compliance with design and manufacturing
quality control standards can self-approve broad categories of
devices. Similarly, there is a conducive climate for clinical
investigation in many European countries. The bottom line is that
a product that might take 6 years to bring to market in the United
States might take 4 years in Europe. With this early introduction
in Europe, there is additionally a great competitive advantage
in other international markets. This necessarily means that, even
if a new product is eventually successful, venture capital will
be required for a longer time in this country and some foreign
markets may be entirely lost. The increased costs plus the uncertainties
of the regulatory process have resulted in a predictable decrease
in the availability of venture capital in the United States.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The more favorable regulatory climate in Western
Europe has allowed many companies to establish a positive cash
flow for new products by introducing the product in Europe before
marketing in the United States. Generally such a strategy can
be expected to save approximately two years. This implies that
American patients are often cared for with products several generations
behind those used for Europeans. This phenomenon is most apparent
in fast moving fields of medicine such as imaging and cardiology.
Recently, Medtronics, one of the largest U.S. device companies,
announced that it was transferring its entire venture group to
Europe. With an increase in clinical research in Europe along
with earlier product introductions, there will be an increased
incentive also to move manufacturing jobs<sup><a href="foot.html">17</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >While in the past American dominance in the
medical device industry was assured, the current outlook is far
less optimistic. Many factors had led to this dominance including
a well financed health care system, strong academic health centers,
a reasonable regulatory policy and low manufacturing costs. Of
these, our efficient manufacturing still gives us a distinct advantage.
Significant regulatory reform would go a long way to reverse the
current adverse trend.<BR>

<br>
<h3>CURRENT TRENDS IN REFORM PROPOSALS</h3>
Almost everyone in the device industry now
supports regulatory reform of one sort or another and agrees that
many areas of industry are severely constrained by excessive governmental
mandates<sup><a href="foot.html">18</a></sup>. There is widespread recognition that regulatory bodies
impose large costs in terms of increased prices and loss of desirable
employment opportunities as well as decreased opportunities for
innovation. In the medical device field, many organizations have
proposed relief from particularly burdensome regulations, often
without first seriously considering the possibility of fundamental
reform. In general, trade organizations, which primarily represent
large manufacturers, tend to shy away from fundamental reform,
while representatives of the smaller manufacturers tend to be
more willing to consider basic issues. This to be expected. Large
companies can better afford the large expensive specialized staff
needed to deal with the FDA. Furthermore, in the device industry,
small companies tend to be responsible for a disproportionate
share of significant innovation and thus are most constrained
by excessive and inappropriate regulation. Finally, burdensome
regulations may, in the short run, work to the benefit of established
firms because they make it more difficult for new, and often smaller,
manufacturers to enter the market. There are, of course, many
exceptions to these generalizations.<BR>

<P>
Current popular proposals for regulatory reform
can be conveniently divided into three categories. One group of
reform proposals is directed at ensuring that the FDA acts  expeditiously.
A second seeks to break the FDA's monopoly. Finally, there is
a host of proposals narrowly aimed at very specific regulatory
abuses.<BR>

<P>
<U>More Expeditious Review</U>
<P>
The 1976 law envisioned very rapid review of
new products. In fact it can be argued that, except for the minority
of devices in FDA Class 3, there was no <I>requirement</I> for
premarket review at all. Only notification of the intention to
market was required. In fact, over the years, there have been
attempts to obfuscate the fact that the FDA has tolerated very
long review cycles. Thus, the FDA at times has reported median
review times, effectively disregarding cases where the delays
have been very long indeed; has not counted the time taken by
manufactures to respond to sometimes inappropriate FDA questions
and requests; and, has pressured manufactures to &quot;request&quot;
that the FDA &quot;stop the clock.&quot; The delays involve much
more than new product applications and include, for example, the
entire process for appropriately reclassifying totally new products
after they have been initially placed arbitrarily in Class 3.
The problem facing reformers who attempt to address the issue
of excessive delays is what to do if, as in the past, the FDA
simply does not comply with the legally established deadlines.
One suggested approach is to not require FDA notification for
less complex devices, perhaps all of Class 1 devices and certain
designated types of Class 2 devices. Such self-certifying is very
close to analogous features in the European Union system. However,
this begs the question of responsibility for the classification
itself. In the FDA system, devices are classified in Class 1 if
&quot;general controls&quot; are sufficient to ensure safety.
Such a criterion is at best subjective and contrasts markedly
with the rather explicit and objective European system. Allowing
manufacturers to self certify Class 1 devices, without reforming
the classification system itself, might break down in practice
into endless litigation.<BR>

<P>
A second difficult issue is what to do if a
manufacturer in good faith places a device in Class 1, manufactures
and markets it and later the FDA decides that the device needs
to adhere to &quot;performance standards&quot; and thus should
have been placed in Class 2. Certainly one would not want to force
such a device off the market if there were no reason to believe
that there were an actual safety problem. Again, the fundamental
need is unambiguous up-front classification.<BR>

<P>
Finally, there have been proposals to allow
marketing of devices which have been approved by the European
Union if FDA regulatory delays exceed statutory limits. It should
be noted that many U.S. products are or will be approved for marketing
in Europe. Such a proposal is an implicit recognition of the quality
of the European system, and one might question why one should
not simply recognize European certification and allow the FDA
and the European Union to engage in jurisdictional competition.
One could also envision that a system which recognized European
approvals only after the FDA failed to act expeditiously might
well exacerbate the adversarial nature of the approval system.
<BR>

<P>
Eventual approval is not sufficient to attract
venture capital needed to develop new products if the approval
process itself is subject to capricious delays due to regulatory
uncertainty. Harmonization of American and European standards,
so that there is an objective basis for mutual recognition, is
a far better answer<sup><a href="foot.html">19</a></sup>.<BR>

<P>
<U>The FDA Monopoly</U>
<P>
A number of current proposals seek to break
the FDA monopoly by privatizing some FDA functions. The inspiration
is clearly from the European Union system where <I>competing</I>
private &quot;notified bodies&quot; certify that the manufacturer
has met the explicit requirements which justify the manufacturer
applying a CE mark (of approval) to it products. Unfortunately,
many current proposals fail to recognize that the virtue of the
European system lies in the fact that the European notified bodies
are expected to exercise independent judgement and are not merely
arms of the central governmental authority. Furthermore, to the
extent possible, their evaluations and decisions are based on
detailed published international standards. Contracting out current
FDA functions to private bodies without first rationalizing these
functions simply substitutes different organizations and different
workers. While there may be some virtue using an organization
that works more efficiently than many governmental agencies, the
more basic problem is with the process itself. Those proposals
which do not foster competition between private certifying bodies
by allowing manufacturers to choose the organization from which
to purchase certifying services would appear to offer limited
advantages.<BR>

<P>
<U>Specific Regulatory Abuses</U>
<P>
Finally, there is a whole series of miscellaneous
proposals that address specific abuses and problem areas. Some
seek to streamline programs that just do not work. This includes
the simplification of the device malfunction (vigilance) program
and the device tracking program. Others seek to eliminate programs
for which there is no logical rationale. This would include the
freeing of exports to first world countries which are perfectly
able to police their own markets. Others attack very narrow issues
which, for lack of a better term, can be classified as corrections
of abuse of power and dereliction of duty. These include attempts
to improve accountability by specifying which particular officials
can make certain decisions, mandating periodic meetings at the
manufacturer's request, requiring unequivocal classification of
a product as either a drug or a device, prohibiting the FDA from
making decisions based on cost-effectiveness, limiting the authority
of the FDA to require controlled clinical studies, prohibiting
the withholding of a classification decision based on GMP violations
and many other such important but narrow issues. While it might
be desirable to achieve immediate relief by instituting some of
these reforms, they represent an attempt to micromanage the FDA.
Without fundamental reform, they, like most well meaning efforts
at micromanagement, run the risk of exchanging of one set of problems
for another. In general, the reform effort would be better spent
seeking to change the system by going back to basic principles,
determining what is actually needed to protect patients, and devising
the most direct way of achieving this goal.<BR>

<h3>THE EU SYSTEM APPROVAL OF NEW MEDICAL
DEVICES</h3>
Much can be learned from the ongoing European
Union medical device regulatory reforms. Approval of new medical
devices in the EU is characterized by:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
1:<I> Objectivity    </I></FONT>
<P>
2: <I>Flexibility  </I></FONT>
<P>
3: <I>Timeliness</I>    </FONT>
<P>
4: <I>Competitiveness<BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
The European Union medical device regulation
law is based on a list of &quot;Essential Requirements<sup><a href="foot.html">20</a></sup>.&quot;
These are universal requirements that apply to all devices. They
cover areas such as safe design and construction, clinical efficacy,
disclosure of residual risks, protective packaging, infection
control, compatibility with other devices, calibration and stability,
radiation protection, electrical safety, labeling, and instruction
manuals. In principle it is sufficient for the manufacturer to
rely solely on these requirements to justify putting a device
on the market. However, manufactures usually rely on published,
internationally agreed upon, standards which are specific to individual
devices or processes. For many decades, professional organizations
such as AAMI and IEEE in the United States and international standards
organizations such as ISO have brought together groups of experts
from the manufacturer, user and government sectors to develop
written standards covering a wide variety of topics. These include
very technical narrowly defined standards to ensure mechanical
compatibility, such as standards for machine screw threads; performance
standards for various materials, such as those for biocompatibility;
safety standards for the internal monitoring of life support equipment;
limits on electromagnetic radiation; as well as very broad standards
defining quality assurance for production, testing and even the
design process<sup><a href="foot.html">21</a></sup>. In the European system, such standards, originating
in various sources, are ultimately accepted by the EU's central
standards organization. While a manufacturer may choose to devise
alternate methods, adherence to such standards by the manufacturer
is presumptive evidence that the manufacturer has met the Essential
Requirements. Clearly defined standards provide objective criteria
and remove much of the uncertainty and risk in seeking approval.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Using published objective criteria related
to complexity and risk, all devices are placed in one of four
classes (I, IIa, IIb, III) by the manufacturer<sup><a href="foot.html">22</a></sup>. </FONT>

Examples are shown in Table 1.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2 >*active implantable devices are technically
regulated under a separate EU </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 >regulation but from a practical standpoint
are handled like Class III devices<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
For the large number of devices in Class I,
the manufacturer self-certifies compliance with the Essential
Requirements by preparing a prescribed Declaration of Conformity,
a technical document containing the supporting data which is available
to the authorities. Certain special processes, such as sterilization
needed for a Class I device, may require additional certification
by a notified body,<I> vide infra</I>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<U>Notified Bodies</FONT></U>
<P>
For all other devices, the manufacturer must
engage the services of an independent &quot;test house&quot; to
audit their systems or product and certify compliance with the
Essential Requirements. These test houses, termed &quot;notified
bodies&quot; in the European system and &quot;device certification
bodies,&quot; or DCB's in our proposed reform are themselves certified
(licensed), in accordance with published standards, by governmental
authorities. In Europe, the manufacturer may engage any notified
body from any country in the European Union. In practice, many
of the notified bodies come from the long tradition of test houses
which physically test production samples. They can be thought
of as being similar to analogous firms in the United States such
as Underwriter's Laboratories. Others come from the more recent
tradition of firms that certify quality assurance systems. There
are a large number of American firms that do similar work and
certify that manufacturers of all types conform to ISO 9000 quality
assurance standards. Many of the notified bodies are licensed
in specialized areas. <I>Objectivity</I> is ensured by the heavy
reliance on published, well constructed standards for both device
classification and regulatory compliance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In addition to being able to choose between
compliance with published standards and devising <I>ad hoc</I>
methods of compliance with the essential requirements, manufacturers
generally have the <I>flexibility</I> to choose between two fundamentally
different methods of demonstrating compliance with the Essential
Requirements. One method involves having the notified body actually
examine or test the entire production run (or statistically valid
samples of the production run) to confirm that applicable standards
have been met. The second method involves having the notified
body certify the manufacturer's quality assurance systems. These
include systems for testing the final product, producing the product
and/or designing the product. The notified body, in many instances,
can certify that the manufacturer has sufficient quality assurance
systems in place to self-certify individual products<sup><a href="foot.html">23</a></sup>. The specific
options available to the manufacturer depend on the class of the
device. In general, the higher class devices must adhere to more
stringent regulations. Examples of allowable compliance methods
are presented in Table II.<BR>

Thus, manufacturers have the <I>flexibility</I>
to choose from a wide array of methods to comply with the device
regulations so that the process of bringing devices to the market
is facilitated. Methods may be chosen that are appropriate to
the company size, strengths and market. The result is that unnecessary
delays are avoided.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I>Timeliness</FONT></I>
of approvals is critical. One of the largest sources of complaints
concerning our current system is the time required to get through
the regulatory approval process. Although the FDA has recently
attempted to expedite the process, 510(k)s and PMA's have taken
far longer that the statutory 90 and 180 days to complete the
process. The profitability associated with bringing a new device
to the market, and thus the practicality of devoting resources
to innovation, is critically dependent on the amount of time it
takes. A delay has at least three deleterious effects. First,
more venture (or internal) capital is needed to support the product
during a prolonged development phase. Second, an income stream
needed to provide an adequate return on capital is delayed. Finally,
during the delay, competitors may become established in the market
place. The European system attacks the problem of timeliness directly
by not allowing anyone to have a monopoly on approval authority.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
A basic problem in the U.S. medical device
regulatory system is that the FDA has had a legal monopoly on
approvals and, if it takes longer than what is reasonable, the
manufacturer has no alternative options. By opening up the process
to competition and allowing the manufacturer the option of choosing
which notified body to engage, the Europeans have essentially
obviated the entire problem. In addition, for many devices, especially
when certified high level quality assurance mechanisms are in
place, the manufacturer may gain additional flexibility and save
time by being allowed to self-certify that the essential requirements
have been met. This problem with timeliness of approvals probably
has been the primary reason some of our best device companies
have shifted new product development to Europe<sup><a href="foot.html">24</a></sup>. Their goal is
to obtain expeditious approval so that they can establish an early
revenue stream so as to produce a return on their large capital
investment<sup><a href="foot.html">25</a></sup>. The Wilkerson Group<sup><a href="foot.html">26</a></sup> has complied a list of 100 devices
which are currently available in other developed nations but which
are unavailable to the American patient.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The European system objective takes advantage
of <I>competitiveness</I> is two separate areas. First, the notified
bodies compete with each other on the basis of price, timeliness
and availability. Our DCB's will function in the same manner.
In addition, since a European manufacturer can engage a notified
body from another country (which was certified by that country's
authorities), there is also jurisdictional competition which acts
as a check on the government itself. If the United States and
the European Union were able to sufficiently harmonize their systems
so as to allow mutual recognition of device approvals, we would
be able to emulate that aspect of the European system.<BR>

<h3>A NEW REGULATORY REFORM PROPOSAL</h3>

<FONT >The FDA itself has publicized its efforts to
speed approvals and is investigating contracting out some of its
functions to non-governmental bodies. Devising a more reasonable
regulatory structure is made easier by the fact the European Union
has accomplished just that. Not only is their experience useful,
but bilateral trade would be facilitated if the system we adopt
is similar enough to theirs that device approval on both sides
of the Atlantic could be accomplished with minimal duplicative
effort and cost.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Alternative paths to reform which would simply
seek to curb the worst governmental abuses without fundamentally
changing the structure are inadequate. The basic 1976 law was
predicated on a device classification system based on performance
standards that were never developed. Approval of most new devices
was based on &quot;substantial equivalence&quot; to previously
approved devices. Not only was the meaning of &quot;substantial
equivalence&quot; never adequately defined, but the entire concept
of similarity with predicate devices must, by necessity, break
down over time as technology advances and the thread of similarity
with older devices becomes weaker. It is as if the space shuttle
was to be approved based on its substantial equivalence with an
ox cart. Finally, faced with the lack of objective criteria for
action, the FDA has become, at best, a cautious and ponderous
bureaucracy. This was predictable and no amount of cosmetic reform
will change the forces which have caused this bureaucratic evolution.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The new European Union medical device regulatory
system offers a more rational structure. The EU system has been
in full effect since 1992 for the most complex and risky medical
devices, active implantables; since the beginning of 1995 for
other medical devices; and is soon to be phased in for <I>in vitro</I>
diagnostic devices. U.S. manufactures have gained experience with
the EU system through two mechanisms. First, many U.S. companies
export to Europe and are thus fully subject to the EU system.
In response, the European notified bodies are well represented
in the United States. More fundamentally, over the years, American
professional organizations have been very active in publishing
standards which ultimately have become the international standards
that form the basis of the EU system. This includes both the thousands
of narrowly defined standards that guide details of design and
also more fundamental standards, such as the ISO 9000 series,
which form the basis of modern quality control systems. In fact
most major American medical device manufacturers either have obtained
or are in the process of obtaining ISO 9000 (series) certification.
Full ISO 9000 certification is significantly more comprehensive
than the GMP regulations currently administered by the FDA as
it includes a quality control system for the design process itself.
Full conformity with these standards, frequently reconfirmed,
allows medical device companies subject to the EU system the authority
to self-certify new products of moderate complexity. This then
allows a very rapid design-marketing cycle, so important to facilitate
the incremental nature of medical device innovation. Because of
the familiarity of American manufacturers with both the EU system
and the standards upon which it is based, it should be possible
for the United States to make a rapid transition to this more
rational and modern system of medical device approval. No doubt
there would have to be a transition period with both the old and
the new approval systems available, especially for devices already
in the approval process. In addition it would seem prudent, at
least until the new system is well established in this country
for the FDA to be notified of each DCB Class III device approval
sufficiently in advance of marketing (90 days) to allow confirmation
that the appropriate standards had been used.  Since the FDA is
a member of international standards organizations, this would
have the further advantage of providing information useful in
drafting new standards. Figures 1 and 2 compare our current approval
process and the proposed replacement approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00017.GIF"><IMG SRC="IMG00018.GIF"><FONT >Adapting
the EU system of device approvals essentially privatizes two important
functions of the FDA: device approvals and GMP (quality assurance)
inspections. There are other FDA functions that need to be considered.
In the EU system, the health authorities of each individual county
have five major functions. They have the responsibility and authority
to license the notified bodies. This is done in reference to internationally
agreed upon standards. Two, administer a post-marketing &quot;vigilance&quot;
system that monitors unexpected failures and adverse effects of
the products. Three, have the authority to remove products from
the market which prove to be out of conformity with the essential
requirements. Four, are responsible for controlling the safety
of human subjects in clinical investigations. Finally, they have
investigative authority and serve to keep the system honest. One
defining characteristic of the EU system is that the manufacturer,
not the government, is primarily responsible for the safety and
effectiveness of their product. The private notified body is a
check on the manufacturer and is in the tradition of a testing
laboratory. The government health authority polices the system.
Most importantly, although the manufacturer must demonstrate (to
the satisfaction of the notified body) that the device is as safe
as is practical according to the state of the art and that it
functions effectively as claimed on its labeling and in its instruction
manual, the final judgement as to relative clinical benefit and
risk is left to the practice of medicine and to those forces which
regulate it.<sup><a href="foot.html">27</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >With a few limitations, a reformed U.S. system
should follow this outline. The FDA's current vigilance system
for medical devices is so overwhelmed with data that it has been
of little use. Since manufacturers already are required to collect
and analyze data concerning device malfunctions and adverse effects,
it would seem reasonable for the manufacturer to have the opportunity
to do the preliminary analysis and pass onto the FDA only those
reports where there is a reasonable possibility that there was
a device problem<sup><a href="foot.html">28</a></sup>. The manufacturer would, of course, have to maintain
records of all reports and their analysis for inspection by their
DCB (and in the case of concern, by the FDA). The FDA, as the
recipient of data from all manufacturers could then perform the
important function of correlating adverse reports concerning the
same type of product produced by several different manufacturers.
It also would be able to monitor individual manufacturer's response
to reports concerning their own devices. In addition the FDA would
be in a position to exchange information with the European Union
authorities. This might facilitate the handling of adverse events
that are so rare that data from multiple countries are needed.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the United States, Institutional Review
Boards, especially those in the academic health centers, have
generally functioned well to both protect the interests of patients
and subjects and to facilitate research. However, it would be
reasonable for the FDA to function as a repository of data concerning
all adverse events during clinical investigations, as such a national
clearing house with access to data from many sites might facilitate
the early detection of rare events.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >With these few modifications, a reformed American
medical device regulatory system would closely follow the EU model.
The FDA would become a smaller, better focused organization with
many of their functions assumed by organizations in the private
sector.<BR>

<h2>IV. Regulatory Reform and Liability for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices</h2>
by W. Kip Viscusi<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT >EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >Tort liability for the pharmaceutical and medical
device industry has been almost synonymous with the liability
crisis.  Notwithstanding the substantial level of government regulation
in these industries, firms have been the subject of major lines
of litigation, such as those involving DES and the Dalkon Shield.
 In terms of the total number of liability cases as well as the
share of liability costs relative to industry sales, the pharmaceutical
industry has been a major focal point of the liability burden.
 These costs have been disproportionate to the overall role of
the pharmaceutical and medical device industries in the economy,
as they have suffered in large part because their products are
intrinsically involved in life and death situations.  The result
is that these liability costs have substantially discouraged new
product innovation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The extent of this liability is also surprising
in view of the already substantial role of government intervention
affecting pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Pharmaceutical
products must undergo an extensive FDA review both in terms of
the character of the product and the wording of the hazard warning.
 Medical devices are also subject to Federal regulation as well
as the pre-emption provisions that should presumably limit tort
liability.  At the current time, there fails to be adequate recognition
on the part of the courts of the role played by government regulation
in insuring efficient levels of safety.  In recognition of this
government activity, this paper proposes a regulatory compliance
defense for all pharmaceutical and medical device product liability,
not simply a defense against punitive damages.  This proposal
would create a more even-handed treatment of pharmaceutical products
and medical devices.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The proposals to revamp the FDA drug and device
approval process would not limit the applicability of these proposals.
 So long as an institutional mechanism insuring an efficient level
of product safety was provided to consumers, there would be no
need to second guess these administrative reviews by the courts.
 Thus, the regulatory compliance defense would simply be a recognition
that there has already been government certification and that
the company has fulfilled its requirements with respect to the
provision of products that provide an adequate level of safety.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A different legal issue related to the proposal
is the ultimate liability of the Dug and Device Certifying Bodies
that would work in conjunction with the FDA as part of the revised
regulatory process.  Potential liability for negligence in carrying
out its obligations or for breaking contractual obligations to
manufacturers should be permitted to promote responsible operation
of these groups.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >However, it is also essential to formalize
the current recognition by the courts that such certification
bodies should not be subject to strict liability to third parties
injured by products.  Otherwise, particularly in contexts of joint
and several liability, many quite responsible institutions would
be reluctant to enter the certification market for fear that their
very existence would be threatened by tort liability suits that
might even be completely unrelated to the manner in which they
carried out their obligations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >INTRODUCTION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The pharmaceutical and medical device industries
are one of the principal targets of tort liability litigation.
 Lawsuits against the firms in their industries have long been
among the most prominent liability cases.  Moreover, if we exclude
asbestos and Agent Orange, the pharmaceutical industry has been
by far the leading industry with respect to mass toxic torts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The prominent role of the pharmaceutical industry
and medical device industries are not a reflection of corporate
irresponsibility.  Rather, the nature of the products produced
by these industries are intrinsically involved in individual health
and in the treatment of patients, many of whom will experience
adverse outcomes and even death during the course of their treatment.
 This locus of the product's use, coupled with the stringent nature
of liability standards, has led to a substantial liability burden
that many observers view as unproductive.  For example, the National
Academy of Sciences concluded that high product liability costs
were largely responsible for shutting down American research with
respect to contraceptives<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.  These costs eliminated research not
because the research was in any sense socially undesirable, but
because firms incurred costs whenever the research led to products
linked to the hazards associated with childbirth.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The substantial tort liability burden is particularly
striking in that it has been coupled with a situation in which
the pharmaceutical industry itself is highly regulated.  The particular
products sold are subject to highly stringent regulations with
respect to their safety and efficacy.  This pre-market approval
process is much more extensive than, for example, regulations
for automobiles or other consumer products that generate considerable
risks.  Indeed, many observers have suggested that pharmaceuticals
are overregulated because of the excessive weight placed on the
potential adverse effects of these products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The high degree of regulation of pharmaceuticals
is inconsistent with a high tort liability exposure if the objective
of tort liability is to address inadequacies in the provision
of product safety.  The purpose of this paper is to indicate how
the tort liability system should be restructured to better reflect
the obligations that pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers
have already met to through their compliance with government regulations.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This paper will explore how the tort liability
system functions and the rationale for the current structure.
 There is currently only minimal recognition of a regulatory compliance
defense for prescription drugs.  In the case of medical devices,
there is a legislative pre-emption that eliminates the threat
of tort liability.  Most Federal liability reform proposals have
only suggested limited regulatory compliance defenses for prescription
drugs, particularly with respect to punitive damages.  This paper
will suggest that these defenses should in fact be much broader
and should pertain to overall liability for drugs and devices
given regulatory approval, and not simply punitive damages.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Although the current FDA regulatory program
provides the institutional reference point, the proposals suggested
here are quite general.  The principal requirements that should
accompany any regulatory compliance defense are that any revision
of the FDA drug and medical device approval process maintain the
current safety standards and continue to establish a uniform warnings
vocabulary.  Provided that these two conditions are met, the rationales
for these proposals will be quite robust with respect to different
institutional structures. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Importance of Pharmaceutical and Medical
Device Litigation</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Product liability litigation against the pharmaceutical
and medical device industries has been considerable.  Notwithstanding
the rigorous regulatory review given to these products, plaintiffs
are often successful in obtaining recoveries for product-related
injuries.  Some of the biggest lines of litigation have involved
these products.  As of 1990, for example, there were 210,000 Dalkon
Shield personal injury claimants, 200,000 claimants against DES,
200,000 claimants against Bendectin, and 500 claimants involving
tampons<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup>.  More recently, the breast implant litigation has led
to the establishment of a trust fund of over $4 billion to cover
potential losses.  This section will provide a brief overview
of some of the liability trends for the pharmaceutical industry<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup>
and an assessment of the extent to which these litigation levels
exceed that for other industries.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To explore these issues, this section will
focus on data for federal product liability cases developed by
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.  This data
base makes it possible to track liability suits and awards for
cases in the Federal Courts.  Omitted from this tally will be
out of court settlements as well as cases resolved in state courts.
 This omission consequently will lead to a substantial understatement
of the overall level of product liability costs for the pharmaceutical
and medical device industry.  Moreover, to the extent that companies
are increasingly relying on out-of-court settlements to resolve
liability cost issues, as is evidenced in the establishment of
the breast implant compensation fund, there will be diminished
litigation.  This change in litigation strategies will create
a deceptive impression of the overall liability burden.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Figure 1 provides a profile of the number of
federal product liability cases for manufacturing industries<sup><a href="foot.html">4</a></sup> excluding
pharmaceuticals and for the pharmaceutical industry.  What is
striking about the case trends in Figure 1 is that the pharmaceutical
industry liability is often half or more that of the entire remaining
manufacturing sector of the economy.  In 1985 the number of pharmaceutical
industry cases in the Federal Courts was about double that of
all other manufacturing industries.  This tremendous liability
burden is dispro-portionate to the output share of pharmaceuticals.
 The remaining manufacturing sector excluding the pharmaceutical
industry had a dollar value of shipments that was much larger
than that of the pharmaceutical industry in 1989.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To fully assess the extent of the liability
burden, one needs to know not only the number of cases filed but
also whether these cases are successful and what award was paid.
 The measure that will be used to assess the extent of pharmaceutical
industry liability will be the relative liability burden given
the scale of the industry.  In particular, Figure 2 provides a
profile of the ratio of the annual product liability awards to
the total sales both for pharmaceuticals as well as the remaining
manufacturing industry.  What is striking is that except in two
years in which the liability awards were unusually low, 1979 and
1989, the level of the relative liability burden was considerably
greater for the pharmaceutical industry than for the rest of the
manufacturing sector.  In the years of the greatest crisis in
tort liability from 1982 to 1986 the level of the liability burden
dwarfed that for the manufacturing sector.  Although the level
of liability awards in the Federal Courts declined after 1986,
even in 1987 and 1988 the relative liability burden for manufacturing
was considerably less than that for pharmaceuticals.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >When viewed in absolute terms, the extent of
the liability burden may not appear to be great.  For example,
even in the highest year of relative liability costs, 1986, the
federal product liability award percentage of sales was only 0.05
percent for pharmaceuticals.  However, the award percentage relative
to the profits of the firm is much greater.  Even more important
is that the federal product liability awards only should be used
as an index of the relative liability burden not as an indication
of the total extent of the liability costs.  Even for the Federal
suits, the out-of-pocket legal expenses and defense costs will
not be included in this tally.  An additional omission is that
cases settled out of court and all cases resolved in state courts
likewise will not be reflected in these data.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The basic message of Figures 1 and 2 is that
pharmaceutical liability has typically far outdistanced that of
other manufacturing industries, relative to its share of industrial
activity.  One hypothesis is that these products are more likely
to be defective and to cause injury than are other manufacturing
products.  However, it is noteworthy that the premarket review
and ongoing monitoring of the performance of pharmaceutical and
medical devices is much more vigorous than for any other major
product group.  The subsequent sections will explore this inconsistency
and examine the nature of the criteria applied by regulatory agencies.
 What will be particularly striking is that the same types of
criteria applied by the courts are mirrored in the regulatory
guidelines.  In effect, juries are second guessing decisions made
by the FDA on a prospective basis and are awarding substantial
verdicts to plaintiffs ex post even in instances in which the
Federal regulatory requirements were fulfilled.<BR>

<h3>The Current Regulatory Structure
and Its Implications for Tort Liability</h3>
<P>
The current role of the government with respect
to pharmaceuticals and medical devices is twofold.  First, the
government reviews these products to ensure their safety and efficacy.
 Second, the government plays an informational role in establishing
the kinds of information that can be conveyed with respect to
the characteristics of these products and the associated risks.
 The discussion below will consider the role of regulatory compliance
defense with respect to each of these aspects of government regulation.
<BR>
<P>
<b>Pre-Market Approval of Pharmaceuticals<BR>
</b>

<P>
The first phase of government regulation of
the products is a determination of which pharmaceutical products
are permitted to be marketed.  The first stage of this process
typically involves the submission of an investigational new drug
application to conduct trials for a new drug.  The legal requirements
for this application require that the company provide information
with respect to the chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and results
of animal and laboratory testing.<sup><a href="foot.html">5</a></sup>  These trials may then begin
provided the FDA does not either request more information or modify
the protocol submitted by the company for the proposed clinical
trials.  From a practical standpoint, the nature of the protocols
are often dictated by the FDA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The clinical trial process consists of three
phases.  Phase one trials are designed to elicit information about
&quot;the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drugs in
humans, [and] the side effects associated with increasing doses.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">6</a></sup>
These tests are also intended to provide information pertaining
to the product's safety.  These phase one trials typically involve
tests on a small number of healthy adults- approximately 20-80
people.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
If the phase one trials are successful, the
company proceeds to undertake phase two trials, which typically
involve testing the drug on 200-300 people who have the specific
disease or condition for which the product is targeted.  The phase
two trials are &quot;conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of
the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients
with the disease or condition under study.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">7</a></sup>  In addition,
these trials are intended to assess whether there are adverse
side effects associated with the drug.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
If the phase two trials are also successful,
the company proceeds to the phase three clinical trials involving
1,000 - 3,000 patients who also have the specific condition or
disease for which the drug is targeted.<sup><a href="foot.html">8</a></sup>  As the phase three trials
reach conclusion, the company submits a new drug application (NDA)
to the FDA to obtain permission to sell the pharmaceutical product.
 This application must include both safety and efficacy information,
and it is a compendium of all the available data obtained thus
far regarding the performance of the drugs with respect to these
two objectives.  In addition, the NDA must include information
pertaining to the proposed labeling for the new drug.<sup><a href="foot.html">9</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In evaluating the NDA, the FDA must ensure
that the product complies with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act (FDCA) requirements pertaining to safety, and that &quot;substantial
evidence&quot; of efficacy be demonstrated.  This stage of the
drug approval process is often quite lengthy, as the FDA review
often takes years after the submission of the NDA.  In many cases
these delays arise because the FDA requests new information from
the pharmaceutical company.  Overall, the NDA process takes between
five to seven years and involves a cost that has been estimated
to be as high as $231 million for each NDA.<sup><a href="foot.html">10</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
An additional cost of the drug lag is that
patients in the United States will be deprived of drugs that potentially
could reduce mortality and morbidity.  There are thus two types
of competing errors known as Type I and Type II errors that could
arise with respect to the approval of new drugs.  The FDA might
approve drugs that turn out to have adverse consequences such
as thalidomide, which was approved in Great Britain but never
approved for use in the United States.  On the other hand, the
FDA could fail to approve drugs that are beneficial and would
have reduced risks because of excessively stringent safety standards.
 Many academic critics of the FDA have charged that the FDA has
erred too greatly on the side of preventing errors of commission
rather than being concerned with the risks that would be averted
by the new drugs that it fails to approve.<sup><a href="foot.html">11</a></sup>  The AIDS lobbyists
have called particular attention to the effect of these substantial
delays as well as the imbalance in attention that the FDA places
on errors of commission as opposed to errors of omission.  This
special disease interest lobbying group has succeeded in expediting
the review process for AIDS-related drugs.  Other potential beneficiaries
of drugs that are delayed by the lengthy review process are not
as well organized and are not as effective in bringing political
pressure to bear to make the FDA more responsive to the patients
who could benefit from these new products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The primary implication of this stringent drug
approval process for the regulatory compliance defense is that
the current concern with the potential safety of new drugs is
already quite substantial.  Indeed, from an economic efficiency
standpoint, one might well argue that the FDA places excessive
reliance on safety, particularly on the safety aspects pertaining
to adverse effects that might be created by drugs.  All that is
needed for purposes of the subsequent discussion of the regulatory
compliance defense is the general result that the FDA procedures
or privately operated procedures will ensure adequate levels of
safety.  These tests will fulfill a company's obligation to provide
an efficient level of safety associated with its products. <BR>
<P>
<b>Regulation of Drug Labeling<BR>
</b>

<P>
Prescription drugs by their very nature pose
potential risks either from misuse or adverse reactions, which
leads to the prescription requirement.  Medical devices also pose
potential risks of a similar nature.  As a result, the FDA requires
that information pertaining to the associated risks be provided
with these products.  In the case of pharmaceutical products,
the warning label must communicate both the overall risk associated
with the product as well as any specific risks associated with
particular groups of product users.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Under the regulatory system established by
the FDCA, the FDA is largely responsible for writing the complete
content of the package inserts<sup><a href="foot.html">12</a></sup> that accompany pharmaceutical products.
 One former FDA General Counsel observed that the &quot;FDA ...
retains, as a practical matter, complete control over package
inserts.&quot;  Unlike the warnings practices under the OSHA hazard
communications standard or EPA labeling requirements for pesticides,
the FDA has both substantial control of the content of the warnings
as well as the warning structure.  In particular, the FDA has
in place a standardized warnings vocabulary that is used to communicate
the risks associated with the drugs.  This vocabulary stipulates
which kinds of information are presented in different places on
the label as well as how different variations in the label, such
as boxing of warnings or larger print, should be used to highlight
specific warnings.  Because of the standardized warnings approach
and the fact that physicians receive training in the processing
of such warning information in pharmacology courses, this system
provides an efficient means of communicating risk information
to the learned intermediary involved in prescribing pharmaceutical
products.  The fact that it is not the patient, but rather the
physician (learned intermediary) who is the target audience for
the warnings greatly affects the character and content of the
warnings message.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The FDA does not develop the warnings language
in isolation.  Rather, the manufacturer is required to submit
to the FDA information pertaining to both the safety and the efficacy
of the product as part of its NDA.  In addition, the manufacturer
must submit proposed labeling for the drug for the FDA review.<sup><a href="foot.html">13</a></sup>
 In conjunction with the manufacturer, the FDA develops the initial
label for the drug.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
There is often a bargaining process between
the FDA and the manufacturer over the content of the warning label.
 The FDA has the ultimate authority since approval of the labeling
is a necessary part of the NDA approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The structure of the warnings vocabulary developed
by the FDA consists of the following sections.  The first section
of the warning label provides information that describes the general
characteristics of the product.<sup><a href="foot.html">14</a></sup>  The second section of the warning
label consists of information pertaining to the clinical pharmacology
of the product, whereby the warning provides information pertaining
to how the particular product operates.  The third section of
the label provides information pertaining to the indications and
the usage of the drug, and this is followed by a contraindications
section indicating the situations under which the drug should
not be administered because of the particular risks that may be
involved.  This section is followed by a warnings section that
details the risks that arise both generally as well as in specific
situations with respect to the drug.  Less frequently occurring
risks are the subject of the precautions section.  Isolated and
more random reactions to the drug are the subject of the adverse
reactions section.  Following this series of risk information
sections, the warning concludes with information about the appropriate
dosage and administration of the product.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The standardized structure of this warnings
vocabulary greatly facilitates the ability of the physician to
process the warnings information.  The FDA also ensures a uniformity
in the use of the warnings language and a correspondence between
the language and the severity of the particular outcomes being
characterized.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
This kind of standardization could be generalized
to contexts in which the FDA did not have the authority to control
and review warnings but instead established as a reference point
a warnings vocabulary framework.  Thus, companies could provide
information with respect to a drug following these guidelines
for the positioning of information and guidelines with respect
to the usage of labeling variations such as boxing of particular
warning sections.  Liability for the company could then be based
on whether the company adhered to the particular warnings vocabulary
guidelines given the characteristics of the product.  Thus, in
our subsequent discussion of the regulatory compliance defense,
no distinction will be made between a warnings policy mandated
by the FDA or a warnings policy based on guidelines established
by the FDA.  It must, however, by recognized that there may be
an additional liability exposure if the FDA does not operate and
specifically approve the warning since then the company must show
that this warning did in fact adhere to the regulatory guidelines.
<BR>
<P>
<b>Post-Marketing Information<BR>
</b>

<P>
After a drug is made available for sale, there
may be adverse consequences that are observed that were not apparent
during the testing process.  If these problems are particularly
severe, it may be appropriate to withdraw the drug from the market.
 Thus, the safety of the drug should be a continuing concern.
 Similarly, if there are adverse consequences associated with
the drug that were not included in the initial labeling, the hazard
information provided should be amended over time to reflect this
changing informational state.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In each case the appropriate reference point
for whether a firm has met its obligation should be the state
of the information at that particular time.  Moreover, because
adverse reactions and effects of drugs are often the subject of
speculation involving small samples, there must be some test of
the scientific validity of the adverse information before companies
should be held responsible for incorporating it in the drug evaluation
process.  A patient administered a drug for a particular ailment
may experience some adverse health effect.  However, in the absence
of a controlled experiment, it is not possible to ascertain whether
this effect is a consequence of the drug or a random variation
in health status that would have occurred if the drug had not
been administered.  The medical literature is replete with possible
adverse effects of this kind.  Some of these are subsequently
bolstered by scientific data, and others prove to be aberrations
that are never established in the literature.  In retrospect,
it is often possible to point to instances in which there was
initial fragmentary evidence regarding an adverse effect that
is ultimately established, but what is important is whether the
information available at any particular point in time is sufficient
to provide a reason for concern.  Effects that appear clearcut
in hindsight may not be evident given the state of information
at an earlier time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In that regard, the FDCA requires that the
pharmaceutical companies share with the FDA information pertaining
to the post-marketing performance of the drug.  This surveillance
process requires that the company report adverse experiences associated
with the drug as well as epidemiologic studies.  The current requirements
are that a company must report any serious reactions to a drug
to the FDA within 15 working days of the receipt of the information.<sup><a href="foot.html">15</a></sup>
 The sources of information that the manufacturer must examine
for these post-marketing studies include clinical, epidemiological,
or surveillance studies, as well as information that appears in
the medical literature.  The FDA then uses that information to
assess whether the drug should continue to be marketed or whether
there should be some change in the labeling for it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
These provisions ensure the safety of drugs
and the appropriateness of information provision.  Regulation
is consequently an ongoing process that continues to reflect the
evolving state of information with respect to the drug.  Under
the current procedures, the FDA must approve any post-marketing
changes associated with the labeling of the drug, although a company
is free to withdraw a drug from the market should it choose to
do so.<sup><a href="foot.html">16</a></sup>  However, if the company does take such unilateral action,
it must simultaneously seek FDA approval for it, and if the FDA
does not approve the change it can institute a regulatory action
against the company.  Moreover, the FDA can overrule the company's
decision to change the warning label if it believes that such
a change would be inappropriate.  <BR>

<h3>The Role of Tort Law</h3>
<P>
<FONT >By imposing costs on the tortfeasor, the liability
system generates both incentives for efficient risk avoidance
as well as compensation for accident victims.  In the case of
monetary losses, both strict liability and negligence standards
will lead to an efficient level of precautions and will lead to
an optimal level of compensation for the accident victim.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Matters become somewhat different in the case
of health effects.  It is very difficult to compensate an individual
for an extreme loss of health status, such as one's life, since
finite amounts of compensation may not make one whole.  The amount
of compensation that would be needed to generate efficient incentives
would be quite large.  An efficient level of damages from a deterrence
standpoint would provide adequate financial incentive to lead
the manufacture to sell products that had an optimal level of
safety when valued using the preferences for safety of the consumer.
 How, for example, do the values of greater safety compare with
the higher cost levels of safer products?  For example, evidence
on the implicit value of life that is appropriate from the standpoint
of deterring risks is $5 million per life.  However, this amount
is not an appropriate guide for insurance and compensation.  Few
individuals would choose to purchase an insurance policy that
would make a payoff of this size in the event of their death.
 As a result, compensation amounts of this magnitude would provide
efficient incentives for deterrence but would provide excessive
insurance.  Consequently, one could view the current tort system
as somewhat split in that the amount of compensation is more closely
linked to the optimal insurance amount, such as the present value
of lost earnings, medical costs, and some compensation for pain
and suffering.  In contrast, the criteria for liability are linked
to generating efficient standards for safety.  Thus, the firm's
obligation is to provide an adequate level of safety for the good,
where this level of adequacy is what would prevail if a good were
traded in a fully functioning and efficient market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The responsibilities of tort liability to provide
incentives for safety and compensation to accident victims depend
of course on the other societal institutions in place.  If, for
example, an individual at risk were compensated through the workers'
compensation system, there would be less need for compensation
through the tort liability system.  Similarly, if the risk level
and the adequacy of warnings is handled through a regulatory structure
that ensures an efficient level of precautions, then there is
no rationale from the standpoint of adequate deterrence for having
tort liability.  Thus, to the extent that the FDA regulations
achieve the social objective of efficient levels of control of
risk, then there is no need to duplicate this function through
additional tort liability.  The obvious exception is that in which
the company withholds critical information from the regulatory
agency so that the regulation cannot be set in an ideal manner.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Government regulations can of course be set
either too leniently or too stringently.  The fact that there
is a government regulation does not necessarily imply that there
is no role for any supplementary social institution, such as tort
liability.  However, in the case of the FDA, the general consensus
is that these regulations are certainly adequate in ensuring safety
and, to the extent that there is any divergence from optimality,
it is that the regulations are excessively stringent with respect
to the promotion of product safety.  If there is already over-deterrence,
there is consequently no rationale for bolstering of the level
of deterrence additionally through incentives provided through
tort liability.  This consideration pertains to the deterrence
or incentive role of tort liability, not necessarily to the compensation
function since regulations do not provide for the compensation
of accident victims.  However, at least from the standpoint of
safety incentives, the optimal use of regulations is to target
them in areas where there are clearly inadequate safety incentives
provided.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There is a widespread consensus in the literature
that the current FDA drug approval process establishes safety
incentives that are excessive.<sup><a href="foot.html">17</a></sup>  The stringency of the process
and the meticulous review of new pharmaceutical drugs is reflected
in the substantial delays that U.S. consumers have experienced
with respect to the introduction of new pharmaceutical products.
 These delays are much greater than in other countries, such as
those in Europe, which also have regulatory procedures to ensure
drug safety.  Studies have also shown that because of these delays
Americans have been prevented from having access to new drugs
with beneficial effects, as the agency places a greater weight
on errors of commission rather than errors of omission.  This
imbalance in the emphasis for these two types of errors has led
to excessive deterrence of new risks that may be created by pharmaceutical
products and inadequate weight on reducing existing risks that
patients now experience.  Because these incentives already ensure
a degree of caution and safety with respect to introducing new
pharmaceutical products that is already excessive, one would not
want to further deter companies from introducing beneficial new
products through additional tort liability sanctions.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One possible counterargument is that after
the drug is approved it may turn out to have adverse effects that
were not anticipated.  However, the task regarding the safety
and efficacy of the product is to make the best judgement that
is possible at the time the product is marketed.  If new information
becomes available to indicate that the product is riskier than
was initially believed, then the company should be held responsible
for acting upon this new information in a reasonable manner and
developing new labeling if necessary.  This way of dealing with
new information is the approach taken in Europe with respect to
medical devices in which companies have a &quot;development-risk&quot;
defense.  Companies are free of liability in the tort liability
regime in all EU countries other than Luxembourg if they can show
that the &quot;state of scientific and technical knowledge at
the time when he put the product into circulation was not such
as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered.&quot;
 This state of the information defense coupled with a requirement
that companies meet the regulatory standards would ensure than
an efficient degree of product safety be provided both at the
time of the product's introduction as well as throughout the product's
life.  Once this has been assured, there is no additional rationale
for augmenting these safety incentives, at least from the standpoint
of risk prevention.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Off-label uses and their relation to a regulatory
compliance defense is an important issue.  The restrictions that
are pertinent for advertising drugs for off-label usage are now
quite stringent<sup><a href="foot.html">18</a></sup>.  For example, in the case of investigational
new drugs that are currently undergoing clinical study, it is
not possible to promote the drug for the usage that is currently
under scrutiny.  Notwithstanding these restrictions on the promotion
of pharmaceutical products, it is generally believed that off-label
usage are quite prevalent, particularly in the cases of AIDS and
cancer treatments.  Much of pediatric age group drug use is also
off-label.  One survey suggested that nearly one-third of the
prescriptions of oncologists for cancer patients were for off-label
usage.  In addition, an estimated 56 percent of cancer patients
have received at least one drug under an off-label purpose.  
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The degree to which there is insurance reimbursement
for off-label usages depends in large part on the nature of the
experimental treatment and the existence of medical evidence supporting
its reliability.  Many off-label treatments for cancer, for example,
are not reimbursed.  Approximately one-half of 681 oncologists
surveyed by the U.S. General Accounting Office reported that at
some point they had been denied reimbursement for the costs of
an off-label prescription<sup><a href="foot.html">19</a></sup>.  That same U.S. General Accounting
Office survey also found that one-third of all the prescriptions
involving cancer chemotherapy involved off-label uses.  Among
the most controversial reimbursements for off-label usage has
been the insurance coverage for the high dose chemotherapy-autologous
bone marrow transplants, which is an expensive and risky treatment.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Strict adherents to regulatory criteria might
speculate that all off-label uses are inappropriate and should
not be undertaken since they have not been accorded FDA approval.
 However, in many instances the opposite conclusion has been reached.<sup><a href="foot.html">20</a></sup>
 The courts have ruled, for example, that Medicaid coverage could
not exclude AZT therapy for an off-label purpose for some classes
of AIDS patients.  Similarly, the courts have ruled that Blue
Cross-Blue Shield must reimburse high dose chemotherapy-autologous
bone marrow transplants.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As Christopher (1993) notes, the nature of
the New York legal provisions with respect to off-label usage
is quite complex: &quot;New York forbids insurers from excluding
coverage of off-label uses of cancer drugs if: (1) prescription
drugs are otherwise covered in the policy; (2) the drug is FDA-approved
for some form of cancer; and (3) the off-label use in question
is recognized by one of the three compendia or recommended by
review article or editorial comment in a major peer-reviewed journal.&quot;
 However, he goes on to note that: &quot;The New York law, however,
allows insurers to exclude from coverage off-label uses expressly
contraindicated by FDA-approved labelling and experimental or</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >investigational drugs.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The nature of the regulatory compliance defense
is somewhat complicated by the use of drugs for off-label purposes.
 The regulatory criteria and the assurance that the drug has met
efficient standards for safety only pertains to uses for which
the drug has been specifically approved, or those uses specified
on the label.  In the case of off-label uses, there has not been
the same kind of review and approval that would provide an ex
ante guarantee that the firm has met its obligations with respect
to safety and efficacy for these uses.  As a result, in the case
of the off-label uses the regulatory compliance defense that is
advocated here would not be pertinent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The practical consequences of this distinction
for off-label uses may be substantial.  It has been estimated
that about half of all drugs prescribed by doctors are given for
off-label uses because the drug is believed to be effective for
these off-label purposes.  At a fairly pedestrian level, one has
doctors prescribing Retin-A for middle aged patients who wish
to eliminate wrinkles even though this is not an on-label purpose
of this anti-acne drug.  Perhaps more importantly in terms of
individual welfare is that many cancer treatments involve off-label
uses of drugs.  At present there are no requirements that physicians
disclose to patients that the particular therapy being prescribed
is an off-label usage.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Whereas there is currently no regulatory compliance
defense in the case of pharmaceuticals, in the case of medical
devices, the 1976 Medical Devices Amendments pre-empted liability
claims against medical devices.  Pre-emption is stronger than
a regulatory compliance defense in that it forecloses all product
liability suits.  The 1995 case of <U>Michael v. Shiley, Inc.</U>
found that these Amendments pre-empted all liability actions involving
negligence, strict liability, and breech of warranty for medical
devices.<sup><a href="foot.html">21</a></sup>  This pre-emption includes all medical devices, not simply
the class III medical devices that are subject to the formal FDA
pre-market approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The main exception to such broad interpretations
of the regulatory compliance defense was the recent decision by
the Ninth Circuit in <U>Kennedy v. Collagen Corp</U><sup><a href="foot.html">22</a></sup>.  In this
case, the court upheld pre-emption only when the FDA had enacted
&quot;specific counterpart requirements&quot; applicable to the
device.  Since the court viewed the pre-market approval process
for Class III devices as not constituting a Federal &quot;requirement,&quot;
the scope of the pre-emption would be severely restricted<sup><a href="foot.html">23</a></sup>.  To
date, this decision remains the exception, as other courts have
interpreted the exemption provisions quite broadly.<BR>
</FONT>
<P><b>Punitive Damages<BR>
</b>

<P>
<FONT >The role of the regulatory compliance defense
has been most prominent with respect to punitive damages rather
than with respect to the overall liability of pharmaceutical and
medical device firms.  Although it will be suggested below that
regulatory compliance should be a defense with respect to all
tort liability, it is even more compelling that punitive damages
are not warranted if a firm has fulfilled all of its regulatory
obligations and has not withheld information from the regulatory
agency.  Groups such as the American Law Institute (1991) have
indicated that abolition of punitive damages in such instances
of regulatory compliance is a particularly desirable reform.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To see why punitive damages reforms head the
list of necessary changes in tort law, let us examine the circumstances
under which punitive damages above and beyond compensatory damages
are awarded and why these damages are not pertinent when pharmaceutical
and medical device companies have complied with government regulations.
 One rationale for punitive damages may be that compensatory damages
alone do not provide adequate deterrence when life and health
are at risk.  This argument is certainly correct from an economic
standpoint, but the role of optimal deterrence will have already
been addressed through regulatory compliance.  If a firm has already
met regulatory standards that ensure a level of safety that is
either efficient or is a more stringent safety level than dictated
by economic efficiency concerns, then there is no additional economic
rationale for punitive damages to augment the safety requirements.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A second rationale for punitive damages is
that they would be warranted if the company's safety efforts fell
well below what was required to provide an efficient level of
safety with respect to the product.  If a firm has not met the
requirements stipulated by the regulation, then certainly punitive
damages may be warranted.  However, if all the regulatory stipulations
with respect to testing and information provision have been met,
then it is not possible that a company's safety efforts could
have fallen greatly below what should be expected since these
expectations are already set out through the regulatory guidelines.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This kind of regulatory compliance defense
may not be warranted with respect to every form of government
regulation.  However, the FDA regulations for pharmaceuticals
differ both in their nature and their stringency.  The distinctive
character of pharmaceutical regulations is that they are extremely
meticulous regulations that entail the premarket review of the
product, extensive testing of the product, a determination of
the safety and efficacy of the product, a provision of risk information
through a procedure that conforms with a highly structured warnings
vocabulary, and post-market surveillance.  These stipulations
certainly go well beyond what might be envisioned by a jury in
any particular case. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Another possible objective of punitive damages
is compensation.  However, this objective should already have
been adequately handled by the compensatory aspect of damages.
 The standard components of tort liability are designed to address
the efficient levels of compensation needed by accident victims.
 If, for example, the courts were to routinely award punitive
damages, this practice would not even be in the interest of consumers
of these products.  Higher liability costs will raise the cost
of producing the product, which in turn will raise the product
price.  In effect, purchasers of a product will be paying for
the higher punitive damage awards through more expensive products.<sup><a href="foot.html">24</a></sup>
 Payments of this type are desirable in the case of compensatory
damages that replicate the kinds of insurance that individuals
would have purchased freely.  However, if individuals would not
have purchased insurance to provide for the kinds of compensation
associated with punitive damages, then in effect, a liability
regime that imposes excessive punitive damages will have forced
customers to buy more insurance for their accident losses than
they would have chosen to provide for themselves if they could
have designed such an insurance mechanism.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A final objective of punitive damages might
be that of retribution.  Although additional penalties on a firm
do serve as a form of retributive punishment, one must also inquire
whose interest such punishment promotes.  If adequate deterrence
and safety incentives are already ensured, retributive punishment
is not needed.  From the standpoint of the consumers of the product,
retributive punishment will not be in their interests if the higher
product price that they must pay for the litigated products reflects
the added costs imposed by such retribution.  Although there may
be instances in which customers will be willing to pay higher
prices for products to know that damages will be assessed to punish
companies, one would expect that such willingness would be associated
with flagrant disregards of safety.  If the company in fact met
regulatory guidelines for efficient provision of safe products,
then there should be little support for retributive punishment
such as this.  If there were such support, then that presumably
would be an indication of a societal preference for even more
stringent pharmaceutical and medical device safety standards than
are now in place.  Thus, a shift in the regulatory guidelines
to promote greater safety levels in response to the preferences
of consumers could ensure that these retributive preferences were
represented without having to rely on punitive damages.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Once the efficient level of safety has been
provided, punitive damages are not innocuous.  Imposing punitive
damages will deter companies from innovating products that might
potentially be subject to punitive damages, such as contraceptives.
 Similarly, companies will have an incentive to exit the market
altogether in an effort to avoid punitive damages, as has been
the case with respect to the production of vaccines.  Deterring
innovations and promoting market exit is not desirable if these
actions are the result of sanctions that are not linked to a provision
of an efficient degree of safety but in fact are imposed on the
firm even if appropriate safety standards have been met.<BR>
</FONT>
<P><b>The Current Common Law Approach<BR>
</b>

<P>
<FONT >Although there have been many discussions of
the regulatory compliance defense for FDA-approved products with
respect to punitive damages, the position taken here will be that
there also should be a regulatory compliance with respect to liability
more generally.  To examine the rationale for this defense, we
must first examine the current status of tort liability as well
as its linkage to the pharmaceutical industry.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Most observers attribute the tort liability
revolution to the emergence of strict liability as well as subsequent
developments in tort law.  The American Law Institute's Restatement
(Second) of Torts was a pivotal document that codified the strict
liability doctrine and indicated that this doctrine would replace
negligence as the preferred theory of liability.<sup><a href="foot.html">25</a></sup>  Section 402a
imposes liability on a firm if the product is &quot;in a defective
condition, unreasonably dangerous&quot; even though &quot;all
possible care&quot; was exercised &quot;in the preparation and
sale of the product.&quot;  This standard consequently is more
stringent than the negligence standard which only required that
an efficient level of safety be provided for the firm to be free
of liability.  For example, additional company expenditures on
safety are desirable so long as the marginal safety benefits exceed
the marginal safety costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is noteworthy that the original drafters
of Restatement (Second) of Torts apparently did not envision that
these criteria were to be applied to &quot;unavoidably unsafe
products,&quot; such as drugs and vaccines:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT >Unavoidably unsafe products.</FONT></I><FONT >
 There are some products which, in the present state of human
knowledge, are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended
and ordinary use.  These are especially common in the field of
drugs.  An outstanding example is the vaccine for the Pasteur
treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to very serious
and damaging consequences when it is injected.  Since the disease
itself invariable leads to a dreadful death, both the marketing
and the use of the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding
the unavoidably high degree of risk which they involve.  Such
a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions
and warnings, is not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous.
 The same is true of many other drugs, vaccines, and the like,
many of which for this reason cannot legally be sold except to
physicians or under the prescription of a physician.  It is also
true in many new or experimental drugs as to which, because of
the lack of time and opportunity for sufficient medical experience,
there can be no assurance of safety ... but such experience as
there is justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding
a medically recognizable risk.  The seller of such products, again
with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed,
and proper warning is given, where the situation calls for it,
is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences
attending their use, merely because he has undertaken to supply
the public with an apparently useful and desirable product, attended
with a known but apparently reasonable risk.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, pharmaceutical products were to be exempted
from these criteria. Not-withstanding this distinction, the judicial
interpretations eventually broadened the &quot;unreasonably dangerous&quot;
test and began to focus on what constituted &quot;defectiveness.&quot;
 In <U>Barker v. Lull Engineering Company</U><sup><a href="foot.html">26</a></sup>, the court ruled
[a] product is defective in design either (1) if the product has
failed to preform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect
when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner or (2)
if, in the light of development factors discussed below, the benefits
of the challenged design do not outweigh the risk of danger inherent
in such design.  In subsequent years, both risk-utility tests
and consumer expectation tests proliferated, and it is the general
consensus that the risk-utility test is more appropriate. <sup><a href="foot.html">27</a></sup> The
manufacturer should not be liable for what the consumer might
expect since these expectations need in no way be reasonable,
but a risk-utility test that has a parallel with an economic benefit-cost
test certainly is pertinent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The most prevalently used risk-utility test
is that developed by Dean Wade.<sup><a href="foot.html">28</a></sup>  That test consists of a variety
of factors that would affect the desirability of the product,
where all but one of these factors is subsumed into a conventional
benefit-cost test.  The one distinctive factor is that the producer
serves in an insurance role for accident victims through the tort
liability awards for product injuries.  It is this insurance role
that underlies the development of strict liability more generally.
 The general notion is that firms provide insurance for consumers
of products through tort liability, where these insurance costs
are transmitted to consumers through higher product prices.  This
theory is sound in the case of rare event product accidents such
as that associated with isolated manufacturing defects, but this
analogy breaks down in the case of mass toxic torts.  The costs
imposed by large scale litigation such as the Dalkon Shield case
cannot be shifted to consumers.  Moreover, it is not feasible
for the company to bear such large scale costs.  The result has
been that many firms have exited the market with respect to development
of new contraceptives and production of vaccines because of the
large scale of these costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Pharmaceutical companies have not escaped the
impact of strict liability.  Several jurisdictions have found
that as a matter of law pharmaceutical products are not unavoidably
unsafe.<sup><a href="foot.html">29</a></sup>  More importantly, the courts have not ruled that compliance
with the FDCA provides a defense in the case of product liability
actions.  Pharmaceutical companies have also been found liable
with respect to the development of new liability doctrines with
respect to hazard warnings even though these warnings are specifically
approved by the FDA and developed in accordance with a highly
structured warnings vocabulary specified by the FDA.  At the present
time, the majority of all courts do not recognize the FDA regulatory
compliance defense with respect to overall liability of the firm.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The effects in the absence of regulatory compliance
defense have been quite striking.  Producers of the DPT vaccine,
for example, were exposed to substantial liability that led to
considerable caution throughout the vaccine market.  Since 1968,
the number of vaccine manufacturers in the United States has dropped
by more than 50 percent.  The American vaccine market is now controlled
by single producer monopolies in the case of vaccines for polio,
rubella, measles, mumps, and rabies.  There are similar kinds
of monopolies for many pediatric vaccines as well.  The substantial
costs of tort liability consequently have led to the exit of the
market of substantial markets concentration for vaccines.  The
result has been a considerable rise in the price of vaccines,
well in excess of the inflation rate.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There have been, of course, changes in the
vaccine areas that have been prompted by the effects of the liability
burden.  In particular, Congress passed the Childhood Vaccine
Injury Act of 1986 in order to replace the burdensome tort litigation
process with an administrative compensation system.  Even in the
case of vaccines, this legislation has not completely eliminated
the tort liability problems.  Many vaccines, such as the chicken
pox vaccine, are not covered by the provisions of the act.  In
addition, this administrative compensation system, which is financed
by a tax on the pharmaceutical companies, requires that claimants
file claims through this program, but the claimant is free to
reject this award and can pursue a tort action under state law
if the claimant views the award as unsatisfactory.  An additional
deterrent to competition in the vaccine industry is that once
firms exited the market for vaccines, it was difficult to reenter.
 Thus, this major liability reform in the vaccine area should
be viewed as an incomplete remedy for the liability problems that
existed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To the extent that there has been any exemption
it has been with respect to punitive damages.  Thus far, there
are five states - Arizona, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, and Utah
- that have provided for an FDA regulatory compliance defense
against punitive damages.  There has been no punitive damage defense
adopted through Federal legislation, although such a defense is
frequently included in draft bills.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Medical devices are regulated under the 1976
Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  Companies
are permitted to market class I medical devices, such as tongue
depressors without government approval.  Class II medical devices,
such as hearing aids, were formerly required to meet government
approved performance standards, and class III medical devices,
such as heart valves, still must undergo a process similar to
that for pharmaceuticals.  In particular, there is a pre-market
approval process for such devices.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The liability regime for pharmaceuticals is
in striking context to medical devices.  The Medical Devices Amendments
of 1976, which were amendments to FDCA, grant a pre-emption defense
for medical devices that is similar in spirit but stronger than
a regulatory compliance defense.  Indeed, in the recent 1995 case
of Michael D. Shiley, Inc., the court ruled that the medical devices
amendments of 1976 pre-empt actions involving negligence, strict
liability, and breach of implied warranty for medical devices.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the case of medical devices, there is not
only pre-emption of cases under Federal law but also claims under
state law as well.  In particular, in 1995 the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit ruled that the Medical Device Amendments
to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act pre-empted all state tort
claims.  Moreover, this pre-emption was held to be true even if
the manufacturer defrauded the Food and Drug Administration and
did not in fact achieve regulatory compliance.<sup><a href="foot.html">30</a></sup>  The defrauding
company was, however, subject to criminal fines for conspiracy
to defraud the FDA and was required to pay total fines of $61
million.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What is striking about this regulatory compliance
defense, in contrast with the treatment of pharmaceuticals, is
that only class three medical devices (devices that are implanted
under the skin) are subject to premanufacturing review.  The more
minor class I and II devices are not subject to premanufacturing
review, although they are subject to postmarketing surveillance
by the FDA.  The irony of this distinction is that in contrast
with exhaustive pre-marketing review of pharmaceuticals, which
often takes up to a decade, the device approval process has been
estimated to take an average of one year.<sup><a href="foot.html">31</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This discrepancy has even led to an important
anomaly in terms of product treatment.  The Copper-7 intrauterine
device was in fact a medical device, not a pharmaceutical.  However,
before the passage of the medical device amendments of 1968, there
needed to be some means of classifying this product, and FDA chose
to classify it as a pharmaceutical.  If this product had in fact
been regulated under the subsequently promulgated Medical Device
Amendments of 1976, the firm would have been free of its ultimately
substantial liability.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The overall policy proposal of this report
is to make the regulatory compliance defense more symmetric for
both pharmaceutical products and medical devices.  Although a
regulatory compliance defense for pharmaceutical products will
not be as strong as the pre-emption given to medical devices,
it will create more similar legal framework.  The premanufacturing
review process for pharmaceuticals is much more stringent than
for medical devices.  The criteria involved ensure the safety
and efficacy of the product based on the best available state
of the information at the time.  There is no rationale for continuing
the distinction that puts pharmaceutical products at such a substantial
relative disadvantage.<BR>

<br>
<h3>Legal Implication of a Revised Approval Process</h3><BR>

<P>
<FONT >We have outlined sweeping proposals for the
revision of the pharmaceutical and medical device approvals.<sup><a href="foot.html">32</a></sup> 
The essential elements of this proposal would be to privatize
the review process for new drugs and pharmaceuticals and to foster
competition in this review process.  In the case of pharmaceuticals,
the Drug Certifying Bodies would approve the IND for the drug,
oversee the clinical development, review the NDA, and certify
that the product is safe and effective.  After this review process
was completed, the FDA would have responsibility for the final
sign off in a highly structured review process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Delegating these responsibilities to private
entities does not necessarily create any legal problems.  Government
agencies, including the FDA, frequently draw on the expertise
and input of private parties in a variety of regulatory areas.
 What is essential, however, is that this delegation of responsibility
be handled in a sound manner to avoid any constitutional problem
that might arise in the delegation of legislative power.<sup><a href="foot.html">33</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the case of medical devices, the manufacturing
and/or Device Certifying Body would be responsible for compliance
with established standards-based criteria.  In the case of the
highest risk devices, the FDA would do a review and confirm that
proper standards had been used.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In each case, there would be no compromise
in the safety and efficacy levels of products as compared to the
current regime.  The ultimate sign-off for these products would
also be the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration
as would the overall character of the safety criteria.  The same
kinds of regulatory compliance defenses that would be sound proposals
under the current product liability and regulatory regime would
also be pertinent if the plan's proposals were adopted.  Thus,
if companies were in compliance with the government regulation
as administered under this new process, then the level of safety
provided by the company would be efficient, thus meeting the safety
objectives of either a negligence or strict liability standard.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Under the revised plan review process, the
Device Certifying Bodies and Drug Certifying Bodies would have
a critical role in the review process.  What, however, would be
the ultimate liability of these certifying bodies?  In the absence
of specific legal exemptions, these bodies potentially could be
subject to the usual liability criteria notably negligence and
strict liability.  If, however, thh2>IV. Regulatory Reform and Lia
liability then there would be a substantial deterrent for any
firm to enter the market as a DCB.  Such companies would face
the prospect of being named as a defendant in any potential product
liability litigation involving a drug or medical device for which
they had been involved in the approval process.  Particularly
in a world of joint and several liability in which a DCB could
be potentially responsible for the entire liability burden if
the defendant company was unable to meet the cost involved in
the award, the DCBs would risk bankruptcy in much the same way
do many companies which face the prospect of mass toxic tort litigation
or punitive damages.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In this instance, a reasonable proposal for
structuring the liability system would be to draw distinction
between potential liability with respect to negligence and strict
liability.  One would want to maintain incentives for the DCB
to exercise care in the approval of new drugs.  Thus, we would
not want the DCB to be negligent in overseeing the review process
for drugs or medical devices.  Thus, permitting suits against
the DCB by an injured plaintiff on the basis of negligence would
provide for the possibility of court sanctions against irresponsible
DCB behavior.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This liability exposure could be coupled with
the provision of a legal exemption from strict liability.  Although
the experience of Underwriters' Laboratory and other certifying
bodies suggests that strict liability has not been of consequence
to date, a specific legal exemption from strict liability could
be beneficial in eliminating the small risk of catastrophic losses
that might otherwise deter entry of potential DCBs.  Would, for
example, a university hospital be willing to gamble its entire
financial resources on the opportunity to enter this novel and
potentially highly litigious area?  If it did so, the fees needed
to cover potential liability costs would provide a deterrent to
the testing of potentially beneficial new drugs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The underlying rationale for strict liability
in the usual judicial context is that the company has a role beyond
not being negligent.  Rather, the firm should serve as the insurer
for the potential losses of accident victims and spread these
losses in much the same way as would an insurance company.  The
reasoning behind this is that the firm can pass along the cost
of the insurance to the customers who in effect will buy the insurance
for liability costs for pharmaceuticals or drugs as part of the
purchase price.  However, the additional insurance rationale is
not pertinent to whether the firm exercises appropriate care.
 The negligence doctrine alone is adequate to establishing these
incentives.  Moreover, it is not the DCB but rather the pharmaceutical
and medical device company that is marketing the product and has
the ability to spread the cost through the product price.  It
is, of course, true that the DCB can raise its fees to the companies,
which in turn can raise the product price.  Even in this instance,
however, this insurance analogy tends to break down in the case
of mass toxic torts and punitive damages.  Unanticipated awards,
such as those that resulted from the imposition of retroactive
liability, by their very nature cannot be recouped in the marketplace.
 Cases such as those that led to the bankruptcy or reorganization
of the affected firms likewise do not lend themselves to an insurance
role.  Moreover, the types of court awards that are made do not
simply provide insurance of medical costs and other income losses
of accident victims but instead provide for amounts well beyond
these losses.  Such awards will not be valued by prospective consumers
of the product since this is not the type of insurance they would
choose to purchase.  Consequently their cost will not be fully
reflected in the purchase price that consumers are willing to
pay.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCBs would, of course, have liability to
the companies as well as to potential consumers.  In particular,
the product certifier would have the responsibility of fulfilling
the terms of its contracts with its clients.  Thus, the certifier
would have the contractual duty to carry out these contract provisions
as well as the tort law duty to provide a workman-like service.<sup><a href="foot.html">34</a></sup>
 The DCB also is subject to the provisions of communicating the
results of its findings to the client.  If the DCB provides false
or inaccurate information, then it is subject to tort liability.<sup><a href="foot.html">35</a></sup>
 Under the theory of negligent misrepresentation the company could
potentially sue the DCB for providing false or inaccurate information.
 Thus, if the company suffered financial losses because of the
false information provided by the DCB and the DCB failed to exercise
reasonable care in obtaining and communicating the information,
then there is a potential basis for a negligence by the company
against the DCB.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The greater practical problem from the standpoint
of DCBs is not whether they are subject to potential liability
actions on the part of corporations purchasing its services but
rather whether third parties injured by the approved products
can obtain liability awards.  As a general rule, U.S. courts have
not found companies responsible for endorsing or certifying products
strictly liable for these defects.  However, a specific legal
exemption from strict liability could ensure that this is the
case and conclusively eliminate the threat of such suits.  The
underlying rationale that has been applied by the courts has been
that the product endorsers or testers are not directly involved
in the manufacturing or the distribution of the product so that
the usual rationales for strict liability are not appropriate.<sup><a href="foot.html">36</a></sup>
 For much the same reasoning, manufacturers have not been held
liable under the theories of breach of warranty.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our plan's proposal that the DCBs be exposed
to third party suits on grounds of negligence is also consistent
with current legal doctrine in this area.  In situations in which
the courts have first determined that the testers or product certifiers
owed a duty of care to the general public, then negligence rules
have been applied.<sup><a href="foot.html">37</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The underlying reasoning that has led to the
courts determining that product certifiers and testers are potentially
liable can be traced to two principles.  If the individual who
is harmed took actions that were based on reasonable reliance
on the information provided by the certifier/tester and if the
certifier/tester is negligent either in obtaining accurate information
or in presenting it then there is potential liability for whatever
physical harm results from the use of these products.  As a general
rule, companies that are responsible for supplying information
to the public and which will be relied upon by the public in making
their purchasing decisions do have a duty to consumers.<sup><a href="foot.html">38</a></sup>  Of course
in the case of the role of DCBs with respect to product certification,
this aspect of liability will be complicated by the fact that
the FDA has the final sign-off in this review process.  Thus,
it must be the case that it is the DCB and not the FDA that is
responsible for the negligence.  The key issue is whether the
DCB has been careless or negligent in carrying out its responsibilities,
which is a much narrower basis for liability than is the case
for the pharmaceutical companies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To summarize, the major changes being proposed
with respect to the liability system pertain both to the current
liability regime as well as the proposed new regulatory structure.
 In particular, the proposal models a regulatory compliance defense
for pharmaceuticals and devices both with respect to punitive
damages and liability more generally.  The plan proposals to revise
the FDA drug and device approval process would not alter the pertinence
or applicability of these legal reforms.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The specific new legal issues that are raised
by the reform proposals pertain to the potential liability of
the DCBs.  If this potential liability is substantial, then entry
into this market will be discouraged and the desired competition
will not be forthcoming.  For the most part, the desired legal
changes needed to accompany this new regulatory mechanism simply
involve clarification of the existing legal structure to eliminate
residual uncertainties.  Potential contractual liability of the
DCBs to the companies purchasing their services would be present
and is entirely appropriate.  The greater dangers are those posed
by strict liability and negligence claims involving the products
tested by the DCBs.  Past legal precedent suggests that strict
liability claims are unlikely to be upheld by the court, but to
eliminate the risk of potentially catastrophic losses we propose
that there be a formal legal exemption from strict liability suits.
 As under the current legal regime, DCBs would be subject to potential
suits with respect to negligence, as indeed they should since
one would want to preserve the incentives for them to carry out
their duties in an efficient manner.<BR>

<br>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<P>
<FONT >The pharmaceutical and medical device industry
is in many respects an anomaly with respect to its legal status.
 This industry has been the target of some of the most pathbreaking
and costly product liability suits.  Indeed, not only is the liability
burden for the pharmaceutical and medical device industry quite
high, it is extremely disproportionate to its sales when compared
to other manufacturing industries.  By almost any objective standard,
the pharmaceutical industry is an outlier in terms of the extent
to which it has been hard hit by the rise in liability costs.
 These liability costs have been of substantial practical consequence,
as they have served as a deterrent to innovation and have discouraged
entry into important areas of product development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What is perhaps most disturbing about these
high liability costs is that they have been coupled with a regulatory
regime that is extremely stringent, certainly more stringent than
what is in place for any other major class of consumer products.
 Pharmaceutical products are subjected to extensive pre-market
testing and even extensive review before they are permitted to
be tested.  After having been tested and shown to be both safe
and effective, pharmaceutical products are marketed under restricted
market conditions in which a physician must prescribe prescription
drugs before they can be purchased.  In addition, the product
is accompanied by an on-product warning or a patient package insert,
the wording of which is specifically approved by the Food and
Drug Administration and is in large part drafted by the Food and
Drug Administration to be in conformance with a standardized warnings
vocabulary.  After the products are on the market, the Food and
Drug Administration undertakes considerable effort with respect
to surveillance of products and monitoring of adverse effects
that are reported to it.  This extremely vigorous regulatory regime
ensures that the usual tort liability objective of striking an
appropriate balance in the promotion of safety for the product
has been achieved.  Indeed, most critics of the FDA suggest that
the FDA errs on the side of excessive caution leading to too few
innovative new drugs reaching the market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the presence of such stringent regulatory
criteria, one wonders why the pharmaceutical industry has been
the object of such extensive litigation.  The reason is not that
the FDA's judgements were in error.  Rather, in some cases new
information becomes apparent over time, which could not have been
known by either the company or by the FDA without even a more
extensive testing process that would have delayed potentially
beneficial drugs from reaching the market even longer.  More important
is that in a regime of strict liability the company will assume
responsibility for insuring any adverse outcomes that occur in
any patient population group.  In some cases there may be adverse
reactions to a drug that lead to a patient injury and a subsequent
lawsuit.  In other instances, the causality may be difficult to
ascertain.  Pharmaceutical companies with their relatively deep
pockets may be held accountable for the losses even though their
product did not in fact cause the injury.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The liability regime we propose would remedy
the inequities created by a liability system that currently imposes
stringent penalties on an industry that already is subject to
extensive regulatory requirements.  A strong regulatory compliance
defense would recognize the role that FDA standards play in addressing
the product safety issue.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Other legal issues are also created by a broader
reform effort.  Under the proposed regulatory process for pharmaceuticals
and medical devices outlined here, DCBs would be potentially subject
to suits from both companies purchasing their services as well
as injured plaintiffs.  Suits on the part of companies that are
attempting to hold the DCBs to their contractual obligations are
entirely appropriate and should be permitted.  In addition, suits
against the DCBs on the basis of negligence in carrying our their
review functions also are appropriate.  At present, certifiers
such as Underwriters' Laboratory are not typically subject to
strict liability.  Nevertheless, it is appropriate to give DCBs
a formal exemption from strict liability in order to eliminate
the low probability chance of a high loss event that may lead
to the insolvency of the DCB.  The prospect of such suits would
deter entry into the DCB arena, which would not be a desirable
outcome.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The legal proposals accompanying our plan simply
involve recognition of the need for a regulatory compliance defense
and codifying the existing legal regime to provide a degree of
assurance that the current legal landscape will not be altered
in a way that will affect DCBs adversely.  Given the past performance
of the liability system, such as the imposition of retroactive
liability in the asbestos cases, the need for a safe harbor for
DCBs even on a limited basis may be desirable in reducing unreasonable
exposures to liability.  The overall objective of legal sanctions
is to maintain the incentives for efficient behavior on the part
of DCBs, and this can be done by adopting the legal reforms that
we have proposed.</FONT>

<P>
<ol>
<li> Clearly, the FDA reports to more than one
Congressional committee, so that the Weingast and Moran argument
is more complicated than the idea of a single, dominant overseer.
 Also, it is not clear that the FDA has responded much to advice
to loosen up, which suggests that it is more of a captive of committees
which criticize the agency for being too easy on industry.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The following discussion is meant to be
suggestive of how to analyze this case in slightly more formal
terms.  It can be skipped without loss of continuity.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<li>   An important semantical point needs to
be made here. Self-certification in the present discussion simply
means letting the market work, including the adoption of the standards
under which self-certification would take place. In other contexts
in this study self-certification will mean letting firms meet

medical devices) on their own. Government is not involved in the
former case, while it is involved in setting and policing standards
in the latter case.<BR>

<P>
<li>  The &quot;lemons&quot; problem resides in
the fact that buyers do not know the true quality of products
before they purchase and use them.  Hence, they tend to overvalue
lower quality products and to undervalue higher quality products.
 This means that only the lower quality products will be sold
in market equilibrium.  Owners of higher quality products will
not supply them for sales because they are systematically undervalued
by the market.  The market for used cars may be used as an example
of the &quot;lemons&quot; problem.  The analysis can also be translated
to the market for medical treatment. There is a pervasive history
of fraud in medical treatment and a tendency for the system to
degenerate into scams. The ease of fraud and scams is the reason
alternative medicines are so popular, such as shark cartilage
for cancer and arthritis treatment.<BR>

Regulation of Medical Devices. New England Journal of Medicine
317:357-66, 1987. In this article, Dr. Kessler (before he became
FDA Commissioner) wrote: &quot;the FDA's extensive reliance on
the 510(k) pathway to reduce the number of devices that require
premarketing approval - and consequently its own workload - is
destined to fail. As technology advances, the number of devices
legitimately found to be substantially equivalent to devices marketed
before 1976 will diminish markedly. If the FDA does not soon develop
other acceptable mechanisms for dealing with new devices, practical
considerations will force it to stretch the statute further, making
the regulation of medical devices even more perplexing.&quot;</FONT>

<li>  The 1976 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act at least
technically offered the opportunity for the manufacturer to market
a device under section 510(k) 90 days after notification of the
FDA. The 1990 amendments removed this option and the manufacturer,
under the threat of severe penalties, must await an FDA &quot;order&quot;
giving permission to go to market.</FONT>

<li>  Briones (1995), p. 17. Statistical analysis
of data based on the date the PMA was submitted, by necessity,
does not include PMA's that were still pending at the time of
analysis. When these PMA's are finally acted upon, perhaps many
years after originally submitted, the average elapsed time will
increase. This phenomenon is more important for PMA's than 510(k)'s
as they typically require much more time and are not acted upon
in the year that they are filed.</FONT>

that the delay would be between 1 and 3 years (pp. 89-91).</FONT>

product lines or ventures, all have been developed, tested and
produced first in Europe. All will be available first to patients
overseas well before they are introduced to patients in the United
States. Overall, the gap between commercial availability of new
therapies in Europe and the United States has widened from 1 to
2 years to 5 to 7 years.&quot; The author has heard similar statements

<li>  In 1994, the Gallop Organization interviewed
58 executives of member companies of the American Electronics
Association and prepared a &quot;Survey of Medical Device Manufacturers
Concerning the Strategic and Economic Impact of the Federal Regulatory
Process.&quot; They looked at the impact of the experience of
these companies with the current 510(k) approval process. Fifteen
percent of these executives reported that their experience has
led them to relocate manufacturing operations outside of the United
States, 35% reported placing a greater emphasis on R&amp;D outside
the U.S. and 59% reported that more products are released outside
the U.S. that in the past.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Commissioner Kessler in his April 6, 1995
statement before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources
stated that &quot;Today, the Clinton Administration is announcing
a number of initiatives to improve the speed and efficiency of
the drug and device review process... I would like to submit for
the record FDA's report on regulatory reform in drug and medical
device review. These reforms ... have been developed under the
leadership of Vice President Gore's National Performance Review...
Some of the reforms we announce speak directly to reduced time
for review and approval. Others aim to reduce excessive regulatory
burdens... They will result ... in annual cost savings for industry
of $500 million.&quot; There is currently little debate concerning
whether reform is needed. The only question is which reforms are
best.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The FDA has recently announced it's &quot;policy
on the development of standards with respect to international
harmonization of regulatory requirements and guidelines&quot;
(Federal Register, vol. 60, no. 196, pp.53078-84, October 11,
1995). The FDA states that &quot;harmonization enhances public
health protection and improves governmental efficiencies by reducing
both unwarranted contradictory regulatory requirements and redundant
applications of similar requirements by multiple regulatory bodies.&quot;
However, taken as a whole, the announced policy has so many caveats
that it is evident that the FDA is still not enthusiastically
embracing the harmonization of standards with Western Europe.
In fact the announcement overtly states that this &quot;policy
document does not ... bind FDA in any way.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<li>  European Council Directive of 14 June 1993
Concerning Medical Devices, Annex I, gives the details of the
14 essential requirements.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The question of why the FDA, despite the
mandates of the 1976 law, failed to develop performance standards,
while the European system successfully relies upon them is elucidated
by Commissioner Kessler writing (NEJM 317:357-66, 1987) that &quot;the
development of 800 performance standards for the 800 types of
Class II devices, which has been estimated to require 50,000 staff
years, would probably exceed the capacity of the agency under
any circumstances.&quot;  In the European system there is no need
for a vast staff as they take full advantage of the myriad of
non-governmental standards setting bodies in a multitude of countries;
they have the flexibility to use generic standards as well as
standards that apply only to a single device; they, in many cases,
use standards to validate the manufacturer's quality assurance
systems instead of individual device standards; and finally they
allow the manufacture to devise <I>ad hoc</I> methods of proving
conformance with the &quot;essential requirements&quot; instead
of or to supplement relying on published standards. This approach
has allowed for more flexibility than relying primarily on a monolithic
federal agency.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Annex IX of the Medical Device Directive
contains the details of the classification criteria.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The full set of EU quality assurance standards
(which are similar to the ISO 9000 series of standards commonly
used in the United States) is equivalent to a super set of the
FDA's GMP requirements in that they also include standards for
ensuring the quality of the design process. The FDA has announced
that it intends to add design quality assurance to its GMP's in
the future.</FONT>

Industry Moves Offshore. Medical Device &amp; Diagnostic Industry.
17(8):72-79, 1995. According to a recent survey, &quot;seventy

<li>  Wilkerson (1955) pp. 217-27. This lists
100 specific medical devices, currently available in Europe, Canada,
Australia and/or Japan, which are currently not available to patients
in the United States.  Eventual FDA approval is expected for most
of these products. In general, these devices relate to the diagnosis
and treatment of severe disease. For example, 31 of the 100 are
related to coronary artery disease, structural cardiac abnormalities
or congestive heart failure. To the extent that they are more
efficacious than devices currently available in the United States,
regulatory delay may be responsible for unnecessary morbidity
and mortality.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Less than the Sum of its Parts (1993) p.
81. The House report states: &quot;Clinical utility is the Agency's
[FDA's] requirement that a device manufacturer prove not only
does the device work as claimed, but that patient's health also
improves as a result of the device's action.&quot; &quot;Since
... ODE is barely able to perform the review presently required
by statute, it makes little sense for it to add routinely the
burden of assessing clinical utility to its review process.&quot;
 There is a critical distinction between the EU's concept of requiring
evidence of clinical efficacy and the FDA's requirement for evidence
of clinical utility. The former is related to demonstrating that
the device has the claimed effect; the latter, that the device's
effect is clinically beneficial. For example, the manufacture
of a mechanical ventilator that breathes for a patient may claim
that it delivers large breath volumes at a slow rate. The EU system
would require that this claim be verified and that the gas really
goes into the patient's lungs as claimed; the FDA system would
require that it be shown that this type of ventilation is, in
some sense, good for some subset of patients. In the EU system,
such medical questions are normally outside the domain of the
device regulations (unless, of course, the device manufacturer
makes an implicit or explicit claim of clinical utility).</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Less than the Sum of its Parts (1993) pp.
71-3. This congressional report quotes the head of the FDA Division
of Product Surveillance as stating that the current device reporting
&quot;system doesn't work and everyone knows it doesn't.&quot;
The report concludes that &quot;The weakness of CDRH's MDR system
reflects an FDA-wide problem with its failure to use management
information systems effectively&quot; and that little has changed
since the GAO came to a similar conclusion in their 1989 report.
The report continues on p. 91: &quot;The MDR system currently
cannot serve as an early warning system ... and it makes little
sense to invest additional resources into this system given its
many flaws. The Agency's chronic problems in this area may make
it necessary to have an independent expert contractor develop
a practical and useful system.&quot; For devices, because they
way that they are actually used cannot be fully determined before
actual marketing, postmarket surveillance is at least as important
as premarket review. Fortunately, it is in the interest of responsible
manufacturers to have their own, generally very effective, systems
to act on device problems discovered in the post-marketing period.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Legislation currently being considered in the
House to deregulate America's electric energy industry would fail
to create a truly competitive electricity market, Michael Block,
Senior Fellow at The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation, told the
WEST Associates Congressional Energy Forum yesterday.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">At the August 18-20 conference in Santa Fe,
Block outlined principles that should guide efforts to replace
America's regulated electric energy industry with a competitive
market system.   The principles Block outlined included:<p>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Objective of reform should be a competitive
market in electric energy, not choice per se.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Market discipline should be the regulatory
mechanism of choice.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Natural monopoly arguments about any activity
should require proof &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">States rights should stop at the Commerce
Clause.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Antitrust oversight and light-handed regulation
should be preferred to so called &quot;incentive regulation,&quot;
which itself should be preferred to cost-of-service regulation.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Transition costs should be allocated, to
the maximum extent possible, in a manner that provides appropriate
incentives.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The Federal government should seize every
opportunity to foster competitive restructuring at the state level.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Private property rights should be respected
and restructuring efforts should emphasize voluntarism.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Environmental concerns should, to the maximum
extent possible, be addressed through market mechanisms.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<P>
<br>
<FONT FACE="Arial">August 20, 1996</FONT>
<P>
<br>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The nuclear power dilemma should be addressed
in any restructuring effort.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Abolish FERC as we know it.  Whatever regulation
remains necessary should be done at the state and local, not Federal,
level.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal ownership of power assets is the
least preferred alternative; private ownership is the most preferred
alternative.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Social and redistributive policy should
be accomplished using explicit subsidies and taxes.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Outmoded Federal regulations should be
repealed.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Reform at the Federal level should begin
immediately.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Block examined how legislation (H.R. 3790)
introduced by Representative Dan Schaefer (R-CO), chairman of
the House Commerce subcommittee on energy, measures up to the
principles, and concluded that the Schaefer legislation does not
go far enough in terms of deregulation, fails to take a skeptical
enough view of Federal regulation, and contains some anti-competitive
provisions such as those mandating costly renewable energy sources.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In a recent study, Block, who heads the Foundation's
project on &quot;Creating Competitive Markets in Electric Power,&quot;
argued that a better approach to energy deregulation this year
would be to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
because it is hindering state efforts to reform energy markets.
 The study, <I>The Competition Revolution and the Market for Energy</I>,
argues that PUHCA repeal would get deregulation off to an immediate
start.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation is a
private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center established in 1993
to create a positive vision of the future founded in the historic
principles of the American Idea.  It brings together a diverse
group of thinkers and policy experts and shares their work with
the American people through seminars, conferences, publications

<CENTER><h2>I.  INTRODUCTION </h2></CENTER>

<P>
In sector after sector of the American economy
- from airlines to telecommunications - competition already has
replaced, or is replacing, regulation as the primary market structure.
 This competition revolution is now sweeping into the energy industry.
 Forty-six states are considering introducing competition into
their energy markets, and some Members of Congress are calling
for the complete deregulation of the energy industry. 
<P>
America is home to one-third of all the installed
electric energy capacity in the world, with investor-owned utility
assets in excess of $500 billion and total revenues of the electric
energy industry of $200 billion annually.   Allowing competition
in this industry would provide consumers with billions of dollars
annually in economic benefits and spur the introduction of better
generating technologies. 
<P>
Yet efforts to introduce competition into the
energy industry are hindered by a regulatory hold over from the
Depression.  The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 is
a major barrier to state reform efforts.  In addition, its primary
purpose - to protect consumers and investors - is better served
by other existing mechanisms. Today, the Act is denying consumers
the benefits of more energy choices at better rates. 
<P>
This paper demonstrates that PUHCA should be
repealed as an important step in bringing the benefits of the
competition revolution to all consumers of energy in America.
 After a brief explanation of the origins and provisions of PUHCA,
the paper explains in section III how the Act is standing in the
way of state competition initiatives. 
<P>
Section IV explores how PUHCA hinders the most
efficient production of energy. Next, the paper explains that
the Act interferes with efficient energy regulation.  Section
VI explains that sixty years after the Depression, PUHCA is redundant.
 Not only has the industry itself transformed, but other federal
government bodies and market mechanisms are better able to protect
consumers and investors. 
<P>
At the end of the paper are appendices defining
terms and abbreviations, outlining the main provisions of PUHCA,
and explaining the reform efforts underway in the leading states. 
<P>
Repealing PUHCA would be a major step forward
in deregulating the energy industry.  It is time to remove this
outdated and redundant regulatory barrier to competition. It is
time to allow the states to experiment with the best methods for
providing consumers with the benefits of energy competition.<BR>

<CENTER><h2>APPENDIX 2 </h2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B>THE MAIN PROVISIONS OF PUHCA<BR>
 </B></CENTER>
<P>
The main provisions of PUHCA are summarized
below. A &quot;holding company&quot; is a company that owns ten
percent or more of the voting stock of a &quot;public utility
company.&quot; <a href="foot.html"><sup>65</sup></a> 
A &quot;public utility company&quot; is an electric
or gas utility company.  An electric or gas utility is any company
which owns or operates facilities to generate, transmit (in the
case of electricity) or distribute (in either case) these goods
for sale.  Numerous activities undertaken by public utilities
are regulated under PUHCA.  These can be divided into several
main areas:<BR>
 
<P>
<u>1) Registration </u>.
 As discussed above, all utility holding companies must either
register under the Act or seek an exemption.  Section 2 of the
Act requires that any firm acquiring more than 10 percent of the
equity of a utility must register as a holding company.<BR>
 
<P>
<U>2) Exemption </u>.
 The Act creates two main categories of public utility holding
companies: &quot;registered&quot; holding companies and &quot;exempt&quot;
holding companies.  Registered holding companies (RHC's) are subject
to all provisions of the Act, while exempt holding companies (EHC's)
are exempt from critical provisions of the Act.  There are currently
fourteen registered holding companies in the U.S.<BR>
 
<P>
There are several ways a holding company can
gain an exemption from the Act.  There are technically five statutory
exemptions.  The two main ones are, first, if a holding company's
operations are predominantly within a single state (i.e., &quot;intrastate&quot;
- Section 3 (a)(1)) and second, if the parent company is &quot;predominantly
a utility&quot; (Section 3 (a)(2)) meaning that the parent is
itself predominantly an operating utility, and operations of the
holding company system are limited to the state in which the parent
is organized, and contiguous states.<a href="foot.html"><sup>66</sup></a>  
The three remaining exemptions
are if the holding company is &quot;only incidentally a holding
company,&quot; a &quot;temporary holding company,&quot; or a &quot;foreign
holding company.&quot; <BR>
 
<P>
<U>3) Issuance and Acquisition of Securities </U>
(Sections 6 and 7).  The Act also regulates the securities and
assets that a registered holding company or its subsidiaries can
hold.  These sections make it unlawful to issue or sell a security
without prior SEC approval.  Specifically, the Act requires that
a security be &quot;reasonably adapted&quot; to the earning power
and security structure of the issuing company and to the capital
structure of the company, among other requirements. <BR>
 
<P>
<U>4) Acquisition of Utility Interests </U>
(Sections 8, 9 and 10).  These sections affect the acquisition
of securities, utility assets, and interests in other businesses.
 Section 8 prohibits a registered holding company from owning
an electric utility and a gas utility without the approval of
the state commission.  Section 9 places restrictions on the type
of assets that can be acquired.  It prohibits registered holding
companies from acquiring any securities, utility assets or any
other interest in any business (unless approved by the SEC) under
the standards of Section 10. Additionally, this section prohibits
any person (including both registered and exempt holding companies)
from acquiring any security of any public utility company, if
that purchase makes the person an affiliate (unless approved by
the SEC).  In the so-called &quot;two-bite rule, Section 9(a)(2)
requires that if a company owns five percent of a utility, transaction
that would result in ownership of more than 5 percent of the equity
of another utility requires prior SEC approval.<BR>
 
<P>
<U>5) Simplification of Holding Company Systems </U>
(Section 11).  An important goal of the Act was to integrate and
simplify the holding company system.  Section 11(b)(1) of the
Act requires that each registered holding company be limited to
a single &quot;integrated public-utility system,&quot; (although
the SEC has the authority to relax this constraint).  This essentially
limits the RHC to a particular geographic region and thus fosters
local control.  Non-utility businesses can be acquired only if
they are &quot;reasonably incidental, or economically necessary
or appropriate&quot; to the operations of the integrated utility
system, as defined in the Act.<BR>
 
<P>
<U>6) Coordination with State Regulatory Authorities </U>.
 An additional goal of the Act was to facilitate regulation of
public utilities on the state level.  For example, Section 6(b)
authorizes the SEC to exempt the issuance of certain securities
by subsidiary companies if approved by a state commission.  Likewise,
Section 9(b) exempts some asset acquisitions from provisions of
Section 10 if approved by a state commission.  Moreover, the SEC
may not authorize the issuance of securities or the acquisition
of assets unless the applicant has complied with state laws.<BR>
 
<P>
<U>7) Intercompany Transactions </U>
(Section 12).  This section was intended to limit transactions
between various affiliates within the holding company system.
 For example, section 12 (a) states that RHC's may not borrow
or receive any extension of credit or indemnity from any system
utility company.  Additionally, the SEC was given rule-making
authority over a large number of other affiliate transactions,
such as use of loans, payments of dividends, and disposal of assets.
<BR>
 
<P>
<U>8) Service Company Regulation </U>
(Section 13).  This section of the Act regulates contracts between
operating companies and service companies.  For example, Section
13 (b) states that service, sales, and construction contracts
between system companies in the same holding company system must
be performed &quot;economically and efficiently for the benefit
of such associate companies at cost, fairly, and equitably allocated
among such companies.&quot; <BR>
 
<P>
<U>9) Reports and Accounts </U>
(Sections 14 and 15).  These sections require RHCs to file routine
reports and keep record in accordance with the SEC's requirements.
<BR>
 
<P>
 <U>10) Exemptions since PURPA</U>.  There
are two main ways that these restrictions under PUHCA have been
alleviated since its passage.  First, under the Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, &quot;qualifying facilities&quot;
under that Act were exempted from PUHCA.  Second, The Gas Related
Activities Act of 1990<a href="foot.html"><sup>67</sup></a>
 allows gas utility holding companies to
seek exemption from PUHCA for certain activities including gas
transportation, storage and acquisitions related to gas supply.
Third, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 amended PUHCA in order to
create an exemption for exempt wholesale generators, which are
essentially facilities devoted exclusively to the generation of
electricity exclusively for sale on the wholesale level.  This
act also created an exemption for foreign utility companies, which
allows an RHC to own a foreign utility.  However, numerous aspects
of these transactions are still regulated by the SEC.

20, 1995 Restructuring Decision:  Orders retail wheeling and poolco
market structure starting Jan 1998.  All customers would be eligible
by 1999, or by 2003 if there are technical problems.  Bilaterals
will be allowed, but at the beginning, all IOU's will be required
to buy and sell all their power through the Power Exchange, which
would gradually become a voluntary spot market.  Transmission
system operated by an independent system operator (ISO) according
to information from bilaterals and Power Exchange.  Both ISO and
Power Exchange should be FERC-regulated, independent of transmitters
and generators.  100 percent of stranded costs allowed to be recovered
through a non-bypassable (i.e. paid by all customers) competition
transition charge (CTC), but at a lower rate of return.  SCE and
PG&amp;E required to file plans to voluntarily divest themselves
of at least 50 percent of their fossil generation to a non-affiliated
entity because of market power concerns. <BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Massachusetts </B></CENTER>
<P>
On May 1, 1996 the Department of Public Utilities
(DPU) issued draft restructuring rules.  The rules envision implementation
of retail wheeling beginning 1998, a Power Exchange as a market
for short-term power sales, an ISO, separation of generation,
transmission and distribution into distinct corporate entities
and stranded costs recovery over ten years through a non-bypassable
access charge. 
<P>
Following DPU's request of August 1995, the
Division of Energy Resources and five (5) utilities have filed
their own restructuring plans, all of them presuming retail wheeling
and most of them proposing the separation or divestiture of generation
assets as the right way to mitigate market power and calculate
stranded costs. 
<P>
A number of bills on retail wheeling for manufactures
and municipal aggregation of loads are pending but not expected
to pass before DPU's final general rules, which are scheduled
for September 1996.  The company-specific orders are to be issued
February and March 1997.   
<P>
DPU imposed the first retail stranded costs
tariff on MIT who built a PURPA 20MW cogeneration facility and
hence departed from Cambridge Electric Light Co.  The tariff provides
for recovery of 75 percent of associated stranded costs. <BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>New Hampshire </B></CENTER>
<P>
The Public Utility Commission issued final
guidelines for a two-year retail wheeling pilot program (starting
May 1996) and applicable to about 50MW.  Participation is open
to any supplier who in turn must obtain NEPOOL membership or contract
with a NEPOOL member.  Utilities, except for individually negotiated
plans, will be allowed to recover 50 percent of stranded costs.
 
<P>
Both House and Senate passed a bill requiring
the PUC to order retail wheeling by June 1998 for all customer
classes.  The bill is expected to be signed by the Governor. 
It leaves the decision over the degree of unbundling to the PUC.
 It also instructs the PUC to assure recovery of nonmitigatable
stranded costs through a time-limited charge to all customers.
 
<P>
On June 6, 1995, the PUC ruled in the Freedom
Energy case that the utility franchise granted to Public Service
of New Hampshire was not exclusive on a permanent basis. <BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Rhode Island </B></CENTER>
<P>
The Electric Industry Restructuring Collaborative,
established by the PUC and comprised of broad spectrum of stakeholders,
issued an interim progress report, reaching consensus on most
issues, but not on a stranded cost recovery mechanism.  
<P>
A retail wheeling bill was introduced in the
House with New England Electric System's support and is expected
to pass.  The bill calls for gradual implementation of retail
wheeling starting in 1998, functional unbundling into separate
affiliates, and stranded costs recovery by 2009.  
<P>
Subsidiaries of Eastern Utilities Associates
filed a restructuring plan calling for retail wheeling for all
customers starting 1998.  It also contained a recovery of nuclear
stranded cost that would extend until all current obligations
are satisfied.<BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>New York </B></CENTER>
<P>
In December 1995, an administrative law judge
(ALJ) issued a decision in the Public Service Commission's competitive
opportunities case recommending that PSC initiate wholesale competition
through a pool with an ISO and then add retail wheeling as soon
as possible.  Following the decision, the PSC approved a restructuring
plan which calls for creating a wholesale pool in 1997 and implementing
retail wheeling in 1998. While the PSC's plan envisions a system
operator consisting of member utilities and a &quot;green surcharge&quot;
to fund renewable programs, it does not deal with stranded costs
recovery.  
<P>
The PSC is also in the process of reviewing
company-specific restructuring proposals filed by Niagara Mohawk
and Long Island Lighting and ordered remaining five of state's
utilities to file their plans. The New York Power Authority has
proposed becoming an ISO and take over other utilities' transmission.
<BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Illinois </B></CENTER>
<P>
The Commerce Commission approved a retail wheeling
pilot programs for Central Illinois Light and Illinois Power.
 Both programs are designed primarily for large loads.  Commonwealth
Edison proposed a long-range restructuring framework, consisting
of a five-year rate-freeze for its customers and experimental
five-year retail access starting 1998.  There are several legislative
proposals pending, including those of the Coalition for Consumer
Choice and Central Illinois Public Service.  All proposals presume
some sort of retail wheeling.

<p>
<h1><center>The Center for Political Renewal</center></h1>
<p>

The purpose of the Center for Political Renewal is to examine the revolutionary
changes now underway in American politics and develop the principles and the
agenda that will guide the next majority political coalition. Big Change may lead
to a revolution in American governance and civic affairs.<p>

The work of the Center for Political Renewal consists of two related endeavors:
The work of Foundation distinguished Senior Fellow <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Weber">Vin Weber</a> on his book, The New
Majority; and the work of the Center itself in developing a set of principles and
an agenda to guide the next successful political coalition to produce a
(peaceful) revolution in American governance and civic affairs.<p>

In The New Majority, Weber looks at the current political upheavals from a
historical perspective and outlines the principles of an emerging majority
coalition -- which may be a "new" Democratic party, a "new" Republican party or,
conceivably, a new party by a different name. <p>

Weber's work is reinforced by other Center activities. For example, in November
1994, the Center sponsored a major post-election poll whose stunning results were
reported in <a href="http://www.wsj.com">The Wall Street Journal</a>. Among its findings were that "a tidal wave
of voter discontent with government in general, and <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/thomas.html">Congress</A> in particular, was
responsible for the loss of dozens of incumbent Democrats who failed to heed the
warning signs." The study found that by nearly 15 to 1, Americans believe the
Federal government is "much too big and has too much power."<p>

<title>Cyberspace and the American Dream -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>



<h1><center>Cyberspace and the American Dream</center></h1>
<p>

The driving force behind the Big Change now happening in America is the
information revolution. PFF has led the way through its Cyberspace and the
American Dream project in exploring the consequences and the direct policy
implications of this revolution.<p>

The Foundation not only dedicated two major conferences to this topic, but it has
published "<A HREF="/pff/position.html">A Magna Carta for the Knowledge Age</A>." This Magna Carta became the
centerpiece of a wide-ranging debate in The Internet and throughout the media
about whether the information revolution was better defined by the metaphor of
"an information superhighway" or the much freer metaphor of "Cyberspace."<p>

But the Foundation's efforts in Cyberspace are by no means limited to vision.
Policy change is taking place in Washington, in state legislatures, indeed, in
governments around the world, as policymakers attempt to understand the
consequences of the move from an analog to a digital world and its impact on
regulatory policy. PFF is actively involved in the telecommunications policy
debate in Washington and around the country, focusing its efforts on the next
generation of telecommunications deregulation. <p>

For example, the Foundation will be offering in May 1995 a complete plan to
abolish the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</A>. In addition, PFF is offering in
conjunction with <A HREF="http://www.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</A> an eight-week seminar on
Telecommunications for Capitol Hill staffers. The goal is to educate
"non-experts" about the Information Revolution and the impact action in <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/thomas.html">Congress</A>
will have in enhancing or hindering its arrival.<p> 

Earlier in the year, PFF, in conjunction with <a href="/townhall/clubs_groups/cse/cse.html">Citizens for a Sound Economy</a>, <a href="/heritage">The
Heritage Foundation</a>, <a href="gopher://gopher.seattle.wa.us:70/11ftp%3AGopher%3A%20%20Seattle%20USA%20Yellow%20Pages%3AInternational%20Affairs%3ADiscovery%20Institute%3A">The Discovery Institute</a> and the <a href="gopher://nuinfo.nwu.edu:70/00/graduate/dissertation/Hudson%20Institute">Hudson Institute</a>, hosted a
congressional seminar on "Updating the Communications Act: The Free Market
Approach." Held in the Capitol Building on January 31, 1995, In excess of seventy
Members of <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/thomas.html">Congress</A> as well key staff and media, including <a href="http://www.wsj.com">The Wall Street
Journal</a> and <a href="http://ibd.ensemble.com/">Investor's Business Daily</a>, attended the seminar.<p>

<title>Senator Bill Bradley Profile</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<img src="discussi.gif">
<hr>
<blockquote>
<font face="arial"> 
<center>
<img src="bradley.gif" align="left">
<h1>Senator Bill Bradley</h1>
<h2>A Profile</h2>
</center>
Bill Bradley is the senior U.S. Senator from New Jersey. A Democrat, he was elected to his third term in 1990. From the day he arrived in the Senate in 1979, Bradley has devoted himself to building a more secure future for Americans by creating a strong and growing economy, providing new educational opportunities, and bridging the gaps between people of different races and nations. He serves on the Senate Finance Committee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and the Special Committee on Aging.
<P><br>
<b><center>Tax Relief, Economic Priorities and Deficit Reduction</center></b>
<br>
Senator Bradley is widely known as the author of the proposed Fair Tax, which eventually becarne the Tax Reform Act of 1986. His tax reforms were based on the principle that people of equal incomes should pay equal taxes. Despite a widespread belief that special interests would prevail, Bradley succeeded in sharply reducing tax rates for all Americans by eliminating most corporate and individual loopholes-in the tax code. It required taxpayers who had avoided paying taxes to pay their fair share, gave tax relief to families, and insured that six million low-income working people would pay no federal tax.
<p>
As a member of the Finance Committee, Bradley has continued to fight for fair tax policy, honest budgeting, and economic policies that enhance competitiveness and growth.
<p>
Bradley has centered his attention on the federal government's debt and deficit crises. He believes that the United States will not be able to compete in the world economy in the next century without significant reductions in both. The first, and most important step that can be taken on the road back to fiscal responsibility, is to dramatically reduce unnecessary government spending.
<p>
Bradley believes that the government spends too much taxpayer money, and often for the wrong purposes. To bring reason to our spending priorities, he has proposed two principles to guide all federal funding decisions: one, the proposal must be in the general interest and essential to public life; and two, taxpayer funding must be the most cost-effective way to finance the proposal.
<p>
Bradley's actions follow these principles. In 1994, the bipartisan Concord Coalition ranked Bradley third among all Senate Democrats for his anti-spending votes. And in the 103rd Congress alone, he offered amendments to appropriations bills that would have saved nearly 600 million taxpayer dollars.
<p>
Bradley is the author of the enhanced line-item veto proposal, a measure which grants the President authority to remove wasteful spending from both appropriations and tax bills. He is also an advocate of major budget reform, which would remove many of the obstacles Congress has erected to real spending reductions.
<p><br>
<b><center>A National Rebellion Against Crime and Violence</center></b>
<br>

In 1994, Senator Bradley issued a call to arms - against the crime and violence that are ravaging our lives and our neighborhoods. In a compelling speech, Bradley demanded a national rebellion against violence, a new commitment by individuals, communities and government against the destruction that is threatening our democratic freedoms.
<p>
Bradley breaks through the clutter of anti-crime rhetoric by arguing that there is no single, simple solution to our crisis of violence. No political posturing will solve it, and no progress will be made unless we all make a contribution. The answers lie closer to home than to Washington, D.C. When only 5% of all crimes are federal crimes and the federal government controls just 13% of the crime-fighting resources, local communities must actively engage in the rebellion. Bradley knows they can -- he has spent many hours in New Jersey communities, hearing about and working with local residents who are involved in their neighborhoods to stop the violence.
<p>
Bradley has successfully fought for innovative new measures to help the federal government assist these efforts. He wrote legislation, adopted in the 1994 Crime Bill, to greatly expand community policing and to help put 100,000 new police on the street nationwide. These community policing forces can forge valuable ties to the neighborhood residents they serve and detect trouble before it turns into crime. The Crime Bill also includes Bradley's Community Schools program, a bold new venture that encourages schools to stay open after hours, on weekends, and all summer to help community leaders provide at-risk children a safe place to learn and play.
<p>
Bradley has also emerged as an advocate of tough, common-sense gun control. He is the author of new legislation which will stop the flow of illegal handguns. By requiring national handgun ID cards, registration of private handgun transfers, greatly increased gun dealer licensing fees, and a limit on purchases, Bradley believes gun violence can be markedly reduced.
<p><br>
<b><center>Race and the American City</center></b>
<br>

Senator Bradley has been described as one of the most eloquent and prophetic speakers on the issue of race relations in our country. He has established himself as a serious voice in the national dialogue on racism, pluralism, and discrimination. Senator Bradley has criticized both political parties and challenged every American to confront the reality of racial prejudices by asking each of us, "When was the last time you talked about race with someone of a different race? If the answer is never, you're part of the problem."
<p>
From a socioeconomic standpoint, he has stressed that by the year 2000, only 57 percent of the people entering the workforce will be native-born whites. In his keynote speech at the 1992 Democratic Convention, he reiterated his strong conviction that "we will all advance together, or each of us will be diminished."
<p>
Senator Bradley sees a critical link between tense race relations and the decay of American cities. He advocates significant national investment and increased personal responsibility in order to halt the deterioration of urban America. Inspired by "leaders of awareness" in churches, schools, businesses, and neighborhoods, Bradley believes we can rebuild our urban communities.
<p>
Bradley's vision for renewal is unique. It is based on successful initiatives designed by local communities themselves. Their leadership is behind Bradley's eight-point Urban Community-Building Initiative, a comprehensive assault on the three crises plaguing urban America: joblessness, violence, and family disintegration. His goal is to expand ideas already working at the local level and help city residents help themselves with programs that provide police, jobs and job training, crime prevention, banking services, and family support.
<p>
Bradley has been remarkably successful in turning this vision into reality. Virtually all of his Urban Community-Building Initiative was enacted into law in 1993-94. Three components - Community Policing, Community Schools, and Community Banking - were approved either in full or more broadly than originally drafted. Four others - Entrepreneurship Training, Mobility for Work, Individual Development Accounts, and Residential Parenting Centers, were included in legislation creating Urban Empowerment Zones.
<p><br>

<b><center>Education: Investing in People</center></b>
<br>
Bradley believes that a college education is invaluable. But he also knows that the cost of higher education has exploded out of reach for too many families.
<p>
In response, Bradley has designed a new way to pay for college. Available at the beginning of the 1994 school year, Bradley's Self-Reliance Loans give all students, regardless of age or income, the chance to borrow money directly from the federal government. Self-Reliance Loans also give students the option of repaying their loans based on income they earn after they graduate.
<p>
The program was available at several colleges in New Jersey and throughout the nation in 1994, and dozens of others will participate in 1995 and beyond. Bradley's initiative will help families who don't qualify for traditional financial aid, and students who cannot afford huge monthly loan repayments immediately after graduation. By eliminating the expensive and unnecessary role banks play in student loans, the program saves taxpayer money. ' And, in an economy that demands highly skilled workers, the program offers everyone the opportunity to go back to school for the training they need to compete in the labor market.
<p>
Senator Bradley has also worked for years to improve elementary and secondary education through the Family-School Partnership Act, and programs for Gifted and Talented students. He hosts several annual events in New Jersey to honor the achievements of young students. Thousands of New Jersey high school students have participated in events such as High School Leadership Seminars and Student-Athlete Conferences over the last 14 years.
<p><br>
<b><center>The Health and Well-Being of Families</center></b>
<br>

Bill Bradley is deeply concerned about the burden of health care costs on America's families. He supports national health care reform that would reduce costs, increase coverage, and ensure quality care for every American.
<p>
Calling domestic violence "America's dark litle secret," Bradley has launched a major effort to respond to the tragedy of spousal abuse. It is a social sickness, and women and children are its most common casualties. Bradley has spoken out forcefully on the need to confront domestic violence, and to make sure its victims get the help they need: protection, counseling, and education about their rights.
<p>
Bradley believes we need comprehensive welfare reform that promotes personal responsibility, and has spearheaded the overhaul of child support collection in New Jersey and the nation. And for families caring for disabled and elderly relatives at home, he is seeking to expand a successful New Jersey project that offers respite services to family caregivers.
<p><br>
<b><center>Rethinking American Leadership</center></b>
<br>
Senator Bradley believes that American leadership in the future will depend more on our economic productivity and the force of our values, rather than on our military might.
<p>
Bradley is a leading proponent of international free trade. He was one of the champions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, working tirelessly in 1993 to ensure passage of a plan he defined as a "historic moment" on America's path toward global economic growth. He advocates an open trading system worldwide, and co-authored the report that served as the blueprint for the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which Congress passed in late 1994.
<p>
Bradley, well known as an expert on the former Soviet Union, considers investing in people and the values of democracy the best way to build lasting security and peace in the post-cold war era. Based on these principles, he authored and passed the 1992 Freedom Exchange Act, the largest U.S. educational exchange initiative in history. Already, more than 10,000 "Bradley kids" have come to the U.S. from the former Soviet Union to study and absorb the lessons of freedom, democracy, and a market economy.
<p><br>

<b><center>Protecting the Environment</center></b>
<br>

Bradley entered the Senate in 1978 with a strong commitment to protect the environment. In 1980, he helped draft the Superfund toxic-waste cleanup bill. Since then, he has pursued legislation to track medical waste in our oceans, prevent oil spills, restore and preserve beaches, rivers, and wildlife, and ban toxic lead from the environment. Most recently, Bradley secured passage of the South Jersey Wild and Scenic River Act. This landmark legislation will protect a 35-mile stretch of the Maurice River and its tributaries, guaranteeing that future generations can enjoy the waterway in its current pristine condition.
<p>
As chairman of the Water and Power Subcommittee, Bradley also passed the Omnibus Water Bill of 1992, the most important piece of water legislation in a generation. The bill's most significant component requires a major overhaul of the nation's largest water project, the Central Valley Project of California. This law cuts wasteful subsidies to agriculture special interests, redistributes water resources to city residents who suffered a seven year drought, and protects endangered wildlife.
<p><br>
<center><b>Scholar, Athlete, Author</b></center>
<br>
Before his successful Senate race in 1978, Bill Bradley had achieved distinction in academics and athletics. He was born on July 28, 1943, in Crystal City, Missouri, the son of Warren and Susan Bradley. In 1965, he graduated from Princeton University with honors in American history. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University, where he earned a graduate degree after studying politics, philosophy, and economics.
<p>
As an undergraduate, Bradley was a three-time basketball All-American and won the Sullivan Award as the country's outstanding amateur athlete. In 1964, he was captain of the U.S. basketball team that won the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.
<p>
After returning from Oxford in 1967, Bradley joined the New York Knicks and played professional basketball for ten years. In 1970 and 1973, the Knicks won the National Basketball Association championship with Bradley as a starting forward. Bradley's book about his decade with the Knicks, <i>Life On The Run</i>, was published in 1976 to wide acclaim.
<p>
Bradley served in the Air Force Reserve from 1967 to 1978, attaining the rank of first lieutenant.
<p>
Bradley's second book, <i>The Fair Tax</i>. was published in 1982 and helped popularize the ideas that eventually became the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
<p>
Bill Bradley and Ernestine Schlant were married in 1974. Ernestine Schlant Bradley is a professor of German and Comparative Literature at Montclair State College. The Bradleys have one daughter, Theresa Anne, and Mrs. Bradley has an adult daughter from a previous marriage. The family lives in Montclair, New Jersey.

<h2>David Gelernter, Ph.D.</h2>
<img src="gelernte.gif" align="left">
Professor of Computer Science
<p>
B.A., Yale University, 1976 
<p>
Ph.D., The State University of New York at Stony Brook, 1982 
<p>
Joined Yale Faculty 1982
<p>
David Gelernter's research interests include parallel programming, software ensembles, and artificial
intelligence. The coordination language called "Linda" that he developed with Nicholas Carriero (also
of Yale) sees fairly widespread use world-wide for parallel programming. 
Linda and its central idea, called "tuple spaces", is the basis for the "JavaSpaces: extension to Java recently outlined by JavaSoft; the goal of JavaSpaces is to "unify and simplify," according to JavaSoft
's presentation at JavaOne -- Specifically to unify object storage and inter-program communication, as in Linda.
Gelernter's current research interests include adaptive parallelism (the "Piranha" system runs parallel
programs by grabbing idle workstation cycles, releasing machines when their owners need them),
programming environments for parallelism, realtime data fusion, and expert databases. He is
co-author of two textbooks (on programming languages and on parallel programming methods),
author of Mirror Worlds (Oxford: 1991) and a forthcoming book about how thinking works (Free
Press).

Gelernter is a recipient of a Presidential Young Investigator Award (1986).

<h2>Jerry J. Jasinowski<br>
President National Association of Manufacturers</h2><p>
<img src="jasino.gif" align="left">


Jerry Jasinowski is president of the National Association Manufacturers and one of the nation's most frequently quoted authorities on the economy and the vital role manufacturing plays in America.
<p>
He has addressed audiences across the country -- from The Commonwealth Club of California to the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. -- in his role as:
<ul>
<li>an economist who can assess the rapid changes creating a new economy 

<li>an astute analyst of the impact of federal policies on business 
</uL>
<ul>
<li>an articulate spokesperson on the importance of modern manufacturing to technology, productivity, international competitiveness and economic growth, and how to improve the living standard of America's workers co-author of <i>Making It In America: Proven Paths to Success from 50 Top Cornpanies</i> (Simon & Schuster, March 1995) 

<li>industry's "most powerful advocate on Capitol Hill," according to <i>Washingtonian</i> magazine
</ul><p>
Under Jasinowski's  leadership, the NAM has beein hailed as Wasington' s most influential and respected business group, helping to shape national policy on a broad range of issues from taxes to trade. He is currently calling for a national strategy to boost economic growth by dramatically downsizing and reforming government, particularly in the areas of taxes, regulations and legal burdens, and by encouraging private sector educational improvements, technological programs and export expansion.
<p>
Jasinowski is widely quoted in the media and has appeared on almost every major national network and public affairs program, including ABC's 
<i>Good Morning America</i>, NBC's <i>Today</i> and 
<i>Meet the Press</i>, CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> and <i>Moneyline</i>, John McLaughlin's 
<i>One on One</i> and the evening network news shows. His opinion editorials have run in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, <i>Harvard Business Review</i>, and other major publications.
<p>
Jasinowski became president of the NAM in January 1990, after serving as the association's executive vice president and chief economist for ten years. The NAM is the largest broad-based industrial trade association in the United States. Its more than 13,500 member companies, including approximately 10,000 small firms, are in every state and account for roughly 85 percent of U.S. manufactured goods.
<p>
A one-time factory worker, Jasinowski joined the U.S. Air Force as intelligence officer serving in the Far East in the mid 1960s. He went on to become assistant professor of economics at the U.S. Air Force Academy. In the early 1970's, Jasinowski came to Washington to manage research and legislative activities for the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. In 1976, he served as director of the Carter Administration's economic transition team for the departments of Treasury, Commerce, Labor, the Council of Economic Advisors and the Federal Reserve. He later was appointed assistant secretary for policy at the U.S. Department of Commerce.
<p>
A native of LaPorte, Indiana, Jasinowski received his B.A. in economics from Indiana University, his master's degree in ePonomics from Columbia University, and is a graduate of the Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program. He serves on the board of directors for Phoenix Home Life and Atwood Richards.
<p>
Jasinowski has three children and resides in Washington, D.C. with his wife, vice president of government relations for The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company.

<title>Biography: Alvin Toffler</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<img src="discussi.gif">
<hr>
<p>
<h2>Alvin Toffler, Ph.D.</h2>
<p>

Alvin Toffler, Ph.D., is one of the world's preeminent futurists.  As
the co-author of War and Anti-War, Dr. Toffler sketches the emerging
economy of the 21st century, presenting a new theory of war and
revealing how changes in today's military parallel almost precisely
the changes now taking place in business.

<p>
<img src="toffler.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>
<p>

Along with his wife and co-author Heidi Toffler, Dr. Toffler describes
their latest book as a suprising departure from their past work--one
made necessary by the new dangers that confront America and the world
at the edge of the 21st century.  These include tens of thousands of
tactical nuclear weapons in the strife-torn former Soviet Union and
what they call "the civilianization of war," the spread of civilian
products and technologies that can be converted to military use.  In
War and Anti-War, the Tofflers picture the runaway proliferation not
merely of weapons, but of advanced technologies with which to make
them.

<p>

This is not the first time the Tofflers have created controversy in
high places.  In 1988, when the Tofflers drove through the high red
walls fo the Zhangnanhai compound in Beijing for a meeting with Zhao
Ziyang, then China's Communist Party leader and the man behind its
dramatic economic reforms, it was an important moment.  And when Zhao
was later ousted by hardliners during the Tiananmen Square events, it
stirred deep memories for the Tofflers.  Consequently, their
best-selling books, including Future Shock and The Third Wave have
been banned in the People's Republic of China.

<p>

In Powershift, the final book of the trilogy which begins with Future
Shock and The Third Wave, the Tofflers focuses on the power struggles
to come--in business, in politics, and in global affairs--as a new
"system of wealth creation" clashes with today's vested power blocs.
In its central thesis, the Toffles propose that power is shiftein from
its traditional basis in violence and wealth toward a new dependence
on knowledge, and especially "knowledge about knowledge."  This shift
in the nature of power, the Tofflers suggest, is about to touch off
tremendous upheavals in existing power relationships as individuals,
companies and countries scramble for control of the new knowledge
resources.

<p>

In a first step toward the legalization of organized democratic
dissent in the Soviet Union, the Tofflers met with Mikhail Gorbachev
and other Western intellecuals such as Arthur Miller and James Baldwin
to launch the Issyk-kul Forum, the first citizen-initiated
non-communist, non-governmental organization to be permitted in the
country since the 1917 Revolution.  The efforts of the Tofflers and
their colleagues have made huge headlines in Pravda, Izvestia, and
Literaturnaya Gazeta as a milestone in the history of perestroika.

<h2>Michael Vlahos</h2>
<img src="vlahos.gif" align=left>
<blockquote>
While our lives move inevitably from future to past, Vlahos,
                         a senior fellow at the Foundation, has tried to march in a
                         different direction. From Bronze Age archaeology,
                         Byzantium, and British imperial history at Yale University, he
                         moved to foreign relations and modern war at the Fletcher
                         School of Law & Diplomacy. As Director of Security
                         Studies at Johns Hopkins-SAIS, he widened his view to
                         take on war and society. So broadened, he was asked to
                         turn the State Departments Center for the Study of Foreign
                         Affairs into a real, long-range think tank. He did. Its theme
                         became -- and, in 1988, just in time -- world change.
                         Vlahos was then commissioned to help turn the U.S. Navys
                         rangefinders toward Big Change, while at the Center for
                         Naval Analyses. In the Foundation, he has found a place
                         that not only sees the ongoing transformation of American
                         life -- the Big Change -- but that actively seeks to be a part
                         of it. Now Vlahos writes, in print and in the ether, about
                         where we are going and how we will get there.

<p align="right">				August 4, 1996</p>
<p><br>
<h2><center>Welcome To Aspen 1996</h2></center>
<p>

Dear Aspen Summit '96 Participant:
<P>
Welcome!  We are glad you could join us in Aspen  a much more comfortable venue in August than Atlanta, where PFF held its first <i>Cyberspace and the American Dream</i> conference in 1994.
<P>
Since then, the Digital Revolution has kept up its frantic pace:  Java, Netscape, Windows 95, the Communications Decency Act, the debate over encryption and intellectual property, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pat Buchanan and the rise of the "New Luddites" -- all in three years.
<P>
It's hard keeping up, and even harder to keep it all in perspective.  During the next two days, we hope you'll learn something about what's happening and is about to happen as a result of the Digital Revolution.  But even more importantly, we hope this two-day "breather" will give you, and us, a chance to step back and gain some perspective on the promise and the peril of our times.
<P>
That, of course, is our main theme -- reminding ourselves that America's continued progress in the Digital Revolution is not something to take for granted.  From Al Toffler's opening speech, "Future Shock in the Present Tense," to our closing debate on whether "growth of the Internet is a 'Leading Cultural Indicator' of American progress," we want to remind ourselves that great civilizations sometimes choose paths leading to decay -- even, or perhaps especially, in a digital world.
<P>
A second theme of this year's conference is "theory vs. practice."  We are delighted at the number and quality of representatives attending this year from America's leading technology companies, and confident that their participation will 
ensure a healthy mix between the thinkers and theoreticians and the doers and practitioners.
<P>
The Progress & Freedom Foundation has grown up with the Digital Revolution.  It's in our blood, and because you are here, we know it's in yours too.  
<P><center>
Sincerely,
<P></center>
<pre>
	Jay Keyworth					Jeff Eisenach
	Chairman 					President
</pre>
<P>
P.S.  Next year's conference will be held here at the Ritz-Carlton Aspen in late July or early August.  As you can imagine, it's a popular spot, and we're booking early.  If  you would like to go ahead and pre-register for next year, please talk with Katherine Epler.

<FONT FACE="Arial">Pressure for the development and introduction
of AFVs is driven by two goals.  One relates to efforts to reduce
the importation of oil especially from the Persian Gulf, discussed
more fully below.  The more binding goal relates to mobile-source
emissions, which is another way of saying emissions from autos,
trucks and buses.  Simply stated, many U.S. cities have not met
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), first put
forward in the 1970 Clean Air Act and subsequently revised and
raised.<sup><a href="end.html">9</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The problem fundamentally relates to ozone,
which falls into two categories.<sup><a href="end.html">10</a></sup>
 The first is found in the upper
atmosphere; this is good ozone that protects the population from
intense sun rays that cause skin cancer.  There is also a lower
atmospheric or terrestrial ozone, which is produced by a complex
reaction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), like hydrocarbons, in the presence of sunlight.  It is
this lower atmospheric ozone that yields smog, which in turn causes
respiratory and other health problems as well as damage to agricultural
crops.<sup><a href="end.html">11</a></sup>  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Ozone is produced each day, rising with the
amount of sunlight and falling to low levels at night.  There
is little if any sustained accumulation from one day to the next,
although ozone can travel as far as 100 miles from its source.
Heat and light being necessary for ozone reaction, the levels
produced follow seasonal patterns; the worst periods occurring
in the spring and summer. The amount of ozone produced results
from the production of the ozone-related emissions, atmospheric
conditions and natural background levels of VOCs.  Population
density, ozone concentration and ozone movement determine the
extent to which ozone production is a health problem. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The ozone creation problem is inherently local,
with wide differences across cities. Chilton and Boemer point
out: </FONT>
<P><blockquote>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Ozone's real-world chemistry is even more dynamic
than this, however - VOC-NOx ratios can change throughout a single
day.  Ratios also vary by metropolitan area and can differ within
portions of an individual city.  Further, the relative amounts
of VOCs and NOx in the air are linked to the location and size
of their sources and the movement of air masses.  VOCs originate
most from vehicle emissions, chemical and petroleum refining companies,
industrial solvents and natural vegetation.<sup><a href="end.html">12</a></sup>  </FONT>
</blockquote><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Continuing with their discussion, Chilton and
Boemer indicate that trees and other vegetation are significant
sources of background VOCs, and, of course, urban vegetation varies
significantly across metropolitan areas.  Indeed, the National
Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Science estimates
that background levels of ozone are of &quot;comparable magnitude&quot;
to man-made VOC emissions and that complete elimination of man-made
sources could leave enough VOC sources to produce smog.
<sup><a href="end.html">13</a></sup>  Finally,
the NRC indicates that solutions to local ozone problems must
be custom-tailored to solve local problems.<sup><a href="end.html">14</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The variation in ozone levels and conditions
across cities can be seen in other ways.  Since passage of the
CAA, ozone levels have changed dramatically in a number of cities.
 Jones and Adler indicate that it &quot;is difficult to identify
a significant air pollution problem outside California.&quot;
<sup><a href="end.html">15</a></sup>
 From 1992 to 1994, the reduction in ozone above allowable levels
for the rest of the nation fell by 57 percent.  For California,
the reduction was 27 percent.  From 1988 to 1990, the years reflected
in the CAA mandate, the nonattainment regions totaled 85, with
40 marginal.  Using 1992-94 data, the total was 18 with 12 marginal.
<sup><a href="end.html">16</a></sup>
 Even so, the 1988-90 data continue to define the problem, and
the various control regions, even those that are cleaner, must
follow the CAA prescription.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial">To address the nonattainment and other vehicle
emissions problems, the CAA set tighter emission standards for
the national auto fleet, to be fully achieved by the 1996 model
year.<sup><a href="end.html">18</a></sup> 
The standard for exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons was
cut from the previous standard of 0.41 grams per mile (gpm) to
0.25 gpm and the standard for nitrogen oxides, from 1.0 gpm to
0.4 gpm.  Emission limits for carbon monoxide remained at 3.4
gpm.<sup><a href="end.html">19</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Breaking with the national scheme, the statute
set stricter hydrocarbon emission standards for a California pilot
program (0.125 gpm) - in effect establishing two standards to
be met by auto producers.<sup><a href="end.html">20</a></sup>
  Along with defining specific metropolitan
and California attainment challenges, the statute took one more
step toward decentralized control by establishing a northeastern
state ozone control region required to reach beyond the national
baseline standards.  In addition, the 1990 law ordered auto firms
to provide cleaner, if not zero, emission automobiles, and mandated
the sale of reformulated, cleaner-burning gasoline.  The CAA also
addressed truck and other vehicle emissions and required EPA to
focus on emissions from boats, farm equipment, lawn mowers, and
construction machinery.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">While forcing attention on alternative fuels,
but not requiring their use, the 1990 CAA ordered cleaner-burning
gasoline to be marketed in cities that failed to meet NAAQS for

carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone.<sup><a href="end.html">21</a></sup>
   Starting in 1992, 39 nonattainment
areas were required, during part of the year, to use oxygenated
fuels, that blend oxygenated compounds with gasoline.  The intent
here was to reduce hydrocarbon and CO emissions which are a weaker
but still significant smog precursors.<sup><a href="end.html">22</a></sup>
  Reformulated (cleaner-burning)
gasoline, a distinct gasoline product not to be confused with
oxygenated gasoline, adds yet one more dimension to the clean
air arsenal. Mandated for the country's nine worst ozone areas
starting in 1995, a two-phase program calls for a 15 percent reduction
in volatile organic compounds beginning in 1995, and a 25 percent
reduction beginning in 2000.<sup><a href="end.html">23</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Under the CAA, ozone nonattainment areas are
to develop state implementation plans (SIPs) to achieve 15 percent
ozone reductions in areas classified as moderate, serious, severe
and extreme ozone  nonattainment areas.  The statute requires
a Clean Fuel Fleet program for operators of 10 or more centrally
refueled vehicles in these areas.<sup><a href="end.html">24</a></sup>
  However, the law does not mandate
the use of any particular fuel but simply requires that California
emission standards be met.<sup><a href="end.html">25</a></sup>
  Beginning in 1996, the nonattainment
areas are required to show an additional three percent reduction
each year until the attainment goal is achieved.  Failure to accomplish
these goals can lead to losses of federal transportation funds
and stiff emissions offset requirements from existing polluters
when new stationary sources seek approval.<sup><a href="end.html">26</a></sup>

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Ozone Transport Region</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Air pollution is not a national problem in
the sense that a well-specified set of pollutants is uniformly
affecting every citizen across all 50 states.  Air pollution is
a decidedly local and regional problem.  Recognizing this, the
CAA sets national baseline standards that must be achieved throughout
the nation, but then sets different standards for California,
22 urban areas, and 12 northeastern states.  Reaching from northern
Virginia, including the District of Columbia, and extending to
Maine, these 12 states form the Ozone Transport Region.
<sup><a href="end.html">27</a></sup>  Cooperation
across part of this region developed in 1967, when nine of the
12 states formed the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use
Management, which continues to operate.<sup>
<a href="end.html">28</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The CAA effectively establishes for the 12-state
region an environmental cartel managed by the Ozone Transport
Commission.  The Commission consists of state governors, the EPA
Administrator, EPA regional administrators, and state air pollution
control officers.  Like all cartels, gaining agreement among diverse
groups is not always easy.  The Commission is charged with the
difficult task of determining a <I>uniform</I> strategy for dealing
with ozone pollution in the 12-state region.  By statute, the
Commission may select to meet its goals by adopting California
standards and California vehicles or by adopting some other clean
fuel strategy - but the Commission may not settle on a technology
that requires the auto industry to produce a third vehicle type
for the U.S. market.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In 1994, the Commission attempted to require
the use of California low emission vehicles (LEVs) as a major
component of its ozone reduction scheme.  The LEVs would have
been electric vehicles.  However, no agreement could be reached
across the 12 states, and the U.S. auto industry filed suit in
those states that had already adopted the LEV rule, arguing that
an LEV for the northeast would be a third car.
<sup><a href="end.html">29</a>
</sup>  In brief, the
argument turned on the notion that because of differences in climate,
requiring colder starts and requirements for energy-using heaters,
a northeastern LEV would be different from a California LEV.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The industry is seeking to persuade the Commission
to adopt a cleaner-fuel approach and has committed itself to provide
a National Low Emission Vehicle (NLEVs) that would satisfy the
ozone reduction requirements of the Northeast Ozone Transport
Region.<sup><a href="end.html">30</a></sup>
  This salvo by the auto industry advanced the prospects
for some AFVs in the large northeastern market, but practically
eliminated the prospects for electric cars in that region.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Energy Policy Act of 1992</FONT></B></CENTER><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Energy security, a motivating factor behind
the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), is a second force pushing
for alternative fuel vehicles.<sup><a href="end.html">31</a></sup>
  EPACT, passed in the wake of the
1990-91 Gulf War, is a prime example of crisis-borne legislation.
 Since 1951, petroleum supply lines from the Gulf have been disrupted
13 times, with the largest supply shortfall occurring during the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August-October 1990.
<sup><a href="end.html">32</a>
</sup>  In each case,
the U.S. economy was seriously affected.  After declaring an energy
crisis at hand the Congress responded by passing legislation that
sought to buffer the economy from future oil shocks.  The Gulf
region now provides about 50 percent of U.S.-consumed crude oil,
a share that is predicted to rise to 60 percent over the next
10 years.<sup><a href="end.html">33</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As described by the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE), EPACT &quot;was enacted to stimulate the research, development,
and accelerated introduction of technologies that can potentially
shift the focus of national energy demand away from imported oil
and toward renewable or domestically produced energy sources.&quot;
<sup><a href="end.html">34</a></sup>
 EPACT requires DOE to promote alternative fuels that reduce consumption
of gasoline and diesel fuel and to determine the feasibility of
meeting EPACT requirements of replacing 10 percent of all petroleum-based
motor fuels by the year 2000 and 30 percent by 2010.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Of course, EPACT was not born an orphan.  Its
legislative parents were the Alternative Motor Fuel Act of 1988
and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  These were then strengthened
by executive orders issued in 1991 by President Bush and in 1993
by President Clinton.<sup><a href="end.html">35</a></sup>  Both executive orders accelerated the purchase
of alternative fuel vehicles for the federal government's vehicle
fleet.  President Clinton's order called for 1993, 1994 and 1995
purchases of 7,500, 11,250 and 15,000 AFVs, respectively.
<sup><a href="end.html">36</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The definition of alternative fuels turns on
the effort to reduce reliance on imported petroleum products.
 These include methanol, ethanol, mixtures containing 85 percent
or more by volume of alcohols with gasoline, natural gas, liquefied
petroleum gas, hydrogen, coal-derived fuels, electricity and anything
else that is clearly not petroleum.  Reformulated gasoline and
innovative fuels such as mixtures of water and petroleum-based
naptha, that may be cleaner than the fuels just mentioned, do
not receive EPACT's blessing.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EPACT's goals for replacing gasoline are ambitious
but currently unattainable.<sup><a href="end.html">37</a>
</sup>  In 1993, the total number of vehicles
that were part of a public or private fleet, was approximately
13.5 million - less than 10 percent of the 190 million vehicles
on the road. Among the 13.5 million fleet vehicles, only 550,000
were in the federal fleet, where EPACT has the greatest leverage.
 Thus to accomplish EPACT's goal, the private fleet must be affected
more significantly.  In 1994, DOE estimated that all of EPACT's
efforts would lead to a reduction of 400,000 barrels of gasoline
per day consumed in the year 2010, about five percent of the total
but nowhere near the 30 percent targeted by EPACT.  Speaking to
the fundamental energy security goal and neglecting the definition
of alternative fuels, the U.S. General Accounting Office indicates
that eight percent of the total gasoline consumed can be reduced
through the use of nonpetroleum-based oxygenates in gasoline.
<sup><a href="end.html">38</a></sup>
 In addition, the 4.3 cents fuel tax added by the 1993 Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act raised the already high hurdles to be
jumped by producers of AFVs and fuels, since the uniform increase
across fuels yields a disproportionate increase in the price of
some alternative fuels.  For example, a 4.3 cents per gallon increase
for CNG, which sells at approximately 90 cents a gasoline equivalent
gallon, is a distinctly larger increase in price than 4.3 cents
on gasoline that sells for $1.15 gallon. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">CAFE Standards: A Companion to EPACT</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EPACT's energy security goal is shared by the
1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act, which established corporate
average fuel economy standards (CAFE) for the U.S. passenger car
fleet beginning in 1978.<sup><a href="end.html">39</a>
</sup>  By statute, firms providing vehicles
to the U.S. fleet must meet an average CAFE for their new car
fleets that accounts for the mix of models produced and sold in
a given year.  A firm that fails to achieve the standard is fined
$50 per mile per gallon per car produced.  Firms may earn credits
in years when they exceed the standard that can be applied to
penalty years.  The CAFE standard has been raised over the years
and is now set at 27.5 mpg for model years 1985 and beyond.  CAFE's
goal relates directly to reducing the importation of crude oil
and petroleum products. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">CAFE's history is controversial.  Auto producers
struggled to meet the rising standard.  For instance, at times
the declining relative price of gasoline made larger and heavier
cars more attractive to consumers; yet to meet CAFE standards,
the auto producers made smaller cars not wanted by dealers or
consumers.  CAFE also had the effect of encouraging foreign producers,
which typically provided smaller, more fuel efficient cars, to
increase the average size of the cars they sold in the United
States.  Thus while domestic producers reduced the sizes of their
standard vehicles, foreign producers scaled up, resulting in an
average vehicle sold in America that was smaller, lighter, and
therefore less crashworthy.  At the margin, fuel economy is substituted
for passenger safety.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The fatality effect of CAFE was estimated by
Crandall and Graham for the 1989 fleet.<sup><a href="end.html">40</a></sup>
  Their analysis shows
that CAFE is associated with 2,200 to 3,900 excess occupant fatalities
per year.  Crandall and Graham also estimated the number of excess
serious injuries triggered by the lighter cars derived from CAFE,
finding 11,000 to 19,500 additional serious injuries in 1989.
 If a value of $1 million is assigned to each life lost and $20,000
is assigned to each serious injury (the values used by Crandall
and Graham), CAFE's adverse safety cost carries a price tag of
approximately $1.9 to $3.4 billion over the life of a given model-year
car.  Put simply, the avoidance of imported oil carries a high
price.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Since EPACT and CAFE share the same goal, it
seems logical to consider the relative merits of substituting
AFVs for CAFE.  In fact, auto producers receive a credit against
their CAFE obligation for each AFV they produce and sell.  Instead
of raising CAFE to higher levels and generating more excess fatalities
and injuries, CAFE could be eliminated.  Efforts made by auto
producers to achieve the current CAFE or even higher future standards
could be diverted to the design and production of AFVs, which
have a safety record that is superior to that of the national
fleet.<sup><a href="end.html">41</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Infrastructure Problem</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Those charged with promoting AFVs recognized
immediately that any significant move to fuels other than gasoline
requires a new fuel distribution system.  DOE's program, like
that in the CAA, first focuses on fleet operators where centralized
refueling and maintenance is cheaper.  The program combines education,
voluntary commitments from alternative fuel suppliers to build
distribution facilities, and requirements for alternative fuel
providers and other federal and state fleet operators to expand
the number of AFVs.  The Department of Energy's March 27, 1996,
announcement of purchase requirements to be met by alternative
fuel providers spells out the fleet requirements.
<sup><a href="end.html">42</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Referring to EPACT, the rules mandate purchase
of AFVs by state and local governments, fuel providers, and related
petroleum and chemical companies.  Some 10 percent of newly purchased
light duty vehicles for the affected fleets must be AFVs for model
year 1997.  The share rises in subsequent years, reaching 75 percent
for model year 2001 and thereafter.  To encourage accelerated
progress toward the ultimate goal, the rules include a system
of tradable credits that arise when a purchaser goes beyond the
minimum number required in a given model year.  These credits
can be applied in subsequent years to fill out a purchase shortfall,
or they can be sold to another fleet owner who fails to meet requirements.
  The DOE AFV initiatives also include a Clean Cities program
that promotes greater use of clean-fuel buses, a push for tax
incentives, state grants, and strategic efforts to locate the
placement of mandated federal AFVs.<sup><a href="end.html">43</a></sup> 
 Close to 50 cities have joined
the Clean Cities effort.  DOE's overall goal is to expand the
nation's AFV fleet from 421,000 vehicles in 1995 to almost 2.5
million by 2010.  Funding for the DOE effort has expanded from
$7 million in FY 1993 to $30 million in FY 1995, but funding for
future budgets is in serious doubt.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Among alternative fuels, compressed natural
gas (CNG) and electricity are the most ubiquitous.  These two
energy sources are supplied to nearly every home, business and
industry throughout the country.  The electricity available at
a home or business is ready to be used for charging an automobile
battery.  However, the natural gas delivered to a home or business
is at a much lower pressure than required for fueling a vehicle.
An investment of $500,000 or more in a compressor and related
equipment is required before a filling station can become a full-service
natural gas dispenser.  A home compressor unit requires an investment
of $5,000.  Liquid petroleum gas (LPG) - commonly known as propane
- is also widely available, with many refueling facilities located
near commercial users.  However, LPG does not compare with the
wide potential distribution of CNG, since natural gas is piped
to homes, industries and commercial establishments throughout
the United States.  Ethanol, which is typically produced from
corn, can be produced practically anywhere in America, blended
with gasoline and distributed across large regions.  Finally,
methanol, which is generally produced from natural gas, can be
made widely available.  According to DOE, there were 4,587 AFV
refueling stations in the nation's metropolitan areas in 1995,
a substantial increase from 1,398 in 1992.
<sup><a href="end.html">44</a>
</sup>  Of these, CNG had
1,078 stations, with locations in all states except Alaska, Maine,
and Mississippi.  In 1996, Maine is the last remaining state without
a CNG station.  Liquefied petroleum gas was available in 3,385
locations, with refueling stations lacking only in the District
of Columbia.  Blends of methanol and ethanol had 88 and 36 stations
respectively, but could be supplied from practically any filling
station.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In a country with more than 200,000 filling
stations, 4,587 alternative fuel stations looks rather pale, but
every state now has at least some refueling capability; some major
cities have a score.<sup><a href="end.html">45</a>
</sup>  In November 1995, <I>USA Today</I> reported
that four additional compressed natural gas stations were opening
each week.<sup><a href="end.html">46</a>
</sup>  As might be expected, concentration by state is associated
with the relative abundance of the fuel type.  California shows
a relatively large number of compressed natural gas and liquefied
petroleum gas stations, as does Texas and other gas-producing
states.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">When assessing availability, it is important
to focus on the fleets being targeted.  In the early stages of
entry, AFVs must be concentrated in locations with refueling capability.
 In some cases, these will be for fleets of trucks and light vehicles
that operate exclusively in particular metropolitan areas or regions.
 In other cases, the fleets may be a city bus system or vehicles
that support a major airport operation.  As fleets grow, and as
demand increases, refueling will grow simultaneously.  However,
in the early stages of market development the chicken and the
egg puzzle will always plague the supporting industry.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Just how large is the U.S. alternative fuel
fleet and what are its future prospects?  At the time of a DOE
1996 survey, there were some 421,000 AFVs in the U.S. fleet.
<sup><a href="end.html">47</a></sup> 
The 279,000 vehicles fueled by LPG account for the lion's share
of the total. With 84,000 vehicles, CNG stands in second place,
and vehicles using ethanol and methanol rank third and fourth,
with approximately 32,000 and 22,000 vehicles respectively.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">According to DOE, the gains experienced by
each vehicle type since 1992 show LPG vehicles have experienced
only small growth.<sup><a href="end.html">48</a></sup>
  Both methanol- and CNG-powered vehicles show
substantial growth, with CNG showing the more dramatic year-over-year
increases since 1993. However, there are expectations for the
1996 sale of ethanol-fueled vehicles to rise significantly, largely
due to General Motors' offering a bi-fueled pickup truck.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The composition of the AFV fleet is dominated
by the private sector, which owns some 342,000 of the total.
<sup><a href="end.html">49</a></sup> 
Most of the AFVs in the private fleet, some 265,000 vehicles,
are LPG-fueled vehicles.  CNG, with 38,000 vehicles, stands in
second place.  In 1996, state and local governments operated 42,000
AFVs.  CNG, fueling some 22,000 of these, was the dominant fuel
type in that fleet.  Of the total, heavy duty vehicles such as
buses accounted for the major share. Even with purchases of AFVs
for the federal fleet stimulated by presidential executive orders,
the numbers in the federal fleet are still rather small. According
to DOE's 1996 survey, there are 36,571 AFVs in the federal fleet,
with CNG vehicles accounting for 23,744 of that number.  Nonetheless,
growth has been impressive; there were just 3,360 AFVs in the
federal fleet in 1992.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">According to DOE, the propane-fueled fleet
component is the oldest and is the least likely to expand markedly.
 The agency predicts CNG to be the growth component of the AFV
fleet, partly due to price and low emissions.  This is in spite
of the lack of refueling infrastructure and the challenges presented
by the requirement for larger on-board fuel tanks.
<sup><a href="end.html">50</a>
</sup>  The methanol/gasoline
blend AFVs are primarily in California, and many are urban buses.
 Government purchases of additional blended-fuel vehicles should
increase the number by 10,000 units in 1996.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">State Regulatory Hurdles</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Thus far, the entry of AFV technology has occurred
despite old-style public utility regulation that affects the pricing
and distribution of natural gas.  The identical problem would
face electricity providers if electric cars became a significant
competing technology.  The central issue relates to the regulation
of prices charged by local distribution companies, which are set
by state public utility commissions.  Traditionally viewed as
a monopolist, the natural gas distributor usually had an exclusive
area franchise in which it operated.  There was no direct competition
from other providers in the sale of the product to typical residential
and commercial customers, although large users could contract
with gas marketers and have their gas shipped from distant points.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Public utility commissions engage in rate-of-return
regulation when setting prices.  Using a standard, but complicated,
approach, the regulatory body identifies an appropriate rate base,
determines what is to be included, and approves a pricing scheme
that yields some predicted rate of return to the gas distributor.
 Gas distributors and regulators engage in periodic struggles
when prices are to be altered.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The AFV market is different in significant
ways from the market for residential, commercial and industrial
gas.  Unlike the market for home-heating and industrial fuels,
CNG will compete head-to-head with gasoline and all other fuels
at the pump.  Of course, natural gas competes with electricity
in its monopoly market, but that competition ends when a customer
settles on a particular boiler or furnace technology. Competition
at the filling station is continuous, particularly for bi-fueled
vehicles, and the market turnover of automobiles occurs more frequently
than the turnover of home furnaces and industrial machinery.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The central problem here relates to incentives
for natural gas providers to assume a new market risk.  With traditional
rate regulation, there is no risk premium paid for the development
of a new market.  A conceptual solution to the problem lies in
separating the assets that serve the AFV market and allowing gas
providers complete freedom in setting price.  Alternately, gas
providers can be allowed to establish separate firms dedicated
to the AFV market.  These firms would buy natural gas from pipelines
or producers, paying the market price.  Then, they would sell
the gas to the AFV market at prices determined by market competition.
 Old-fashioned economic regulation applied traditionally to natural
gas providers will not work in the AFV market.  For the new technology
to enter, regulatory reform will be necessary.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Conclusion</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are distinct regional differences in
the ozone problem and differences in how people in various regions
are addressing the problem.  There are significant differences
in the availability of AFV fuels across regions as well as the
likely concentration of AFVs that could ultimately form viable
markets.<sup><a href="end.html">51</a></sup>  Given the differences in the air quality gap to be closed
and the regional options for closing it, logic suggests that the
instruments of control should be decentralized.  The success of
CAA and EPACT relies on actions to be taken by cities, states
and regions.  With NAAQS as a baseline, California standards higher
than the baseline, and with promises of cleaner fuel autos, logic
further suggests that city, state and regional control groups
should be given complete flexibility in determining incentive-based
rules for inducing technological change.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Yet this leaves a number of questions unanswered,
which will be addressed in following sections:  How can regions
that seek cleaner air make their desires known in the market place?
 After all, markets for air quality are few and far between. 
Should communities and regions consider modifying fuel taxes to
make cleaner-burning fuels more attractive?  Should subsidies
be provided to investors who build clean fuel filling stations?
 Or should consumers be given incentives to purchase cleaner cars
and fuels?  How would these incentives be calculated?  And where
might the zone of control be located?</FONT>

<TITLE>The Public Utility Holding Company Act -- PFF</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<CENTER><h2>II.  THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT </h2></CENTER>
<P>
PUHCA was enacted during the Great Depression
in order to address problems in an energy industry that had &quot;concentrate[d]
control of vast utility empires in a few hands, which led to deception
of investors, excessive rates for consumers, and obstruction of
state utility regulation.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup>  In order to address these purported
problems, the Act required the integration and simplification
of utility holding company systems into single &quot;integrated
public-utility systems.&quot; 
<P>
A holding company is any company which owns
the stock of another company.  PUHCA defines a utility holding
company as &quot;any company which directly or indirectly owns,
controls, or holds with the power to vote, 10 per centum or more
of the outstanding voting securities of a public utility.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup>
 For the purposes of the Act, an &quot;electric utility company&quot;
means any company which owns or operates facilities used for the
generation, transmission or distribution of electric energy for
sale, other than sale to tenants or employees of the company operating
such facilities for their own use and not for resale. <sup><a href="foot.html">4</a></sup> A &quot;gas
utility company&quot; is generally a company that owns or operates
facilities used to distribute gas at retail.<sup><a href="foot.html">5</a></sup> 
<P>
The holding company structure has always played
an important role in the utility industry.  In 1932, three holding
companies accounted for about half of the investor-owned electric
utility market.  In 1935, about 80 percent of the electric and
gas utility industry was controlled by holding companies.
<sup><a href="foot.html">6</a></sup>  With
PUHCA's enactment, more than 200 registered utility companies
- a large share of the utility industry - became subject to its
rules.<sup><a href="foot.html">7</a></sup> 
 In 1938, the 214 utility holding companies registered
under PUHCA controlled 922 utilities and 1,054 non-utility subsidiaries,
and often controlled other utilities through minority shareholdings.<sup><a href="foot.html">8</a></sup>
 
<P>
By 1952, the process of reducing the complexity
of utility cross-ownership and reducing the number holding companies
was largely complete.  And today, only 14 active holding companies
(11 electric and 3 gas) remain registered under the Act.
<sup><a href="foot.html">9</a></sup>  The
11 registered electric utility holding companies account for about
20 percent of investor-owned utility retail electricity sales.
  Many of the largest electric utilities and most of the gas industry
are not even regulated under the Act. 
<P>
Yet the holding company structure is clearly
valuable to utilities as they continue to organize this way despite
the substantial regulations imposed by PUHCA.  In fact, a number
of pending mergers in the energy industry would create new registered
holding companies. 
<P>
A utility holding company subject to PUHCA
is required to &quot;register&quot; unless it can qualify for
exemption under any of five statutory exemptions.
<sup><a href="foot.html">10</a></sup>  The two main
exemptions are for utility operations that are predominately in
a single state and holding companies that are predominately operating
utilities.  Collectively, these exemptions encourage utilities
to operate in single states and to maintain relatively simple
organizational structures. 
<P>
Under PUHCA,  registered holding companies
require SEC approval to issue or sell securities, acquire utility
or nonutility assets, sell utility assets or enter into service
arrangements with sister companies.<sup><a href="foot.html">11</a></sup>  
 PUHCA also imposes rules
on various intercompany transactions, record-keeping and accounts,
and contracts between operating and service companies.  There
are also both routine and transaction-specific reports which utilities
must file with the SEC. 
<P>
Perhaps the most important aspect of PUHCA
regulation is the &quot;integration requirement.&quot;
<sup><a href="foot.html">12</a></sup>  PUHCA
places a virtual ban on the acquisition of geographically distant
utility assets through the holding company form.  The effect of
this restriction is to keep both registered and unregistered utility
holding companies largely confined to one geographic area.
<sup><a href="foot.html">13</a></sup>   The
Energy Policy Act of 1992<sup><a href="foot.html">14</a></sup> 
weakened this restriction, by permitting
investments by registered and exempt holding companies in foreign
utility companies and exempt wholesale generators (EWG's), &quot;wherever
located.&quot;  PUHCA continues to affect the acquisition of other
systems, however, and while the integration requirement does not
apply to EWG's, other provisions of PUHCA do.  For example, when
acquiring an EWG, a registered holding company is limited as to
the amount it can invest. 
<P>
The integration requirement is subject to interpretation
by the SEC, which appears to have loosened its interpretation
of the requirement over time.  For example, the SEC recently approved
a merger where the utilities in question were part of the same
power pool rather than actually contiguous.
<sup><a href="foot.html">15</a></sup>  The SEC could, however,
change course at any time.  
<P>
Finally, PUHCA regulates the degree to which
a registered holding company can acquire non-utility assets. 
Thus, the Act restricts diversification by registered holding
companies into non-utility businesses as well as into other utility
businesses.

</B>
<P>
<i>by Alvin Toffler</i><BR>
</B></center>
<P>
Just how stable is the American political system?  To answer that
not insignificant question, it may be helpful to look back to
the early '90s when two brash personalities took center stage
in the American political theater.<BR>

<P>
Let me begin with a question:  What do Hillary Clinton and Newt
Gingrich share in common?  That question may seem amusing, but
is in fact vital to understanding the notion of future shock in
the present tense.<BR>

<P>
Let's start with Hillary Clinton.  That smart, tough First Lady
came to Washington hoping to make radical changes in the U.S.
health care system.  Hillary Clinton was slapped down.  Newt Gingrich
- who despite our political differences has been a personal friend
of ours for more than 25 years - came back to Washington as Speaker
of the House after the election of 1994 hoping to make even more
radical changes.  Brilliant, outspoken and imaginative, he envisioned
changes not just in health care and welfare but in American society
across the board, hoping, he said, to speed our transition to
a Third Wave information society.  Newt Gingrich, too, was quickly
slapped down, although some of his proposals were later adopted
and repackaged by President Clinton.<BR>

<P>
The way both of these people were treated reminded us of a conversation
in the White House with Lee Atwater, a political campaign operative
for President Reagan and later President Bush.  What he said to
us shortly after Reagan's first election was that &quot;you're
going to hear a lot in the days to come about the Reagan revolution.
 Don't believe a word of it.  If we Republicans are lucky,&quot;
he said, &quot;by dint of heroic effort we may push the system
5 degrees in one direction to compensate for the 5 degrees that
President Carter pushed it in the other direction.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Soon, both main political parties were engaged in the quadrennial
mindless race toward what can only be called the obsolete middle.
 What Atwater knew, what the treatment of Hillary Clinton and
Newt Gingrich suggested, then and now, and what each campaign
seems to reaffirm is that the American political system resists
any radical change.  The system itself, the structure of collective
decision making, the architecture of American politics, is itself
ultra stable.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>The End of Ultra-Stability<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The idea that the U.S. political structure is ultra stable should
in fact give pause to everyone, because by fueling a global shift
from a Second Wave smokestack society to a Third Wave knowledge-based
society, Americans are opening a path to tremendous benefits not
only for America but for the world.  The benefits will range from
higher standards of living, economic standards, to better health,
cleaner environment, etc.<BR>

<P>
But Americans -- and the populations of many other countries are
being battered by the very acceleration and the pace of life that
the knowledge revolution, instant communication and the Third
Wave of change bring with them.  Most Americans now feel hard
pressed, stressed out, upset with conditions in the country. 
Many are angry.  Most wish change would slow down and let them
catch their breath.  The Second Wave smoke-stack world that they
knew is vanishing as the Third Wave future invades every aspect
of American society today.  Daily life is suffused with higher
and higher levels of uncertainty and unpredictability.<BR>

<P>
This is not just true for individuals.  Businesses and giant corporations
are investing billions of dollars, sometimes even tens of billions.
 Essentially they are placing wagers on highly unpredictable outcomes.
 Many firms are caught up in incessant, traumatic orgies of restructuring.
 Many seemingly smart managers show all the signs of future shock
and run like lemmings after the latest management fad:  synergy,
core competence, total quality management, EVA, vertical integration,
re-engineering.  Some of these may be helpful, but, by and large,
most of these changes are made without any understanding of how
the resulting organization will fit into the fast-emerging economy
of the future, let alone the emerging social structure.<BR>

<P>
Meanwhile, the stress levels rise.  We call it future shock, which
is the distress and disorientation brought on by trying to adapt
to too much change at rates faster than people can handle.  We
also believe that, in fact, today's most disturbing social, cultural
and political developments can be traced precisely to this condition.
 Among these are the frightening fanaticism that we see in many
corners of society - racial and religious intolerance, the spread
of paranoia and conspiracy theories, anarchic terrorism, the purposelessness
and moral paralysis among so many young people - or the technophobia
 that was so perfectly symbolized by the Unabomber (whose Luddite
manifesto would have found many more supporters if its author
had not, it appears, punctuated his paragraphs with blood ). 
What we really see are two ways of life, two civilizations, in
collision.  One is the fading Second Wave industrial civilization.
 The other is its fast spreading Third Wave replacement.  The
collision of these two will result in enormous and politically
dangerous dislocations of various kinds.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Solidity and Flexibility of the Political System<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Against this turbulent background, should Americans want an ultra-stable
political system that focuses on the immediate and punishes the
change makers?  Or do countries undergoing such profound, high
speed change need a political system that anticipates social change
and mitigates its  accompanying turmoil and social conflict? 
Do we want a political system that in all its basic structures
was designed for the past to remain unchanged?  Or do we want
one that changes in sync with the changes in society?  Indeed,
is the political system in America really as stable today as it
was when Lee Atwater suggested that it was?  Is the American political
system ultra-stable or even stable?  Does the ultra-stability
of our pre-digital system provide the modicum of order and predictability
that society needs? Or by its obsolescence does it contribute
to <I>disorder</I> by suppressing needed changes and essentially
creating the conditions for a possible explosion of violence in
the future?<BR>

<P>
At a time when all our industrial era institutions, our Second
Wave institutions are in crisis -- the school system, the justice
system, the legal system, the family system, the health system,
the value system, and the energy system, not to mention the welfare
system (which has neither been ended as we know it, as President
Clinton now claims, or replaced with adequate safeguards for the
helpless, as the Republicans claim) -- do we want our political
system to be stable or do we want it to be flexible?  Do we want
it to stay as it is or do we want it to change?<BR>

<P>
In 1996 politicians of both parties were busy congratulating themselves
about welfare reform legislation that finally passed the Congress
and made its way to the White House.  But are the changes that
we celebrate today really as important as they appear in a media/political
system that focuses intensely on now and not tomorrow? And the
larger question is, are we capable of creating new replacement
systems for those that are in crisis if the overloaded political
decision-making apparatus is not itself dramatically and perhaps
constitutionally improved?<BR>

<P>
When the Industrial Revolution launched a Second Wave of change
in history roughly three centuries ago, political systems were
transformed.  Monarchies toppled; &quot;divine right&quot; went
out the window; modern nations were formed; mass political parties
were organized.  In country after country, politics eventually
came to reflect the industrial order.  Politicians began to speak
in terms of machine analogies: they spoke of checks and balances,
political machines, of railroading legislation, steamrollering
a bill, capturing the state machine.  Trotsky talked about the
flywheel revolution.  All of these metaphors reflected the industrial
Second Wave technologies of that era.<BR>

<P>
Vast social dislocations followed the arrival of industrial civilization
on the planet.  Conflicts and even wars resulted from the clash
between the old First Wave agricultural elites and the rising
urban industrial Second Wave elites.  That is the historical background
we should not forget as we now go through a process of transformation
from a Second Wave to a Third Wave civilization.  Today, everything
is caught up in this vortex of transformation - our economic,
social and cultural systems are essentially up for grabs.
<P>
<CENTER><B>The Economy of the Future<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
What the United States has is not an economy.  What the United
States has are two economies or a bisected economy, with remnants
of the old Second Wave, mass production, bigger-is-better, assembly-line
economy of the industrial age, and alongside it, the rising and
rapidly growing Third Wave economy.  Our economists chattering
away on C-SPAN and CNN and in the newspapers constantly talk about
the future of the economy.  I think it is time to stop talking
about the <U>future of the economy</U> and start talking about
the <U>economy of the future.<BR>
</U>
<P>
Talking about the <U>future of the economy</U> implies a continuation
of the economy as we have known it.  Talking about <U>the economy
of the future</U> implies something dramatically different.  It
is an economy in which we will be compelled to redefine the fundamental
concepts that we have lived with since Adam Smith, Karl Marx and
the Industrial Revolution.  All the fundamental terms of economic
thinking now require radical redefinition.  What is productivity
in an information-based or knowledge-based economy?  What is property
and what is capital as they go from tangible to intangible?  Money
itself is subjected to a new law as it becomes informationalized
and as information becomes monetized.  The nature of work changes.
<BR>

<P>
We are moving into a world in which for many the job may no longer
be the primary source of income.  We are moving into a world in
which the faster the rate of change, the more complex the society,
the more information must be generated, stored and transformed
into knowledge, the more information must be exchanged and the
more competitive the global economy becomes.  We are creating
an economy with less and less room for uneducated or less skilled
workers.  Indeed, even highly skilled workers can have the wrong
skills at the wrong place at the right time and find themselves
vulnerable.  We may be moving from a economy based on employment
to one in which we do not have employees but have in fact &quot;entreployees&quot;,
some cross between entrepreneur and employee.<BR>

<P>
Everyone talks about symbol manipulation or knowledge work, but
little has been done to categorize its forms.  There is more to
mind work than just computer data.  Not all knowledge is or must
pass through our digital technology.  Face to face communication
remains vital, as well.  What is really interesting is that one
can build a typology of knowledge work.  People work at different
levels of abstraction, from the data entry clerk to the research
scientist to the financial planner or the corporate strategist.
<BR>

<P>
You have different functions going on inside companies that in
the past were regarded as essentially wasteful and unproductive.
 Some people in companies bring  information from the outside
world into the firm.  Other people are paid to take information
from inside the firm and export it.  Then you have people that
are essentially like relays; they internally carry information
from one part of the firm to the other.  Then you have those that
are creative, the people who come up with crazy ideas, one out
of ten of which is really powerful and useful. Then you have another
team of people who say, &quot;Wait a minute; that will not work,&quot;
who essentially filter the creative ideas as they are raised.
All of these knowledge processes are going on inside every organization,
but have never been mapped, categorized and or valued very highly.
<BR>

<P>
In fact, in the Second Wave, the assumption was that there were
two fundamental sources of added value, one was physical or manual
labor and the other was capital.  Ideas, people who dealt with
this information and knowledge, were regarded as paper pushers,
pencil pushers, who were unproductive and provided no value added.
We now know the reverse may very well be coming true.  These are
just a handful of the changes that the economy is going through,
and if you look at them closely they are not incremental changes
but in fact are transformatory.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>The New Role of the Family in Society<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
If all that was happening was a shift from a manual labor economy
to a knowledge based economy, that would be pretty revolutionary.
 But at the same time, we are also transforming the social structure
as deeply as the economy.  <BR>

<P>
Take the role of the home, once the center of society.  There
were exceptions, of course, but, as a rule, in First Wave agrarian
civilizations around the world, the typical family structure was
an extended family with multiple generations living under the
same roof.  Grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins and sometimes
non-blood relatives identified as relatives were brought into
the households.  These large households were the center of work,
with the family serving as a production team, going out together
to work in the fields or in the cottage itself.<BR>

<P>
The family had a lot of fundamental functions in such societies.
 The family not only did the work, the family took care of the
health of its members.  If you were sick, there was no place else
to go.  The family educated the children because for most people
there were no schools.  The family took care of the sick and the
elderly because there was no was no state welfare; there was no
external support.  The family also was indeed a media system,
so that if the state or the church wanted to communicate with
the children and form that new generation, it had to do it through
the family.  The family was a transmission link in communication
from the powers that be or were.<BR>

<P>
With the Industrial Revolution family structure changes.  Family
size shrinks, and, instead of a big household with a lot of people
all living together, the nuclear family becomes the norm.   In
the United States that was defined that as:  mother stays home,
father goes to work, two children under the age of 18.   The nuclear
family, thus, became the Model T, the standard family form and
everybody was expected to grow up into that.  You're going to
get married, you're going to have kids, you're going to live in
house with a white picket fence.  You are going to grow up in
a nuclear family, and, in turn, you are going to create a nuclear
family.<BR>

<P>
In industrial society, the old, fundamental functions of the family
are stripped away from the family.  Work is no longer done in
the household, it is done somewhere else, in a factory or an office
that operates like a factory.  Notice that education is no longer
regarded as the task of the parent primarily but now is assigned
to a school, a mass education system designed for mass production
society. Health now goes to the doctor in the health delivery
system.  Care of the elderly goes to the state and, as far as
the family serving as the critical media in society, they now
have competition from the mass media.  All the fundamental social
functions that the family filled in First Wave societies have
now been taken away from them.  The family is reduced.  The relationship
is reduced essentially to procreation and psychological support
and some consumer functions as distinguished from producer functions.
<BR>

<P>
 When we were researching Future Shock in the mid-sixties, we
asked every expert we could find, &quot;What is going to happen
to the nuclear family system?&quot;  They said, with great assurance,
&quot;Nothing.&quot;  But we said that was not plausible because
there were too many other changes happening in society.  And in
fact, what has happened is that the nuclear family, defined precisely
in the terms of the Census Bureau, now describes  less than 5
percent of the population.  A major reason is that most women
now work, which immediately shatters the definition of nuclear
family.<BR>

<P>
However, there are even more fundamental changes in family structure
occurring with the arrival of the Third Wave of change.  Some
people do not like these changes, and we are not arguing that
they are necessarily good, but they are happening and they are
fundamental.   What is happening is not the death of the family,
but the emergence of multiple family styles:  single parents,
childless couples, once remarried, twice remarried, etc.  We have
gone from a homogenous family structure to a heterogeneous family
structure.  We have done this with enormous pain and traumatic
emotional agony in society, but this is not unrelated to the other
changes in the world around us.  Family is not an independent
variable; it is related to how we work; it is related to technology;
it is related to communication; it is related to the other parts
of the social system; it is a component to a larger system.  When
you change all those other components you change the family as
well.<BR>

<P>
In 1980, in The Third Wave, we wrote about the electronic cottage.
 Apart from encouraging smaller work units, apart from permitting
a decentralization and deurbanization of production, apart from
altering the actual character of work the new production system
is shifting literally millions of jobs out of factories and offices
into which the Second Wave swept them right back where they came
from originally - the home.   This strange idea was ridiculed
after we wrote it by the establishment media like The New York
Times and The Economist. The New York Times ran a page one article
dismissing the whole notion as merely &quot;visionary.&quot; 
Of course, The New York Times today is filled with articles about
people working at home.<BR>

<P>
It is not just work that is returning to the home. Health care
is as well.  When our daughter needed intravenous antibiotics
a couple of years ago, she did not get them in the hospital. 
She got them at home.  Many processes that we once thought had
to be done in the doctor's office can now be done at home: electronic
blood pressure measurement, pregnancy testing, HIV testing, etc.
<BR>

<P>
We are now beginning to see shopping at home and banking at home
and building communities from home.  We are going to see (or hear)
broadcasting from home; we are going to be publishing from home;
we are going to be organizing political protests from home.  In
short, the home is becoming a more important place -- or will
become a more important place -- than it has been for the last
couple of hundred years.  That last bastion holding out against
the Third Wave -- education -- will increasingly reenter the home,
at least partially, and despite the bitter resistance of Second
Wave educators who operate the compulsory cognitive labor factories
that we still call schools.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Demassification of Society<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
At a still deeper level, the social structure itself is being
transformed by the digital revolution. Cyberspace is a part, but
only a part, of the Third Wave because there are other things
happening on the planet, such as demographic shifts.  It is not
just technology driving this whole thing.  There are convergent
forces that are making this tremendous transformation happen.
 The Third Wave is breaking up the Second Wave mass society into
which most of us were born.<BR>

<P>
The Second Wave society was based on mass production, mass consumption,
mass education, mass media, mass entertainment, mass recreation
and weapons of mass destruction.  The Third Wave is breaking that
mass up and society is becoming more internally differentiated.
 We coined the term demassified to describe the new society because
there was no simple word in the English language to explain the
idea.  <BR>

<P>
Demassification creates a much higher complexity in the social
system and creates much higher rates of information exchange.
 (In fact, we would argue that the reason we are having an information
revolution is because higher social diversity requires the exchange
of more and more information among the units or people or institutions
in that society.  Thus we begin to see more and more differences
within the society itself in lifestyles, in marriages, in religions
and among the generations.)<BR>

<P>
We see differentiation at every level.  For example, think of
production.  We have gone from the concept of mass manufacturing
to the concept of mass customization.  With the help of information-based
technology, we reduce the cost of introducing variety into the
output of the production process.  It used to be very expensive
to change anything about a product.  The information revolution
reduces the cost of diversity and so we get mass customization.
 But mass customization is only a halfway step toward full customization
on demand.  In fact, when customers want full customization, our
future cyber-based production system will be able to provide that
probably at the same cost as a mass product because of the intelligence
imbedded within the production process itself.<BR>

<P>
It is not just manufacturing that is demassifying.  There are
more different kinds of insurance policies today than ever existed.
 There are more forms, more instruments for investments; even
real estate title searches are becoming more and more customized
and so on.   The message to business: If your company's product
line is not increasingly demassified or your technology does not
cut the cost of customization, get ready for a competitor whose
products do and whose technology will.<BR>

<P>
In markets we now hear not just about mass marketing.  When we
researched Future Shock in the 1960's and talked to the visionary
marketing people at that time, they talked about &quot;market
segmentation&quot;.  The mass market actually could be seen as
having several segments.  Later they began talking about niche
marketing and boutiques.  Today if you query  them, they talk
about &quot;particle marketing&quot;.  And what is a particle?
 You are a particle; every individual is a particle and the idea
is &quot;one-to-one&quot; marketing.  Talk individually to each
customer. Interactive technology will allow the establishment
of an ongoing relationship, a continuing dialogue, between customer
and company.  Companies may find themselves selling things to
that customer that they never previously thought about.  They
may service that customer in ways that that customer needs once
the customer tells them about their need.<BR>

<P>
All of these changes -- and all social processes -- produce additional
social consequences. In effect, we have a positive feedback loop.
 More and more change producing more and more change.  My oldest
friend is Dr. Donald F. Klein, who is the world's most eminent
psychopharmacologist.  In <I>Listening to Prozac</I> seventy pages
are devoted to him because of contributions in psychopharmacology.
 Don is always asked, &quot;Does such and such a drug have a side
effect?&quot;  His answer is very simple.  He shrugs and says,
&quot;No side effect, no central effect.&quot;  That is true in
social terms as well, except it is much harder sometimes to trace
the side effects.<BR>

<P>
We see the side effects of demassification in increased individuality
and personal freedom in the society.  We can now engage with the
society around us more as individuals than we ever could before.
 On the other hand, there are negative by-products or side effects.
 The epidemic of loneliness in America is directly related to
demassification.  Everybody or almost everybody is lonely in America
or complains of loneliness, and that is because in the old world
you knew the people who grew up with you.  You had a lot of information
about your next door neighbor.  You did not even have to discuss
it with them,  You all got up at around the same time in the morning,
you all went to the same place to work on the assembly line, you
knew what the next family was going to watch on television because
there were only three channels, etc.  There was a lot of tacit,
implied, shared knowledge.  Now you do not know very much about
your neighbors, or the girl next door, or the boy next door. I
believe that contributes to the loneliness that describes America.
<BR>

<P>
With the personal freedom has come an enormous outbreak of antisocial
behavior - a kind of 'anything goes' culture.  But even these
changes still are not the whole story.  Along with economic and
social changes, there are also profound cultural changes transforming
life at deep levels like epistemology and at shallower levels
like pop culture.  In Future Shock, we said America was going
to build a multichannel society, which is exactly what has happened.
 We went from a world of mass media to one which is increasingly
demassified.  We are obviously moving toward an infinity of channels.
 While there is a lot of redundancy in the programming and a lot
of programming that's hardly worth talking about, if you look
closely, you begin to see this diversity, good or bad.  <I>The
New York Times</I> reports about niche music radio stations. 
For example, the article lists radio stations that specialize
in the following kinds of music: blue grass, contemporary Christian,
zydeco, dance-hall, salsa romantica, tejano, tropical, not to
mention banda for rural Mexico and banghra from India.  And that
is just the beginning.  When the Internet and the cyber revolution
fully develops, the possibilities become truly infinite.<BR>

<P>
Clearly we are now en route to an infinity of channels or ports
into the home and eventually perhaps directly, who knows, into
the brain.  Add to all of this the unbelievable variety of symbols,
images, sounds and ideas made available by the Net.   In addition,
digital broadcast satellites and automatic translation, which
will eventually bring into American homes on-line information
and broadcasts from Nigeria or Brazil or China or Malaysia, will
introduce further cultural diversity.  Soon you will get programs
transmitted by the Ayatollah in Iran, neo-Nazi's in Idaho, or
broadcast by the Vatican or fundamentalist preachers like Pat
Robertson - who is indeed one of the pioneers of satellite broadcasting.
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Violence, Alienation and Politics<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Not so long ago, the world's sole surviving super power was paralyzed
for weeks on end by a small group of paranoid conspiracy fantasists
and I believe racists calling themselves Freemen.  The government
was unable, because of political realities, to use force against
them.  While we want to underscore that we are not saying that
we should have used force - it is wonderful that we were able
to resolve that situation peacefully - at the same time, the spectacle
of the government unable to deal with a tiny, private para-army
calling itself a militia is disconcerting.<BR>

<P>
On the one hand, you see the government politically unable to
exercise force in that situation, while force and violence, such
as the Atlanta Olympic bombing, run pretty free in the streets
of the country.  It is troublesome because one of the defining
characteristics of a government or a state is its ability to impose
a monopoly of violence.  Violence is supposed to be monopolized
by the state so that people cannot just run around killing each
other.  What we are supposed to have is an orderly society where
only government-licensed police and the military apply violence.
 What we see today is that government offices are bombed, government
agents are threatened with their lives and there is a lot of violence
in the society.  Something is happening to the monopoly of violence.
 In fact, competition in the society is breaking down monopolies.
 State violence is one of the monopolies that is breaking down,
and not just in the United States. Ask the Japanese how they feel
now that their very orderly society, so stable since World War
II, is suddenly facing a terrorist sarin attack in its subway.
<BR>

<P>
Meanwhile, our political life in America is also experiencing
the side effects of demassification.  We see two political parties
playing their usual, ritualized games and politicians in private
denounce the polarizing rhetoric that they feel compelled to use.
 Huge sums are spent on elections, but larger and larger percentages
of Americans are resentful, alienated and cut off from any sense
of enfranchisement.  They are so cut off that they have come to
despise members of the entire political class, whether Democratic,
whether Republican, whether elected officials or the media around
it.  No one any longer feels represented in America by our pseudo-representative
government -- not only inner-city black youths, but also small
business people.  There are even super millionaires out there
who once made huge political contributions to this or that party
but refuse now to even take their phone calls.  Even they complain
that they feel unrepresented.<BR>

<P>
One evening not long ago we found ourselves sitting next to an
elderly millionairess, a grande dame and an intimate friend of
one of  this nation's living First Ladies.  This is a woman with
strong ties to the world of the White House, telling us she was
so disgusted with both political parties that she almost voted
for Ross Perot - until she concluded that he was a flake.  The
tenor of her remarks, made from deep inside the &quot;establishment,&quot;
made us think of the bitter alienation among the French aristocracy
 before their revolution.  Something is truly not right, not stable,
when the richest and most powerful members of society no longer
believe in the system in which they prospered.<BR>

<P>
This widespread mood of disaffection can be heard on talk radio,
where it ranges to actual hatred for the system.  Remember, we
are not living in Weimar Republic after a decade of horrible hyperinflation
that destroyed everybody's lives and then ultimately produced
a Adolf Hitler.  We are not living in a post-Gorbachev Moscow
after the collapse of the Soviet empire and the disintegration
of its economy.   By most measures, we are living in the most
competitive and affluent society in the world.  Americans have
lower unemployment rates than the Europeans.  Yet there is this
tremendous upwelling of hatred toward the system.  Why?<BR>

<P>
This profound and growing distrust and hatred makes one wonder,
as the television drones on with the reports of the political
pollsters and the ritual of campaigning, if, in fact, Americans
can get through the next decade or two without some kind of political
crisis.  Indeed, can the United States escape the next decade
or two without a constitutional crisis?  What we say about America
can be doubled for other countries.  Political disaffection is
not an American characteristic alone; it is true in Italy, in
England, in Japan.  It is true throughout the so-called developed
and affluent world, not to mention the countries in which people
cannot express their hatred for the government.  In short, the
question we would like to leave on the table is, can we have cyber-revolution,
a digital revolution, a social revolution, a cultural revolution,
an epistemological revolution, a biological revolution, combined
simultaneously with upheavals in the biosphere, the technosphere,
the sociosphere, the psychosphere and the infosphere, without
equally dramatic accommodative changes in the political structure?
<BR>

<P>
How we answer that question will determine whether the Third Wave
will bring positive changes.  The Third Wave can literally raise
billions of people on the planet out of poverty.  It can raise
the species to a whole new evolutionary level; it can lead us
to the stars themselves.  But can the Third Wave do so if the
leader in this global revolution -- the United States -- has collective
decision-making processes both in corporations and in the public
sphere that are slow, sclerotic, and sick?   If the internal political
system clanks and grinds and misfires, overwhelmed by the speed
and complexity of the problems that it sets out to solve, can
we get through the next period ahead without substantial unnecessary
pain?<BR>

<P>
It is time to divert some of the astonishing creativity and innovativeness
in the United States, especially the creativeness that is being
poured into technology,  to the political sphere.  We must, if
we want anything resembling a decent and democratic future.  The
time has come to recognize that both political parties in their
present form remain parties of the past, despite the rare Al Gores
and Newt Gingrichs in their ranks.  We need launch a civilized
ten or fifteen year public democratic discussion of what a democracy
in the twenty-first century under Third Wave conditions ought
to look like.  We are not advocating crash therapy, because the
attempt to impose crash therapy on the Russians has been disastrous.
 We are not talking about rapid instantaneous change.  We are
talking about a discussion that takes into account all the new,
democratic potentials that the cyber revolution produces.<BR>

<P>
We are not talking about just instant push-button voting, because
that is truly a vulgarization of the concept that cyber technology
can help us politically.  There are enormously creative ways that
we can use to re-vivify, restructure and redesign our democracy
for the twenty-first century.  It is time for Americans, whether
they are Netizens, citizens on-line or off, to organize themselves
not into armed pseudo-militias or fanatical political or religious
movements, but in cyber-based Committees or Correspondence to
lay the basis for peaceful political transformation.  Some of
that is already happening, mostly on the Net.  But we need to
bring the distributed intelligence and imagination in American
society together to simulate future democratic alternatives. 
We must envision together and discuss in civil terms, not for
a day but for a decade or more, how to take advantage of these
new tools for democracy.<BR>

<P>
If we fail to do this, we lose our human rights, we lose our privacy
.  We lose even the pretense of popular participation in political
life if we allow intolerance and violence to explode.  If we remain
so focused on the technologies of the Third Wave, we will be abdicating
our intellectual and political and human responsibilities building
a better society.  The time to begin this debate and this process
of learning together is now, not when perhaps it becomes too late.

<B><FONT FACE="Arial">III.  ECONOMIC INCENTIVES FOR THE PRODUCTION
OF CLEANER AIR</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Air quality is a classic case of economic externalities
and the tragedy of the commons:  no one owns it, so no one wants
to pay to keep it clean.  Finding reliable incentives that encourage
people to treat air quality with owner-like concern is the crux
of the environmental challenge.  Air quality is a valuable asset,
but its price is zero.  People who want more clean air logically
feel more should be provided, without paying for it.  Those who
use air quality in manufacturing or in transportation tend to
think in terms of rules and regulation instead of having to confront
a monthly bill that accounts for their environmental use.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Were it not for transaction costs, solving
the problem would be simple.<sup><a href="end.html">52</a></sup>
  Property rights to defined elements
of the atmosphere could be placed in the hands of owners, be they
environmental organizations or private entrepreneurs.  These owners
would predictably recognize the value of alternative uses and
manage their asset to maximize its value.  Lovers of cleaner air
and people who wish to produce goods and services would compete
for use of the valuable rights.  In theory, the market process
would yield an effective and efficient outcome.  Taking another
theoretical approach, and assuming information and transaction
cost are negligible, wise politicians seeking to serve the public
interest could calculate taxes and fees to be imposed on individuals
who use the scarce atmosphere.<sup><a href="end.html">53</a></sup>
  Following this prescription, campers
who build fires and drivers of automobiles would receive bills
that reflect the cost they impose when consuming the environment.
 But, alas, the costs of such approaches are high.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Were it not for transaction costs, we could
rely on common law rules that endow environmental rights to all
property owners and offer protection when those rights are violated
against the owners' will.<sup><a href="end.html">54</a></sup>
  But while common law works well for
pollutants with a known, and readily controllable, source, the
rule of law faces severe challenges when the problem has to do
with millions of small emission sources that collectively produce
unwanted smog.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Assuming transaction costs are negligible,
we can imagine a community that sets a continually monitored baseline
for air quality.  The community could reward activities that improve
baseline conditions and penalize actions that tend to undermine
it.  The community could provide a scheme of subsidies and taxes
that affect the decisions of ordinary people, whether they be
environmentalists or not.  As explained more fully below, both
of these fiscal instruments are widely used in the United States.
 In recent years, countries across Europe have begun to base fuel
taxes on fuel emission characteristics.  For example, Germany,
Italy, Sweden and Great Britain have reduced fuel taxes for natural
gas vehicles.<sup><a href="end.html">55</a></sup>
  Ireland, Belgium and Italy have no excise taxes
on natural gas as a vehicle fuel, and the Netherlands revised
its tax structure to eliminate penalties previously placed on
gaseous fuels.  The application of lower relative taxes on LPG
makes that fuel more attractive, from a price standpoint, than
gasoline or diesel in Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the
Czech Republic.<sup><a href="end.html">56</a></sup>  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Another approach to reducing emissions would
be for a community to organize a market for emission rights, where
those who find ways to reduce emissions below the baseline could
sell the rights to others who face higher control costs.  All
along, air quality would improve, and a primitive but important
set of property rights would emerge.  Emission permit markets
currently exist nationally for sulfur dioxide emission allowances.
 Markets for emission reduction credits are established in regions
throughout California, across several northeastern states, and
in the Mid-Atlantic Regional Air Management Association.
<sup><a href="end.html">57</a></sup>   The
City of Chicago has a burgeoning market underway, and the State
of Texas has approved a state emissions reductions credit market.
<sup><a href="end.html">58</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The U.S.'s struggle to improve air quality
has reached a point where the gains from employing economic incentives,
like a permit market or emission fees and subsidies, are large
enough to cover some meaningful transaction costs.  A plethora
of special taxes, subsidies and other incentive programs are in
place in many states, and the federal government has modulated
fuel taxes to favor or penalize certain fuels.  The rich variety
of state, local and regional programs illustrates the range of
experiments that can take place when we recognize that air pollution
problems are almost always local and regional in nature.  In effect,
states and cities compete for population and economic activities,
both of which are highly mobile.  Those areas that impose burdensome
rules will be punished when people and prospective industrialists
vote with their feet; regions that find lower cost ways to achieve
air quality goals will be rewarded.  The competition among regions
thus leads to many different mixes in taxes, subsidies and permit
markets as each area seeks the most effective and efficient way
to produce clean air.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal Incentive Programs</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Actions taken by the federal government to
improve air quality and affect the expansion of the AFV fleet
are just as pervasive as those found at the state and local level.
 There are taxes, subsidies, permit markets and a heavy dose of
mandates.  When considered together, the federal and state programs
seem to reveal a crude effort to encourage the use of cleaner
fuels and cleaner-fuel vehicles.  But unlike local and state governments,
the federal programs offer only a uniform approach that does not
always fit with the various air quality goals sought by communities
facing distinctly different challenges.  In fact, current federal
fuel taxes are not truly based on emissions goals.  Some fuel
types are penalized heavily, relative to others, and programs
based primarily on the goal of providing cleaner air are not particularly
effective.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The political and economic importance of clean
air and energy security has spawned a wide variety of federal
initiatives designed to promote the purchase and use of AFVs.
 Tax credits and deductions are offered for the purchase of AFVs
and certain fuels.  Federal tax law also provides subsidies in
the form of differential excise taxes for those who purchase alternative
fuels.  Income tax deductions are provided under the EPACT for
the incremental costs of engine modification, fuel storage and
delivery systems, and emission control systems (retrofit).  Deductions
are also allowed for refueling facility expenditures.  The following
limits are placed on these deductions:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Up to $2,000 for vehicles that weigh less
than 10,000 pounds;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">$10,000 for vehicles that weigh between
10,000 and 26,000 pounds;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">$50,000 for trucks and vans over 26,000
pounds and for buses with seating capacity for 20 or more adults;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">$100,000 for AFV refueling facilities;
and,</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">For flexible-fuel vehicles, only the incremental
costs of qualified items can be deducted.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EPACT also provides for a 10 percent tax credit
for purchases of electric vehicles, up to a maximum of $4,000
- a credit scheduled to fall by 25 percent in 2002, by one-half
in 2003 and by 75 percent in 2004.<sup><a href="end.html">59</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Alcohol fuels, such as ethanol, also receive
favorable treatment from the federal government.  For example,
the tax code provides income tax credits of 60 cents per gallon
for alcohol content in fuel when used as either a mixture (at
least 10 percent alcohol) or as a straight fuel.  Ethanol producers
are provided a tax credit of 10 cents for each gallon of fuel,
up to 15 million gallons per year, that is sold to buyers who
use it in fuel mixtures or to retail purchasers.  These credits
do not apply to alcohol produced from petroleum, natural gas or
coal (i.e., methanol).  Under current law, these credits are to
expire on January 1, 2001.  The federal tax code also provides
a tax credit of $3.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent for domestic
production of oil, gas and synthetic fuels derived from nonconventional
sources.<sup><a href="end.html">60</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Federal highway motor fuel taxes differ for
all major conventional and alternative fuels.  The current rate
on gasoline is 18.4 cents per gallon.  The rate for diesel fuel
is 24.4 cents per gallon.  All but 6.9 cents of these taxes is
allocated to the highway trust fund, with the balance earmarked
for deficit reduction and cleanup of underground storage tanks.
Liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, methanol (from
natural gas) and 10 percent ethanol fuels are taxed, respectively,
at 18.3 cents, 18.4 cents, 11.4 cents and 13 cents respectively,
which is almost in reverse order of their clean emission characteristics.
However, CNG, which is one of the cleanest burning fuels, is taxed
at the equivalent of 5.6 cents per gallon of gasoline.  Table
1 provides a more complete list of federal motor fuel taxes in
both gallon and gasoline equivalent terms.</FONT>

</TABLE>
<P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">By making some major assumptions, we can estimate
the consequences of the net tax or subsidy, relative to gasoline,
the federal government provides for the purchase of AFVs and for
the use of alternative fuels.  Assume that the income tax credit
for the purchase of alcohol fuels amounts to six cents per gallon
for 10 percent ethanol blends. Applying this assumption, the first
column of Table 2 shows the approximate effective federal motor
fuel excise rates for the BTU equivalent of gasoline for alternative
fuels after subtracting the alcohol tax credit.  Assuming further
that each vehicle is operated for 120,000 miles (i.e., 10 years
at 12,000 miles per year) and that each vehicle gets 28 miles
per gallon for the BTU equivalent of one gallon of gasoline, the
second column of the table shows the net excise taxes paid by
the vehicle operator.<sup><a href="end.html">61</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As noted earlier, purchasers of alternative
fuel passenger cars are allowed a tax deduction of $2,000.  If
we assume that automobile buyers are in a 28 percent federal marginal
tax bracket, this deduction reduces the buyer's taxes by $560.
 Electric vehicle buyers are allowed a $4,000 tax credit.  This,
of course, reduces an electric car buyer's taxes by $4,000, regardless
of marginal tax rates.  Using the noted assumptions, the last
column of the table shows the relative advantage given by the
combination of fuel taxes, income tax deductions and credits relative
to gasoline-fueled vehicles.  As indicated, the net value of the
tax reductions is largest for electric vehicles.  Ethanol is some
distance away in second place.  And CNG comes in third.  The value
of the tax reductions for the other fuels is probably too small
to make much difference in consumer behavior.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial">Even with large tax subsidies, electric vehicles
have not emerged as a competing technology,  and  ethanol  production
 has  not been stimulated in recent years.   With the<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">price for electric vehicles exceeding $30,000
and with battery replacement costs running close to half that
amount, the lack of market penetration for electric vehicles is
surely understandable.  As to ethanol, the high demand for corn
has driven up its price, making alcohol production a less attractive
proposition.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In addition to tax incentives for purchasers
of AFVs and alternative fuels, several federal agencies manage
a wide variety of programs that provide grants and subsidies to
states, localities and consumers for the development and implementation
of alternative fuel programs.  For example, EPACT authorizes $10
million per year for financial assistance to state and local AFV
programs. EPACT also allows manufacturers of AFVs to receive credits
that can be applied to the CAFE standard of 27.5 mpg for conventional
motor vehicles.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Through its Urban Consortium Energy Task Force,
the DOE provides funds for energy technology and management programs
in cities and counties.  DOE uses oil overcharge money derived
from prices charged by oil companies during the 1970s' oil embargoes
to fund state energy efficiency programs.  Along with Ford, General
Motors, Chrysler and the Electric Power Research Institute, the
Department of Transportation (DOT) funds the U.S. Advanced Battery
Consortium, which conducts extensive research on electric vehicles
(EVs).  Under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act of 1991 (ISTEA), the DOT provides funds for state transportation
programs and projects that improve air quality.  ISTEA authorizes
the use of federal funds for the conversion and purchase of centrally-fueled
AFVs and for on-site fueling facilities for publicly-owned fleets.
The National Air and Space Administration and DOT also provide
support for AFV research from their research budgets.

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">State Alternative Fuel Regulations,
Laws and Incentives</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Interest in AFVs appears to be universal among
states.  As of November 1994, all fifty states and the District
of Columbia had enacted statutes, written regulations or issued
executive orders that in some way facilitate the use of alternative
fuels in motor vehicles.  These measures range from very minor
and relatively passive measures to complicated and detailed mandates,
tax credits, tax deductions, grants and other measures supporting
the acquisition of AFVs and stimulation of AFV technologies.
<sup><a href="end.html">63</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">California illustrates the range of these actions.
 The state has a comprehensive set of subsidies and mandates contained
in at least 15 statutes related to the use of vehicles that produce
lower emissions than conventional gasoline powered vehicles. 
One such statute requires the state to purchase 25 percent AFVs
as it replaces the state fleet.  Another statute allows a 55 percent
tax credit, up to $1,000 per passenger vehicle and up to $3,500
for heavier vehicles, for those who purchase low emission vehicles
or retrofit conventional vehicles.  California also sets an excise
tax on fuels with 85 percent ethanol or methanol that is one-half
the rate charged on gasoline.  For operators of flexible-fuel
vehicles in the air quality district, the Sacramento Metropolitan
Air Quality Management District annually offers $500 of &quot;free&quot;
85 percent methanol fuels.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">At the other extreme, Indiana provides no state
funds or mandates for AFVs, but the state government offers assistance
to private firms and localities in attracting federal grants for
AFV activities.  Like Indiana, Kentucky has no incentives or mandates,
but has several small demonstration projects and has received
DOE funding for four retail CNG refueling stations.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As noted in Table 1, federal motor fuel excise
taxes favor some alternative fuels over gasoline and diesel fuel.
 State taxes paint an entirely different picture.  Table 3 shows
state tax rates for gasoline, diesel and four alternative fuels.
 A number of states listed in the table provide special fuel tax
treatment for AFVs with decals purchased from the state.  The
annual decal fees range from $30 for light vehicles to $4,060
for heavy-duty trucks and buses depending on the weight and annual
mileage of the covered vehicle.  For example, Louisiana requires
a $150/year decal, which exempts operators of propane and natural
gas vehicles from fuel taxes.  Alabama requires an AFV decal for
a fee that ranges from $75 to $175 depending on vehicle weight.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">With some rather modest exceptions, state taxes
per gallon of fuel differ very little across the six fuels listed
in the table. Since federal taxes favor alternative fuels over
gasoline and diesel, and since most states tax fuels are approximately
the same by volume, the sum of state and federal excise taxes
would appear to provide implicit subsidies for alternative fuels.
Table 4 gives these sums.  However, fuel energy content, not volume,
is the more relevant unit of measurement. Table 5 shows the sum
of state and federal excise taxes based on the BTU equivalent
of one gallon of gasoline. Viewed in BTU terms, CNG receives a
relatively favorable treatment. Ethanol is treated favorably,
but the tax savings on ethanol consumption is considerably lower
than for CNG.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">On the other hand, current state tax laws substantially
penalize the use of methanol.  Only six states (Alaska, Arkansas,
Colorado, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Vermont) tax methanol at a
lower rate than gasoline and diesel fuel.  All other states and
the District of Columbia tax methanol at a higher rate.  In most
states there is also an excise tax penalty for using propane.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The combined effect of state and federal fuel
taxes, considered in the light of emission characteristics, form
an interesting picture.  CNG and LPG are cleaner burning than
ethanol- and methanol-blends of gasoline.  The tax structure favors
CNG and ethanol and penalizes methanol and LPG.  However, the
effects of combined taxes are not as unfavorable on air quality
grounds as the federal tax system considered in isolation suggests.
 The federal tax system appears to reflect a massive political
struggle among the various fuel providers.  Apparently, ethanol
achieved a major victory; LPG did not do so well.  This outcome
tells us that the political process may not be well suited to
establish emission-based fuel taxes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">State taxes suggest the reverse of federal
programs.  Certainly the data reveals the influence of special
interests.  For instance, states that are specialized in the production
of corn favor ethanol; those that produce natural gas favor gas-based
fuels.  But overall, the state schemes come much closer to setting
taxes based on emissions than does the federal scheme.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The outcome suggests that competition matters.
 States compete for population, economic development and environmental
protection.  The national government does not face the same competition.
 The record suggests strongly that states should focus on emission-based
fuel taxes that provide incentives for all fuel producers to achieve
higher environmental standards.  The national government should
address primarily the highway user-fee component of the fuel tax,
while perhaps paying some attention to emission-based taxes that
address national environmental concerns.<BR>

<TITLE> Puhca Versus the States -- PFF</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<CENTER><h2>III.  PUHCA VS. THE STATES </h2></CENTER>
<P>
Forty-six states currently are studying options
for restructuring their electric energy markets.  In six states
- California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York
and Rhode Island - the state public utility commissions or legislatures
have adopted, or are close to adopting, specific restructuring
plans.<a href="/foot.html"><sup>16</sup></a> 
<P>
Each of these states is proposing to allow
retail customers to buy power directly from generators or other
alternative suppliers.  In such transactions, the traditional
franchise utility would merely transmit and distribute power.
 The benefits to consumers of such market arrangements are obvious:
 consumers will not be captive customers of a franchise utility,
relying on regulators to assure that their utility does not charge
excessive prices. Instead, consumers will be able to shop for
power the same way they shop for long distance telephone carriers.
 Furthermore, competition between generators ultimately will lead
to lower prices. 
<P>
PUHCA interferes with state-level restructuring
efforts in two ways.  First, it makes it difficult for states
to implement asset divestiture and unbundling proposals.  Second,
it will diminish the entry into retail markets of other power
suppliers that is necessary for restructuring proposals to produce
maximum benefits for consumers. 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Unbundling (Charts 1 and 2) </B></CENTER>
<P>
An important aspect of a number of state proposals
is divestiture of generation assets, or the unbundling of utility
assets into a generating company (Genco), transmission company
(Transco) and distribution company (Disco).  In California, for
example, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
have been ordered to divest themselves of at least 50 percent
of their fossil generation capacity. <a href="/foot.html"><sup>17</sup></a>
 The purpose of these proposals
is to reduce the potential for market power and cross-subsidization
on the part of a vertically integrated utility, and to facilitate
regulation of monopoly transmission and distribution services.
 Proposals differ as to whether the divested Gencos, Transcos
and Discos could remain affiliated within a holding company structure. 
<P>
In some cases, PUHCA makes adoption of corporate
unbundling almost impossible. Unbundling an existing non-holding
utility company into legally distinct Genco, Transco and Disco
would create a new registered or exempt holding company.  The
large non-holding company utilities that operate in more than
one state would be the primary candidates for becoming registered
holding companies if one of the states in which they operate was
to issue a corporate unbundling order.  As Chart 1 shows, 
</ul><IMG SRC="img00001.gif">
<BR>
<ul> 
<P>
this would impose significant costs and procedural
delays on existing utilities.  Some of the most significant costs
include possible spin-offs of non-integrated or non-retainable
non-utility assets. 
<P>
Due to these potential costs, affected utilities
are likely to raise legal challenges, thus frustrating or at least
delaying restructuring efforts.  Even if events never reached
this stage, utilities could point to this troublesome aspect of
PUHCA in regulatory proceedings.  This might have a &quot;chilling&quot;
effect on state commissions, which may respond by avoiding corporate
unbundling proposals, even though, in the absence of PUHCA, such
proposals would be a beneficial part of a competitive restructuring
package.<BR>
 
<P>
If PUHCA did not exist, corporate unbundling
would be much more straightforward, as the contrast between Charts
1 and 2 demonstrates.<BR>
 
<P>
<IMG SRC="img00002.gif"><BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B> Barriers to Retail Entry (Charts
3-6) </B></CENTER>
<P>
A key condition for successful state restructuring
plans is free entry into the energy market.  Restrictions either
on building new, more efficient generation plants or on entrants
buying existing generation capacity have an unambiguous impact:
 diminished competition in a deregulated environment. 
<P>
PUHCA is a significant barrier to entry in
a retail wheeling environment, and it will decrease participation
by some of America's most efficient firms in state competitive
restructuring efforts.  The Act restricts the ability of registered
holding companies, exempt holding companies, non-holding companies,
and non-utility companies to enter newly restructured markets.
  
<P>
The geographic integration requirement of PUHCA
prevents registered holding companies and their affiliates from
buying or building generation capacity to compete in a geographically
separate retail market.  An acquisition that fails to satisfy
the SEC integration requirement compliance test cannot be completed,
as is shown in Chart 3.  For example, the New England Electric
System cannot own a generation plant in California that directly
competes in the California retail market, even though there is
no economic reason why it should not be allowed to do so.  
<P>
Also, as Chart 3 shows, even when an acquisition
is consistent with PUHCA's geographic integration requirements,
the registered holding company still needs approval from the SEC
on the acquisition and its financing. The SEC approval process
is costly, uncertain and time consuming.  Even if approval is
eventually forthcoming, the delay may be a dealbreaker, and the
asset may not be obtained by the most efficient operator.
 
<P>
Exempt holding companies also may face SEC
jurisdiction if they attempt to enter a newly restructured retail
market, especially if such an entry would threaten their exemption
status.  The prospect of becoming a registered holding company
may well deter an exempt holding company from pursuing transactions
in out-of-state restructured markets.  Even if willing to carry
this burden, the SEC approval or procedural delay may be a dealbreaker,
as is illustrated in Chart 4.<BR>
 
<P>
<IMG SRC="img00003.gif">
<P>
<IMG SRC="img00004.gif">
<P>
Retail transactions across state boundaries
that do not involve the acquisition of generation might also create
problems for exempt companies.  For example, California's consumers
might benefit from buying power directly from Arizona Public Service,
which is a subsidiary of Pinnacle West, an exempt holding company
because its operations are limited to a single state.  If Arizona
Public Service bought a distribution company in California and
sold a significant amount in that market, its operations would
no longer be limited to a single state and it might lose its exemption.
 As a result, Arizona Public Service might choose not to compete
in the California retail market.
 
<P>
Finally, the exempt status of exempt wholesale
generators (EWGs) may diminish their importance as potential competitors.
 EWGs represent an easy source of entry into the retail generation
markets.  By selling at retail, however, an EWG's operations would
no longer be limited to wholesale level, and it would lose its
exemption from PUHCA.  The costs of losing the exemption are likely
to keep the EWGs off the retail market.
 
<P>
PUHCA will also make it more difficult for
utility companies that are not already holding companies to enter
new retail markets.  Such companies may, for financing and other
reasons, prefer to create a new corporate entity when acquiring
a generation plant used to make retail sales.  As Chart 5 shows,
entering a retail market in this manner creates a maze of PUHCA-related
procedures and requirements that may eventually result in ordered
divestitures of substantial assets from the entering entity. 
This possibility, and the administrative costs and other restrictions
of PUHCA, are likely to cause such companies to avoid these transactions.
 In particular, any transaction that entails becoming subject
to PUHCA is very likely to deter companies that are not already
holding companies.
 
<P>
Any corporate entity that owns retail generation
becomes an &quot;electric utility company&quot; under PUHCA. 
A parent of such an entity (unless able to qualify for an exemption)
must register and thereby become subject to all the requirements
of PUHCA, including the geographic integration and ownership of
non-utility assets requirements.  Non-holding companies that are
not already in the electricity business may bypass PUHCA when
acquiring a retail generation plant by not using a holding company
structure.  In that case, however, the company would, as shown
in Chart 6, become an &quot;electric utility company&quot; under
PUHCA.  Future activities, whether in the power industry or elsewhere,
that would entail creating a holding company would make such a
company subject to full PUHCA requirements, unless an exemption
could be found.  Such a threat is likely to deter non-power companies
from entering the retail generation business.
 
<P>
Thus far, state restructuring proposals typically
have not mandated the use of wholesale power pools, which provide
another possible framework for competition.  The exceptions are
California, where initially all utility power must be traded through
a pool,  
<P>
  
<P>
<IMG SRC="img00005.gif"><BR>
<BR>

<P>
<IMG SRC="img00006.gif">
<P>
and New York, where the pool structure is required
to be in place before retail wheeling is implemented in 1998.
 Although a pool structure eliminates some of the problems discussed
above, because generators selling into the pool are considered
wholesale and therefore exempt, some PUHCA-induced restrictions
remain.  In particular, the ability of registered holding companies
to participate by owning EWG's outside their integrated service
territories would still be limited by SEC investment rules for
such companies (see Chart  7).<BR>
 
<P>
<IMG SRC="img00007.gif">
<P>
Without PUHCA, as Chart 8 shows, the process
of acquiring utility assets will be greatly simplified and much
more attractive to a large number of potential entrants.  Paradoxically,
even though PUHCA directly regulates registered holding companies,
the high costs of becoming a registered holding company prevents
retail entry by those companies that actually do <I>not</I> fall
under its jurisdiction.  (Compare Charts 5 and 6 with Chart 3).

 
<P>
Although PUHCA is viewed as serving consumers'
interests by limiting market power through merger control, in
fact the Act <I>increases</I> market power by raising barriers
to entry into newly restructured retail markets.  The repeal of
PUHCA is thus necessary to provide electricity consumers the greatest
benefits of electricity competition.<BR>

<P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Conventional wisdom and anecdotal evidence
tell us that the first automobiles on the dusty roads of America
encountered many naysayers.  Early drivers were greeted by catcalls
and &quot;Get a horse!&quot;  Availability of fuel was a problem,
and no one could imagine how the new technology might affect the
environment.  Indeed, few people cared.  Today, what can we say
about AFVs, their emission characteristics and costs?  Which of
the AFVs is in the best position to enter the market?
<sup><a href="end.html">64</a></sup>   </FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Compressed Natural Gas</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">It is estimated that in 1990 there were 500,000
CNG powered vehicles worldwide.  In the United States today, some
84,000 CNG vehicles ply the roads, 49 percent of which are pickups
(most of them bi-fuel vehicles).<sup><a href="end.html">65</a></sup>
  Ford offers its Crown Victoria,
Econoline van and F150/250 pickups for the CNG market.  Chrysler
sells its CNG Voyagers, Caravans, Dakota and Ram pickups, while
General Motors is reentering the market with sedans.  Meanwhile
Chrysler, Ford, Cummins, Mack Truck, Caterpillar, and Detroit
Diesel are developing natural gas engines for vehicle use. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Natural gas is a fossil fuel extracted either
from natural gas wells or from wells that produce both crude oil
and natural gas.  Because of its very low energy density, natural
gas needs to be used as compressed gas (CNG) or liquefied and
stored cryogenically (LNG).  Either method requires heavier, more
expensive storage systems than those found in conventional vehicles.
CNG vehicles can be bi-fuel (natural gas and either diesel or
gasoline) or dedicated to natural gas, which optimizes performance.
 When properly tuned, a single-fuel natural gas vehicle has superior
power and efficiency to a gasoline engine.  An engine dedicated
to natural gas can have a higher compression ratio, increasing
thermal efficiency 10-20 percent, which compensates for the heavier
tanks required for containing the compressed fuel.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are two refueling options for CNG vehicles:
 (1) Fast-fill at a compressor-equipped refueling station or (2)
at home or work, which takes several hours for a typical light
vehicle.  The fast-fill method requires a greater infrastructure
investment, as much as $500,000 for an average volume station.
<sup><a href="end.html">66</a></sup>
 As for home refueling, much of the infrastructure is in place,
because most homes are connected to a natural gas utility system.
 With a small compressor unit, which costs approximately $5,000,
CNG vehicles could be filled at home using overnight filling.
Compared to gasoline, dedicated CNG engines have longer engine
lives and lower maintenance costs due to the cleaner burn of CNG.
<sup><a href="end.html">67</a></sup>
 As to safety and health concerns, natural gas is less subject
to self-ignition than gasoline, and the release of natural gas,
which is nontoxic, does not cause a serious health hazard.
<sup><a href="end.html">68</a></sup>  The
per-mile injury rate for CNG vehicles is 37 percent lower than
for gasoline fleet vehicles and 34 percent lower than all gasoline
vehicles.<sup><a href="end.html">69</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">CNG is being used in fleets across the country.
 A central refueling point makes fleet usage attractive.  For
example, the Peachtree City, Georgia, police force recently converted
its twelve patrol cars to CNG.  Schools in Tulsa, Oklahoma (120
buses), and Aurora, Colorado (53 buses), are using CNG buses.
 The cities of Milton, Florida (25 police cars, sedans and garbage
trucks), and West Vancouver, British Columbia (40 police, utility,
and administrative vehicles), are successfully  using CNG vehicles.
<sup><a href="end.html">70</a></sup>
 The American Gas Association estimates that more than 25 U.S.
school districts have converted five or more buses to CNG use.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Not surprisingly, natural gas companies are
at the forefront in using natural gas vehicles.  An American Gas
Association survey in 1991 revealed that 8,827 natural gas vehicles
are part of the fleets of 82 U.S. utility companies.
<sup><a href="end.html">71</a></sup>  In order
to reduce air pollution, water clouding and fuel bills, Disneyland
converted much of their transportation system (60 boats and rafts,
one submarine, four Main Street vehicles, and 16 service vehicles)
to CNG. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">United Parcel Service implemented a CNG program
for its delivery vehicles in New York City, the District of Columbia,
Dallas, Los Angeles, Tulsa and Oklahoma City.  The firm reports
a maintenance cost drop of $1.00 per vehicle per day, a 30 percent
reduction in fuel costs and reductions in pollution (18 percent
less CO, 86 percent less nonmethane hydrocarbons, and 22 percent
less NOx).<sup><a href="end.html">72</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The U.S. Postal Service (USPS), which now has
thousands of CNG vehicles, tested seven types of alternative fuels
in their vehicles and found that CNG was the only fuel tested
that is economical, safe and viable.<sup><a href="end.html">73</a></sup>
  They incurred costs of converting
to CNG of $1,500-$2,500 per vehicle and increased vehicle weight
by 200 pounds.  USPS concluded that electric vehicles had high
maintenance, costs and limited range.  Propane (LPG) vehicles
tested were deemed unsafe and did not reduce reliance on imported
oil.  Liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanks required too much space.
 Methanol suffered from low fuel economy and corrosive effects
on engines.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Research on fuels for AFVs focuses primarily
on light vehicles and is generally incomplete.  Comparisons of
studies are difficult to make, since the tests reported are often
for different vehicles using different test techniques.  For these
reasons, we report a series of findings, which turn out to be
rather wide-ranging.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">On the basis of these studies, CNG turns out
to be a rather clean fuel.  Evaporative emissions from CNG are
zero since refueling and storage requires a sealed system.  Because
of more complete combustion, carbon monoxide (CO) and non-methane
hydrocarbon emissions are substantially lower than for conventional
gasoline.  NOx emissions may be higher, but in dedicated engines
special combustion chambers can reduce NOx emissions.  When substituting
natural gas for diesel, particulates cease to be a problem, but
NOx surfaces again.  In one comprehensive review, the author reports
a consensus that natural gas has a 20 percent advantage over gasoline
when it comes to greenhouse emissions (GHG), and is neutral in
GHG relative to diesel.<sup><a href="end.html">74</a></sup> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The Department of Energy has not yet completed
its final assessment of emissions for CNG vehicles.  However,
one DOE report concludes that using CNG lowers CO emissions by
six to 99 percent, a range too wide to be very instructive.  NOx
emissions range from 40 percent higher to 85 percent lower, and
hydrocarbon (HC) emmisions range from 697 percent higher to 44
percent lower for passenger cars.  However, much of the increased
HC is methane, which does not contribute to ozone.  In short,
the overall effect of CNG use would be ozone reducing.
<sup><a href="end.html">75</a></sup> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In a California Council for Environmental and
Economic Balance study of CNG, CO emissions were 50 to 90 percent
lower than for gasoline vehicles, HC emissions were 50 to 80 percent
lower, and particulates were nearly eliminated.  NOx emissions,
which are subject to temperature and the presence of oxygen, were
shown to be as much as 80 percent higher.<sup><a href="end.html">76</a></sup>  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A 1990 EPA report estimates that CNG vehicles
will reduce volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), an ozone precursor,
by 36 to 47 percent in bi-fuel vehicles and 80 to 90 percent in
engines dedicated to natural gas.<sup><a href="end.html">77</a></sup>
  It is important to note the
EPA's findings, given the agency's lead role in regulating mobile
source emissions.  An American Petroleum Institute report agrees
that dedicated engines reduce VOCs 80 to 93 percent, but estimates
the bi-fuel systems will generate 75 to 86 percent less VOCs.
<sup><a href="end.html">78</a></sup>
 A study by the Gas Research Institute<sup><a href="end.html">79</a></sup>
 estimates 83 percent less
reactive organic gases, another measure of ozone precursors, and
another exhaustive report estimates that CNG use has 60 percent
lower ozone-forming potential than do gasoline vehicles.
<sup><a href="end.html">80</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A 1995 report prepared for the Natural Gas
Coalition compared emissions for nine different light vehicles
and provided some data for heavy-duty trucks and locomotives.
 Net smog-forming emissions for CNG vehicles, which accounts for
volume as well as reactivity of emissions gases, were 87 percent
less than those from gasoline engine vehicles.  Emissions of NOx
from heavy-duty vehicle engines were at levels that could not
be achieved by diesel engines.<sup><a href="end.html">81</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As with emission estimates, the estimated cost
of moving to CNG vehicles varies widely from study to study. 
A 1994 survey of AFV studies reports the overall costs of CNG
range from 74 percent to 170 percent of the cost of a gasoline-fueled
light vehicle.<sup><a href="end.html">82</a></sup>
  The DOE estimates that light vehicle conversion
costs range from $2,700 to $5,000.<sup><a href="end.html">83</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In a more comprehensive study, the American
Petroleum Institute examined the incremental costs, including
private and social costs, of the adoption of CNG for three cases.
<sup><a href="end.html">84</a></sup>
 The first is a private CNG vehicle program with a public refueling
program.  The second is for centrally fueled fleets in nine cities.
 The third case involves the use of new CNG transit buses in metropolitan
areas having a population greater than one million people.  The
costs of emissions reductions were calculated at avoided costs
(the cost effectiveness of achieving the same reductions through
other means).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In all three cases, the net private benefit
of CNG vehicles is negative, and in all three cases, the net social
benefit may be positive (which accounts for air quality improvements
as well as private costs and benefits).<sup><a href="end.html">85</a></sup>
  For example, CNG use
in Los Angeles light vehicles would have a private cost ranging
from $0.01 to $0.36 per gallon equivalent, but would yield overall
social benefits as large as $0.55 or overall costs of $0.01 per
gallon.  For transit buses, the net private costs range from $0.04
to $0.50 per gallon equivalent, but the social benefit ranged
from a high of $0.35 per gallon to a loss of $.027 per gallon.</FONT>

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Liquefied Natural Gas</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas
stored in liquid form at refrigerated temperature levels; it therefore
shares many of the features of CNG.  The liquid form offers an
advantage over the compressed form.  The fuel is stored at low
pressures (10 to 25 psi), which yields rapid refueling capability
and the use of smaller storage tanks.  However, with the added
bulk of insulation, LNG tanks are about twice as large as gasoline
tanks for an equivalent amount of energy.</FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A major disadvantage of LNG is that the refrigeration
can consume 25 percent of the energy of the natural gas being
liquefied.  This adds roughly $0.20 per gallon equivalent to the
cost of the natural gas.  There is also a potential frostbite
problem associated with the handling of LNG, but all other technological
assessments are essentially the same between LNG and CNG.  Emissions
characteristics, of course, are the same as CNG use.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">LNG is in use in a substantial number of heavy-duty
truck and bus demonstration fleets, but few light-duty AFVs are
currently operating on LNG.  There is a potential use of LNG as
a fuel for heavy-duty vehicles,<sup><a href="end.html">86</a></sup>
 particularly if the federal taxes
on LNG and CNG are equalized.<sup><a href="end.html">87</a></sup>
  Since LNG is a liquid fuel, it
is taxed at about a 12 cents per gallon higher rate than CNG.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Even with the tax disadvantages, LNG has penetrated
some major markets. The Houston (Texas) Metro has announced its
commitment to convert 300 of its buses to LNG use, and Roadway
Express, operator of 3,500 long-haul moving trucks and 5,800 local
moving vans, is considering using LNG fuel in its trucks.
<sup><a href="end.html">88</a></sup>  However,
the federal tax penalty on LNG, as compared to other alternative
fuels, makes the conversion far less attractive.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Liquefied Petroleum Gas</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) can be formed
from a mixture of gases including propane, butane and ethane.
 In the United States, LPG is primarily composed of propane, and
the terms LPG and propane are often used interchangeably.
<sup><a href="end.html">89</a></sup>  LPG
has been used as a commercial fuel for more than 60 years.  Currently,
more than 300,000 vehicles in the United States and four million
vehicles worldwide operate on LPG, although only a small percentage
(2.8 percent) of the U.S. count is used for transportation.
<sup><a href="end.html">90</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">LPG is liquefied by compressing the gas to
a pressure of more than 100 psi to reduce its volume for transportation
and storage.  This requires as much as 45 percent more tank space
than gasoline for an equivalent operating range.
<sup><a href="end.html">91</a></sup>  LPG tanks are
heavier than gasoline counterparts, but the fuel is lighter, which
yields a minimal net weight increase.
<sup><a href="end.html">92</a></sup>  Engine operating and combustion
characteristics yield cleaner starts, which increase engine life
by 50 percent or more.<sup><a href="end.html">93</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Engines can be dedicated to LPG or can be bi-fuel
(with either diesel or gasoline).  Using a dual-fuel system reduces
the efficiency of using propane and requires the complication
of having two simultaneous fuel systems.  Diesel engines can also
be converted to LPG usage, reducing the emission of particulates.
 At present, engine builders are working on dedicated LPG engines
for heavy duty use.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In the United States, most LPG is produced
from stripping wet gases from natural gas, and the remainder is
a by-product of oil refining.  LPG represents three percent of
natural gas and oil reserves.<sup><a href="end.html">94</a></sup>
  It is unclear if the availability
of LPG will be sufficient for widespread use as an alternative
fuel. For instance, a California Energy Commission report predicts
supply shortages, particularly in the winter months when propane
is used as a heating fuel.<sup><a href="end.html">95</a></sup>
  However, other studies show that supply
is not a constraint on LPG use in America.  U.S. refiners are
expected to increase their production of LPG due to changes in
refining processes, and the availability of imported LPG is also
projected to increase (which, of course, works against EPACT's
policy of reducing the importation of fuels).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Substituting LPG for gasoline reduces CO emissions
by as much as 23 percent, due to the fuel's lower carbon-to-hydrogen
ratio and higher thermal efficiency.  CO, HC, and NOx emissions
depend on the air-fuel ratio.  CO falls as the ratio increases,
HC falls, then increases as the ratio increases, and NOx increases,
then drops as the ratio increases.  Therefore, there is an HC/NOx
tradeoff at different air-fuel ratios.<sup><a href="end.html">96</a></sup>
  CO reductions are the
largest relative to gasoline.  EPA reports an 80 percent reduction,
making LPG attractive for use in confined spaces such as warehouses.
<sup><a href="end.html">97</a></sup>
 EPA also reports nonmethane hydrocarbon reductions for current
LPG vehicles of 41 percent.  Chang estimates a 35 percent reduction
in ozone-forming potential (OFP),<sup><a href="end.html">98</a></sup>
 but Cleanfleet reports a 68
to 71 percent OFP reduction.  Due to a relatively less expensive
storage system, LPG conversions generally cost less than CNG conversions.
 Estimates usually range from $700 to $1500.  Fuel prices are
in the same range as CNG prices.<BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Methanol</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Methanol is an alcohol-based fuel.  While natural
gas is currently the least expensive and widely used raw material
for methanol production, the fuel also can be made from coal or
biomass.<sup><a href="end.html">99</a></sup>
  Methanol can be used in neat form (M100 or 100 percent
methanol), but is currently only used as a gasoline blend (M85,
or 85 percent methanol).  The fuel has a high octane rating, and
its efficiency increases with an increased compression ratio and
with an increased leaning of the air/fuel mixture, which increases
engine efficiency by approximately 10 percent relative to gasoline.
 Methanol fueled engines can produce more horsepower than their
gasoline counterparts, but the gains are offset by the necessary
heavier fuel tank.<sup><a href="end.html">100</a></sup>
  Because of its power-to-volume traits, a methanol
AFV must have an 80 percent larger tank than a gasoline vehicle
for an equivalent driving range.  Pure methanol presents a cold-start
problem that is resolved with 85 percent blends with gasoline.
 The blend with gasoline obviously reduces some of the air quality
advantages.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Methanol is highly corrosive, but corrosion
inhibitors in the fuel, particular alloys and polymers in engines,
and certain lubricants can help to overcome this problem.  The
fuel conducts electricity, is volatile, burns with an invisible
flame and has wide-ranging flammability limits.  Methanol is highly
toxic, but odorless and tasteless, which increases exposure risks.
 Other problems include accelerated cylinder wear, fuel system
durability for unaltered engine parts (due to its corrosiveness),
and the explosivity of vapor in fuel tanks at ambient temperatures.
 Adding gasoline to pure methanol to form M85 mitigates the invisible
flame and vapor explosivity problems.  Blends allow the fuel to
be identified by odor or taste, a valuable property for a toxic
substance.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As a practical matter, domestically produced
methanol is not a current contender for a major role the U.S.
AFV fleet market.  The plant capacity does not exist, and while
U.S. production facilities could be expanded at exceptionally
high costs, substantial and immediate increases in demand would
likely be satisfied from overseas, which provides little in the
way of energy security benefits.<sup><a href="end.html">101</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are no standardized test procedures for
methanol, thus it is difficult to characterize the test data.
Some research indicate methanol use will reduce CO and HC, but
NOx emissions could increase or decrease.  Depending on gasoline
blends, VOCs could decrease by as much as 80 percent and ozone
forming potential by 30 percent.  However, an American Petroleum
Institute study shows reductions in VOCs to range from zero to
75 percent and ozone reductions to average 13 percent.
<sup><a href="end.html">102</a></sup>  The findings
for NOx indicates that methanol vehicles could not meet California
standards.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In 1994, Chrysler offered three light vehicles
equipped for 85 percent methanol; Ford produced one.
<sup><a href="end.html">103</a></sup>  In 1995,
Chrysler reduced its offering to one vehicle while Ford continued
to make its single offering.  The corrosive nature of the fuel
creates substantial hurdles for engine manufacture and modification.</FONT>

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Ethanol</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Ethanol is the most widely used alternative
fuel in the world.  Brazil, with more than four million vehicles
using ethanol, has a highly subsidized program to produce ethanol
from sugarcane.<sup><a href="end.html">104</a></sup>
  All standard gasoline-fueled vehicles can burn
ethanol/gasoline blends with little, if any, difficulty.  In 1988,
880 million gallons of ethanol were produced in the United States,
blended with gasoline and used as a motor fuel, accounting for
almost one percent of the motor fuel market.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In the United States, ethanol is produced from
corn and thus is dependent on the world price of grain.  Like
methanol, ethanol is an alcohol fuel that can be used as 100 percent
ethanol or as a blend with gasoline (10 percent ethanol/90percent
gasoline blend is known as gasohol).  Ethanol's corrosion properties
lie between those of gasoline and methanol.  Most vehicles, however,
can use gasohol without problems.  Ethanol burns with a luminous
flame, unlike methanol, making it easier to detect fires.  It
is less flammable than methanol, but can be explosive in tank
vapor space.  It has no known carcinogenic compounds, but ingestion
can nevertheless cause severe problems.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Ethanol blends do not provide significant improvements
in smog-forming emissions. An American Petroleum Institute study
concludes that total VOC emissions are 20 percent higher for vehicles
using ethanol blended fuel.<sup><a href="end.html">105</a></sup>
   EPA estimates an impact of 15 percent
higher VOCs in 1990 and 20 percent higher in 2000.
<sup><a href="end.html">106</a></sup>  In addition,
NOx emissions tend to be higher with gasohol than gasoline. When
ethanol is substituted for diesel, the main benefit is reductions
in particulates.  HC and CO standards can be met, but NOx emissions
may be a problem.   In 1995, efforts by EPA to require the use
of ethanol in reformulated gasoline were stopped by the U.S. Court
of Appeals (D.C.).<sup><a href="end.html">107</a></sup>
  The court chastised EPA for pushing ethanol
in a program designed to produce cleaner air when EPA itself had
admitted there were no environmental benefits and that ethanol
&quot;might make air quality worse.&quot;<sup><a href="end.html">108</a>
</sup> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Currently ethanol costs substantially more
to produce than gasoline.  Production costs range from $1.10-$1.65
per gallon, making wholesale costs almost double that of gasoline.
 Since a gallon of ethanol has two-thirds the energy of a gallon
of gasoline, ethanol, which wholesales for, say, $1.20 per gallon,
equates to a gasoline cost of $1.80 per gallon. Since ethanol
blends require no changes to the vehicle and distribution poses
no problems, the higher price of the fuel is the only relevant
cost.  Of course, a substantial increase in demand for ethanol
could raise other issues.  For example, reliance on gasoline for
ethanol blends reduces the national security benefits of this
alternative fuel and the associated increase in demand for corn
could, in turn, increase food prices.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Electric vehicles </FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Popular in the late 1800s, electric vehicles
(EVs) have been in use for more than a century.  Of the 4,200
vehicles sold in 1900, 38 percent were electric vehicles, 22 percent
were gasoline fueled and 40 percent were steam powered.
<sup><a href="end.html">109</a></sup>  The invention
of the electric starter in 1911 eliminated the major inconvenience
of gasoline-fueled vehicles, thus eliminating the demand for EVs.
 Since then there have been three surges in interest in EVs. 
The first, in the 1960s, was due primarily to air quality concerns.
 The second, in the 1970s, was a result of the concerns over the
U.S. dependence on imported oil.  The third began in the mid-1980s
and continues to the present.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Relying on ubiquitous standard electricity,
EVs have no refueling problems.  Since there is no energy combustion
on board, there are no tailpipe and no vehicle emissions.  But
storage of electricity in vehicle batteries raises a major constraint.
 EVs in the 1960s used tubular lead-acid batteries.  Many different
technologies have been tried since then, but potential problems
including high costs, questionable durability and the recycling
of toxic components remain.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Aside from their high purchase price, which
currently approaches $30,000, EVs are not particularly attractive
to motorists due to long recharging times, lack of heating and
air conditioning, reduced range, and limited speed and acceleration
compared to gasoline vehicles.  Existing battery technology limits
the driving range to about 100 miles between charges, and replacing
batteries that have a two-year life runs as much as $10,000.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As a result of intense R&amp;D efforts, the
performance for batteries increased 30 percent in the past decade.
 They are now expected to last 30,000 miles with deep dis-charge
cycles and longer with light use and frequent charging.  Advanced
maintenance-free designs are expected to last up to 60,000 miles.
<sup><a href="end.html">110</a></sup>
 Due to lengthy charging periods, EVs are often charged at night,
which dovetails in nicely with the excess generating capacity
of electrical utilities. But EVs are substantially heavier than
their gasoline or diesel counterparts due to the battery weight,
adding to their energy use per mile.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EV marketing efforts received a potential reversal
when the Ozone Transport Commission moved toward the new National
Low Emission Vehicle as the flagship of its ozone control efforts.
 Despite that, General Motors announced that it will offer an
EV produced by its Saturn Division in the fall of 1996.
<sup><a href="end.html">111</a></sup>  This
EV, to be marketed in Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix and Tucson,
will have a 70-mile range and sell in the mid-$30,000 price range.
 Chrysler is offering a $100,000 minivan conversion.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The elimination of tail-pipe emissions is the
major benefit of EVs.  If the electricity is generated from nonpolluting
sources (nuclear, wind, water, solar), then there may be clear
environmental benefits. But, if power generation comes from fossil-fuel
powerplants, then pollution concentration may actually increase.
 Thus while EVs have an extreme advantage in point-of-use emissions,
they do not necessarily reduce global emissions.  For this reason,
EVs may address local nonattainment problems at the expense of
regional air quality.  For instance, a DOE paper cites one study
that estimates the changes resulting from substituting EVs for
conventional vehicles in Southern California's South Coast Air
Basin to be HC reduction of 98.9 percent; CO, by 98.7 percent;
and, NOx, by 60.9 percent.  SOx increased by 495.8 percent, and
particulates, by 570.5 percent.<sup><a href="end.html">112</a></sup>  The increases were due to emissions
from coal-burning power plants.  If the electricity had been nuclear
generated (as in the case of Chicago), then there would be no
SOx and particulates emission increases.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EVs suffer from severe cost penalties arising
from lower power and limited range.  Weight limitations impose
another restriction.  EVs are small.  An American Petroleum Institute
study by Henderson and Rusin concludes that these penalties range
from $6,700 to $7,700 per vehicle.<sup><a href="end.html">113</a>
</sup>  The study concluded that EV
life-cycle costs are from $2,000 to $5,000 more than a conventional
vehicle, which gives a total incremental cost of from $8,700 to
$12,700.  Mass production of EVs would likely bring substantial
reductions in vehicle prices.  But the prospects for their widespread
use are still rather dim.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Summary and Comparisons</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Upon completing our review of the various emission
studies described here, we returned to a 1990 General Accounting
Office (GAO) report that summarized similar findings.
<sup><a href="end.html">114</a></sup>  The GAO
summary closely parallels our findings.  Focusing on four of the
alternative fuels, the report states that CNG reduces hydrocarbons
by an estimated 40 to 90 percent and may reduce CO emissions by
50 to 90 percent.  According to the report, LPG produces 50 percent
fewer hydrocarbon emissions and may reduce CO by 25 to 80 percent.
Methanol was found to reduce ozone-forming hydrocarbons by as
much as 40 percent when blended in an 85 percent mix with gasoline.
 Ethanol had similar characteristics.  The GAO summary and our
review suggest strongly that CNG is the cleanest of the gas-based
and alcohol fuels, followed by LPG, methanol and ethanol.  Of
course electricity is the cleanest of all, if the generating source
is nonpolluting.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Our assessment of AFV characteristics and costs
indicates that LPG and CNG vehicles have emerged as competitive
technologies in niche markets.  Many fleet owners are already
turning to CNG as a fuel source in order to cut transportation
costs and provide environmental benefits.  LPG is a weak second-place
contender, and its reliance on petroleum feedstocks places the
fuel at a disadvantage when assessed in terms of energy security.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Of the alcohol fuels, ethanol is clearly a
strong contender.  Its market penetration is not hampered by the
availability of refueling stations, but its supply depends on
the relative price of corn. Ethanol received the most favorable
tax and government incentive support, but even with heavy subsidies
its production has faltered in recent years.  Since ethanol is
blended with gasoline, the fuel does not provide the emission
reductions of LPG and CNG.  Methanol's corrosion and safety problems
puts it in last place in the gas and alcohol technology struggle.
 Relative to the other AFVs, electric vehicles are clearly in
an early stage of technological development.  EVs are being produced,
and significant and productive R&amp;D is underway.  With breakthroughs
in battery technologies, EVs could become a contender in the highly
specialized small commuter car market.  At present, however, we
do not see EVs as a major force in the light vehicle market.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Our review of AFV emission and cost characteristics
provides a basis for drawing some tentative conclusions regarding
emission reduction costs.  We emphasize the word &quot;tentative.&quot;
 As noted before, there is no single set of consistent emission
and cost studies for all AFVs.  The first approach we took illustrates
the wide variation in costs.  Here, we estimated a set of emission
reduction costs for CNG-AFVs and EVs using the Gas Research Institute
emission data on reactive organic gases and cost estimates provided
by Deborah Gordon that reflect fuel and retrofit costs alone.
<sup><a href="end.html">115</a></sup>
 These calculations show the cost of reducing one ton of ozone
precursors to be $16,194 for CNG and $91,679 to $155,233 for EVs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In the interest of providing a more comprehensive
and practical basis for estimating the cost of reducing a ton
of smog-forming emissions, we took EPA data on VOCs emissions,
ranges of purchase premium values and EPA's mid-point estimate
for fuel costs for light vehicles fueled with CNG, LPG, ethanol
and methanol.  We recognize that smog production requires interaction
of NOx with VOCs but were unable to obtain comprehensive data
that showed interaction for AFVs.  We made our calculations without
assigning any dollar value to improved environmental quality.
 In brief, our calculations simply reflected the costs paid by
consumers who might purchase AFVs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Our calculations relied on a number of key
items of EPA data.  These were supplemented with several critical
assumptions.  The fuel prices used in the calculations were drawn
from the EPA database for 1990. We assumed the typical vehicle
fleet has a 10-year life, so we used an undiscounted one-tenth
share of the price premium as the annual fixed charge for each
AFV.  For the analysis, we assumed the vehicles achieve an average
of 20 mpg and are driven 20,000 miles annually.  On this basis,
an average AFV would use the equivalent of 1,000 gallons of gasoline
annually.  The range of annual fuel charges and purchase price
premiums for each vehicle formed our annual incremental cost.
<sup><a href="end.html">116</a></sup>
 For example, EPA's upper estimate for the premium for CNG light
vehicles is $3,250.  Our calculations showed the annual incremental
cost for CNG including fuel costs is $265 per vehicle.  That for
blended ethanol is $960, while blended methanol vehicles carry
an annual incremental cost of $110.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">We then considered a hypothetical fleet of
17,231,516 passenger cars, which happens to be size of the 1991
California fleet.  If the hypothetical fleet used conventional
gasoline, then, using EPA's baseline of 1.75 g/mile of VOCs, approximately
665,000 tons of VOCs would be emitted in one year.  If the entire
fleet were converted to CNG, there would be roughly 615,000 fewer
tons.  The annual incremental cost per ton would be $7,400.  Converting
the entire fleet to 85 percent ethanol would likely increase VOCs
emissions.  But methanol blends would reduce VOCs by approximately
435,000 tons annually at a cost of $4,300 per ton.  Unfortunately,
EPA provided no data for VOCs on LPG vehicles.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, to place AFVs in perspective with
vehicles using reformulated gasoline (RFG), we made similar calculations
for that fuel, drawing on other reports for data and assuming
the entire fleet is converted to RFG vehicles.<sup><a href="end.html">117</a>
</sup>  That conversion
would remove approximately 133,000 tons of VOCs at a cost per
ton of $2,600.  Table 6 summarizes our findings.  Recall, the
1991 baseline fleet using conventional gasoline emitted 665,000
tons of VOC.  A move to 100 percent RFG vehicles would reduce
133,000 tons at the lowest price per ton of $2,600.  However,
more than 500,000 tons would remain.  Conversion to methanol blends
would reduce 435,000 tons at a price per ton of $4,300.  More
than 200,000 tons would remain.  CNG vehicles would practically
eliminate all the VOCs at a price per ton of $7,400.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial">We conclude this analysis by noting an underlying
issue that explains why emission reductions are so costly.  Vehicle
emissions are at a very low level, which means that a large number
of vehicles must be affected to generate annually a ton of emission
reductions.  On the basis of the EPA data we used, CNG vehicles
emit 5.7 pounds of VOCs annually.  Ethanol and methanol blends
emit 26.5 pounds, and RFG-fueled vehicles emit 61.7 pounds.  A
conventional vehicle using standard gasoline emits 77.2 pounds
of VOCs each year.</FONT>

</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<CENTER><h2>IV. PUHCA VS. EFFICIENCY</h2><BR>
 </CENTER>
<P>
Quite apart from the direct impact PUHCA will
have on state competitive restructuring programs, the Act imposes
substantial social costs on electricity and gas customers, stockholders
and the public at large by erecting barriers to efficiency and
by imposing significant administrative, financing and transactions
costs.<BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Barriers to Efficiency<BR>
 </B></CENTER>
<P>
As discussed in the last two sections, PUHCA
restricts the movement of registered holding companies into markets
that are not geographically connected or capable of such interconnection.
 The SEC has recognized that these requirements are restrictive,
and while it appears that the SEC is relaxing its interpretation
of this section somewhat, such mergers are nevertheless subject
to regulatory scrutiny by the SEC as well as by FERC.
<a href="/foot.html"><sup>18</sup></a>
 
<P>
The potential benefits lost because of these
restrictions are numerous.  While it is unlikely that major benefits
would accrue at the plant level because the minimum efficient
scale of an electric generating plant is now relatively small,
<a href="foot.html"><sup>19</sup></a>
substantial benefits from non-contiguous utility integration include:
a more efficient mix of generating facilities through better coordination;
<a href="foot.html"><sup>20</sup></a>
savings due to a more efficient scale of overhead activities;
<a href="foot.html"><sup>21</sup></a>
and, savings due to more efficient matching of load diversity.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>22</sup></a>
 The present value of the total savings from lifting restrictions
on non-contiguous utility mergers is estimated at approximately
$2 billion<a href="foot.html"><sup>23</sup></a>
 - and this does not include the &quot;cost&quot; of
the integration requirement imposed on consumers of states where
competitive restructuring is underway. 
<P>
In addition, PUHCA directly and indirectly
restricts registered holding companies from engaging in non-utility
activities.<a href="foot.html"><sup>24</sup></a>  
The &quot;ten-percent rule&quot; directly restricts
a registered holding company to no more than 10-percent ownership
of a subsidiary venture before that venture is subject to the
requirements of PUHCA.  Furthermore, the &quot;functional-relationship
test&quot; combined with the &quot;50-percent rule&quot; essentially
requires that the business a registered holding company does in
a &quot;functionally related&quot; area <I>outside</I> the firm
cannot exceed what the company does <I>inside</I>.
<sup><a href="foot.html">25</a></sup>  Although the
SEC has begun recently to make exceptions to the 50-percent rule,
these rules still constitute significant direct restrictions on
non-utility activities. 
<P>
Indirectly, the Act creates a &quot;chilling
effect&quot; on non-utility activities by requiring SEC oversight
of these businesses.<a href="foot.html"><sup>26</sup></a>
  The fact that firms must publicly disclose
the details of these businesses, and incur compliance costs, imposes
a burden that affects exempt holding companies and non-utilities
as well as registered holding companies.  
<a href="foot.html"><sup>27</sup></a> 
<P>
Utilities have a comparative advantage in many
non-utility activities but are prevented from engaging in them
due to PUCHA.<a href="foot.html"><sup>28</sup></a>  
The costs associated with limits on diversification
were somewhat mitigated by enactment of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, which permits registered holding companies to enter
the telecommunications business.<a href="foot.html"><sup>29</sup></a>
  This legislation will produce
large benefits because the electric utility industry already has
laid 10,000 miles of fiber optic cable for its own data transmission
and other purposes.  This cable capacity has gone under utilized
because of PUHCA and now may be made available for other purposes. 
<P>
Many industry observers anticipate that electric
utilities will find significant efficiencies in having homes wired
for improved energy-use metering and applications such as &quot;real
time pricing&quot; of electricity.  In the event this takes place,
utilities will obviously be in a good position to utilize the
same wires to offer telecommunications services at very competitive
prices.  This is now permissible, but other potential benefits
of diversification are not currently feasible.  For example, while
the 1996 Act permits electric utilities to diversify into telecommunications,
the reverse is not true.  Telecommunications companies cannot
diversify into the retail electricity business without being subject
to the requirements of PUHCA.  And, the Act continues to restrict
entrance by electric utilities into non-telecommunications  businesses. 
<P>
Given that there are important complementarities
between a number of industries and electric utilities, it is likely
that many firms would find it profitable to enter utility markets,
thus bringing additional capital and expertise.  In general, PUHCA
limits the possibility of innovative and efficient industrial
companies acquiring electric utilities and applying the lessons
learned in competitive industries to their regulated firms.  These
economies are lost, in addition to limiting participation in the
market for &quot;corporate control.&quot;<BR>
 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Barriers to the Market for Corporate
Control </B></CENTER>
<P>
The market for corporate control - whereby
firms are able to create value by acquiring poorly managed firms
and improving their performance - exerts a powerful disciplining
effect on costs.<a href="foot.html"><sup>30</sup></a>  
There is substantial statistical support for
the proposition that takeovers create important social benefits.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>31</sup></a>
 An active market in corporate control can be especially important
in traditional rate-regulated public-utility markets, where the
incentives to control costs are relatively weak, because costs
are easily passed through to ratepayers.<a href="foot.html"><sup>32</sup></a>
  To the extent that PUHCA
impedes the operation of the market for corporate control, it
results in less efficient utilization of utility assets and higher
costs and prices for consumers. 
<P>
For example, of the nine hostile utility takeover
attempts that occurred between 1960 and 1986 (all of which failed),
six failed &quot;primarily because of federal regulatory procedure
based on the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.&quot;
<a href="foot.html"><sup>33</sup></a>
 In the five years from 1986 to 1990, there were 13 takeover attempts
but only one was successful.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>34</sup></a> 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Restrictions on Financing, Affiliate
Transactions and Administrative Costs </B></CENTER>
<P>
As discussed previously, the regulatory costs
imposed by PUHCA to a non-utility of acquiring a utility are prohibitive.
 Such a company, under the Act, could be required to become a
registered holding company.  Registered holding companies need
SEC approval to issue or sell securities, acquire utility or nonutility
assets, sell utility assets or enter into service arrangements
with sister companies.  This clearly makes it nearly impossible
for a non-utility to consider acquiring utility assets. 
<P>
There are substantial costs routinely associated
with PUHCA's regulation of utility financing.  Since companies
must obtain SEC approval for numerous activities, they are often
significantly delayed in responding to market opportunities. 
The benefits of optimal financial arrangements are slow in coming,
and therefore may be foregone.  As discussed below, state utility
commissions also regulate these decisions, and this local regulation
is likely to be better able to assess local needs. 
<P>
Moreover, each registered holding company must
file annually a number of routine reports with the SEC to meet
the requirements of PUHCA.  The cost of filing these required
forms has been estimated at $6 million annually (or more than
$50 million on a present value basis). <a href="foot.html"><sup>35</sup></a>
 Utilities also must file
applications with the SEC to obtain approval for various transactions.
 In addition to these routine filings, companies in a registered
holding company system must generally seek SEC approval any time
they undertake non-routine activities which fall under the purview
of PUHCA.  These costs have been estimated at more than $10 million
annually (or more than $100 million on a present value basis).
<a href="foot.html"><sup>36</sup></a>
 Thus, total annual administrative costs are estimated at $16
million annually, or approximately $150 million on a present value
basis. These are costs that consumers eventually pay through higher
rates for gas and electricity. <br>

<title>V.Emerging AFV Niche Markets</title>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717"
Vlink="545454" ALINK="#FF0000"><ul><blockquote>
 <a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif"
 align="right" border="0"></a>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">V.  EMERGING AFV NICHE MARKETS<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P><br><p>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Our comparison of AFVs has focused almost exclusively
on light vehicles, and for good reason:  The CAA and EPACT look
to the larger light vehicle fleet for reducing smog and improving
energy security.  For example, EPACT is limited to vehicles weighing
less than 26,000 pounds, which is the beginning weight for large
18-wheelers.  California AFV statutes are limited to vehicles
weighing less than 8,000 pounds.  Furthermore, the vast majority
of research on emissions and costs has been devoted to emerging
light vehicle technologies.  Indeed, when compared with light
vehicles, EPA emission standards for large diesel engines are
at a very rudimentary level.  As indicated by our discussion of
infrastructure, conversion costs, price premiums, vehicle choice
and continued improvement of gasoline-fueled vehicles, penetration
of the light vehicle market by AFVs faces high hurdles.  The growth
experienced by AFVs continues to be found in public and private
fleets where refueling and vehicle choice present little difficulty.
 But the capture of some significant share of the conventional
consumer market is not likely to occur in the foreseeable future.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Many of these seemingly insurmountable challenges
largely disappear when the market for heavy trucks, buses, locomotives
and off-the-road machinery is considered.  Refueling for fixed-schedule
trucks and buses can be conveniently located at terminals, and
the additional tanks required for alternative fuels adds a small
proportional increment to the vehicles' weight.  With almost two
million plying the nation's highways, annually consuming 17 billion
gallons of diesel fuel, heavy trucks present a significant market.
<sup><a href="end.html">118</a></sup>
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A large part of the heavy-duty truck market
is composed of tractor/trailor vehicles weighing more than 26,000
pounds, the limit for EPACT programs.  But there are still significant
federal and state tax incentives for purchasers of heavy-duty
AFVs.  The federal government provides an income tax deduction
of $5,000 for intermediate weight trucks and vans, and a $50,000
tax deduction for vehicles weighing more than 26,000 pounds. Among
states, Arizona provides funds for the conversion of buses; Wisconsin
provides grants for alternative fuel trucks, vans and buses purchased
by municipalities; and, Maryland, Montana and North Dakota provide
state income tax credits to assist the purchase of vehicles weighing
more than 10,000 pounds.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Since heavy-duty vehicles are large fuel consumers,
fuel-cost savings weigh heavily in the balance when AFVs are considered.
 Indeed, in a 1994 report, Weaver and Turner concluded that converting
from diesel to natural gas could be economically justified on
fuel savings alone.<sup><a href="end.html">119</a></sup>
 In a survey of 4,000 fleet operators, 59 percent
reported use of AFVs.<sup><a href="end.html">120</a></sup>
  Of these, 40 percent burned LNG and 39
percent used CNG.  Both user-groups reported substantial fuel
cost savings.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">AFVs offer significant clean-air gains relative
to heavy-duty diesel trucks and vehicles.  In addition to producing
VOCs and nitrogen emissions, conventional diesel engines are heavy
emitters of particulates, CO and sulfur dioxide.  According to
EPA, conversion of 1991 diesel engines to CNG (or LNG) reduces
hydrocarbon emissions by 67 to 80 percent, NOx by 10 percent,
particulates by 40 to 76 percent and CO by 74 percent.
<sup><a href="end.html">121</a></sup>  Switching
to methanol virtually eliminates particulates, but may increase
CO and hydrocarbon emissions.  Movement to LPG eliminates particulates
and reduces CO, but may increase NOx and hydrocarbon emissions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In a study of 44 LNG heavy-duty vehicle projects
nationwide, Robert Nimocks found some 2,277 LNG heavy-duty vehicles
in service.<sup><a href="end.html">122</a></sup>
  Some 30 additional LNG projects were initiated in
just four years.  Nimocks found that 17 of 51 fleets covered by
his survey were composed of long-distance delivery, less-than-carload
and refuse haulers.  This was concentrated in California and Texas,
where air quality problems are most severe.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Urban buses provide another important niche
market for AFVs.  For example, Brooklyn Union recently announced
that its 12 CNG fueling stations provided the equivalent of one
million gallons of CNG in 1995 to its 2,200 CNG vehicles operating
in New York.<sup><a href="end.html">123</a></sup>
  Included in the fleet are 53 commuter and two shuttle
buses that operate in Brooklyn and Queens.  Some 330 additional
buses are being considered for conversion. The organization estimated
that conversion from diesel fuel eliminated 43 tons of air pollution
in one year.  With 300 alternative-fueled buses, the Houston Metropolitan
Transit Authority operates the world's largest LNG fleet, and
some 10 other transit agencies have converted buses to LNG use,
including Sun Metro in El Paso, which will eventually operate
121 LNG buses.<sup><a href="end.html">124</a>
</sup>  Out of concern about particulate emissions, the
governor of Massachusetts ordered the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority to purchase exclusively buses that use alternative fuels.
<sup><a href="end.html">125</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Throughout our discussion of AFVs, the chicken-and-egg
problem surfaced regularly.  How can people be induced to purchase
AFVs when there is no refueling capability?  Or, how can refueling
infrastructure be built when there is no mass market?  The heavy-duty
truck and vehicle market tends to resolve this problem because
refueling infrastructure can be justified for fleets of urban
buses and operators of heavy-duty trucks that are refueled at
either end of a scheduled run.  The facilities that are built
can then be made available for public use, which strengthens the
overall market for AFVs.  But what about suppliers of engines
and vehicles?  Have they responded to the emerging market forces?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Major engine and truck producers have responded
to the market for LNG and other alternative-fuel vehicles.  Navistar,
General Motors and Peterbilt are offering LNG-fueled engines.
 Mercedes, General Motors, Flxible and Ikarus offer LNG-fueled
buses, and practically every large engine manufacturer now makes
available LNG and other alternative fuel engines.  Although the
price premium for equipping a heavy-duty truck or bus with an
alternative-fuel engine runs as much as $60,000, the gain in fuel
and operating costs comes close to offsetting the premium. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In addition to these niche players, a potential
market may be developing for locomotives and operators of mining
machinery and ore carriers.  Again, refueling presents a smaller
challenge than in the light-vehicle market.  Here too, the gains
from fuel cost savings go a long way toward offsetting conversion
costs and purchase premiums.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The evidence we have compiled indicates that
AFVs are a viable force in the heavy-duty market.  Again, LNG
and CNG appear to be the major contenders in this market.  Regional
pressures to reduce air emissions form part of the stimulus, but
sheer economic forces push in the direction of alternative fuels
in these significant niche markets.  AFVs can surely be a component
of Environmental Innovation Areas. </FONT>

<TITLE> V. Puhca versus Efficient Regulation -- PFF</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<CENTER><h2>V.  PUHCA VS. EFFICIENT REGULATION </h2></CENTER>
<P>
Increases in competition diminish the need
for regulation in general and magnify the importance of PUHCA's
anticompetitive features.  Nevertheless, competition is not yet
sufficient to eliminate the need for maximum rate regulation.
 Paradoxically, PUHCA has effects that are inconsistent with an
efficient regulatory system.  
<P>
<CENTER><B>Increased Competition in Electricity
and Gas </B></CENTER>
<P>
Although competition at the retail level for
electricity has just started to emerge, there has, in recent years,
been a significant increase in wholesale electricity competition.
 In the gas industry, competition has increased at both the wholesale
and retail levels. 
<P>
Wholesale power markets have become increasingly
competitive in recent years, primarily as a result of a series
of legislative and regulatory developments.  Today, large regional
grid networks allow competing suppliers access to wholesale customers
of many sizes and types. 
<P>
The Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act
of 1978 (PURPA),<a href="foot.html"><sup>37</sup></a>
 created a new class of generators, called qualifying
facilities (QFs) consisting of co-generators and small power producers.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>38</sup></a>
 As a result, non-utility generation increased rapidly in the
1980's, and by 1992 accounted for 10 percent of total U.S. generation.
 
<P>
Wholesale competition also has been facilitated
by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, <a href="foot.html"><sup>39</sup></a>
which permits any person, including
a registered holding company, to acquire an exempt wholesale generator
wherever located, or a foreign utility company (&quot;FUCO&quot;)
without seeking prior approval from the SEC.<a href="foot.html"><sup>40</sup></a> 
The EWGs constitute
an important source of non-utility generation. 
<P>
Today, additional units of generating capacity
are just as likely to be provided by non-utility generators (NUGs,
which include both QFs and EWGs) as by utilities.  During 1990-91,
NUGs added more net capacity than did utilities and forecasts
suggest that the importance of NUG's will increase in the future.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>41</sup></a> 
<P>
The 1992 Energy Policy Act also authorized
FERC to require companies to provide transmission services if
in the public interest.  Pursuant to this provision, the Commission
in April 1996 issued an order that requires all transmission-owning
public  utilities to open their transmission lines to eligible
wholesale customers on a non-discriminatory basis.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>42</sup></a>  Providing
access to the transmission network will increase competitiveness
at the wholesale level and make the state regulators' job easier
and their regulation more effective. 
<P>
The gas market has, in the deregulated environment
of recent years, become much more competitive. In 1978, Congress
passed the Natural Gas Policy Act as part of the National Energy
Plan.  In January 1985, in accordance with Phase 1 of this plan,
wellhead prices for about half the nation's gas supplies were
decontrolled.<a href="foot.html"><sup>43</sup></a>  
Wellhead price controls were eliminated for all
gas supplies by the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989. 
<P>
In October 1985, FERC, in Order 436, allowed
pipelines to become open-access transporters of gas bought directly
from producers by all classes of customers.  In November of 1993,
FERC issued Order 636, which basically converted pipelines to
common carrier status and made natural gas procurement, contract
and price negotiations the responsibility of the local distribution
companies. 
<P>
The deregulation of wellhead prices, combined
with greater access to pipeline transportation services, and the
inclusion of many more participants in the natural gas market,
has resulted in a much more competitive market than existed a
decade ago.  The gas industry seems well along in the deregulatory
process and PUHCA simply acts as a drag on the process. 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Regulatory Efficiency </B></CENTER>
<P>
The developments described above mean that
electric utility firms are now faced with wholesale competition
from numerous non-utility generators and other utilities.  Even
in the absence of retail competition, this change in market structure
reduces the need for PUHCA regulation. The price information from
an active wholesale market is a major aid to state regulators
and hence they are able to more easily judge the &quot;reasonableness&quot;
of a local utility's rate requests.  Information generated from
a competitive wholesale market is a high-powered substitute for
the purported informational benefits of PUHCA regulation. 
<P>
PUHCA was intended &quot;to provide a mechanism
to create conditions under which effective federal and state regulation
will be possible.&quot;<a href="foot.html"><sup>44</sup></a> 
 It is, therefore, ironic that the Act
discourages the holding company structure, which is conducive
to efficient regulation. The major purpose of public utility rate
regulation is to insure that rates are reasonable relative to
costs.  The avoidance of unauthorized cross-subsidies is particularly
important for multi-product utilities. 
<P>
Firms with discrete product lines can organize
either through the divisional structure (examples are PacifiCorp
and UtiliCorp) or as holding companies in which the divisions
are separate corporate entities.  The holding company structure
facilitates regulation because it makes it more straightforward
for both the regulator and the regulatee to allocate costs.  Costs
are more easily traceable to the individual products and cross-subsidies
are easier to discern.  It is for this reason that firms in regulated
industries frequently are <I>required</I> to provide certain product
lines through separate subsidiaries or affiliates (for an example,
see section 272 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which requires
Bell operating companies to provide certain services through separate
affiliates). 
<P>
The requirements of PUHCA make organizing as
a holding company costly, whatever its other advantages.  If PUHCA
were repealed, it is likely that more firms would organize as
holding companies, thereby improving the regulatory process.

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">VI. ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AREAS:
 A REGIONAL APPROACH TO ACHIEVING NATIONAL GOALS<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Think Globally, Act Locally<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Most of us are familiar with the bumper-sticker,
&quot;Think Globally, Act Locally.&quot;  As it happens, this
slogan provides exactly the right framework for thinking about
the use of alternative fuel vehicles to achieve environmental
and national security objectives.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As discussed above, two federal government
objectives can be addressed by expanding the use of AFVs:  1)
 Improving air quality in specific regions of the country; and,
2) reducing America's reliance on imported petroleum. The first
objective is defined by the CAA.  The second emerges primarily
from EPACT and CAFE.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The CAA correctly recognizes that the clean
air problem is local or regional in nature. Different atmospheric
conditions and other characteristics make prospects for one national
solution for smog reduction very unlikely.  For example, Atlanta
has a heavy background level of hydrocarbon emissions from trees,
while Chicago has heavier NOx emissions and little in the way
of natural hydrocarbon emissions.  Uniform national command-and-control
 regulations simply will not get the job done.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Energy security, on the other hand, is a national
problem.  Simply put, EPACT calls for a reduction in the aggregate
importation of petroleum products into the United States - an
objective that could in principle be met through the use of AFVs
anywhere in America.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The solution:  Think globally, act locally.
 Create national objectives, but implement them on a geographically
&quot;customized&quot; basis that focuses on achieving maximum
environmental benefits.   And, do so in a way that encourages
further innovation, so that the best technologies are brought
to market and applied where they can do the most good.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">To achieve these objectives, we propose the
creation of Environmental Innovation Areas (EIAs).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The essence of the proposal is simple:  Allow
those regions for which the federal government has identified
specific environmental objectives to achieve those objectives
in a way that makes the most sense for each area.  Further, because
the objectives are (at least in part) national, provide national
resources to meet them. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In principle, the EIA concept could be applied
to address a wide variety of environmental problems which share
the national/regional characteristics of the clean air challenges
we have addressed in this paper.  However, we focus here on describing
a specific proposal for implementing EIAs to address the clean
air and national security benefits associated with AFVs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Identifying Regional Candidates
for EIAs</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The boundaries of an EIA should be determined
by the environmental issue it is meant to address.  In the case
of smog, smog production is a local or regional phenomenon tied
directly to emissions from mobile and stationary sources of particular
pollutants.  An EIA set up to deal with smog should have geographic
boundaries covering the sources of the smog, regardless of whether
those boundaries are consistent with political boundaries, such
as a city or state.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The CAA addressed the regional nature of the
problem establishing 22 metropolitan nonattainment areas and the
12-state Ozone Transport Region (plus the state of California)
as controlling units.  Indeed, the CAA defined decision-making
organizations for each of these regions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">We propose that each of the 22 urban areas
plus the 12-state Ozone Transport Region and the state of California
be designated automatically as EIAs.  Further, any other region
wishing to establish an EIA should be allowed to apply for approval
by federal authorities for such designation.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">EIAs and Clean Air Standards</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EIAs should be granted open-ended flexibility
in achieving air quality goals based on EPA-approved interpretations
of national standards.<sup><a href="end.html">126</a>
</sup>  The measurement of their success should
be their progress toward achieving overall performance standards
based on air quality monitoring - not whether they use specific
technologies or follow specific command-and-control regulation.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Utilizing this flexibility, each EIA will employ
its own, unique package of control instruments to deal with its
unique problems.  In some cases, control of NOx is more important
than obtaining reductions in VOC.  In other cases, stationary
controls are more crucial than seeking additional emissions reductions
from mobile sources.  But each EIA will have one common element:
 their efforts will be outcome-based;  inputs alone will not count.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">To replace the current input-based approach
with one based on outcomes will require waiving numerous EPA and
other mandates.  To obtain such waivers, each EIA would specify
how it plans to achieve the nationally mandated smog-reduction
goals, including detailing the actions to be taken and the means
by which the region would monitor outcomes and enforce decisions.
 However, we would propose that EPA be required to approve all
initial waiver requests based on a standard of &quot;reasonable
evidence&quot; that the EIA's proposal would achieve the desired
goals.  Further, waivers should only be revoked if an EIA consistently
(e.g. three years running) fails to achieve the specified outcomes
in terms of emissions reduction.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">We expect that EIAs would examine a wide variety
of options for achieving their objectives, including: </FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Differential fuel taxes that reflect emission
characteristics for different vehicle fuels;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Provision of tax credits or deductions
for the purchase of AFVs and construction of refueling facilities;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Requirements that AFVs be used in particular
locations;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Purchase of clean fuel vehicles by public
entities, or incentives for purchase by private ones;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Inspection and maintenance programs that
provide low cost, effective means for assuring emission reductions;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Transportation plans that reduce the use
of private automobiles; and,</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Development of emissions trading schemes
that provide incentives for the use of cleaner fuels and technologies
and allow optimal tradeoffs between stationary and mobile source
emission reduction.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In addition to these tools, we are confident
that the implementation of EIAs will generate many new ideas,
as groups at the grass roots level who will live with (and pay
for) the EIAs' policies seek to find the most effective and efficient
solutions.  In general, we would expect less reliance on inflexible
command-and-control regulations, strict rules requiring centralized
inspection of vehicles and fleets, high taxes on emissions, and
burdensome transportation plans relative to the use of flexible
market-based approaches.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">With EIAs around the nation utilizing different
control instruments, a discovery process will occur that leads
to fresh approaches for improving environmental quality. EIAs
will learn from each other what works and what does not, what
are more efficient and less costly ways to meet the standards.
Metropolitan areas, states and regions are naturally involved
in a competitive market for growth and change, and environmental
quality is an important consideration for people and firms when
making location decisions. The means chosen for maintaining and
improving environmental quality matter as well.  If one region
can provide cleaner air at lower cost than another, then more
wealth will be produced in the low-cost region.  There will thus
be pressure on EIAs to develop and adopt the most innovative,
efficient and effective mechanisms to meet their goals.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Federal Role in EIAs</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The federal government will play a crucial
role as referee in the EIA process.  By statute, it defines the
clean air goals to be achieved.  The national standards should
reflect a public policy choice made by Congress and enforced by
the EPA.  For instance, the national ambient air quality standards
would be a baseline EIAs would first be challenged to achieve,
after which they are obviously free to go further.  Given rising
incomes and strong preferences for improved air quality, it is
likely that the EIA process would inspire a race to the top. 
Allowing flexibility places a heavier burden on air quality monitoring.
 The EPA would be challenged to provide better, more complete
data on emission levels, and to give regular progress reports
to EIAs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The federal government also plays a key role
by leveling the playing field for competing fuels and AFVs.  For
example, federal tax policy currently favors electric vehicles
and penalizes the use of propane.  Vehicle taxes should be set
on the basis of gasoline equivalence, relying fundamentally on
the notion of taxes as a highway user fee.  Alternately, the federal
government should apply emissions-based taxes to all fuels that
affect truly national environmental concerns, such as upper atmospheric
conditions or emissions that travel across national boundaries
or large populous regions.  States and EIAs should be encouraged
to continue to use emission-based fuel taxes.  In addition, the
federal government should gear its subsidies for urban transportation
programs to encourage the use of clean fuel buses.</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">EIAs and Energy Security</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EPACT, related executive orders and CAFE form
the second major force pushing the entry of AFVs into U.S. markets.
 Unlike improvements in air quality, which redound to the benefit
of people in local areas, a one-barrel reduction in imported oil
does not generate locally identifiable benefits but serves to
accomplish a national mandate.  Under EPACT, DOE is charged with
reducing American reliance on imported petroleum.  AFVs are an
important means of accomplishing this objective.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Currently, DOE is considering rules that could
require providers of alternative fuels, public sector fleets and
private fleet operators with 20 or more vehicles to increase their
purchase and use of AFVs, with the objective that AFVs will account
for 75 percent of new fleet purchases by the turn of the century.
 Presidential executive orders require similar mandates for federally
operated fleets.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">A requirement that the federal government itself
purchase AFVs is one thing. However, a requirement that private
firms and state and local governments purchase AFVs is an unfunded
mandate.  In the first instance the costs borne by the federal
government are visible; they are in the U.S. budget.  In the latter
instance, the costs are hidden but nonetheless real.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In conjunction with EIAs, we propose that all
required purchases of AFVs be funded sufficiently to cover related
incremental costs.  For private firms, income tax credits or direct
payments would be preferred.  For public sector fleet purchases,
the federally provided offset may take the form of trades involving
other federal programs.  With all costs made visible, U.S. taxpayers
and their representatives can better appreciate the opportunity
cost of the mandate and more effectively allocate funds for that
purpose.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">What size budget would it take to fund an incremental
cost of mandated AFVs? One illustrative approach to answering
the question involves consideration of failed 1992 congressional
attempts to expand AFV purchases.<sup><a href="end.html">127</a>
</sup>  Under the proposed 1992 National
Energy Security Act, Congress described AFV purchase targets for
federal, state, local and private business fleets.  The bill called
for 1.2 million AFVs in private fleets by the year 2000 and twice
that number in operation by 2010.  Some 1.4 million light vehicles
were included in the 2010 count.  If, for example,  the current
incremental cost of $3,500 for CNG vehicles were budgeted, the
total cost of achieving the 2010 goal of an additional 1.4 million
light vehicles would be $4.9 billion. If spread over a 15-year
period, the annual cost would run $326 million.  (Although this
illustration is for light-duty vehicles, we would expect, at least
initially, much of the AFV budget to be concentrated in the purchase
of heavy-duty vehicles, which are less dependent on a distribution
infrastructure.  The incremental costs of these vehicles are highly
variable, depending on vehicle type.)</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">This cost could be at least partly offset by
using funds from a variety of existing federal programs designed
to promote the use of AFVs.  EPACT currently provides income tax
deductions of up to $2,000 for the purchase of light-duty AFVs
and greater amounts for heavy-duty vehicles.  Funds are also provided
through DOE's Clean Cities Program and through DOT programs to
promote AFVs.  These existing subsidies could be redeployed to
fund the incremental cost of AFV purchases through EIAs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">An additional 1.4 million light vehicles, which
would be about 10 percent of the privately owned fleet, would
reduce annual oil consumption by about 14 million barrels and
emissions of VOCs by about 40,000 tons.  Although this constitutes
a relatively small percentage of total VOC emissions, through
the EIA process this reduction would be concentrated in the areas
where smog is of greatest concern.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">To achieve the maximum environmental benefit
from AFVs, funding priorities for AFV purchases should be determined
in conjunction with the EIAs.  Specifically, we propose a periodic
tournament process, managed by the Department of Energy, to establish
how much AFV funding each EIA should receive, with funding decisions
based on air quality conditions in the competing EIAs.  That is,
the first decision-making criterion in allotting AFV funding should
be to see which EIAs would achieve the greatest environmental
benefits by using AFVs.  Once ranked on the basis of how much
AFVs contribute to air quality gains in each EIA, the DOE would
then consider other factors, such as the availability of fuels
and the development of a critical mass for viable infrastructure
and markets, in making the final funding allotment.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Finally, federally mandated fuel economy standards
(CAFE) should be reexamined in the light of AFV technologies.
 An expansion of AFVs can have the same effect on oil importation
as higher CAFE standards, which carry a high cost in human life.
 We believe the increased use of AFVs can make CAFE unnecessary
and, ultimately, that CAFE can and should be eliminated.  Auto
producers will then be able to channel energies used currently
for achieving CAFE to designing and producing AFVs.</FONT>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Next Step in a New Environmental
Agenda<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The EIA concept can be used for managing most
forms of environmental pollution.  Few environmental challenges
are truly national in scope but typically local or regional in
nature.  Indeed, the history of environmental law indicates that
the federal government's first environmental regulation was aimed
at efforts to coordinate state and local actions.
<sup><a href="end.html">128</a></sup>  Even after
the formation of the federal blueprint in the 1970s, the federal
government continued to rely on states for operating federally-approved
programs and, in the case of water quality, setting water quality
goals for streams, rivers and lakes.  All attempts to impose uniform
standards across the entire country have met with frustration,
exemptions, delays and variable enforcement.  To some degree,
variations reflect differences in the nature of the pollution
problems encountered and the ability of communities to deal with
the national goals.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Embryonic EIAs may already be forming.  Under
DOE's Clean Cities program, almost 50 metropolitan areas have
submitted plans and gained approval for cooperative assistance
in promoting AFVs and clean air.<sup><a href="end.html">129</a></sup>
  Each designated city has its
own specialized plan for achieving clean air goals.  In some cases,
the plans include cooperative private/public efforts to expand
alternative fuel infrastructure along with efforts to be taken
by stationary sources to reduce emissions.  In others, the plans
involve transportation systems and expanded AFV fleets.  For example,
a school transportation agency in California's Long Beach Clean
City area is converting an aging fleet of 180 diesel-fueled school
buses to vehicles using CNG, methanol and advanced designed diesels.
 To assist in the process, Southern California Gas Company installed
a CNG refueling station, and the district is building an electric
recharging station for an electric powered demonstration school
bus.  In another case, leaders in Honolulu formed a coalition
to promote the use of propane, methanol and electricity as vehicle
fuels. The coalition plans to add 480 AFVs to the existing fleet
of 300. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The Coachella Valley Region of California,
best known as the location of Palm Springs, provides a more complete
example of how the Clean Cities program could form a foundation
for EIA designation.<sup><a href="end.html">130</a></sup>
  Leaders across nine cities in the region
organized an association for promoting clean air.  By combining
the interests of industrialists, educators and operators of bus
companies, the association moved forward with a program that promotes
AFVs, improved transportation systems and the location of specialized
manufacturers in the area.  Their plan includes the production
of hydrogen fuels, making available CNG refueling units in newly
constructed homes, and the expansion of refueling facilities.
 The Coachella Valley now has the largest CNG refueling station
in Southern California along with mobile refueling units for commercial
users.  After converting 40 vehicles to CNG, the local bus company
has achieved some 30 tons of NOx emission reductions that it is
now seeking to sell in the Southern California emissions credit
market.  With a number of key stakeholders in place, the Coachella
Valley group could readily move to embrace larger environmental
goals and seek flexibility for attaining them as an EIA. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">An effort in North Carolina to achieve water
quality goals provides the best example of an operating EIA. 
North Carolina's Tar-Pamlico River Basin Association was formed
in 1988 for the purpose of achieving reductions in phosphorous
and nitrogen discharges in the Tar River and Pamlico Sound.
<sup><a href="end.html">131</a></sup> EPA
agreed to alter its command-and-control approach to mandatory
point-source controls, without which Tar-Pamlico could not achieve
the desired standard.  Instead, EPA allowed the Association to
meet a water quality performance standard.  Tar-Pamlico's solution
was a plan involving the trading of pollution reductions:  the
association facilitates trading between farmers who reduce their
discharge of nitrogen and phosphorous and municipal treatment
works that are required to reduce their discharge of the same
pollutants.  Funds for these trades come from members of the association
that pay discharge fees based on emission characteristics.  Even
more to the point, the Association members represent a regional
watershed, which is the relevant zone of control, that does not
conform to any particular political boundary.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Visions of EIAs are also seen in other countries.
 For example, all French rivers are managed by autonomous and
distinct regional authorities.<sup><a href="end.html">132</a></sup>
  Each of the associations must
obtain its own funding, and each is accountable for improving
water quality.  In the United States, EPA's bubble and offset
policies for air pollution control, which allow low-cost sources
of pollution control to exchange emission reductions with higher
cost sources, represent steps in the direction of EIAs.<sup><a href="end.html>133</a></sup>  These
instruments decentralize control by allowing plant operators to
meet overall standards instead of meeting standards at each-and-every
source and to obtain pollution offsets from other plants.  In
other words, rudimentary forms of EIAs are emerging.
<sup><a href="end.html">134</a></sup></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">EIAs represent a next logical step that can
be taken to move environmental protection forward. By focusing
on the appropriate zone of control; emphasizing outcomes, not
inputs; and, allowing flexibility in achieving desired goals,
environmental control authorities can assist the development of
incentive-based institutions that will more effectively yield
environmental improvement. </FONT>

<TITLE> PUHCA is Redundant -- PFF</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<CENTER><B>VI.  PUHCA IS REDUNDANT </B></CENTER>
<P>
As the SEC has recognized, the regulation of
utilities has become vastly more sophisticated at both the federal
and state levels in the years since PUHCA was enacted. The pervasiveness
of other regulatory programs makes the PUHCA requirements duplicative
and unnecessary. 
<P>
<CENTER><B>State Regulation </B></CENTER>
<P>
One of the intentions of PUHCA was to facilitate
the regulation of electric utilities on the state level through
simplification and data availability.  Absent any of the PUHCA
provisions, state regulators have expanded their authority over
both electric and gas utilities and now have all the authority
needed to protect consumers from unreasonable rates. 
<a href="foot.html"><sup>45</sup></a> Most states
also regulate securities issuances, acquisition and diversification
activities and prescribe uniform systems of accounts for regulatory
purposes.<a href="foot.html"><sup>46</sup></a> 
<P>
All state commissions have the authority to
regulate retail rates of investor-owned utilities and to demand
justification before adopting any rate changes.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>47</sup></a> In this connection,
states have the authority to access out-of-state information that
affects an in-state utility.<a href="foot.html"><sup>48</sup></a> 
 The great majority of state commissions
also have the authority to investigate rates, approve mergers,
and investigate contracts and agreements between utilities and
their affiliated non-utilities.<a href="foot.html"><sup>49</sup></a>
  Many commissions have authority
to regulate utility entry into non-utility activities.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>50</sup></a>  Most states
lacked the authority to review these activities when PUHCA was
passed in 1935.<a href="foot.html"><sup>51</sup></a>  
<P>
Importantly, any activity which affects rates
(as all important activities invariably do) is under the control
of state regulators.<a href="foot.html"><sup>52</sup></a> 
 Thus, even if a state commission is not
directly granted the authority to review a particular utility
transaction, it is able to review it and take remedial action
<I>de facto</I> through powers of rate review.  Similarly, even
if a commission did not have express approval power over mergers
or consolidations - although most of them do<a href="foot.html"><sup>53</sup></a>
 - the commission
could nevertheless control these transactions by reviewing their
effects on rates and potentially disallowing cost recovery in
the next rate hearing.  Finally, in the limited number of cases
where a commission does not have full access to all of a utility
affiliate's books and records, the commission can simply refuse
to grant a rate increase if its requests for data are not met.
<sup><a href="foot.html">54</a></sup>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Federal Regulation </B></CENTER>
<P>
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
is responsible for regulating rates for the interstate wholesale
electricity and natural gas markets.<a href="foot.html"><sup>55</sup></a>
  As part of its regulatory
functions, FERC collects detailed financial information and has
established uniform systems of accounts to which regulated utilities
must adhere.<a href="foot.html"><sup>56</sup></a>  
<P>
FERC also has the authority to review, in advance,
electric utility mergers and securities issuances, and has oversight
over numerous utility transactions, including mergers, property
dispositions, the acquisition and issuance of securities, and
affiliate transactions.<a href="foot.html"><sup>57</sup></a>
  Finally, FERC has authority to scrutinize
the books and records of a utility, and of a person who controls
such a utility. <a href="foot.html"><sup>58</sup></a>
<P>
With respect to the issue of access to books
and records, utilities generally have the burden of proof in rate
proceedings.  Therefore, as a practical matter, even when a state
commission does not have independent access to the books and records
of a utility affiliate, the utility will be required to provide
such records to the extent that they relate to the recovery of
costs.<a href="foot.html"><sup>59</sup></a> 
Similarly, the issue of the reasonableness of affiliate
transactions can be addressed by  FERC and the states through
their normal ratemaking authorities.<a href="foot.html"><sup>60</sup></a> 
<P>
At the time PUHCA was enacted, public utilities
were exempt from the federal antitrust laws.<a href="foot.html"><sup>61</sup></a>
  Now, not only do
FERC and the SEC examine the same aspects of proposed mergers,
but the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice does as
well, in order to deter mergers that are detrimental to consumers'
interests.  Thus there would still be redundancy in utility merger
oversight even if PUHCA were repealed. 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Financial Disclosure </B></CENTER>
<P>
As noted, a major goal of PUHCA was to standardize
accounts and increase financial disclosure.  Today, registered
holding companies are subject to the same securities laws which
are applicable to all publicly held companies.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>62</sup></a>
  Repeal of PUHCA
would not affect these laws in any way. 
<P>
Moreover, the market itself &quot;demands a
level of disclosure unheard of in the days when PUHCA was passed
into law&quot; for any company that wants to attract outside capital.
<a href="foot.html"><sup>63</sup></a>
 Any company wishing to obtain financing through organized securities
markets must meet stringent standards of disclosure and uniformity,
independent of the requirements of securities laws.  Because of
the tremendous benefits of the securities markets, there is an
extraordinary incentive to meet the necessary standards.  The
growth of intermediaries between firms and individual investors,
such as mutual and pension funds, ensures that firms are subject
to a high level of financial scrutiny.  Expert rating agencies,
such as Duff and Phelps, Moody's, and Standard and Poor's, provide
an elevated level of scrutiny. 
<P>
The institutions of the accounting profession
also have responded to the demands for better information.  For
example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has become
increasingly important in establishing uniform accounting standards
which must be used by all accountants who are members of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  All financial
statements certified by a member of the AICPA must follow rules
established by FASB.  The stricter accounting standards envisioned
by the framers of PUHCA for the utility industry have thus been
incorporated by the accounting profession and are now widely enforced
by it.  Any utility wishing to enjoy the benefits of having audited
financial statements must meet these standards.

<CENTER><h2>VII.  CONCLUSION </h2></CENTER>
<P>
PUHCA was enacted under vastly different circumstances
than exist today.  In the last 60 years, the electric and gas
utility industries have undergone substantial changes.  Whatever
the merits of PUHCA in 1935, the case for repealing it now is
strong. 
<P>
As the states try to move toward a more competitive
environment, PUHCA stands in their way.  If unchanged, PUHCA will
be an even more significant impediment to the competitive restructuring
of the electric utility industry in the future.  For the gas industry,
which has to a large extent already been restructured, the PUHCA
restrictions may be even more burdensome. 
<P>
Given the existing regulatory protections,
the increasingly competitive electricity and gas environment,
and the desire on the part of many states to move away from the
old vertically integrated monopoly structures, the case for repealing
PUHCA seems compelling. The SEC has been recommending PUHCA repeal,
albeit in slightly different forms, for more than a decade. 
<a href="foot.html"><sup>64</sup></a> It
seems time for the Congress to act.

<title>Welcome to Renewing American Civilization WWW Homepage -- PFF</title>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/pff/multi/gif/renew2.gif" alt="Renewing American Civilization"></CENTER>
<p><p>

For 30 years, America has experienced declines in many of the most basic measures
of cultural health, from out-of-wedlock births, to crime rates to voter turnout.
These developments have coincided with the explosive growth of bureaucratic
government ("the welfare state") and the emergence of a radical challenge to some
of the most fundamental principles of American thought.<p>

Since September 1993, a serious, substantive alternative to this approach has
been offered on over 60 college campuses throughout America in the form of a
college course: "Renewing American Civilization." Developed and taught by
Congressman Newt Gingrich, who holds a Ph. D. in History from Tulane University,
the course is dedicated to describing the underlying principles of American
Civilization and applying those principles to the challenges facing America in
the 1990s and the 21st Century -- including specifically the replacement of the
welfare state with an "opportunity society." <p>

In March, Mr. Gingrich completed his latest course at Reinhardt College, a small
(900 students) liberal arts college just north of Atlanta. In addition, the
course will be distributed by means of satellite broadcast and video tape for use
on college campuses across the country. By mid-1995, the Foundation will have the
class widely available on a for-credit basis on major college campuses nationally
through Mind Extension University and have available a 90-minute video that gives
the essence of the 20 hour course. <p>

<P>
While most sites on the World Wide Web request support of $25, $50 or more, the Frontiers of Freedom Institute would like to spend some quality months building our reputation and earning your respect.

<P><b>Therefore, we are asking for $1.  One dollar.</b>  It may not sound like a great deal of money to you, but frankly, thousands of web users log on to our site every week.  If everyone who viewed our site sent us $1, then we could continue producing quality conservative studies, conferences, and op-eds.  Of course, not everyone will send us $1.  However, we can only hope that this material is of concern enough for many people to simply slip a one dollar bill in an envelope and send it to us.  We will put it to constructive use.  It will allow us to continue moving the ball forward in the debate of conservative and limited government principles versus liberal big government dogma.
<P>
Certainly, if our op-eds and mission statement speak to you in a more passionate and personal way, we encourage you to think about a more substantial gift.
<P><blockquote><I>
For now, however, your support of $1 makes the philosophical connection between our organization and you.  It is a symbolic way of saying -- "Youre doing well.  Continue the fight."</blockquote></I><P>

We thank you for viewing our site and hope we can become more substantive partners in the future in order to advance conservative principles across the country.<P>

<TITLE>Taxpayer Protection Pledge - ATR</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<center>
<h2>Americans for Tax Reform's<br>
Taxpayer Protection Pledge</h2></center>

<center>[ <a href="pled926.html">104th Congress</a> | <a href="pled926b.html">Candidates</a> | <a href="/atr/pledge/statelst.html">State Organizers</a> | <a href="/atr/pledge/guide.html">Voter Guides</a> | <a href="plegfaq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> ]</center><p>

Candidates and elected officials began taking the pledge in 1986. After President Reagan's Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed,
many taxpayers feared that some politicians would raise income tax rates. With President Reagan's support and endorsement,
Americans for Tax Reform and a broad-based coalition of groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National
Federation of Independent Businesses and hundreds of taxpayer groups throughout the nation began to ask all candidates for
public office to "take the pledge." Every year, all Members of Congress are asked to take the pledge by Americans for Tax
Reform, and all challengers are asked to take the pledge during each election cycle. 



<P>
<blockquote><blockquote>     I, ________, pledge to the taxpayers of the _____ District of the State of _______, and to the American people that I will:<P>

     ONE, Oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; and
<P>
     TWO, Oppose any further reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.<P>

<title>  But what about the children?

<h3><I>But what about the children?</h3></I>
By <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Olasky">Marvin Olasky</a></center>
<P><p><P>
 But what about the children?
<P>
 That's the question liberal defenders of the status quo throw
at conservatives who have worked this year to change the current
welfare system.  But that question can be dealt with responsibly
only when two other questions are answered first.
<P>
 First, will the changes lead to children being deprived of food,
shelter, clothing or medicine?   Answer:  Only if welfare administrators
refuse to tighten their belts and rethink their missions.  Most
welfare dollars never get to the poor people they are designed
to help.   Most go to support federal and state bureaucracies
and their political allies in the nonprofit sector.  If the welfare
system were a private corporation, its middle management already
would have been substantially downsized.  As it is, the change
needs to be imposed.  
<P>
 Second, will the changes lead to an improved war against the
real enemy, fatalism?  Answer:  Yes.  If poverty itself led to
illegitimacy, crime, laziness and illiteracy, the United States
could never have become a rich country, because it was poor people
-- worse off materially than poor individuals today -- who built
 America.  But poor children in the past generally had parents
who showed by word and deed the virtue of striving to meet challenges.
 Today, many poor children see all around them the apathy of life
on welfare -- and it's the fatalism that hurts.  If welfare reforms
help to develop more hard-working, family-honoring parents, their
children will be immensely helped.
<P>
 Welfare hurts children:  That's more than a theory.  One recent
study looked at the earnings of adult men who had grown up poor.
 The study compared adults of the same race who as children had
the same family income, family structure and parental educational
background; the only difference was whether families derived the
bulk of income from welfare or work.   The study showed that the
more welfare income a boy's family had received as he was growing
up, the lower his earnings as an adult; but more non-welfare income
led to higher adult earning.   The bottom line was that hard-working
parents, even (and sometimes especially) if poor, generally produce
hard-working children. 
<P>
 Sound charitable programs help children: That's also more than
a theory.  Groups provide assistance at every age from conception
through young adulthood: 
<UL>
<LI>Some 3000 crisis pregnancy centers throughout the United States
offer material, psychological,and spiritual help to young women
who are pregnant and do not want to be, and thus help their children
to avoid death before birth and gain a better life after they
are born.   The largest single network of independent local programs,
CareNet, has headquarters in Sterling, Virginia.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Bethany Christian Services cuts through the adoption bureaucracy
as well as anyone, and also is willing to do transracial adoptions
at a time when some organizations still look at skin color rather
than character. About half of the states have Bethany organizations;
national headquarters are in Grand Rapids.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>KidsHope, based in Spring Lake, Michigan but now expanding
nationwide, leads members of congregations to become tutors and
mentors of children in poor communities.  Children receive significant
help and church members learn to reach out successfully.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Boys Town, based in Omaha but now expanded to several states,
has a series of programs for children and families in crisis;
family-style homes for abandoned and abused children are the most
intensive.  Boys Town's proven system gives people with ordinary
parenting skills the ability to handle troubled kids.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Teen Challenge, headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, has
more than 140 local chapters around the country devoted to helping
young people escape addiction or alcoholism. Teen Challenge leaders,
generally ex-addicts themselves, understand that people do drugs
or get drunk daily because they have holes in their souls that
only God can fill.
</UL>

<P>
  
<P>
 But what about the children?  That is a good question to ask
throughout the year and especially at Christmas, when we celebrate
the birth of a child who came into the world to suffer with us
(that is the literal meaning of compassion) and die for us.  It
is wonderful to see volunteers throughout the country who give
of themselves sacrificially.  And it is a great mistake to be
panicked into supporting bureaucratic programs that present &quot;buy
one, get one&quot; offers:  Here's bread, but along with it you
have to swallow a stone.

<P><p><P>
 It's still trendy among liberals to link homelessness with supposed
government cuts in social services.  Nattering about Newt in the
mid-90s has replaced the roaring about Reaganism that characterized
the early-80s, but the message is the same:  Budget dips sink
ships.  The truth is different:  Many of the lives sinking in
recent years had holes cut into their hulls 25 years ago, during
liberalism's golden age.
<P>
 Take as a case study the story of Rudy Jones, 45.  He grew up
in a middle class household in the District and as a teenager
reacted, 60s-style, to school &quot;regimentation.&quot; He became
a voracious reader of political thrillers and worked for Hubert
Humphrey's campaign in 1968.  Then he went to college, where drugs
were more important than studies, and learned about LSD, speed
and surrealistic painting.
<P>
 After college Mr. Jones moved to Los Angeles and &quot;tried
to get into the film business.  That's where I really got into
some fast circles.  I was doing a lot of powdered cocaine out
there.&quot;  The infantilized gratification-seeking that characterized
late-sixties politics and culture stayed with him as he moved
back to Washington and worked at a television station as a production
technician and then as film and tape editor.  
<P>
 By 1984, Cal Ripken, Jr. thirty miles to the north had already
begun his streak of showing up for work day after day, but it
was hard for a child of the sixties to be an iron man.  A stripper
in a strip-tease joint in 1984 introduced Jones to crack cocaine,
which he had heard of before as a drug that led middle class people
to &quot;sell their houses and break up their lives.&quot;  He
had scoffed at such reports, but when he took his first hit &quot;the
bells were going off in the center of my brain.&quot;
<P>
 Jones had learned during the sixties to satisfy his impulses,
and he spent the mid-80s turning theory into practice.  More cocaine,
more disintegration in his life: &quot;It was like a slow motion
train wreck.  A big long pile up.&quot;  Unable to work consistently
because of his drug use, Jones left his job in 1988 and began
a series of freelance assignments that would give him the money
for crack without the obligation of regular labor.  
<P>
 The culmination came in September, 1994, when he received a check
for $1500 from a public television station: &quot;I just went
nuts. Didn't sleep or eat for four days in a row, doing crack
all the time.  That's when I realized I needed to do something
drastic.&quot;   Drastic for Jones was entering a live-in, anti-addiction
program at the Gospel Mission at 810 Fifth St., N.W.
<P>
   Ironically, it was sixties reasoning -- don't think about right
and wrong, just show me where I can get a buzz -- that led him
into a program built on right and wrong:  Jones based his decision
to enter the Gospel Mission not on faith in Christ, but on research
showing that religious anti-addiction programs are more successful
than others:  &quot;I wanted to get results, I didn't care how.&quot;
 
<P>
 Pragmatism changed to awe as Jones went through the Gospel Mission's
Bible studies and counseling programs, however. The transformation,
he says, began when he stopped thinking of God as &quot;a bunch
of physics laws&quot; and started to see Him as &quot;a personal
entity that man could relate to.&quot;  Suddenly he could pray,
for he knew that God was listening.  Suddenly there was purpose
that went outside self-pleasing, for God was watching.  Suddenly
there was power to change, because God was helping.
<P>
 After five months Jones felt &quot;completely changed.&quot;
 When I interviewed him in February, 1995, he spoke of no longer
living for each day's pleasures, as he had done since the 1960s,
but dying to self -- seeing God rather than man as the center
of things. 
<P>
 
<P>
 Complete changes sometimes short-circuit; time heals all wounds
and also tests all spiritual swoons.  I've checked on Rudy Jones:
 He has stayed clean this year and was judged ready to move out
of the Gospel Mission in order to live with and care for his mother,
who is now in her 80s and in need of help.  He's working in telecommunications
and volunteering twice a week to teach English and writing to
newcomers at the Mission.   Stuck in the sixties for three decades,
he has finally grown up.  And its time that the apologists for
infantilism did so also.

 The Hebrew and Greek words for &quot;envy&quot; are used 23 times
in the Bible.  They are used negatively 22 times, positively once
-- when the apostle Paul in Romans 11:14 hopes that the good lives
of Christians will arouse non-believers to constructive envy.
<P>
 Calvin Trillin, author of the hilarious food book <U>American
Fried</U>, presents his own version of constructive envy concerning
ordering in restaurants.  Do not study the menu, he says, or discourse
endlessly with the waiter; instead, see someone at an adjacent
table who is stuffing his face with great joy, point at him and
his food, and tell the waiter, &quot;I want some of that.&quot;
<P>
 Constructive envy.
<P>
 Sitting in a room at the Gospel Mission on 810 Fifth St. N.W.,
41-year-old Jerry Minor opens the furnace door of his past and
looks into hell.  &quot;I couldn't -- I couldn't hold a job,&quot;
he recalls.  &quot;Drugs and alcohol.&quot; Mr. Minor started
using heroin and cocaine when he was 19, was married at 22, and
over the next few years turned from &quot;recreational use&quot;
into a drug-focused wreck of a man.
<P>
 Mrs. Minor accepted the occasional use, but as it mastered Minor
and he became unable to hold a job or act decently in the home,
she &quot;just couldn't put up with it anymore&quot; and left
in 1984.  Minor hit the streets, selling crack cocaine and heroin
but not netting much cash in the process, &quot;because I was
using as much as I was making. Most of the money went right back
into my body.&quot; 
<P>
 He was also &quot;off and on&quot; in jail for selling drugs.
 When not behind bars he would see his wife and children every
few weeks; she would plead with him to stop doing drugs, but &quot;it
was just beyond my control to stop.&quot; He sometimes stayed
at big, government-funded homeless shelters, but he found there
&quot;a lot of the same things that I was always doing.  A lot
of drugs, a lot of fights.&quot;  
<P>
 Minor walked into the Gospel Mission in 1992 -- out of desperation,
not belief.  &quot;I was tired of doing the things that I was
doing.  I was tired of going in and out of jail.  And that was
it.  The shelters fed me and clothed me but they gave me no rest.
 I was just tired, you know?&quot;  He was also functionally illiterate,
and deciding it was time to do something about that.
<P>
 At the Gospel Mission, constructive envy started to set in. 
&quot;I started seeing other people accepting the Lord, and realized
they were getting better. I wanted some of that, because I had
tried everything else. And there were people here showing me that
they cared about me.  People helped me with the Bible, helped
me understand the Bible.  And it was the grace of God that finally
did it.&quot;
<P>
 Three years later, Minor is working as a drug counselor at the
Gospel Mission.  He could never be licensed by the government:
 He doesn't have the classroom hours, and his reading still isn't
very good. (A volunteer tutor works with him regularly.) But he
knows the tricks of the drug trade and isn't easily taken in by
scams; he's stood up to bullies before and isn't easily possessed
by fear; he's learned to live with little and isn't readily subject
to greed. 
<P>
 There's still a long way to go for Jerry Minor.  He's working
on his relationship with his children.  (His ex-wife has since
remarried.) He's still working on his 3-R skills.  But &quot;now
he's a leader,&quot; says Gospel Mission staff psychologist Molly
Soper.  &quot;The men look up to him, and new ones come in see
that he's getting it together in a way they have not.&quot; 
<P>
 Constructive envy.  It doesn't happen when homeless men are thrown
together into a shelter that enables their self-destruction by
supplying needs regardless of behavior.  It doesn't happen when
men forget that right and wrong do have meaning, and that not
all life styles are equal.
<P>
 But when it does set in -- because truly compassionate people
have structured a challenging environment in which  the desire
to change is watered daily -- constructive envy does not enable
people to wallow as they are.  It changes them.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>Introduction &amp;  Summary</h2>
</center><blockquote>
<P>
 America is in the midst of  an historic period of  dynamic change
and opportunity driven by a transformation of  technology.  In
1995, one half of all capital investment in America, broadly defined,
will be in computers and telecommunications equipment. The telecommunications
industry already constitutes one seventh of our economy and is
growing.  By the early 21st century, the global information industry
is expected to be a $3 trillion market.  Yet the government statutory
and regulatory system now in place was erected in the 1930s during
the New Deal and embodies the limits and technological realities
of a long-vanished era.
<P>
 To seize the opportunities of the knowledge age, a new, modern
and efficient governmental role with respect to telecommunications
is needed.  Government can, and indeed should, perform certain
tasks.  This report is an effort to identify and focus on the
essential governmental functions needed for America to enter the
new century -- and to cleanse the detritus of the past.  Many
current governmental institutions and regulations are relics of
past practices and  seek to perform tasks better performed by
competitive markets.  The report has a simple goal: to provide
for a modern and effective government to complement market forces
to speed the development of  new products and services for Americans.
<P>
 The new, smaller government role (hereafter the 'Replacement
Model') is based on a functional analysis of what a government
should be for a digital era of the 1990s and beyond.  A functional
analysis reveals certain overarching principles which are applied
by the Replacement Model.  Conceptually, a functional analysis
supports a government role for ensuring parity of  opportunity
 across media such as wireline, cellular, broadcast, DBS and video
dialtone.  The success of any one company or even industry should
reflect their inherent attributes rather than their relative regulatory
handicaps.  With respect to mission, the Replacement Model will
provide for a new Office of Communications (the &quot;OC&quot;)
to be located within an existing Executive Branch agency.  
<P>
 The OC will concentrate on the following tasks: (1) overseeing
the implementation of a transition from the current practice of
universal service based on hidden and elaborate cross-subsidies
to a smaller, more efficient and targeted needs -- based system;
(2) overseeing the mass privatization of  spectrum to the American
people through a sequenced, phased-in  auction process; (3) coordinating
a non-interference standard to govern the private sector's use
of spectrum; and (4) coordinating U.S. international commitments
and opportunities for telecommunications. Supporting the new,
more focused  governmental role will be an emphasis on traditional
antitrust enforcement utilizing existing expertise and personnel
located within the U.S. Department of Justice. 
<P>
 The Replacement Model offers a detailed and  specific action
plan for the transition to a the new, modern government.  Existing
statutes, rules and regulations are either eliminated immediately,
subject to a three year sunset provision, or retained and re-assigned
to the Replacement Model's Office of Communications.  At the end
of the sunset period, those rules and regulations deemed necessary
by the OC to promote economic welfare through competition will
be retained only by affirmative action of Congress.
<P>
 Part One of this report establishes the case for replacing and
modernizing the existing regulatory regime. The focus is on the
systemic influence of  regulations and statutes which authorize
the Federal Communications Commission (&quot;FCC&quot;) and have
inflicted staggering costs upon American consumers and the economy.
 The report recognizes that other restrictions arising from federal/state
mechanisms such as the Modified Final Judgment (&quot;MFJ&quot;)
 settlement also have had an impact on competition.  
<P>
 The systemic problem, however, remains that the statutes, rules
and regulations underlying the FCC have denied through intrusive
regulation the U.S. economy tens of billions of dollars in annual
growth. Current public servants may be dedicated and hard working.
 It is the system itself which in some measure mandates that the
FCC engage in certain practices and procedures which block new
products and services such as cable TV, microwave, cellular, voice
mail, video dialtone and new personal communications services.
For decades these technologies have been denied Americans while
the FCC struggled to decide what to allow to the consumer.  Price
competition has been stymied and business costs ultimately borne
by the American public have been needlessly inflated by a plethora
of entry, ownership and contractual regulations of telephone and
media markets. Part One details the history of this structural
obstruction of technology and competition.
<P>
 Resolving the economic imbalances imposed by universal service
is a key ingredient to any meaningful reform proposal.  Basic
dialtone telephone service for those truly in need is an essential
element to a sustainable modernization of government's role. 
Part Two offers two approaches to providing basic service for
those truly in need.  The approaches make the actual price of
phone service open and clear to the American people.  Currently,
a hidden tax is imposed on all through various subsidies.  Urban
users subsidize rural users. Business and long-distance rates
subsidize residential rates. Much of the money is paid to companies,
not consumers.  Many of the well-to-do get subsidized.   The current
system imposes burdens on those allegedly it seeks to help --
those financially less well off.  An urban, single parent family
on government assistance programs today actually subsidizes the
phone bills of  rural users -- even if the rural user calls from
a ski chalet or vacation home  straight out of  <I>Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous.</I>
<P>
  Moreover, no one knows what the subsidies cost despite the billions
of dollars in the system because the lack of accountability destroys
incentives to economize.  Like a Soviet-era good under Gosplan,
no one really pays the true cost of the phone services they use.
 The replacement model puts a halt to this muddle.  
<P>
 The model supports the claimed purpose of cross-subsidization,
promotion of so-called &quot;universal service,&quot; but in ways
that are more accountable, explicit and efficient.  Both plans
recognize a <I>national </I> interest in keeping basic phone service
affordable to all Americans.  The first model has three facets.
 First, the federal program to keep residential telephone rates
affordable in high cost areas would be limited to that amount
needed on a going forward basis to provide wireline service to
those areas.  Second, the model embraces use of  a specific, targeted
means test to provide assistance to those truly in need.  Third,
the responsibility for the remainder of the universal service
subsidies paid by interstate long distance callers would devolve
to the state level subject to broad federal guidelines.  Restoration
of market prices and efficient pricing will foster real competition
and result in substantially lower prices.
<P>
 The second approach proposes that the responsibility for maintaining
universal service be transferred to the states.   Those local
exchange costs that are now allocated to the interstate jurisdiction
are returned to the respective states.  Each state could recover
those costs as deemed fit, subject to federal guidelines.  Under
this model, federal law would  pre-empt entry restrictions and
prohibit discriminatory treatment of interstate users for comparable
services. 
<P>
 Both approaches are subject to strict federal guidelines forbidding
price discrimination and requiring interconnection for all competitors.
 Moreover, the Replacement Model continues the federal pre-emption
of state regulation of wireless services.
<P>
 In Part Three, the Replacement Model promotes American competitiveness
through a modern approach to use of  the spectrum. Spectrum is
transferred to private hands in a sequenced,  phased-in approach.
 In Phase One, those with current licenses in spectrum are granted
title to the spectrum currently used.  These owners of spectrum
, the vast majority of whom have already purchased their stations,
will be free to use, transfer and develop spectrum as they deem
necessary.   Property rights in spectrum will be enforced through
traditional legal protections afforded all property owners in
the courts. Under this approach, industry would also have recourse
to the OC for interference issues and use of laboratories for
testing and evaluation of new equipment and technologies.
<P>
 In Phase Two, applications pending before the FCC as of May 1,
1995,  would be granted title to the spectrum on an expedited
basis.  In addition, the OC will on an expedited basis, begin
to roll-out non-allocated spectrum for the presumptive 
<P>
use by private sector entities seeking its use.  Competing bids
for the spectrum will be subject to expedited auction.  This bottom-up,
demand-driven process will allow market forces to determine spectrum
use and jump start competition and technological innovation. 

<P>
 In Phase Three, the government will begin the process of turning
over its spectrum to the private sector by beginning an expedited
survey of available spectrum bands, establishing standardized
parcels for entrants to claim.  The government currently presides
over massive amounts of under-utilized spectrum far in excess
of its needs for possible use by the Department of Defense, NASA,
etc. 
<P>
 In Phase Four, the government will  permit claimants to claim
title to available spectrum as identified in the spectrum survey.
In the event that there are multiple claimants for a particular
parcel of spectrum, an auction will be held.  Each department
making the spectrum available that is subject to an auction will
retain a portion of auction proceeds for modernization to more
efficient digital equipment, re-location expenses and for current
operations.  Remaining auction proceeds can be dedicated to deficit
reduction.
<P>
 The premise again is that spectrum use will be dictated by the
American people, not the government.  The Replacement Model envisions
a governmental role for coordinating &quot;spectrum contours,&quot;
&quot;overlay rights&quot; and &quot;band management rights&quot;
but mandates that these rights be defined quickly and made available
for private investors willing to risk capital in developing new
wireless services.  The key is to sell title in property, not
mere licenses.  Those who claim unchallenged use of identified
parcels or bid and win title to spectrum are free to develop and/or
re-sell the spectrum as with any other private property right
subject to antitrust review and the geographic and interference
boundaries of property assignments.  The primary goal of these
spectrum reforms is the rapid and efficient creation of a spectrum
market and to provide an economic stimulus in job creation.  Recent
announcements by the government confirmed that auctioning spectrum
can also have a supplemental benefit of raising billions in revenue
for deficit reduction.
<P>
  Finally, Part Four sets out a detailed and specific plan for
implementing the Replacement Model's recommendations.   It re-assigns
and re-organizes the functions now performed by the FCC.  The
goal is to focus on the critical tasks for today and the future.
 Government unquestionably should fulfill some functions and services
for the benefit of all Americans.  Others should be eliminated
immediately. A third residual category of FCC rules and regulations
would be sunsetted in three years.
<P>
  The Replacement Model  updates government to account for the
differences between the analog past and the technologies now emerging
through market forces.  For sixty years, the government substituted
administrative, bureaucratic decision-making for the free market.
 Two old, major assumptions -- (1) the existence of a &quot;natural
monopoly&quot; in telecommunications; and (2) the assumption that
technology would remain essentially static or unchanging -- are
untenable for the 21st century.  The model makes a clear break
with the past, embracing competition with antitrust enforcement
and by transferring authority to the states in those instances
when monopoly regulation remains temporarily necessary. The new
role for government is leaner, more cost effective and serves
the American people.   This, then,  is a call to action to meet
the challenges of the telecommunications revolution -- an American
opportunity.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>Part One: The Regulatory Roadblock to the Telecom Revolution</h2>
</center>

<P>

<B>Overview</B>
<P>
 The failure of telecommunications regulation is systemic to the
regulatory structure created by and under the Communications Act
of 1934.  Regulation has been prone to wasteful delay, costly
and unnecessary intrusion on market processes without due regard
for regulation's unintended effects, and abuse of process by special
interests.  These problems are not linked to any particular FCC.
 Rather they span the decades and continue to this day.  Nor are
the hard work and many hours spent by public servants in the FCC
a factor in improving the situation.  It is systemic. In light
of the accelerated pace of technological change and heightened
global competition, the ill effects of this system are increasingly
unacceptable.   
<P>
 The FCC's processes have been prone to delay for three reasons.
 First, considerable delay results simply from good old fashioned
 bureaucratic practices. The Commission's processing of licenses
and formal complaints take inordinately long.  Second, centralized
decision making by regulators dealing with complicated issues
better left to market forces leads to wasteful regulatory vacillation.
 As explained below, the agency's back-and-forth handling of basic
regulatory questions has been extensive.  Third, some of the regulatory
functions assigned to or assumed by the FCC functions duplicate
responsibilities of federal antitrust and other authorities. 
This duplication complicates the review of matters such as telecommunications
and represents needless expense.   
<P>
 Over time, the regulatory system has expanded its regulatory
authority to address problems it did not fully understand in ways
fraught with unintended effects.  Through the financial interest
and syndication and prime time access rules, the FCC attempted
to increase diversity in television programming by attempting
to shift profits from the television networks to Hollywood producers.
 Instead, it simply created a bonanza for game-show producers.
 Through its so-called fairness doctrine, it justified encroachment
on broadcasters' First Amendment rights without due regard for
the chilling of speech.  In the late 1960s and 1970s, the FCC
dramatically increased the tax on interstate long-distance service,
lowering residential telephone rates artificially for the rich
and poor alike.  Perhaps most costly of all, the FCC's top-down
management of the electromagnetic spectrum frustrated the development
of new broadcast stations, television networks and innumerable
&quot;wireless&quot; radio services.  
<P>
 Lastly, the FCC's regulatory process has lent itself to abuse
by existing firms and special interests resistant to competition.
 Using regulatory processes against one's existing or potential
 competitors is a temptation few businesses and almost no trade
association can resist.  The perennial loser of this &quot;gaming&quot;
of the regulatory system has been the American public.  For example,
if the Commission had authorized phone companies to begin competing
directly against cable in 1984, cable consumers would have saved
between $3 and $7 billion annually between 1983 and 1992.  Likewise,
the FCC-imposed delay in licensing cellular telephony cost America
$85 billion in growth and consumption.  
<P>
 The case for reforming and replacing this  failed regulatory
regime is compelling.  Over the last two decades the FCC moved
laboriously -- sometimes in the face of political opposition from
Congress and sometimes after prodding from the courts -- to open
markets to competition and to reform existing regulation. Despite
these steps, the systemic problems persist.   Delay through regulatory
gaming is still the order of the day.  For example, in the past
it was AT&amp;T who opposed opening the long distance and equipment
markets to competition and broadcasters who stymied competition
from cable TV systems.  Today, it is MCI and other long distance
carriers who oppose AT&amp;T's efforts to compete, it is the cable
companies who oppose telephone companies' efforts to compete in
video markets, and it is the broadcasters who oppose satellite-delivered
radio services.  
<P>
 In numerous cases the FCC continues costly regulation and intrudes
on business decision making that could be much better handled
by market forces or state government.  For example, federal price
regulation of the long-distance market is counterproductive. 
Virtually all of the existing broadcast regulation imposed unnecessary
costs ultimately borne by the American viewing public.  Most of
the spectrum remains hostage to bureaucratic gridlock. 
<P>
 The case for radical transformation is even more compelling now
given that the market power rationale for much of this regulatory
intervention has largely disappeared. The telephone industry used
to be a monopoly; but the main segment of that industry under
the FCC's jurisdiction  long-distance service  has become highly
rivalrous.  Although some experts disagree on the current extent
of competition in local telephone service, most would agree that
full competition in the local loop is both feasible and highly
likely.  The broadcast industry used to be oligopolistic; now
the number of broadcasters has burgeoned and they compete vigorously
with cable and direct broadcast satellites.  An invigorated &quot;wireless
cable&quot; (MMDS) industry supplies additional competition, and
telephone companies will enter video markets in the near future.

<P>
  If America's regulatory and statutory regime for telecommunications
dates back to the Communications Act of 1934,  it is helpful to
recall that in 1934 the telegraph still was the dominant form
of communications for Americans. Enacted in the midst of the Great
Depression, the 1934 Act today is defended after the fact by the
following assumptions: (i) a natural monopoly existed in the telecommunications
industry, warranting price-and-entry federal regulation; (ii)
broadcast spectrum , both radio and TV, was scarce and required
federal oversight; and (iii) the analog technologies of the day
dictated the form and function of communications. At that time
only a telephone let people communicate point to point; only a
radio broadcast, for example, could reach out to many.  None of
these assumptions holds true today.   We are now in an era of
accelerating innovation moving towards digital technologies in
 the 21st century:
<UL>
<LI><B>Competition, not monopolies. </B>Introduction of microwave,
fiber optics, cellular, digital cellular, co-axial cable, satellite
and the new personal communications services/personal communications
networks (&quot;PCS/PCN&quot;) mean that competition, rather than
natural monopoly, better characterizes the telecommunications
 industry.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Abundance, not scarcity. </B>The future is and will be
characterized by abundance, not scarcity. Over the wireline, the
capacity to transmit data (&quot;bandwidth&quot;) is doubling
every five years. A fiber in the new fiber optic networks can
carry in 1995 simultaneously 37,500 separate conversations.  The
marginal cost of  transmitting a call is literally zero.
<P>Wireless spectrum also is characterized by new abundance.
 New digital techniques<B> </B>known as Code Division Multiple
Access (&quot;CDMA&quot;)  present a massive wideband increase
in efficient use of spectrum.
<P>In broadcast fields, other compression techniques and advances
in spectrum management open up huge segments of spectrum for commercial,
educational and public applications.
<P>The old approach of the government husbanding scarce spectrum
and tightly regulating its use no longer has a valid basis.  

<LI><B>Flexibility in transmission, not limits.  </B>Digital signals,
consisting of 1s and 0s, do not define and are not characterized
by the devices through which the signals are transmitted. Telephone
calls, faxes, or TV broadcasts can be sent and received by any
variety of platforms, processed by on- board microprocessors.
 Video can be sent into the American home <I>via </I>coax cable,
wireless, satellite direct digital broadcast, or over the telephone
line. Telephone calls can be cellular/ wireless, sent over the
telephone line or through a Cable TV coax cable. In all instances,
how the digital transmissions are sent and the means they are
received do not change the nature of the transmission.  
<P>The 1s and 0s are the same.  The analog technology of the
1934 Act could not offer that flexibility.  A telephone had to
make a phone call.  A radio had to receive a broadcast, etc. 
The 1934 Act's separate provisions for wireline telephones, radio
broadcasts, etc. are obsolete and reflect the limits of analog
technologies. 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
 Despite the rapid growth of competition in all sectors of the
industry, the FCC continues to expand.  At present, the Commission
has over 2,200 full-time employees. Its budget for 1995 is $185
million.  Adjusted for inflation, the Commission's budget fell
6.5 percent during the Reagan Administration.  It rose over 56
percent during the Bush and Clinton Administrations.  In the two
most recent fiscal years, the Commission's budget increased a
total of 35 percent. The Clinton Administration has proposed a
budget for fiscal year 1996 of $224 million, a 62 percent increase
over bloated 1994 levels.
<P>
[FIGURE 1]
<P>
 The Commission's staff has grown from 1,753 full-time employees
in 1993, to a proposed 2,271 for 1996  a 30 percent increase in
three years.  The Common Carrier Bureau employs 270 people, and
spends an estimated $22 million a year.  The Mass Media Bureau
employs 335 employees, spending an estimated $27 million a year.
 The Cable Services Bureau has 223 employees; its 1995 budget
was about $18 million.  About 865 people, or more than 40 percent
of FCC staff, provide &quot;executive direction and support.&quot;
 Nearly 40 percent are engaged in &quot;non-feeable&quot; activities
that cannot be linked to any specific regulatory program.
<P>
 <I><B>The Challenge.  </B></I>Apart from budgetary savings, transforming
telecommunications regulation will create an enormous opportunity
for America.  The pace of technical change and global competition
have accelerated.  The faster the potential rate of innovation,
the greater care that must be taken to assure that regulations
designed to address outmoded monopoly concerns do not have the
unintended effect of retarding innovation.  Likewise, the globalization
of markets and economic liberalization of Soviet bloc and developing
countries have heightened the competition facing U.S. companies.
 At the turn of the century, a country growing at 4 percent per
year would have been considered to have a high growth rate.  Now
something closer to 10 percent would be in order.  Starting in
1780, it took Britain 60 years to double its output per person.
 Beginning in 1880, Japan achieved this feat in 34 years.  Starting
in 1966, South Korea did it in 11 years.  
<P>
 Our country is poised to take advantage of tremendous opportunities
for economic growth and social development through reform of the
government's role in regulating the telecommunications industry.
 At stake is our ability to compete and prosper in an international
information market that is projected to exceed $3 trillion by
the close of the decade.  Our entrepreneurial culture, openness
to innovation and acceptance of robust competition give American
concerns a comparative advantage.  America's technical resurgence,
especially in the digital arena, provides a basis for reforming
its telecom regulatory regime to provide a powerful springboard
to greater technical advance and levels of prosperity.  The chief
obstacle in the way is unnecessary, increasingly costly, regulation.
<P>
 <I><B>The FCC's Performance.  </B></I>The rest of Part One details
some of the regulatory system's &quot;highlights&quot;.  The FCC's poor performance here in part is a symptom of  the regulatory
regime mandated by the 1934 Act.  We consider its processes for
licensing wires and spectrum and its program content. We end by
reviewing wasteful regulatory vacillation,  the complaint process
and duplicative functions.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>1.1 Licensing</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>Section 214 of the 1934 Communications
Act gives the FCC broad power to license wireline facilities and
services used in interstate common carriage.  No facilities may
be deployed or operated without the FCC's advance approval.  The
FCC licenses use of the airwaves too, under section 307 of the
Act.  The Commission allocates frequencies to various uses, and
assigns them to specific users.  Cable facilities, by contrast,
are licensed by local authorities; the Commission exercises only
general oversight over the franchising process.
<P>
 Across the board, the Commission's licensing process is characterized
by procrastination, equivocation and seemingly endless delay.
 Unnecessary delay in issuing licenses ultimately found to be
in the public interest imposes enormous costs on the industry
and the national economy.  It particularly increases the risk
and cost of introducing new technologies.  While the FCC equivocates
about issuing new licenses, the market waits.  If a $20 billion
a year industry develops five years later than it might have because
of unnecessary FCC delays in issuing the needed licenses, the
American public pays  in lost services and jobs.
<P>
 <I><B>a. Licensing wires</B></I><B>.  </B>The most surprising
fact about the licensing of interstate wires is that it is required
at all.  There is no obvious reason why a federal commission must
approve every new deployment of equipment, wires or wireline services
that can arguably be characterized as &quot;interstate.&quot;
 As the long-distance telephone industry has demonstrated, entry
can be completely deregulated with no adverse effects.  Nonetheless,
comprehensive licensing by the FCC remains the norm.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>1). </B><I> <B>Customer Premises Equipment</B> (CPE).</I>
 Until the 1960s, the FCC backed AT&amp;T's position that telephones
and other forms of customer premises equipment were an integral
part of &quot;telephone service,&quot; to be provided only by
the monopoly telephone company.  In 1956, for example, the Commission
agreed with AT&amp;T that the sale of the Hush-a-Phone  a small
plastic device that snapped onto the mouthpiece of the phone to
provide privacy  violated AT&amp;T's tariffs and was therefore
illegal.
<P>
 Today, the CPE market is fully competitive.  The market for telephone
handsets alone generates $750 million a year.  Assuming that competition
has driven prices in this market down by 20 percent (a reasonable
assumption) if the FCC had simply approved handset competition
in 1956, when the Hush-A-Phone sought to enter the market, consumers
could have saved several billions between 1956 and the late 1970s
when competition was allowed.
<P>
 These figures reflect what consumers might have saved if the
FCC had merely authorized competition in handset markets.  The
overall market for CPE  including PBXs, key systems, voice processing
equipment, teleconferencing equipment, telephones and fax machines
 generated $16 billion in 1994.  One can only speculate as to
how much more consumers would have saved if the FCC had approved
competition in all CPE markets generally a decade or two before
it did.  What is clear is that in this single market, FCC licensing
delays cost consumers billions of dollars.
<P>
<B>2). <I>Long-distance Services</I></B>.  The Commission's
forty-year effort to protect AT&amp;T from long-distance competitors
tells a similar story.  The FCC grudgingly permitted limited private-line
competition in 1969, six years after MCI filed its first request
to do so.  The Commission rejected subsequent attempts by MCI
to expand its offerings in 1975, and to interconnect with AT&amp;T
in 1978.  On both occasions, MCI had to go to the D.C. Circuit
Court of Appeals to win those rights.
<P>
 Today, long-distance is a $65 billion market, more than double
its 1978 size.  Both the FCC and Department of Justice maintain
that competition in long-distance markets has spurred innovation
and pushed prices sharply down.  To the extent this is so, the
Commission's decades-long policy of <I>forbidding</I> competition
in long-distance markets once again cost consumers tens of billions
of dollars had the FCC fully opened long-distance markets in 1968,
rather than in 1978.
<P>
 The FCC's regulation of the competitive process in the long distance
market has also denied consumers the benefits of robust competition.
  Throughout the 1980s, the FCC stymied efforts by the incumbent
carrier to cut prices in the face of competition.   When it eventually
allowed AT&amp;T to respond by introducing optional calling plans
in the residential market and tariff 12 and contract offerings
in the business market, prices fell substantially.  Amazingly,
long-distance carriers continue to operate under difficult notice
and tariff requirements.  Just this year, MCI intervened to delay
reductions in tariffs that would have given consumers discounts
up to 50%.  MCI contended that the rates were too low. The delay
in introducing the plan, which was finally approved, cost consumers
an estimated $30 million. Generally, had competition been permitted
to reduced interstate rates by 10 percent, consumers would have
saved tens of billions of  dollars.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>3). <I>Enhanced Services</I></B>.  The Commission's
two-decade crusade against the provision of &quot;enhanced services&quot;
by telephone companies has imposed yet another layer of costs.
 From the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, the Commission enforced
a policy of &quot;maximum separation&quot; between &quot;basic&quot;
voice services and network-based data processing, electronic services,
and computers.  The Commission did not back away from this quarantine
until 1986, and did not allow AT&amp;T or the Bell Companies to
provide enhanced services directly until 1992.  Today, enhanced
services comprise a $13.6 billion market.  Phone companies compete
head-to-head with independent providers to deliver enhanced services
like voice mail to consumers.
<P>
 It is impossible to estimate precisely what this unnecessary
quarantine has cost consumers.  But the single example of voice
mail demonstrates that the costs were staggering.  Today, phone
companies provide voice-mail services at roughly $5 a month per
mailbox, to roughly ten million customers.  This single service
alone is thus a $600 million a year industry in the U.S. economy.
 Yet the market scarcely existed at all until phone companies
were finally authorized to serve it.  Though the technology was
available in the 1970s, if not earlier, FCC permission to deploy
it did not come until 1988.  The cost to the economy from the
Commission's delay in authorizing these services has been estimated
to approximate $6 billion.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>4). <I>Cable TV</I></B>.  In 1958, the Commission
declared that it had no jurisdiction over cable television; cable
was viewed as a strictly local matter.  The Commission revisited
the issue in 1959 and again disclaimed jurisdiction.  In 1962,
the FCC decided it would regulate cable, but only indirectly,
through the microwave systems used to import distant television
signals.  The FCC adopted a more general cable policy in 1965,
still relying on its authority over microwave common carriers.
 Finally, the Commission announced it had full jurisdiction over
cable after all, because cable competed with television.
<P>
 The Commission did not wade into the threshold business of franchising
local cable networks; it left that to local authorities.  Instead,
as described below, the Commission set out general rules for what
cable systems could or must carry, simply to limit cable competition
against established broadcasters.
<P>
 Cable today is a $23 billion a year industry.  Once again, it
is impossible to quantify with precision what consumers lost by
Commission policies that aimed to suppress cable for the benefit
of broadcasters.  But given the high value consumers place on
television programming,  the Commission-imposed drag on competition
certainly cost consumers billions of dollars in the 1960s and
1970s.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>5). <I>Video Dialtone</I></B><I> (VDT)</I>.  In 1970,
the FCC put in place rules to exclude phone companies from the
provision of video programming and cable television.  In 1987
it suggested that the policy might be inhibiting competition and
began to reevaluate it.  The reevaluation occupied the Commission
for five years.  In 1992 the Commission again declared its general
support for telco provision of video dialtone services.  Many
phone companies then filed for permission to provide commercial
services.  The Commission took another two years to approve the
first such application.
<P>
 In the few markets where a second cable company has challenged
the first, cable television rates are 20 to 30 percent lower than
in markets served by only a single provider.  If the Commission
had authorized phone companies to begin competing directly against
cable in 1984, and had phone companies actually entered at that
time, cable subscribers could have benefited from billions in
savings <I>a</I> <I>year</I> for the period from 1983 to 1992.
<P>
 The Replacement Model recognizes that federal licensing of both
common-carrier and cable wires and their uses is now obsolete.
 State regulators already oversee the physical deployment of facilities
along public rights of way.  State authorities likewise regulate
the prices charged by local phone companies in areas where the
phone companies are still deemed to possess monopoly power.  The
FCC's role in licensing wireline facilities is now simply an expensive
anachronism, one that costs the economy enormously in lost competition
and yields no concomitant benefits whatsoever.  The Replacement
Model addresses this by updating the 1934 Act specifically in
Part Four, sharply reducing any federal role in licensing and
therefore slowing the introduction of the wireline facilities.
 
<P>
 <B>b.  <I>Licensing spectrum</I>. </B>Licensing of spectrum presents
somewhat different problems.  Two adjacent radio stations cannot
broadcast on the same frequencies simultaneously; rules or property
rights of some kind are needed to prevent interference.  The Commission
licenses spectrum to private users for fixed periods of time.
 With few exceptions, the licenses are given away; they are not
sold.
<P>
 Protracted delays in issuing licenses cost both industry and
consumers enormously.  And the Commission seldom issues licenses
cleanly; there are almost always many strings attached.  These
prescriptions impose additional, large costs on the economy and
consumer welfare.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>1). <I>Radio and Television</I></B>.  The introduction
of both FM radio and television was delayed by years of FCC equivocation
over which bands would be assigned to which uses.  FM radio technology,
which was invented in 1933, was not in widespread use until the
1960s.  The modern television was exhibited by RCA in 1939, but
the FCC took years to adopt initial standards.  The FCC then froze
all applications for TV licenses until 1952.  In the year after
the freeze was ended, the number of stations tripled. However,
a 1952 FCC decision deliberately limited the number of viable
stations per market  and impeded the creation of additional TV
networks at enormous cost to the American viewing public.
<P>
 Licensing radio transmitters of every kind remains one the Commission's
largest and most time-consuming activities.  Between 1984 and
1994, the Commission designated 6,834 broadcast license applications
for hearing.  The administrative costs of those proceedings approached
$50 million over ten years.  Licensing broadcast applicants by
lottery would have cost the FCC just over $12 million; licensing
via auction would have cost just $2.4 million, in addition to
generating substantial revenue.
<P>
 But those numbers pale beside the costs society bears while it
waits for the FCC to get licenses out the door.  Judging from
the secondary market, broadcast licenses for AM radio, FM radio
and broadcast television are worth, in the aggregate, about $13
billion.  Direct broadcast satellite (DBS) spectrum is worth an
estimated $3 billion; MMDS spectrum is worth roughly $1 billion;
IVDS spectrum is worth over $200 million.  Spectrum, in short,
is an enormously valuable commodity  when it finally gets into
private hands.  In the aggregate, broadcast spectrum licenses
in use today are worth an estimated $17 billion.
<P>
 With a commodity this valuable, every year, every month, of delay
in putting it to productive use costs the economy enormously.
 If it just sits idle for a year, the economy suffers an irretrievable
loss.  If FCC licensing procedures were responsible for delaying
the movement of  spectrum into productive, private uses, the delays
would be responsible for reducing the broadcast industry's total
revenues by about $38 billion, and total economic output by a
substantial fraction of this $38 billion.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>2. <I>Cellular</I>.</B>  Cellular technology was first
conceived in 1947 by Bell Laboratories.  AT&amp;T was operating
its first experimental cellular telephone system in 1962, but
the FCC did not even get around to allocating spectrum for cellular
until 1974.  The first cellular licenses were not handed out until
1983.  Today, the cellular industry generates some $14.2 billion
in revenues a year.
<P>
 But the delays were much longer than a year.  Cellular service
could have been introduced a decade earlier; the technology was
in hand, and the only obstacle was FCC licensing.  Economists
estimate that the decade of delay cost  America roughly $85 billion.
<P>
 At a finer level of detail, the economy lost millions simply
because cellular licenses were issued through lengthy comparative
hearings rather than through quick auctions.  Comparative hearings
typically took 18 months.  In 1985, it was estimated that delays
of that order eroded the value of each cellular license by $90,000
and cost the government $20,000 per hearing in administrative
costs.  Extrapolated over the 60 licenses for which comparative
hearings were used, this method of license assignment cost the
economy roughly $9 million.  The remaining 1,400 cellular licenses
were assigned through a lottery process, which was estimated to
have delay and administrative costs of $67,000 per license; overall,
these lotteries thus cost the economy another $130 million in
1994 dollars.  Auctions, if used instead, could have saved the
economy more than $100 million. 
<P>
<I>  </I><B>3). <I>PCS</I>.</B>  The FCC's handling of Personal
Communication Services (&quot;PCS&quot;) licenses marked a significant
improvement over past practices.  But even here, unnecessary delays
have been very costly.  PCS services were introduced in the United
Kingdom in 1989.  That same year, the FCC received two petitions
for a PCS rulemaking.  In the more than five years since, fewer
than 150 of the nearly 3,500 broadband and narrowband PCS licenses
have actually been assigned.
<P>
 Assuming that PCS competition can push the price of wireless
phone service down by 20 percent, existing cellular consumers
would have realized more than $9 billion in savings if PCS licenses
had been assigned five years ago.  If PCS had added five millionnew wireless customers during that period, an additional gain
to the economy of more than $1.5 billion from subscriber revenue
would have been realized.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>4). <I>Subcarrier Channels</I></B>.  Radio and TV
stations can readily use interstitial bits of their spectrum to
transmit paging signals, electronic TV guides, and other kinds
of data.  The transmission of radio programming via subchannel
frequencies was developed as early as 1948.  The Commission did
not permit use of these frequencies for anything but broadcast
services until 1983.  In 1994, the subcarrier market was worth
$40 million.  Had the FCC decided in 1948 to permit unlimited
use of subcarrier frequencies, the economy would have gained hundreds
of millions of  dollars.
<P>
<I><B>  </B></I><B>5).  <I>Vertical Blanking Intervals</I></B><I>
(VBI)</I>.  Restrictions on another usable part of the broadcast
video signal  the vertical blanking interval (VBI)  have entailed
significant losses as well.  The VBI was first used in 1967. 
But for the next 16 years the FCC did not permit the VBI to be
used for anything but closed-captioning.  In 1983, the Commission
finally authorized television stations to begin offering teletext
services on the VBI; additional VBI communications services such
as data transmission, computer software delivery, and paging were
authorized in 1985.  Total dollar values for this market are unavailable,
but like FM subcarriers, the delay in permitting full use of VBI
technology imposed an unnecessary cost on the economy.  
<P>
<I>  </I><B>6).  <I>Spectrum Zoning</I></B>.  Sub-carrier channels
and the VBI illustrate a more general point: the FCC routinely
&quot;zones&quot; spectrum licenses.  Licensees may use the spectrum
only in the specific, designated ways approved by the Commission
at the outset.  A licensee that discovers a new way of squeezing
more transport out of its spectrum (as sub-carrier and VBI technologies
allow), or discovers an entirely new, more valuable way of using
the spectrum  must go back to the Commission for a new license
 and risk standing in line for years or even decades while the
Commission considers the matter.
<P>
 The gains from dezoning can be substantial.  A government study
concluded that if a single UHF television station in Los Angeles
were to shut down and transfer its spectrum to a third cellular
provider, the overall public gain would be about $1 billion over
eight years.  This study predates the PCS decision and assumes
that the introduction of the third provider would cause a 25 percent
reduction in prices.  What the PCS auctions indicate are that
markets will move spectrum to higher valued uses.  Another example
is  Nextel (formerly &quot;Fleet Call&quot;).  In 1991, Nextel
purchased approximately 9 MHz of spectrum for roughly $45 million
in the Los Angeles market to provide digital wireless telephone
service.
<P>
 The Replacement Model, in Part Three, identifies a procedure
to permit the American economy to capture gains by dezoning spectrum
licenses across the board.  The simple <I>deletion</I> of a few
lines of legal boilerplate from FCC spectrum licenses -- and a
streamlined &quot;rollout&quot; of spectrum for creative use by
the private sector -- could create a very substantial increase
in social welfare nationwide.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>1.2 Content and Program Regulation</h2>
</center><blockquote>
<P>
 <B>a. <I>Broadcast Program Formats. </I></B>Neither the Radio
Act of 1927 nor the Communications Act of 1934 expressly requires
broadcasters to provide specific kinds of programming or to serve
any particular constituency.  The Commission, however, spent decades
trying to prescribe program formats.
<P>
 In 1946, the FCC published its &quot;Public Service Responsibility
of Broadcast Licensees&quot;  the &quot;Blue Book.&quot;  In applying
for license renewals, broadcasters were to show they had provided
&quot;balanced program structure.&quot;  In 1960, the Commission
replaced the Blue Book with even more specific guidelines as to
what constituted a well balanced programming structure.  From
1970 to 1981, the FCC tried unsuccessfully to curtail its program
review. The D.C. Circuit disagreed a third time.  In 1981 the
Supreme Court at last agreed that the Commission could reasonably
leave program formats to the marketplace.  The Commission eliminated
certain programming guidelines for radio in 1981, and for broadcast
television in 1984. 
<P>
 The Commission continues to insist, however, that programming
respond to &quot;community needs.&quot;  FCC regulation superflously
requires every radio and television broadcaster to provide &quot;significant
programming&quot; to five or more community issues each quarter.
 The Prime Time Access Rule, promulgated in 1970, and modified
in 1974 and 1975, still requires network affiliates to devote
at least one of the four daily &quot;prime time&quot; hours to
non-network programming.
<P>
 The decades of Commission meddling with program formats have
served no demonstrably useful purpose at all.  Between 1934 and
1978, the Commission found only eighteen occasions not to renew
a license because of inadequate program service.  Its programming-related
license revocation rate was less than one station every two years.
 Indeed, it has only refused to renew 142 licenses in all, for
any reason.  The vast majority of license renewals are approved.
<P>
<I> <B>b.</B> <B>The Fairness Doctrine</B></I><B>.</B>  In an
effort to make the airwaves accessible to the largest variety
of voices, the Commission instituted the so-called &quot;Fairness
Doctrine&quot; in 1949.  Broadcasters were to offer access to
their facilities for the airing of opposing viewpoints.  In 1959,
these rules were partly codified by Congress in its &quot;equal
time&quot; amendments to section 315 of the Communications Act.
 In 1967, the FCC extended the doctrine to advertising, or at
least to cigarette advertising.  In 1974 the Commission retreated
from this position and exempted all commercial advertising except
for &quot;editorial advertisements.&quot;  In 1981, the FCC determined
the Fairness Doctrine was no longer in the public interest and
in 1987, repealed it.  During the course of nearly 40 years, the
Commission issued more than 20 orders in pursuit of this policy.
<P> <HR>

<P>
<B>The FCC on the Fairness Doctrine:</B>                                
<P>                                                                 
<B>1974:</B><I> [T]he First Amendment impels, rather than prohibits, governmental promotion of a system which will ensure that the public will be informed of the important issues which confront it. . .The purpose and foundation of the fairness doctrine is therefore that of the First Amendment itself.</I>  (48 F.C.C.2d at   
5-6)                                                             
                           <P>                                      
<B>1985:</B><I> [W]e no longer believe that the fairness doctrine, as a matter of policy, serves the public interest. . . Furthermore, we find that the fairness doctrine, in operation, actually inhibits the presentation of controversial issues of public importance to the detriment of the public and in degradation of the editorial prerogatives of broadcast journalists.</I>  (102       
F.C.C.2d at 147)                                                 
                                                                 
<B>1987:</B><I> [W]e are persuaded that the fairness doctrine is unconstitutional on its face.</I>  (2 F.C.C. Rec. at 5047).          

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<I> </I><B>c. <I>Cable Programming</I></B><I>.</I>  The Commission
has also spent three decades trying to dictate what kind of programming
should or should not be carried on cable.  In 1966, the FCC tried
to persuade Congress to prohibit cable from originating its own
programming.  Three years later the Commission embraced the opposite
position: larger cable systems were <I>required</I> to originate
their own local programming on at least one channel.  The rule
survived two months; the Eighth Circuit found that the Commission
lacked the authority to regulate cable this way.  The Supreme
Court eventually upheld the Commission's power to require cable
program origination, but expressed no view on the validity of
the content rules.  In 1974, however, the Commission deleted the
origination requirement entirely.  The 1984 Cable Act expressly
forbids the FCC from imposing any new requirements concerning
the content of cable television services.                    
<P>                                    
<HR>

<B>The FCC on Cable Program Origination:</B>                                          
                                                                               
<B>1966:</B><I> [W]e shall urge that Congress prohibit the origination of program or other material by a [cable] system.</I>  (2 F.C.C.2d at 787)                       
        <P>                                                                       
<B>1969:</B><I> [W]e have accordingly concluded that, at least for the present, [cable] operators should be eligible to engage in program origination, and encouraged or even required to do so.</I>  (20 F.C.C.2d at 206)                               
        <P>                                                                       
<B>1974:</B><I> [T]he Commission has concluded that the mandatory origination scheme is not likely to be the most effective means of fostering local expression in programming. . . .Accordingly, we have decided to eliminate the mandatory origination requirement.</I>  (49 F.C.C.2d at 1104)

 A second FCC rulemaking crusade has addressed the carriage of
broadcast stations on cable.  In 1965, the FCC issued its first
set of &quot;must carry&quot; rules, directing cable providers
to carry local broadcast signals.  It revised the rules in 1972.
 In 1985, the D.C. Circuit struck down the Commission's rules.
 The Commission immediately responded with a new set of rules.
 These were struck down again a year later.  In 1992, Congress
passed its own version of must-carry rules.  A three-judge district
court upheld the rules; the Supreme Court has remanded the case
for further factual findings.  Since 1965, the Commission has
issued 57 orders promulgating or affirming must-carry rules, acted
on hundreds of petitions for carriage by broadcasters and waiver
requests by cable operators, and been reversed on appeal twice.

<P>
 While it has tried to require cable to carry some broadcast stations,
the FCC has labored equally hard to forbid carriage of others.
 Rules were designed to outlaw &quot;leapfrogging&quot;  the importation
of a distant network affiliate rather than a nearby one.  In 1970,
the Commission proposed a new version of &quot;distant signal&quot;
rules, somewhat less restrictive than the old.  In 1972 the Commission
changed its regime yet again.  Almost before the ink had dried,
the FCC began to amend and backtrack.  In 1976, the FCC eliminated
the &quot;leapfrogging rules.&quot;
<P>
<I> </I><B>d. <I>Financial Syndication Rules (Fin-Syn)</I>.</B>
 For many years, the Commission labored to control the relationships
between television networks and suppliers of TV programming in
order to encourage more diverse programming.  The Commission initiated
its first rulemaking on the subject in 1965.  Five years later
it issued its financial interest and syndication (&quot;fin-syn&quot;)
rules, which barred the networks from selling network-produced
programming directly to independent stations and from acquiring
a financial interest in syndicated programming. 
<P>
 The Department of Justice followed in 1974 with an antitrust
suit against the three networks, which resulted in a consent decree
that largely incorporated the FCC's rules.  After those decrees
expired in 1991, the FCC tried to reinstitute a modified set of
rules; these were struck down by the Seventh Circuit.  In thirty
years, the Commission has come roughly full circle.  The networks
have as much leeway to purchase and sell programming in 1995 as
they had in 1965.  In the three decades in between, however, the
Commission significantly intruded on this process.  Along the
way it issued 15 major opinions and a comprehensive staff report,
and defended its action before federal appellate courts three
times.  During much of this period a comprehensive antitrust consent
decree addressed precisely the same concerns and both were based
on misguided notions of network power over program supply.
<P>
 The Replacement Model, in Part Four, <I>infra</I>, proposes immediate
elimination or in a few instances sunsetting all program content
regulations.  Media markets are competitive today and will be
still more rivalrous tomorrow.   Content regulation is unnecessary,
counterproductive, and runs afoul of the First Amendment rights
of speakers.

<h2>1.3 Wasteful Vacillation</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P> Centralized decision-making
by the FCC deals with complicated issues better left to market
forces.  Consequently, with rare exceptions, Commission rulemaking
is a quagmire of false starts, delay, backtracking, and endless
fine-tuning.  The Commission announces a major new regulatory
scheme: time and again, after substantial delay, it then abandons
it, drastically revises it, steps back to an earlier plan previously
discarded, or starts all over again after a rebuff from the courts.
 Both industry incumbents and firms considering entry spend years
guessing at what the final regulatory regime will be.  Endless
uncertainty in the regulatory process entails huge losses for
both consumers and providers alike.
<P>
<I> <B>a. Enhanced Services Supplied by Phone Companies</B></I>.
 The Commission has been equivocating for three decades over the
rules to govern phone company provision of &quot;enhanced services,&quot;
like voice mail.  During that period, the Commission has issued
over 150 orders, and has made five trips to appellate courts to
defend its rules. 
<P>
 The process began in 1966, when the FCC began investigating the
convergence of computers and communications.  Seven years later,
this <I>Computer</I> <I>I</I> proceeding culminated in rules mandating
that telephone companies offer enhanced services only through
separate subsidiaries.  Just three years into this scheme, the
Commission proposed another.  Its <I>Computer</I> <I>II</I> inquiry
lasted almost eight years.  <I>Computer</I> <I>II</I> resulted
in a new definition of what kinds of services properly belonged
in the separate subsidiaries.  Two years after this scheme was
fully developed, the FCC reconsidered the rules again: <I>Computer</I>
<I>III</I> had been launched.  <I>Computer III</I> would eliminate
the separate subsidiary requirement; network interconnection requirements
and accounting rules, the Commission now concluded, would suffice.
 A fourth rulemaking proposal was issued in February 1995.  Astonishingly,
the Commission is proposing separate subsidiaries once again,
the position first adopted in 1966.

<I> </I><B>b. <I>Cable Television Supplied by Phone Companies</I></B>.
 In 1968, the Commission declared that telephone companies required
certification before they could offer cable television service.
 The Commission formally barred telephone companies from the cable
market in 1970.  With hardly any consideration of the matter,
Congress codified the ban in the 1984 Cable Act.  In August 1986,
the FCC began reexamining the ban; by 1988 it had tentatively
concluded that it didn't serve the public interest.  In 1991,
the Commission invited further comment on the ban.  A year later,
the Commission formally recommended that Congress repeal it.
<P>
 In 1993, phone companies finally brought First Amendment challenges
against their blanket exclusion from the arena of &quot;video
speech.&quot;  Since then, fifteen federal judges have examined
the ban.  Without a single dissenting vote so far, all have concluded
that the ban is unconstitutional.
<P>
 The FCC has responded with open defiance: it has simply reaffirmed
its power to license all phone company operations under the common
carrier (not the cable television) provisions of the Communications
Act.  Phone companies have filed a new round of First Amendment
challenges.

<I> </I><B>c. <I>CPE</I>.</B>  Customer premises equipment (&quot;CPE&quot;)
is another example of FCC obstruction of market forces.  After
a decade of skirmishing and with prodding from an appellate court,
the FCC struck down all tariffs barring foreign attachments in
1968.  This ruling did not, however, cover handsets; they would
still be provided exclusively by the monopoly carrier.  It was
1975 before the FCC allowed full competition in the provision
of CPE, nearly 25 years after the issue arose.  In the process,
the Commission issued nearly 60 major notices and orders, including
13 in the Computer II proceedings dealing with structural separation
and tariffing issues.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>1.4 Processing Complaints</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
Some significant share of the
FCC's budget and energy is spent on processing complaints.  The
Commission does keep track of how many complaints are filed, and
tallies how many it takes off of the books.  But the Commission
makes no attempt to determine whether complaints are resolved
to anyone's ultimate satisfaction.  Most complaints of any significance
simply put the Commission in the position of adjudicating disputes
between large corporations, disputes that often require ultimate
resolution in court.
<P>
<I> </I><B>a. <I>Common Carriage</I></B>.  The Commission is required
by statute to investigate and dispose of all complaints against
interstate common carriers.  Charges against carriers for violations
of the Act generally begin as informal complaints. During fiscal
year 1993, the most recent year for which figures have been made
publicly available, the Enforcement Division of the Common Carrier
Bureau received more than 10,000 informal complaints.   There
is no way of knowing how long the Commission takes on average
to dispose of an informal complaint.
<P>
 A complainant may follow up the initial round with a formal complaint.
Formal  complaint proceedings must conform to strict standards
prescribed by the Commission. Judging from reports in the F.C.C.
Record, the Commission has adjudicated some 154 formal carrier
complaints from 1990 to March of 1995.  Nearly 90 percent (134)
involved disputes between two or more carriers.  Most end user
complaints were brought by large entities such as Bank of America
or local utility companies.  Only four of the complaints were
brought by individual customers; of these, three were dismissed
by the Commission.  During the past five years, the Commission
required an average of almost three years to adjudicate a formal
complaint against a carrier.
<P>
<I> </I><B>b.  <I>Cable.</I></B>  The procedures for cable rate
complaints are similar to those used for common carriage.  Complaints
are simply forwarded to the cable operator, which is then expected
to respond.  Broadcasters may also petition for must-carry rights.
 After considering the initial petition and comments, the bureau
may issue a ruling or specify additional procedures such as oral
argument, an evidentiary hearing or further written submissions.
  The 38 complaints of unreasonable rates resolved by the full
Commission since the 1992 Act took effect required an average
of almost fourteen months to resolve.  Must-carry complaints resolved
between 1990 and 1994 took an average of six months.
<P>
<I> </I><B>c. <I>Broadcast</I></B><I>.</I>  Between 1990 and 1995,
the Commission issued more than 4,500 orders and notices concerning
disputes over the regulation, licensing, construction, and spectrum
allocation for radio and television broadcasters.  Most complaints
are filed around the time licenses come up for renewal, when complaints
may help tip the scale against an incumbent and in favor of a
challenger.  During the first five of the six months before its
license is due to expire, a station must post its renewal application
for public view and announce over the air its intention to renew
and the schedule for filing public comments.  The Commission takes
the station's complaint record into account when deciding whether
to renew a license.  There is apparently no &quot;resolution&quot;
of complaints of this sort beyond that.
<P>
 The FCC also processes a large number of complaints concerning
spectrum interference.  Most of these complaints are processed
by regional and local FCC district offices.  Market forces, controlled
by property rights, contracts and privately-enforced limits on
trespassing, could do the job at least equally well.

</PRE>
<HR>

<P>

<P>
 When AT&amp;T sought to acquire McCaw Cellular, for example,
the Department of Justice reviewed the proposed merger.  The Commission
mercifully decided not to invoke its Clayton Act jurisdiction,
but rather to consider antitrust issues in connection with the
application to transfer the radio licenses.  Had it chosen to
conduct the Department's whole antitrust review again, it could
have.  Though it would have been expected to consider the Department's
conclusions, the Commission would not have been bound by them.

<P>
 In addition to enforcing the antitrust laws, the FCC has put
in place a huge labyrinth of structural rules aimed at preventing
antitrust violations before they even occur.  These rules generally
forbid more than is necessary, particularly when markets are changing
fast, and thus suppress more competition than they promote.  For
example, the Commission's rules ban affiliations between newspapers
and broadcasters;<B> </B>prohibit common ownership of two or more
television stations, two or more AM stations, or two or more FM
stations with overlapping service contours; prohibit common ownership
of a television station and an AM or FM radio station in the same
market; ban telephone companies from acquiring Enhanced Specialized
Mobile Radio (ESMR) licenses  in or out of their telephone service
areas; bar cross-ownership of broadcast television and cable systems
in the same market; and preclude local exchange carriers from
providing video programming in their service areas.  
<P>
 The FCC has duplicated most of the mandates of the AT&amp;T divestiture
decree.  The FCC regulates equal access, cross-subsidization and
vertical integration.  The Department of Justice and the consent
decree purport to do so as well.  The decree forbids the Bell
Operating Companies from discriminating in the dissemination of
network information; under the Commission's &quot;All Carrier
Rule,&quot; carriers must make any information necessary for carrier
interconnection available in a timely manner and on a reasonable
basis. 
<P>
 FCC regulation duplicates Department of Justice antitrust enforcement
in other areas, as well.  In 1974, for example, the Department
of Justice filed an antitrust suit that sought to limit the power
of ABC, CBS and NBC to monopolize prime-time entertainment by
combining with their affiliates and controlling all access to
network air time.  All three networks signed consent decrees that
incorporated the FCC's weaker rules on the subject and added stricter
conditions.  Unlike the FCC rules, however, most elements of the
consent agreements were to sunset in 1991.  The remaining provisions
were vacated on November 8, 1993, by which time the networks were
clearly in decline.
<P>
 The 1992 Cable Act and FCC rules implementing it likewise address
relations between cable operators and their video programming
affiliates.  But actions brought separately by the Department
of Justice and a group of state Attorneys General against various
major cablecasters culminated in two 1993 consent decrees addressing
precisely the same issues.  The decrees require the video programming
affiliates of several major cable operators -- including the largest,
TCI -- to provide their programming to other video distributors
(like operators of direct broadcast satellites) on reasonable,
non-discriminatory terms.  Unlike the Commission's regulations,
these decrees address specific circumstances that present serious
anticompetitive concerns; they are targeted at particular defendants
and a specific record of abuse.
<P>
 The Commission duplicates itself internally as well.  It recently
announced, for example, plans to regulate cable television services
provided by phone companies under both Title II and Title VI.
 Thus, non-common-carrier cable television service, ordinarily
licensed under section 541 of Title VI, must <I>in addition</I>
be licensed under the more restrictive provisions of section 214
of Title II.  The two Titles, however, create sharply different
and inconsistent rights and duties.
<P>
 Finally, there is extensive overlap between FCC and state authority.
 Every major line and switch operated by local phone companies
for the joint provision of in-state and interstate services is
allocated roughly three parts to state regulators and one part
to the FCC; the regulation of all matters of depreciation, pricing
and so on are double regulated accordingly.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>PART TWO: A NEW MODEL FOR COMPETITION, UNIVERSAL SERVICE, AND DEVOLUTION</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
 The 1934 Communications Act required the FCC to &quot;make available,
so far as possible, to all people of the United States, a rapid,
efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication
service.&quot;  This language has been used to justify so-called
universal service policies designed to encourage penetration of
telephone service to as many households as possible.  The means
of  doing so was through massive cross-subsidies administered
through the FCC.  As of this writing, over 96 percent  of American
households have access to a telephone.  While it  is not clear
that these subsidies have any material impact on maintaining this
access rate, they do suppress toll calling and greatly complicate
the introduction of local competition.
<P>
 Competition poses a direct challenge to existing universal service
subsidies designed to keep local residential rates lower than
they otherwise would be.  The local telephone companies and their
state regulators transfer among themselves, out of the public
eye, literally billions and billions of dollars.  Residential
telephone services have been priced below cost since at least
the 1940s.  At present, there are five explicit support funds
administered by the FCC-mandated National Exchange Carriers Association
(&quot;NECA&quot;).  Most of the $1.4 billion disbursed by NECA
yearly goes to support low-cost telephone service to high-cost
rural areas.
<P>
 There are disagreements regarding the magnitude of current implicit
rate support payments.  The current transfer payments are estimated
to be about $20 billion a year.  The going-forward cost of subsidizing
wireline service to high-cost areas is estimated to be less than
$7 billion.  No responsible party seriously challenges the existence
of a substantial subsidy.
<P>
 Below-cost residential service constitutes one of the largest
off-budget entitlements programs.  Generations of economists have
criticized the program.  Its inefficiencies, faulty signals and
fundamental unfairness have been amply documented.   Moreover,
competition makes this subsidy program increasingly unsustainable.
  It is grounded on gross, government-sanctioned price distortions.
 The same product is sold to different customers at inordinately
different prices.   Such discrimination can be sustained only
when customers can be denied access to alternatives.  Competition
and technological advance are exactly that -- alternatives.
<P>
 <I><B>The replacement model: two approaches.</B></I>  <B> </B>While
one need not be convinced of the need to continue to provide subsidized
access to high-cost areas, two alternative approaches are identified
below to maintain (perhaps increase) telephone penetration rates
at less cost and in fairer, more efficient ways.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>2.1 The Federal Universal Service Plan Approach.</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
 </B></I>Under the Federal Universal Service Plan, every residential
and business telephone customer would pay a universal service
line charge for each access line it purchases.  The plan is similar
in concept to the existing federal charge levied against all long
distance subscribers of 52 cents per subscriber but under this
plan, the customer would make the direct payment.  The U.S. line
charge addresses two goals: (i) keep affordable service in high
cost areas; and (ii) fund policies targeted at the needy.  The
charges would be made explicit to endusers and be explained in
billing.
<P>
 <B>a.  <I>High-cost areas. </I></B> The high-cost subsidy would
be limited to companies serving high-cost areas.  Within 180 days
of enacting legislation, the new Office of  Communications would
determine a &quot;high-cost schedule&quot; which would set out
the cost of serving high-cost areas. The national average cost
of local basic dialtone service now is estimated to be about 
$18.00.  The replacement model envisions using census block data
currently available and the going-forward costs of serving those
lines. 
<P>
 Under the federal U.S. plan, the total high-cost subsidy would
initially be the product of the number of high-cost lines times
each line's respective &quot;line subsidy.&quot;  The line subsidy
is the cost of serving that line as indicated in the high-cost
schedule minus the $18.00 national average cost of service.  Each
year the high-cost subsidy is recovered by a monthly universal
service subscriber line charge levied equally on all residential
and business access lines.  
<P>
 Companies serving high-cost areas, the so-called carriers of
last resort, receive a subsidy payment for each high-cost line
equal to its line subsidy, that is, the cost of serving that line
as indicated on the high-cost schedule minus $18.00.  Over a fifteen
year period, the line subsidy payments would be reduced by one
dollar a year.  The total high-cost subsidy amount and the universal
service subscriber line charge would be reduced accordingly. 

<P>
 After three years, all carrier of last resort payments would
be put up for competitive bid.  The individual states would define
the relevant carrier of last resort areas within which bidding
would take place, but the areas should be defined as narrowly
as possible to preclude distortion to competition.  The high-cost
line subsidy and the carrier of last resort payment would be reduced
to reflect the competitive bidding process.
<P>
 Alternatively, the subsidies could be paid directly to subscribers
in high-cost areas.  In that case, the phase down of the subsidy
should be increased to replace the cost reducing effect of  the
auction process.  In either case, the plan would reduce interstate
long-distance prices substantially and generate billions in consumer
welfare and promote the development of new technology.  
<P>
 <B>b. <I>Targeted aid to the needy. </I></B> The second component
of the Federal Universal Service Plan is to target aid to low-income
users to assure that telephone service remains affordable for
all.  The OC will advise Congress within 180 days after enactment
on how best to perform this function. Possibilities include funding
means tested waivers for installation charges, deposits and the
federal universal service subscriber line charge.  Each year the
low-income subsidy would be recovered as an explicit component
of the monthly universal service subscriber charge.  As the high-cost
fund is ramped down, only a small portion of the savings would
be needed to fund this second component of the federal subscriber
line charge.
<P>
 By targeting assistance to low income households, the Federal
Universal Service Plan would be more fair and less expensive.
 It would also be more effective in raising telephone penetration
rates among the poor, because installation charges and deposits
are widely believed to represent larger obstacles to telephone
subscribership than does the monthly cost of telephone access.
<P>
 It should also be noted that the lower long-distance rates under
the Federal Universal Service Plan would be beneficial to many
rural households.  Rural callers make more long distance calls
on average than do urban customers.   Also, one study found that
low-income (life-line) customers in one state paid more than 60
percent of their monthly bill for long-distance services.
<P>
 The administration of the universal service subscriber line is
envisioned as being administered by a private organization such
as the National Exchange Carriers Association.  All other existing
subsidy programs either would be funded by the Federal Universal
Service Plan or  eliminated.  All local exchange carriers would
provide itemized billing of the universal service subscriber line
charges with brief accompanying explanations. 
<P>
<B> c.  <I>Devolution of the Remaining Subsidies Back to the States.
</I></B> Within 180 days after enactment, the OC will determine
best how to return those interstate costs not covered by the plan
 to the individual states.  States will have broad flexibility
to recover these costs as they deem fit, subject to general federal
guidelines.  The essential federal guideline in this regard is
the &quot;most favored nation&quot; approach, which would prohibit
State regulators from discriminating against interstate users
when pricing access to local exchange facilities.  A strict MFN
approach is designed to promote interstate commerce.   Moreover,
the Replacement Model assumes elimination of all legal barriers
to entry in local telephony markets and pre-emption of all state
public utility regulation of  wireless carriers.  Additionally,
the OC could be required to calculate an appropriate national
access cap below which all states would have to price interstate
access.  This one time cap would be set to reflect that portion
of interstate costs that are recovered by the universal service
subscriber line charge. 
<P>
 States will nevertheless retain the flexibility to adopt additional
universal service policies.  Nothing here will limit the ability
of the states to formulate universal service policies beyond those
expressly provided for in the federal universal service subscriber
line charge.  For example, the states may maintain residential
rates at or below the national average or expand the definition
of services covered under universal service.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>

<hr width="50%">
<h2>2.2  The Replacement Model's Option Two: Full Devolution</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>

This alternative model also emphasizes transition, not maintenance,
and explicit, not implicit subsidies.  In contrast to the Federal
Universal Service Plan, however, it transfers the full responsibility
for universal service back to the states. 
<P>
 <B>a. <I>Transition, not maintenance.</I></B> Due regard for
transitional inequities is appropriate. Where changes are contemplated
in regulation for the purpose of benefiting society as a whole,
the full cost of such change should not be visited on one single
group.  Due regard for transitional inequities should not be converted
into creating long-term maintenance programs.  
<P>
 In 1977, Senator Ernest Hollings, then-Chairman of the Senate
Communications Subcommittee, proposed a program which would have
essentially frozen both the total amount of subsidy dollars and
those eligible to receive them.  Support payments would have been
made in aid of ensuring a single party, Touch-tone service with
access to 911 emergency services, but not the full range of options
available. Such services could be purchased, of course, but not
at subsidized prices.
<P>
 A comparable approach today would entail freezing the size of
the five NECA-administered support funds (an initiative that the
FCC has, in part, already undertaken).  Alternatively, a freeze
coupled with an automatic reduction over the next decade -- say,
10 percent a year -- could be put in place.  Again, the objective
would be to safeguard legitimate transactional inequities while
at the same time encouraging efficiencies and to take into account
the lower cost options and technologies.   
<P>
 <B>b. <I>Implicit to Explicit.  </I></B>Most support payments
are buried in telephone company FCC and state-filed tariffs, with
the result that the magnitude and direction of subsidies is at
best disputable, and there is scant accountability.  Congress,
under this full devolution plan, would direct the OC promptly
to discern and make public the magnitude and direction of telephone
industry price support programs.  In effect, a &quot;subsidy budget&quot;
would be established, much as a &quot;burden hours budget&quot;
is required in conjunction with Federal paperwork reduction measures.
 To quote Justice Brandeis, &quot;Sunshine is the best disinfectant.&quot;
 
<P>
 <B>c.  <I>Devolution. </I></B> Then, the full responsibility
to devise and administer residential telephone price support programs
for today's implicit subsidies should be transferred from Washington
to the states.  States would  have the responsibility to regulate
the price charged for access to and from that state.  Several
mechanisms exist for generating funds necessary to meet a pre-determined
State &quot;universal service&quot; budget.  Assume, for example,
Tennessee were to determine that, next year, $250 million is needed
to cover its local exchange carrier's costs and maintain the status
quo -- $200 million to subsidize residential rates and $50 million
to provide nearly free &quot;lifeline&quot; services to the truly
needy.  Tennessee would have the flexibility to determine the
charges levied by local phone companies in conjunction with the
origin and termination of intra- as well as interstate calls.
  State authorities might choose to raise access charges in order
to meet a clearly defined societal purpose.  Alternatively, those
authorities might choose sharply to reduce access charges to make
the state more competitive with peers for attracting and retaining
investment and jobs.  
<P>
 This approach would give states new responsibilities subject
to a federal interest in promoting interstate commerce.  The states
would still be required to meet MFN non-discrimination requirements
noted above.  Elements of this approach exist in certain FCC-administered
programs today.   The outlines of  state-sanctioned &quot;lifeline&quot;
programs are nominally subject to local option and legislative
endorsement.  State authorities traditionally have been left with
the option of defining what constitutes &quot;universal service.&quot;
  Instead of being bit-players in a system largely administered
through Washington, here states would have the primary responsibility.
<P>
 This approach would also give states broader latitude for experimentation,
subject to the limitations imposed by their competing for commerce
and industry.  The communications component of business enterprise
has nearly doubled over the past 10 years.  States know this and
are aware of the impact on their competitiveness should they hike
phone charges significantly.  The top 10 largest states in the
country today account for more than two-thirds of the total &quot;telephone
economy&quot; and for the preponderance of long distance calling.
 
<P>
 States also could be required to meet the MFN non-discrimination
requirement noted above.  This would give states new responsibilities
and opportunities to experiment and control their destiny subject
to a federal interest in promoting interstate commerce.

<h2>PART THREE:
VOLUNTARY RE-ALLOCATION OF RADIO</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
 The Replacement Model implements a pro-competition, anti-monopoly
regime which will not protect incumbent companies by placing the
onus on new entrants to the market to justify themselves.   New
wireless service providers will have a presumptive right to compete.
 The Replacement Model envisions that government's role will be
dedicated to providing an orderly entry-way for the robust forces
of competitive rivalry, as well as safeguards to ensure the continued
vitality of market competition.
<P>
<B>1.</B> <I><B>Spectrum defined.  </B></I>The radio spectrum
-- generally defined as the range of electromagnetic frequencies
between three kilohertz and 300 gigahertz -- is  one of the Nation's
most valuable economic resources.  Television and radio broadcasting,
cellular telephone communications, paging and messaging, satellite
services, point-to-point microwave and taxi dispatching -- all
use spectrum.
<P>
 The use of spectrum as a resource is largely determined through
administrative allocation and licensing procedures first developed
in the 1920s.  Under this system, the federal government determines
the general uses for the radio spectrum, allocates bands of frequencies
to each of those uses, and then assigns licenses to specific users.
 This system involves a large degree of central planning by federal
regulators.   The FCC today determines which services are to be
provided, the frequencies on which they will be provided, the
conditions under which they will be provided, and the technology
to be used. 
<P>
<B>2. </B><I> <B>The Replacement Alternative: A  Property Rights
Approach to Spectrum.  </B></I> As far back as 1959, Nobel-laureate
economist Ronald Coase proposed that property rights be accorded
to radio licenses, that license owners pay for the right to use
spectrum, and that bidding for that right was the most efficient
way to allocate spectrum.  Privatizing spectrum would eliminate
the years current applicants must wait to provide new services,
permit market forces to move spectrum to its highest valued use,
and greatly reduce spectrum scarcity, unleashing a raft of new
wireless technologies.
<P>
 In 1991, NTIA studied the idea, reviewed the considerable literature
and past proposals on the subject, and concluded that a &quot;market-based
system for spectrum management would improve considerably the
efficiency and fairness of the current U.S. system, and, if properly
designed and implemented, can fully address concerns about such
issues as competitive equity, spectrum 'warehousing,' and the
preservation of socially-desirable services.&quot;  As part of
its recommendation, NTIA supported private transfers and subleasing
of spectrum rights directly from one user to another.
<P>
 All of this is administratively feasible.  Spectrum is already
bought and sold, although only in the secondary market.  New Zealand
has already liberalized significant bands of  spectrum already.
 In 1927, Congress -- persuaded by incumbent broadcasters -- to
establish a &quot;public interest&quot; licensing scheme.  That
system served the interests of incumbents well, short-circuiting
competitive forces from almost the very beginning.  America can
now correct this mistake.
<P>
 The Replacement Model presumes that new companies, new services
and new ideas have a presumptive right to access spectrum with
non-interfering use.  New entrants are encouraged to invade existing
markets and compete.  New and existing users have the right to
compete freely without &quot;public interest&quot; restrictions,
thereby lowering prices, increasing consumer choices, and expanding
services.  <HR>

</PRE>
<HR>

<P>
<B></B> As this chart indicates, the U.S. government is the prime
holder of spectrum in the 30,000 megaHertz  to 300 gigaHertz range.
 Spectrum is used for a wide variety of critical law enforcement,
national defense, and other important needs.  Nevertheless, large
portions of the spectrum go unutilized or vastly under utilized,
and many of the wasted bands are under the control of the federal
government.  The Replacement Model, as discussed below, encourages
through incentives the government to privatize this spectrum.
 In addition, Congress may well wish more direct and explicit
 means of ensuring this resource is used more efficiently, as
it has in the past -- as when it recently re-assigned 220 Mhz.
in the emerging technologies band from the federal government
to the private sector.  
<P>
 Auctions are an efficient way to assign rights.  The objective
is not to generate funds for the U.S. government.  Indeed, the
objective of the auction approach stressed below is to reduce
scarcity values which are currently associated with spectrum licensing
and use.  Nonetheless, it is currently estimated by all, including
the FCC itself, that auctions will generate billions in direct
proceeds over five years.  This sum, while substantial, will pale
compared to the economic growth, new jobs, new companies, new
products and consumer saving that will accompany the more efficient,
market-oriented use of spectrum.
<P>
<B>3. </B> <I><B>The current standard is hostile to consumers.
 </B></I>The centerpiece of the 1934 Act is a &quot;Public Interest
Standard&quot; which came into being first with the 1927 Radio
Act.  The Public Interest Standard was requested by David Sarnoff
and incumbent radio broadcasters so government would have a legal
basis to deny licenses to newcomers.  Senator C.C. Dill, the author
of the both the 1927 Radio Act and the 1934 Act, liked the standard
because it permitted policymakers (such as himself) political
discretion to shape the marketplace.  Dill subsequently wrote
that political control was important because common law was rapidly
shaping spectrum access rights as private property.  The public
interest standard, in practice, allows regulators to stop decentralized
development and to engage in both industrial policy and political
handicapping.
<P>
<B>4.</B> <I><B>&quot;Public interest&quot; cannot be defined.
 </B></I>Today there is still no effective definition of the &quot;public
interest&quot; standard.  In 1993, Commissioner Duggan attacked
critics of the FCC and the public interest standard -- claiming
the FCC indeed, could define it.  That this debate was still occurring
almost sixty years after the concept was promulgated makes the
point cogently.  In effect, the public interest standard is exactly
whatever three of the five FCC members say it is. Nothing is ruled
out.
<P>
<B>5.</B>   <I><B>The Replacement Plan</B></I><B>. <I> </I></B>The
Replacement Model sequences reforms to give markets and competitors
time to make rational decisions based upon market information.
 Phase One can be completed soon after enactment.  All current
license-holders of spectrum are granted a complete fee simple
in their spectrum -- the title to use, sell, lease or transfer
as they deem fit, subject only to interference and antitrust concerns.
 A one time registration fee can be assessed to help fund the
replacement model's title registry service of the spectrum.
<P>
 Phase Two contemplates expediting all exclusive applications
pending before the FCC for spectrum licenses as of May 1, 1995
(as a representative date).  These applications, upon completion
of geographic, power and location contour analysis, will be promptly
converted to property rights of the applicant to the spectrum.
 Competing applications will be subject to auction.
<P>
 Phase Three would open up all unallocated (non-government) spectrum
for application.  This process would facilitate entry by surveying
available spectrum bands (all those where entry is currently feasible)
and establish standardized parcels for new entrants to claim.
 Such a survey function is designed solely to promote consumer
welfare by encouraging competition and is not to block off spectrum
&quot;for reserves.&quot;  For spectrum frequencies in which there
are more than one claim asserted, the model mandates that the
government auction the new bands within 180 days.  As much as
efficient, the new Office of Communications should permit market
forces, subject to antitrust review, to determine the geographic
and interference boundaries of the initial property assignments.
 The FCC's current experience in creating  &quot;overlay rights&quot;
for PCS licensees should be a valuable guide in this process.
<P>
 The premise is that spectrum use will be dictated by the American
people, not the government.  The model allows for &quot;spectrum
contours,&quot; &quot;overlay rights&quot; and &quot;band management
rights&quot; to be defined quickly by the government and made
available to investors willing to risk capital in developing new
wireless services.  Auctions will be mandatory when more than
one entity registers for use of spectrum under a defined and short
timeframe.  The process encourages competition amongst potential
users to establish new wireless services, triggering a discovery
process which will usher in dynamic application of cutting-edge
technology.  These auctions will sell property, not licenses.
 Those who bid and win title are free to develop and/or re-sell
the spectrum as with any other private property right subject
to antitrust review and geographic and  interference boundaries.

<P>
 Under Phase Four, unallocated spectrum held in reserve by the
government would be opened for use by the private sector as applicants
see fit.  Spectrum bands currently reserved for government use
would be made available for private users through direction the
of  Congress.  The federal government owns the vast majority of
 &quot;clean&quot; spectrum -- spectrum which is not in use. 
Phase Four envisions that those government agencies with a claim
to spectrum will disgorge their unused spectrum within a determined
timeframe.  New companies and new services are encouraged to establish
new wireless services -- triggering a process of discovery as
new technologies are tried and used.  
<P>
 When more than one private party registers for use of the same
parcel of spectrum, an auction will be held.  Current entities
such as the Department of Defense and NASA will be permitted to
retain a portion of the proceeds from spectrum roll-out for modernizing,
re-location expenses and operational uses.  Although it can be
expected that certain departments will resort to &quot;national
security&quot; arguments to not only maintain but possibly expand
their claim to spectrum use, Congress is encouraged to view such
assertions skeptically.  Much of government's use of spectrum
is inefficient, with competing elements within a single bureaucracy
refusing to share spectrum for narrow, internal rivalries or other
reasons.  Any claim to &quot;national security&quot; should be
justified with full inquiry by Congress into the validity of the
claim and whether more efficient means can be found to accomplish
the asserted mission.
<P>
 Auctions will be held within a specified deadline time of 180
days.  This approach would account for transaction costs to the
extent they are a significant obstacle to the aggregation of spectrum
where that might be efficient.  
<P>
<B>6.</B> <I><B>The property rights model is supported by courts
and common law.  </B></I>The model encourages both new competitors
and existing licensees to push the process forward from below.
 This reform is not a descendant from the edict of a civil servant
from above.  Not even interference rights should be set forth
in detail in new legislation.  The model instead broadly defines
what new competitors are entitled to do, and offers spectrum users
the opportunity to fulfill their market-driven aspirations.  The
government remains involved to protect the marketplace <I>via
</I>antitrust and property law.
<P>
 <I><B>Conclusion.</B></I>  The Replacement Model is predicated
upon a fundamental re-appraisal of the rationale and validity
of the current &quot;public interest&quot; approach to spectrum
management.  The model is premised on a new standard to gain economic
benefits from the efficiency of a competitive market: &quot;consumer
welfare.&quot;  Government action will be explicitly designed
to promote the economic choices for the American consumer,  with
lower prices, improved selection, and better, more innovative
services.
<P>
 The legal content for this standard draws from the spirit of
competition embedded in over 120 years of  antitrust law.  More
importantly, it is a clean break with the industrial policy of
the central planners,  representing a series of almost unbroken
failures over the past seven decades.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>PART FOUR: THE REPLACEMENT MODEL</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
<I><B> A clean sheet approach. </B></I> The Replacement Model
adopts a  clean sheet approach to the government's role in the
knowledge age.  The model addresses the  four critical functions
that should be performed regardless of  era or technology.  First,
government should establish, protect and enforce a system of 
property rights, tangible and intangible.  The central task of
government is to protect individual rights  and formulate the
laws by which the rights are adjudicated.  Government should also
define the application of individual rights to a particular sphere
of activity.  Clarity is essential.  Ambiguous property rights
are an invitation to litigation, diverting energy and creativity
into lawsuits that serve no customers nor generate no new wealth.
 
<P>
  Second,  the government should promote market efficiency and
competition by policing market break down.  Since the 1934 Act,
technological progress is turning the telecommunications marketplace
from one characterized as &quot;economies of scale&quot; and &quot;natural
monopolies&quot; into a competitive market.  While government
can assist industry when possible through cooperative efforts
to promote standards and technical guidelines, in general, competition
has made whole areas of FCC central planning, such as broadcast,
cable and long distance regulation unnecessary and costly.  These
regulations should be eliminated immediately.  
<P>
 Third, where government supervision is called for it will frequently
be best done through antitrust enforcement.  Antitrust law is
designed to prevent acts and practices that can lead to the creation
of new monopolies, or harm consumers by forcing up prices, limiting
access to competing products or reducing service quality.  For
more than 120 years, America has relied upon antitrust law to
foster competition and ensure that all compete fairly and by the
same rules.  Telecommunications is such a market --  telephone,
cable, satellite, wireless -- all are seeking to compete.  The
implication is that the price-and-entry regulation of the 1934
Act should therefore be replaced by antitrust law as quickly as
possible.
<P>
 Fourth, many of the remaining necessary governmental functions
in telecommunications should be transferred to the states with
appropriate federal guidelines, as well as to other federal agencies
with expertise.  For example, most regulation of local exchange
facilities could be returned to the states which already regulate
75 percent of these costs.  Where appropriate, federal interests
regarding local telephony could be transferred to the proposed
new Office of Communications in an existing agency in the Executive
Branch.
<P>
<B>B.  A Functional Re-Assignment of  FCC Responsibilities Under
The 1934 Act. </B>
<P>
     The following is a suggested roadmap for analyzing the salient
 provisions in Title 47  by function in accordance with a modern
approach to telecommunications.  In general, the analysis  corresponds
to the five operational bureaus of the Commission:  common carriage,
mass media, wireless, cable and international/satellite (a functional
organization not coincidentally mirroring the limits and functions
of analog technology).  
<P>
      Many statutory provisions and FCC rules and regulations
can be eliminated immediately upon enactment of  the  replacement
law. Some provisions can be phased out over time. Others, however,
need to be retained and their enforcement transferred elsewhere.
 Unless indicated otherwise, all FCC statutory authority and FCC
rules and regulations will be sunsetted within three years of
the FCC replacement law.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>4.1a  The New Office Of Communications</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
 The edifice government created sixty years ago drastically needs
an update and facelift to match the realities of contemporary
technologies. The replacement for the FCC is the Office of Communications
(&quot;OC&quot;).  The OC will oversee a telecommunications industry
based on the proposition that a digital transmission can not be
characterized by differentiating regulations based on function.
 A digital transmission of 1s and 0s can be transmitted by and
received through any variety of means -- twisted pair, cable,
wireless, video dialtone or satellite.
<P>
 The OC will consist of far fewer than the approximately 2,200
current federal bureaucrats.  It will reside largely in an Executive
Branch agency.  Placing the OC within a consolidated niche within
the Executive Branch should have <B>no </B>impact whatsoever on
the integrity or independence of decision-making.  At present,
the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission are both parts of Executive departments.
 There has not been any indication that these arrangements impaired
independence or generated undue political influence.  
<P>
 The OC would assume the following functions:  oversee for a transition
period the remaining federal responsibilities to regulate interstate
access to local exchange facilities, coordinate the privatization
of the spectrum, and prepare for Congress a phase out plan for
all FCC rules and regulations which will be sunsetted in three
years (except as noted below).
<P>
 First, the OC will: (a) monitor interconnection requirements
under Section 201 of the 1934 Act consistent with the federal
guidelines against discriminatory pricing, with enforcement under
the jurisdiction of the Justice Department; (b) monitor compliance
with hearing-impaired and speech-impaired requirements under Section
225 of the 1934 Act with enforcement under the Department of Justice
civil division; (c) monitor uses of telephone communication for
harassing calls or prohibited commercial purposes; and (d) implement
the universal service plan and federal responsibilities to monitor
and facilitate the development of local competition created by
legislation terminating the MFJ. 
<P>
 Second, the OC will also coordinate the transfer and privatization
of spectrum.  It will consist of the frequency coordinator role
of the current FCC and the NTIA, which currently chairs the &quot;Interdepartmental
Radio Advisory Committee,&quot; established in 1922 by then-Commerce
Secretary Herbert Hoover. The OC will establish and run the Spectrum
Registry File (&quot;SRF&quot;).  The SRF will be the resource
to keep track of centralized registration of spectrum.  
<P>
 Under the plan to privatize spectrum, all current licensees of
spectrum will be granted title in the spectrum.  A deed to the
spectrum will be filed with the SRF.  All new spectrum to be auctioned
will be registered with the SRF as well.  
<P>
 Currently,  all engineering, screening and approval of applications
of  &quot;private radio&quot; -- commercial mobile radio service
-- is handled by &quot;frequency coordinators.&quot;  These are
private entities such as the National Association of Business
and Educational Radio (&quot;NABER&quot;), the Associated Public
Safety Communications Officers (&quot;APCO&quot;), etc.  These
user groups perform most of the functions that the government
staffs at one time undertook.  The frequency coordination process
has worked well, and paid important dividends in terms of speed,
flexibility and reduced tax payer costs.   
<P>
 The OC will harness this system and work with the private sector
and industry associations to perform for broadcast and other forms
of spectrum use what NABER and APCO do currently for private radio.
 An important result would be to speed up title issues with respect
to spectrum.  The OC, as the FCC does today, will retain ultimate
authority.  But a large volume of the engineering &quot;sweat
work&quot; will be delegated. 
<P>
 The OC will prepare within one year a phase out plan for all
FCC rules and regulations which will be sunsetted except in the
event that Congress affirmatively acts to preserve the regulation
in the interest of competition.  The OC will also make recommendations
for the efficient phasing-out of other FCC regulations should
the three-year sunset create transitional problems.  A critical
component of the OC's work will be to document instances where
safety or substantial market failure would make continuation of
any sunsetted regulation beneficial to consumers.   Unless Congress
acts before the sunset date, all designated FCC rules and regulations
will be rescinded on that date. 
<P>
<B> </B>The OC will reverse the massive grant of power given to
the FCC under Title II of the 1934 Act.  Previously, pursuant
to the 1934 Act, the FCC controlled rates for common carriers,
investigated existing ones and  determined new ones.  The FCC
controlled which companies compete, where and under what corporate
structures. The OC will supervise the transition back to the market.
 It will develop and implement the universal service plan on a
transitional basis with a finite sunset provision for non-needs-based
subsidies.  The OC will also supervise on a temporary basis the
availability of interstate access on a non-discriminatory basis
to local exchange facilities.
<P>
<B> </B>The OC will also roll back government impositions under
Title III of the Act.  All existing broadcast stations are presumed
to face effective competition.  The OC model returns cable TV
to the 1984 Cable Act.
<P>
 The OC model makes a break with the Cable Act of 1984, however,
by repealing the grant to the FCC to regulate cross-ownership
of cable and exclude telephone companies from cable programming.
 The FCC authorized state and local authorities to regulate cable
rates as well as set technical standards.  Federal law pre-empted
local attempts to require cable systems to operate as common carriers
or utilities.  The legislation, however, expressly barred new
FCC regulation of content on cable programming.  The new standard
for effective competition will be the original 3 over-the-air
signal standard promulgated by the FCC.  Local cable regulation
is pre-empted.
<P>
 The goal, as indicated at the outset of the Report, is to fashion
a new, modern governmental approach to telecommunications supportive
of and in harmony with the realities of the technological changes
over the past 60 years.  Government has a role to play in the
information age.  But that new, modern role has no basis in the
1930s and the values and technological limits of that era.

<p>
The Small Business Survival Foundation (SBS Foundation) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit research and education organization that studies the impact of government polices on the small business and entrepreneurial sector of the United States economy. From taxation to trade, SBS Foundation examines legislative and executive branch-led initiatives, to determine the affect on entrepreneurship, and potential for impeding economic growth.<p>
The SBS Foundation was formed in February of 1995. One of the major project areas undertaken by the foundation is the issue of tax system overhaul. During the course of the national debate on tax system overhaul, SBS Foundation will examine the leading plans (as well as other major proposals) to analyze their impact on small businesses and entrepreneurs. SBS Foundation's new booklet, <a href="grtax.html">The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense Of Competing Tax Plans</a>, looks at leading tax overhaul proposals based on the foundation's "basics of a sound tax system. " The booklet is written by Raymond J. Keating, SBS Foundation Chief Economist, with a foreword by Malcolm S. Forbes Jr.

<p>
Overhauling our nation's tax system ... pessimists say it will never happen -- optimists
simply claim they are in economic nirvana as the debate continues
to swirl around them. Not only has the national debate commenced,
but real pro- posals have been advanced and committee hearings
are already taking place in the United States Congress.
<p>
Every American taxpayer is impacted by the broken tax code. Small businesses
and entrepreneurs are particularly hard hit by our punishing,
complex system. The horde of taxes required of them from all levels
of government, com- pounded by the cost and burden of tax compliance,
and the fact that our perplex- ing system changes with the wind,
make the issue of taxation invariably the num- ber one concern
of small enterprises nationwide. 
<p>
Which of the leading tax overhaul proposals is the best system for America and small businesses
and entrepreneurs? The Small Business Survival Foundation (SBS
Foundation) is attempting to answer this question, as we study,
examine, analyze and criticize the various proposals as they become
more spe- cific, then overlay those proposals on the small business,
entrepreneurial sector for closer scrutiny. 
<p>
Over the next couple of years, the U.S. Congress will continue to debate which tax
system is best for America. As the "race to the White House" heats up, tax overhaul will become a central issue. 
<p>
One principle has become more solidified as the debate continues -- the entrepreneur
must remain at the core of our economic model. How to stoke the
entrepreneurial spirit must remain at the forefront of developing
a new tax sys- tem. The current U.S. tax code is a catastrophic
failure in this regard -- it punishes risk taking and entrepreneurship,
thus damaging economic growth and opportunity for all Americans.
<p>
The great tax debate has indeed just begun. It is exciting to
watch long-time allies of tax overhaul debating the merits of
each of the proposed systems. I am thrilled that this debate is
taking place. And, I remain optimistic that small businesses
and entrepreneurs -- the backbone of the American economy -- will,
in the end, be the winners of this long overdue revolution in our tax system.

<p>
 We are about to begin one of the most exciting, important debates in our his- tory -- what
kind of tax system we will have as we enter the 21st Century
and the Third Millennium. 
<p>
Public disgust with the current code grows and grows. Americans deeply resent a system which defies understanding, smothers growth, and invites corruption and manipulation.
<p>
Raymond Keating's short, lucid booklet couldn't be better timed.
It will enable concerned citizens to understand the essentials
of this upcoming debate. Keating quickly captures the flaws of
our tax system and then simply and fairly summarizes the alternatives
-- the flat tax, the national sales tax, the value-added tax
and the so-called consumed-income tax. 
<p>
The author's easy-to-understand checklist of criteria enables readers to see why the VAT and the consumed-income tax should be quickly discarded. The flat tax
and a national retail sales tax would both benefit the economy
and be a vast improvement over what we have now. At the end of
this booklet, Keating provides the two utopian versions of these
alternatives. Even if you think them unrealistic, they will make
you realize how truly "low-rated" a tax system can be!
<p>
This booklet will be an essential tool in stoking the debate.
The'96 election is absolutely critical. Unless voters have an
opportunity to give an unmistakable mandate for a fundamental
overhaul, an overhaul will not happen. Too many forces will oppose
it and gut it. Be wary of candidates who refuse to firmly advocate a specific alternative. Timidity, generalities, good intentions will be insufficient to bring about a true tax revolution. <p>
Personally, I am an unabashed advocate of the Dick Armey flat tax. There may
be better alternatives, but I believe it has the best chance to
win political approval next year. But this gets to the virtue
of this booklet -- it succinctly gives you the information you
need to make up your own mind and, just as importantly, to get
involved!

<p>
Entrepreneurs drive the economy. By creating and investing in new businesses, ideas, and innovations,
the entrepreneur ensures economic renewal and growth. While government
can assist this process by protecting life and limb and guaranteeing
property rights, government unfortunately more often than not
cre- ates obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic growth. Perhaps
the most for- midable of the many governmental obstacles thrown
in the path of entrepreneurs during this century has been the
U.S. federal income tax code. 
<p>
As constituted today, the federal income tax system amounts to a convoluted mess. It is complicated,
inefficient, intrusive, and serves as an impediment to entrepreneurship,
investment, economic growth, and job creation. 
<p>
In fact, only narrow
special interests, lobbyists, lawyers, and tax accountants can
derive any benefit from the current, complex income tax system.
Of course, the system can be largely attributed to their influence
peddling in our nation's organized interests, a complete overhaul
of our tax system has verged on fantasy for the past six to
seven decades - <i>until now</i>. 
<p>
"The Great Tax Debate" has arrived in Washington, D.C. A variety of tax overhaul proposals
are being given serious consideration not only in the many think
tanks that sprinkle Washington, D.C.'s urban landscape but in
the Halls of Congress. 
<p>
In the following pages, we shall examine
criteria for a sound tax system, review the main problems of our
current tax system, analyze alternative proposals, and outline
an ideal tax plan that promotes entrepreneurship and economic
growth. Leading ideas for replacing the current income tax system
include a flat income tax, a national retail sales tax, a "consumed-income"
tax, or a value- added tax (VAT). 

Naturally, every form of taxation has a downside - our goal should be to minimize such distortions our current income tax system fails this test miserably, and the search is on for an imporved tax system.

The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation released
a report Oct. 31 asking the question, "Will
Sweeney Sink or Save Labor?"
 The new report concludes: "Under
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, big labor will be a big loser."
<P>
The report lays out the long decline of labor union
membership and the increasing share of government employees in
labor union ranks.  SBS Foundation forecasts, based on recent
trends, that public-sector employees account for 42% of union
membership, up from a mere 6% in 1960.  As a percent of private
and public workforces, private-sector union membership is in free
fall, while public-sector unionism has stagnated for several years.
<P>
"This trend is not lost on union leaders like Sweeney,"
says SBS Foundation president Karen Kerrigan.  "Big
labor's
massive campaign against Republican members of Congress who favored
spending restraint and market-based policies are antithetical
to the labor movement's
need for coercive government to assist in their organizing efforts,
while propping up their relevancy.  With Republicans keeping control
of Congress, big labor's
failed efforts to reelect a Democrat majority will go down in
history as one of the most wasteful and unsuccessful political
campaigns of the twentieth century.  Labor leaders should have
focused on the task at hand:
building membership and representing the authentic concerns of
its members.  Sweeney is doing neither."
<P>
The report's
author, Raymond J. Keating, SBS Foundation Chief Economist, notes:
"In
an economy where entrepreneurship is on the rise, competition
is intensifying, and technological advancements are bringing about
further decentralization, big labor's
preferences for high taxes, excessive regulation, protectionism,
larger government, and class warfare make no sense.  In addition,
Sweeney's
strategic alignment with other groups in demise, like social activists
of the 1960s variety 
(socialists, left-wing academics, and various big-government groups)
 will only speed, rather than slow, the decline of labor unions.
 I guess misery does love company."

<CENTER><B>Calling a "Salt" a "Salt"
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The pernicious union corporate campaign tactic known
as salting was wounded recently by an administrative law judge
(ALJ) in San Francisco.  In a decision involving Irwin Industries,
the ALJ held that filing "frivolous,
knowingly false"
charges was "an
integral part of the . . . 'fight
back'
strategy that was contrived to force the company to spend substantial
amounts of money defending itself before the"
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). 
<P>
The company had hired known Boilermakers Union organizers
in the past, but they had never been a target of "salting"
activity.  However, after an organizer was hired as a supervisor
on a new job, and asked to sign a statement that  asserted "I
am here for the best interest of IRWIN INDUSTRIES, INC. AND NOT
for the benefit of the [boilermakers] . . .," 
he initiated the campaign.
<P>
The organizer and his supporters engaged in a work
slowdown and were subsequently fired for that activity.  Afterwords
a busload of applicants appeared at the company office where they
filled out job applications and wrote the words "voluntary
organizers"
at the top.  The NLRB issued a complaint alleging unlawful discharges
against the organizer and his cohorts, and unlawful refusal to
hire the "volunteer
organizers."
<P>
The judge dismissed the complaint.  He went on to
recommend that the NLRB impose a remedy on the union which blocks
the future filing of bogus charges against the employer.<BR>

<CENTER><B>Sweeney's
Hangover<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
In a <I>Washington Times</I> piece today (November
6 1996) called "Wednesday
hangover,"
AFL-CIO Chief John Sweeney may have taken too much liberty with
rank-and-file dues.
<P>
According to the report:
<P>
<I>
". .class-action lawyers are looking into suing the AFL-CIO on
behalf of its members to return to them the $35 million in dues
that union President John Sweeney spent trying to elect a Democratic
House of Representatives.
<P>
Any such suit could cripple the AFL-CIO for years,
one legal expert suggests.
<P>
Ironically, class-action suits are lucrative for
lawyers and are protected by the liberal Democrats Mr. Sweeney
supports."</I>
<P>
It looks as though shrewd lawyers have figured out
that fewer lawsuit opportunities will be available as the GOP
will likely make another attempt at legal reform.  And with fewer
new regulations and rules being signed into law- 
as is expected to be the case with the new Congress-
why not go after labor unions?
<P>
<I>The massive partisan political campaign waged
against the GOP in the '96
elections, only resulted in 14 GOP freshmen scalps for John Sweeney.</I>

<P>
Meet Michela Alioto (D), one of the heirs to the
AFL-CIO's
$35 million "windfall"
from American workers that union bosses are using in their effort
to buy back Congress.  With the help of this special "education
fund",
Alioto (D) is mounting a serious challenge to Representative Frank
Riggs (R), who currently represents California's
first congressional district.
<P>
According to FEC reports filed between January and
June, 1996, Alioto (D) has received $74,125.00 in campaign contributions
from organized labor.  Describing the diversity of her contributor
base, Alioto said,<i> "To
be perfectly honest, we had labor and that was it."</i>
 She further candidly asserted that she is "very
proud of that, and <U>will never forget it</u>."
<P>
Should she unseat Riggs (R) on November 5, these
will no doubt be words for her to live by in the 105th Congress.

<CENTER><B>Contempt for New York Union<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The New York Sheet Metal Workers Local 28 has tried
for 25 years to blame its abysmal record of race discrimination
on everyone but itself.  The U.S. Supreme Court refused to accept
any more excuses and let stand a contempt of court citation. 
The union once again is ordered to stop discriminating against
minorities and to satisfy a court decree of reaching a goal of
29.23% minority membership.
<P>
The case stems from a suit filed by the federal government
in 1971 charging that the union discriminated against blacks and
Hispanics seeking union membership.  Minorities made up only 3
percent of the membership by 1974.  After constant legal challenges,
the union is currently subject to the order to raise minority
membership.
<P>
Over the past quarter century, the union has dragged
its feet and already been cited for contempt.  It has sought to
blame employers, the courts and the law itself for its failure
to provide equal opportunity.
<P>
As the national union bosses seek to portray the
labor movement as the champion of workers, once again we see that
that their own house is not in order. <BR>

<CENTER><B>The Union Yes-Man<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
For years unions have spent heavily on public relations
to promote its slogan, "Union
Yes."
 This year the AFL-CIO is sinking up to $500,000,000 dollars into
its effort to buy back control of government.
<P>
In addition to buying up television time and traveling
door-to-door, the unions have unveiled a fresh crop of political
candidates who are taking the union money in their run for public
office.
<P>
Inside-the-beltway political pundits are calling
these challengers "Union
Yes-Men."
<P>
How does a Union Yes-Man stand out from the rest
of the pack.  The following "test"
is provided by an avid reader of <I>Labor Watch</I>:<BR>
<P>
If your army of campaign "volunteers"
all have Washington D.C. license plates, you might be a Union
Yes-Man.
<P>
If the phrase, "Pardon me," is a campaign payback, not a Miss Manners' nicety, you might be a Union Yes-Man.
<P>
If you plan to dress up as a "ghost
employee"
for Halloween, you might be a Union Yes-Man.<BR>
<P>

<CENTER><B>No, We Mean Other Oppressive Employers!<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
When it comes to watching out for the rights of workers,
AFL-CIO has a glaring blind spot-
its own employees!  The labor federation is under severe criticism
for forcing its "Union
Summer"
workers to put in excessive <U>unpaid</U> overtime.
<P>
In a complaint to the Department of Labor, Rep. Cass
Ballenger (R-NC) demanded an investigation into reports that participants
were given a weekly stipend of $210 and free housing and required
to put in 12-hour days.  The Workforce Protections subcommittee
chairman calculated that at least one participant apparently receive
an hourly wage of $2.76, without any overtime premium,
when the minimum wage was $4.25 an hour.
<P>
A response from the Labor Department may come soon,
but the union reaction to the charges was immediate.  
<P>
Deborah Dugan of the AFL-CIO in response to the charges
remarked, "We
feel very confident that we complied with the relevant laws,"
<I>The Washington Times</I> reported.
<P>
Why do union leaders always appear so defensive when
the Labor Department goes after them?<BR>

</B></CENTER>
<P>
Michael Petyo, a Republican challenger running against incumbent
Rep. Peter Visclosky in Indiana, is proud of his union family
heritage.  His letterhead boldly states his credentials,
"Businessman,Union Man, Veteran."
<P>
But labor leaders have turned on Petyo, by distributing his positions
on issues that he says he was never contacted about.  In fact,
Petyo supports 7 of the 8 positions that the AFL-CIO claims he
opposes in their "voter"
guide.
<P>
Here is the text of a letter sent to Jerry T. Payne, Secretary
Treasury of the Committee on Political Education, Indiana AFL-CIO:
<BR>

<P>
<I>Per our conversation by phone this morning, please understand
that I am VERY disappointed that my brothers in the AFL-CIO would
choose to do something as irresponsible as to report my positions
on union issues incorrectly.  Saying you assumed negative responses
because I failed to send in a survey I never got is beyond insulting.
 This is particularly true in light of your "voter"
guide claim that "all
information contained [was] obtained from press releases, surveys,
and questionnaires."
 I consider this to be a small time, underhanded way to operate.
 I expect and demand more from my union brothers and especially
from my leadership.</I>
<P>
<I>As I said, my campaign received no survey.  Further, if I had,
I certainly would have responded quite differently from the false
information being sent out by the AFL-CIO about me.  I am a member
of Carpenter's Local
1005 out of Hobart, Indiana.  My son is also a member of 1005.
 My wife is a member of Foodserver's
Local 1 out of Chicago, Illinois.  My family is a union family.
 You have attacked something that I have worked to instill in
my family.</I>
<P>
<I>I can not begin to try to understand nor explain to my family,
my friends, my neighbors, my fellow workers, and others why my
own union brothers and sisters would want to publish such outright
lies about me.  I am at a loss with what to do or say.  Your actions
in printing <B>Stand Up: For Indiana's
Working Families: AFL-CIO Voter Guide by Issues</B> were absolutely
wrong.</I>
<P>
<I>John Sweeney said to me as a union man that weneed to support
our own.  As a union man, I agreed with him and decided it was
time to get one of our own elected.  As a union man, I feel my
working brothers and sisters should know the truth about both
me and my campaign.  I believe that this entire affair is a contrived
inaccuracy.</I>
<P>
<I>I expect to see from my union leadership a public retraction
of these statements.  I look forward to them showing their support
for one of their own.</I>
<P>
<I>God Bless You and thank you in advance for your help in correcting
this injustice.<BR>
</I>
<P>
In a letter to Petyo, the AFL-CIO representative Payne writes:
<BR>

<P>
<I>Our record indicated, prior to receiving your fax today, that
you had NOT responded in writing to our questionnaire.  Therefore
we assumed you were opposed to the issues or else you simply did
not wish to have a written record of where you stand on the issues.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
If Petyo was a Democrat, we have to assume that they would of,
in fact, supported one of their own.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>Going and . . .<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Striking workers continue to picket at the Frontier Hotel in Las
Vegas, Nevada in what is currently the longest strike in the United
States. Over 500 workers walked off the job on September 21, 1991
because the hotel was seeking a contract with terms different
from the pact agreed to by other Strip hotels.
<P>
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer, Richard Trumka, during his annual
visit to the strike, said that the strikers "are
teaching workers of America what solidarity is all about."
 Trumka also boasts that during the strike, not one striker has
crossed the picket line and that they have maintained pickets
24 hours a day.  
<P>
Striker Stats: Strikers have been receiving three meals a day
(free); 101 babies have been born to strikers, and union leaders
have encouraged other union members to participate in the strike
when visiting Las Vegas.
<P>
Anyone care to wager an end date to this strike?<BR>

<CENTER><B>LIUNA PAC Money Flows Freely to Democrats<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Labor union leaders are "betting
the House" that Democrats
take control of Congress next year.  Their $35 million-dollar
ad campaign is augmented by over $40 million in PAC contributions.
<P>
  The Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA) 
(the topic of many <I>Labor Watch </I>articles dealing with its
ties to organized crime and its relationship to the White House)
is feeding the campaign
coiffeurs of 209 Democrats through its PAC, the Laborers Political
League.  To date, $750,000 of the PAC money has made its way to
Democrat incumbents and challengers to vulnerable Republicans
this election cycle.
<P>
Countless LIUNA officials have been convicted of state and federal
offenses during the past 20 years.  And, LIUNA has been described
as a "union with clear
ties to organized crime"
by New York's Organized
Crime Task Force and the President's
Commission on Organized Crime.  
<P>
In 1994, a Justice Department report stated that: "LIUNA
has been infiltrated at all levels by corrupt individuals and
organized crime figures who have exploited their control and influence
over the union for personal gain and to the detriment of the union.
 LIUNA union officers and employees at all levels, including the
general presidency, have been chosen, subject to the approval
of, and have been controlled by, various members and associates
of organized crime."
<P>
Recently, questions have been posed by the media and legal experts
regarding Arthur Coia's
(head of LIUNA) friendship with President Clinton and the First
Lady, and whether the Justice Department is giving LIUNA favorable
treatment because of Coia's
personal ties to the Clintons.
<P>
The legal cloud over LIUNA has not stopped  Democrats from taking
LPL's money.  
<P>
In the House, Laborers Political League money is being doled out
to key Democrats in the leadership, and those ranking members
who would chair committees if the Democrats take control of Congress
next year.  
<P>
Here is a list of those Democrats and the amount of money recieved
(so far) from the Laborers Political League in 1996:<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Democrat  Position  Laborers $ $ $ $</FONT></B>
<P>
Dick Gephardt Minority Leader $9,000
<P>
David Bonior  Minority Whip $10,000
<P>
Martin Frost  DCCC Chairman $10,000
<P>
David Obey  Appropriations $6,500
<P>
Martin Sabo  Budget  $3,000
<P>

<P>
John LaFalce  Small Business $2,000
<P>
James Oberstar Transportation $7,000
<P>
Charlie Rangel Ways and Means $7,000 <BR>

<P>
What type of Return of Investment will LIUNA get for its generosity?
 Good question.  Too bad the media isn't
paying attention.

<a name="one"></a>
<B>Christmas in October<BR>
</B>
<P>
October 3, 1996 will go down in the history books as a red letter day in the struggle to break free of the shackles of reactionary union leaders and their congressional lackeys.  On this day, the Senate broke the Kennedy fillibuster over a labor provision in the transportation bill, and the Labor Department erased its illicit and illegal striker replacement regulations.
<P>
The Kennedy fillibuster was designed to prevent a technical correction which would have clarified that Federal Express has always been, and shall continue to be, covered by the Railway Labor Act (RLA).  Under the RLA, unions must organize all workers of a company in a nationwide system.  Union organizers have been trying to ignore that law and organize smaller portions of FedEx under the rival National Labor Relations Act.
<P>
The National Labor Relations Board has been considering this issue for almost five years.  Now that the AFL-CIO controls a majority of the votes on the Board, including the vote of former Kennedy staffer Sarah M. Fox, the agency was poised to reverse the law to favor the unions.
<P>
Also, on October 3, the Labor Department officially nullified regulations implementing the striker replacement executive order.  That order was blocked by a federal appeals court as an unlawful power grab by the President.
<P>
While the nullification of the rules closes the official book on this sordid story of special interest pandering, the theme remains alive in the Democrat platform for 1996.  That document states:  "We support the President's actions to stop the government from procuring goods and services from companies that [hire permanent replacements]."  The action, though deemed illegal by the courts, is still supported by the President and his side-kicks John Sweeney, Dick Gephardt, and Tom Daschle.
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<B>Psst, the Law is Still the Law<BR>
</B>
<P>
Leave the Sweeney/Clinton Labor Board out of the case and the law remains the law.  In other words, a federal appeals court recently ruled that arbitrators still do not have the power to stick union contracts onto nonunion employers.
<P>
In the case involving Zcon Builders in California, the court upheld  long-standing precedent recognizing the separateness of different subsidiaries.  The union claimed that a nonunion firm was the alter ego of a unionized company, and sought to enforce its collective bargaining agreement against both.  An arbitrator issued an award of back pay against both firms, thus assuming power to act against the company that never signed the contract.  The appeals court rejected this power grab, ruling the arbitrator overstepped his authority.
<P>
The case is significant as a reaffirmation of the legitimate practice of double breasting, where businesses operate both union and nonunion subsidiaries.  It is symbolic because it comes only four months after the Sweeny/Clinton Labor Board issued its most pro-union decision to date on this or any other topic.  In the Board's Manganaro decision, reported in Labor Watch (5/17/96), the union activists on the Board ignored past precedent and ruled that unions can force contracts on nonunion subsidiaries.  The decision opened the door for imposing union membership and dues onto nonunion workers without a secret ballot election.
<P>
The good news is that the AFL-CIO policy machine has not yet annexed the federal courts.  Whether the NLRB can return to  neutral ground remains to be seen.
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B>Corporate Campaign Against Bridgestone/Firestone Hits the Information Superhighway<BR>
</B>
<P>
The United Steel Workers have expanded the venue of their corporate campaign against Bridgestone/Firestone from the traditional picket activities at subsidiary companies to the Internet.  The union's new world wide web site asks "cyber protesters" to send pro-union messages to the company.
<P>
Several municipal bodies, retailers and other companies have boycotted products and services of Bridgestone/Firestone.  Saturn reportedly is replacing Firestone Tires with another brand on all new cars at customers' request.
<P>
Despite the two year strike and corporate campaign, Bridgestone officials report that the company has maintained record sales and round the clock operations.  Late last month, Bridgestone/Firestone sent recall notices to all remaining strking workers.
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<B>Labor Unions Top List of OSHA Training Grant Recipients<BR>
</B>
<P>
Labor unions have never shied away from the U.S. government money tree, and it seems that green-backs are ripe for the picking from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  OSHA will disburse over $2 million in training grants to 26 non-profit groups to fund training  and research programs, with emphasis on ergonomics, back injury prevention, and safety and health programs.
<P>
Labor unions can expect to receive over one million dollars of the grant money.

<B>Rank-and-File vs. Sweeney<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>On September 1, 1996, AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney wrote an op-ed in <I>The Washington Times</I> defending
the union's use of members dues to subsidize political activities.
 On September 10, a union member responded.  Here is a brief excerpt
from the letter:
<P>
<i>As a member of an AFL-CIO-affiliated union,
I found John Sweeney's Commentary article (&quot;Debating the
AFL-CIO's Campaign Role:  Resource Allocation,&quot;- Sep. 1)
misleading and untruthful.</I>
<P>
<dd>Mr. Sweeney errs by stating that &quot;no
individual is ever forced to pay the pennies it costs each month
for his or her union's political activities.&quot;  While the
assessed amount for the &quot;grass-roots action and advertising
in the media&quot; he speaks of are small, not all unions are
complying with federal law prohibiting the use of dues for political
purposes.  I demanded a refund from the national president of
my union;  he refused to even consider this, claiming it would
jeopardize the union's standing with the AFL-CIO.  Thus, Mr. Sweeney's
claim is a lie.  While the individual amount of money may be small,
the principle being violated is not. 
<P>
<dd>...Four years of Clinton/Gore has been too
much.  This union member will be voting for Dole/Kemp this fall
because the Democrats have nothing to offer but higher taxes,
fear, misery and less freedom.  Mr. Sweeney is another power-grabbing
liberal, like the man he supports for the White House this fall.

<B>Clinton Administration Finally
Gives Up On Its Illegal Power Grab<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>As<I> Labor Watch</I> reader's recall, on
March 8, 1995, President Clinton issued an executive order to
bar the government from contracting with companies that fire and
permanently replace their striking workers.  The order applied
to contracts over $100,000.
<P>
<dd>The President was temporarily blocked by a
federal judge, and a federal appeals court unanimously overturned
his order on February 2, 1996.  The judge in the case said that
Clinton's actions violated federal labor law &quot;which guarantees
the right to hire permanent replacements.&quot;  They also called
the administration's arguments &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;far-fetched.&quot;
 The President's order would have covered federal government contracts
totaling $437 billion or 6.5% of GNP.
<P>
<dd>According to the senior counsel at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce -- one of the parties that filed suit against
the order -- the decision &quot;means that when federal labor
law grants a business a certain right, the President can't just
come in and take it away by executive fiat.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<dd>The Administration decided this week not to
take the case to the Supreme Court, but Labor Secretary Robert
Reich loyally defended the President's action even though the
order was viewed as &quot;far-reaching&quot; by the courts.<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B>Mini Task Force on Health Care
Reform<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>All systems are &quot;GO&quot; for the Clinton
Administration's push for guaranteed (government-run) universal
health care coverage.  The President has tapped Secretaries Robert
B. Reich of Labor and Donna Shalala of Health &amp; Human Services
to lead the National Commission on Health Care Quality.  Membership
of the advisory panel is expected to include labor union leaders
and representatives from the health, insurance and &quot;business&quot;
communities.  The Commission, among other things, will &quot;study
the need for consumer protections, guarantee quality of care,
and assure access to health care services.&quot;
<P>
<dd>Reich and Shalala replace the dynamic duo,
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and guru Ira Magaziner, whose
failed top-to-bottom health care reform is credited as a key reason
why Democrats where voted out of Congress in 1994.  With labor
unions and the left elated with the new commission, it is projected
that the Reich-Shalala proposals will be reminiscent of the old
Clinton-health care plan.  Even with the passage of Kennedy-Kassebaum,
President Clinton's &quot;business agenda&quot; in his second
term, if reelected ,will focus heavily on health care reform.
<P>
Is it too early to dust off Harry and Louise?
<BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<B>Chicken Little<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich's nationwide
sweatshop sweep recently took him to DeCoster Egg Farm in Turner,
Maine.  With a media cadre and state Democrat legislators in tow,
the U.S. Department of Labor's investigation into housing and
labor violations resulted in a $3.6 million fine against the company.
<P>
<dd>DeCoster Egg Farms is no small-time closet
operations.  It is the town's biggest taxpayer and employer, with
360 employees.  According to a city official, &quot;The town's
own inspectors had long insured that the egg farm kept up to local
codes.&quot; 
<P>
<dd> However, DeCoster agreed to comply with the
DOL findings, including purchasing new housing for workers.  Unfortunately,
the story does not end here.  The Reich investigation-turned-media
expos&eacute; damaged company sales and tarnished the company's
image - despite quick compliance.
<P>
<dd>The Administration's &quot;reinvention initiatives&quot;
calling for partnerships between government and business to correct
labor violations have proven to be empty promises.  We can expect
the 1996 presidential campaign to showcase  Reich as he conducts
more inappropriate media-laden crackdowns to make the news - 
not a difference -  on companies that supposedly violate labor
laws<BR>

<B>Unhatched and Mobilized - </B>
<br>
<B>Federal Employees Gear Up for '96<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>With more than 3 million federal employees now &quot;unhatched&quot;
to fully participate in partisan political activities if they
want to, President Clinton has unleashed a tremendous political
force than can help him win this November with the liberalization
of the Hatch Act in 1993.  A diversity of interests have long
opposed overhauling the 1939 Hatch Act - a bill that bars federal
workers from participating in various political activities, and
in theory, protects them from political coercion.
<P>
<dd>The main assertion has been that liberalizing the Act would give
more power to unions, and thus Democrats.  Federal union members
who can now attend Chicago as delegates to the Democrat National
Convention have not been shy about sharing what they plan to do
with their new found freedom.  As quoted in <I>The</I> <I>Washington
Post</I> on August 26, Myke Reed of the American Postal Workers
Union (APWU) says, &quot;Surveys showed that 40% of union households
voted Republican in 1994...It's not going to happen again.&quot;
<P>
<dd>The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) also plans to flex
its partisan muscle.  The NTEU is targeting 39 congressional seats
- those who are &quot;anti-federal employee lawmakers.  The President
of the NTEU is quoted as saying that President Clinton's changes
in the law allow them to &quot;have a real opportunity this time
to influence the outcome of a number of elections.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<B>Mean-Extreme Republicans are at it Again...First
They're Cutting Medicare, Now They're Raiding Pensions<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is encouraging
Democratic candidates to say that Republicans in Congress &quot;voted
to allow corporate raids of employee pension funds&quot; and &quot;voted
to allow companies to take the money without informing their employees
or retirees.&quot;
<P>
<dd>According a survey conducted by Stan Greenberg (oh great health
care pollster for President Clinton), the pension message tested
by him is the strongest campaign weapon yet.  A memo from the
DCCC states, &quot;The pension raids are the strongest reason
to vote against a GOP Member of Congress this fall.&quot;  The
second strongest message is &quot;Cutting medicare to pay for
tax cuts for the wealthy.&quot;  
<P>
<dd>Both claims are false, but truth has nothing to do with labor
leaders wanting a Democrat Congress next  year.  The AFL-CIO is
running ads pushing both messages.
<P>
<dd>In the DCCC memo, there is no mention of the specific &quot;pension
raid&quot; legislation to back up their claims for candidates.
 For the record, the Republican Reconciliation Bill eased the
tax burden for businesses which chose to use excess pension funds
above 125% of current pension liability for other business/economic
activity.  This minor adjustment to the tax law is &quot;the big
pension raid&quot; labor unions refer to in their rhetoric, and
in their multi-million dollar ad campaigns.  The change in law
simply encourages businesses to reinvest excess pension funds
into the company to create more opportunities for their workers.
<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B>Media Reality Check -</B>
<B> Union Dominance of the Democrat Party<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>Most news surveys have found that union members made up approximately
34% of delegates to the Democrat convention - a figure kindly
passed over as trivial matter.  
<P>
<dd>According to the Media Research Center in its daily coverage of
media reporting on the convention, the media has reported that
union members dominate the delegate count in Chicago, but they
have failed to raise questions concerning &quot;who controls the
party.&quot;   The Center's <I>Media Reality Check '96</I> reports,
&quot;Only 21% of GOP delegates said they were part of the religious
right, but in San Diego, CBS worried about their having too much
influence.  On Sunday, August 11, Face the Nation guest gave five
ominous questions.&quot;  But television guests in Chicago have
not been asked similar questions about control of the Democrat
party relative to union influence. 
<P>
<dd> Here are the number of delegates that the major unions sent to
Chicago:  the AFL-CIO sent 811 delegates to the Democrat National
Convention; National Education Association sent over 400 delegates;
and the American Federation of Teachers sent 150 delegates.<BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<B>Operation Liberty Bell<BR>
</B>
<P>
<dd>The National Right to Work Committee mounted a challenge to organized
labor's $35 million campaign against Republican members of Congress
up for re-election by kicking off a national campaign called &quot;Operation
Liberty Bell.&quot; 
<P>
<dd> The National Right to Work Committee campaign will inform workers
of their <U>Beck </U>right to a refund of the portion of their
union dues that is used for purposes other than collective bargaining
- for example, political campaigns and lobbying activities.
<P>
<dd>An April 1996 Frank Luntz and Associates poll found that 62% of
union members opposed the use of their dues for negative political
advertising against Republicans; 59% would ask for a refund of
their dues; and 78% did not know they could file a form to stop
payment of their dues for political purposes.

<b>Education Lobby Shifts Political Strategy --<br>
NEA Has New Presence at GOP Convention</b>
<p>
<dd>While the bulk of the education lobby's PAC money is dedicated to electing Democrats, the National Education Association ( NEA) claims that the '94 elections were a "wake-up call" that required their presence at the GOP convention in San Diego.
<p>
<dd>According to a new poll of NEA members, the union found that its rank-and-file is evenly split in its political affiliation -- one-third are Republicans, one-third are Democrats, and one-third are Independents. The poll also reports that union members feel that the NEA is too partisan.
<p>
<dd>Accordingly, the NEA held several events with Republicans this week at the Convention -- in order to build bridges.
<p>
<dd>A recent report showed that close to 99% of the NEA's political action funds are directed to Democrats, but nonetheless, the education lobby claims that they will not try to elect Democrats "but a pro-education majority."
<p>
<dd>There 34 NEA delegates to the GOP convention and the Republican Mainstream Coalition (liberal Republicans) hosted an event to discuss how to avoid "cuts in education." Republican members of Congress speaking at the program included Senator James Jeffords, and Representatives Sherwood Boehlert and Jim Leach.
<p>
<dd>NEA president-elect Bob Chase says he came to San Diego in search of "common ground" -- but GOP insiders say the teacher's lobby can first begin with common sense, by ending their political attacks on Republicans.
<p>
<a name="reversal"></a>
<b>A Reversal of Fortune</b>
<p>
<dd>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was forced to practice-what-it-preaches, in a reverse discrimination suit against the Commission from an EEOC employee. A federal district court recently sided with the plaintiff, a white-male attorney for the EEOC, who charged that he was denied promotions 10 times between 1984-1992.
<p>
<dd>The EEOC and Justice Department continue to remain tight-lipped on the case. The plaintiff received outstanding job performance appraisals in addition to receiving certification from a management training course during his long tenure at the Commission. The federal district court awarded the plaintiff $150,000 in damages and $300,000 in back pay.
<p>
<dd>The EEOC initiates discrimination suits against employers, but was reminded in court that, "Federal agencies such as defendant EEOC are under a particularly compelling mandate to adhere strictly to the requirements of Title VII."
<p>
<a name="objectors"></a>
<b>Conscientious Objectors Have Rights, Too</b>
<p>
<dd>A public sector union must accommodate the religious beliefs of a Roman Catholic worker who opposes union stances on social issues, a U.S. District Court judge ruled earlier this month. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) must allow the union member to donate to charity, an amount equal to his mandatory union fees, so that he does not inadvertently contribute to causes he objects to on moral or religious grounds.
<p>
<dd>The worker objected to positions taken by the union on abortion and the death penalty, and also to "supporting an organization (AFSCME) that champion theses issues," according to the judge. Not only was the union ordered to allow the worker to pay an amount equal to his union fees to an "agreed upon" charitable organization, but it was ordered to refund his fees from 1991.
<p>
<a name="overhaul"></a>
<b>Time to Overhaul the NLRB</b>
<p>
<dd>The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation released a new report documenting the bias of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and its interpretation of labor law. The report also outlines reform measures to move both labor law and the NLRB into the 21 st century.
<p>
<dd>According to the study entitled "Time to Overhaul Labor Law and the NLRB," the NLRB has taken judicial activism to the extreme  blatant political NLRB decisions have been consistently reversed by the courts who hear such cases. In addition, current NLRB Chairman William Gould has publicly stated his support or opposition to various pieces of legislation before Congress -- an act that is unprecedented for what is supposed to be an impartial arbritor of labor law.

<CENTER>Union Money Well Spent - New Board's Decision Advances
Labor Agenda<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<P>
A new Administrative Review Board set up by Labor Secretary Reich
in June, has expanded the Davis-Bacon Act to include more workers.
 The Davis-Bacon Act requires government-determined prevailing
wages be paid to workers on taxpayer-funded construction projects.
<P>
Specifically, the panel ruled that <U>suppliers</U> to a federally-funded
construction project also must pay Davis-Bacon wages to their
workers even though those workers do not work at the construction
site.  In reaching its decision, the Review Board had to reverse
the decision of an administrative law judge, and evade a 1994
federal circuit court ruling that exempted off-site work from
the payment of &quot;prevailing wages.&quot;  
<P>
In this case, Bechtel Constructors was getting the raw materials
it needed (for a federal construction project) from a quarry which
did not pay prevailing wages to the quarry workers.  They must
now pay these workers back wages in accordance with the Davis-Bacon
Act.
<P>
 One ironic feature of the case is that the defendant, Bechtel
Constructors, is a big beneficiary of the Davis-Bacon Act and
opposes its repeal.   Building trade unions, which have contributed
heavily to congressional Democrats and to the Clinton-Gore campaign,
have long sought this specific change in the way the Labor Department
administers the Davis-Bacon Act.<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<CENTER><B>There He Goes Again<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) should have greater
powers to penalize employers, according to its chairman, William
B. Gould.  In the same breath, the chairman then criticized the
Republican Congress for seeking to &quot;emasculate&quot; his
agency by threatening budget cuts.
<P>
Chairman Gould has never missed an opportunity to express his
view that labor laws should be tilted in favor of unions.  His
speech this week to the California Labor Federation was no exception.
 But the union theme of Republican bashing was an added feature.
 Gould was effusive in his expression of thanks to California
labor bosses and Democrats for their efforts to protect his budget
and their agenda.
<P>
Most Board watchers agree that members should not criticize the
very law they are sworn to uphold.  Chairman Gould has consistently
flaunted this rule of professionalism and decorum.  His partisan
attacks also continue to destroy any pretext of impartiality.
<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<CENTER><B>Non-Union Hotels and Democrats<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
A major Chicago labor union is upset that the Democrats have included
three nonunion hotels on the list of &quot;Democrat National Convention
Hotels&quot; for next month's big convention, <I>The</I> <I>Washington
Times</I> reports.  The Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees'
Chicago local had issued a list of nonunion establishments to
be shunned at the convention, and apparently Democrat planners
were compelled to ignore the union directive due to a shortage
of room space.
<P>
The Democratic National Convention Committee (DNCC) recently conferred
official convention status upon two Marriott Hotels and  Swisshotel.
 Marriott hotels have long been prominent on every union blacklist
because its staff refuses to unionize.
<P>
Although Bill Clinton and Al Gore plan to patronize a union hotel
for the convention, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
are stunned and appalled at the DNCC's decision.  <BR>
<P>
<a name="four"></a>
<CENTER><B>Bond Assails Clinton Veto of TEAM Act<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
As expected, President Clinton vetoed the Teamwork for Employment
and Management (TEAM) Act, and one U.S. Senator took Clinton's
action to task. 
<P>
 Senator Kit Bond, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business,
said that political pandering by the President on behalf of organized
labor played a major role in Clinton's decision to veto the TEAM
act.
<P>
Bond said an alarming pattern had developed.  &quot;President
Clinton's message to small business is 'get to the back of the
line; what labor wants, labor gets,' &quot; he said.
<P>
The TEAM Act amends the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
to allow employees and managers at nonunion companies to resolve
workplace issues such as scheduling, safety and health, and even
things like free coffee and company softball teams.  The legislation
would not allow employee teams to act as unions since they could
not engage in collective bargaining or act as exclusive representatives
of employees.
<P>
&quot;Opponents and even some misguided individuals in the news
media have claimed that the TEAM Act would allow 'company dominated
unions,' an assertion that is absolutely false,' &quot; said Senator
Bond.  
<P>
Once again, President Clinton has proven that the only &quot;team&quot;
he'll play on is organized labor.<BR>

<b>D.C. Labor Unions Derail Health Clinic for At-Risk Residents</b><br>

The July 1 edition of <i>The Washington Post</i> reports that labor unions representing District of Columbia health workers have halted efforts to open a health clinic for low-income residents of the North Capitol Street area of Washington, D.C.
<p>
After hearing many complaints about the shoddy treatment at her neighborhood clinic, community activist Alverta Munlyn decided that her neighbors would benefit if they, along with private and public organizations, came together to operate the city's nearby faltering clinic.  Munlyn also figured out that the new clinic would save the financially-strapped city $700,000 initially, and $1.3 million annually in subsequent years.
<p>
Munlyn convinced Providence Hospital to manage the clinic, Georgetown University to provide the doctors; public health officials to close the faltering clinic to subsidize hers; and finally, Munlyn persuaded Mayor Marion Barry to support her efforts.
<p>
But then the labor unions stepped in. Labor leaders -- fearful that labor infested hospitals would close if too many low-income residents chose private clinics -- believe that the city's poor should be cared for through a network of union-supported services. And now, city officials who once proclaimed the clinic as the perfect model for public-private partnership, have backed off from their earlier endorsements and offer weak reassurances that Munlyn's idea will be achieved.
<p>
D.C. Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), outraged at the union's narrow position, says that labor unions should put their "interests aside for the better interest of the community."
<p>
But, the labor unions have not backed-off, putting their interests above the low-income residents in the District of Columbia. <i>Labor Watch</i> concludes that when labor leaders talk about universal health care for all, they only approve of such services when the jobs and money are fimnelled through them.
<p><br><b>
<a name="detroit">
If the Sweeney/Clinton Board Thinks It's Bad, It Must Be Awful
</b><br>
What is black and white, and walked all over? The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) settlement agreement with striking unions at the <i>Detroit News</i> and the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>.
<p>
Fed up with picket line misconduct, the NLRB is threatening Detroit's striking newspaper unions with a court injunction if the misconduct is not ended. Earlier in the labor dispute, the NLRB reached an "informal" settlement with the striking unions in which the "unions pledged not to block entrances to the newspaper's property, threaten or coerce replacement workers or employees who have crossed the picket lines, or engage in other strike misconduct." According to the Board's Detroit Regional Office, the agreement was breached "almost as the ink was drying." Unions however deny involvement in picket line misconduct, and say the violence is caused by the newspaper's private security.
<p>
The NLRB is currently seeking a "formal" settlement with the unions. If broken, the unions would be forced to end the misconduct and could force fines and other penalties.

Labor-loving Republicans Snubbed by Labor
</b><br>
A two-term, labor-loving Republican will not receive the '96 endorsement of local labor leaders as he did in 1994.
<p>
But maybe someone forgot to tell Rep. Jack Quinn (R-NY) that he's not a Democrat. Nope -- Sorry! Buffalo Labor Relations Council President John Kaczorowski did in fact remind Quinn of his party status.
<p>
According to a July 15 article in <i>The Washington Times</i>, Kaczorowski said, "We even told him if he were a Democrat he wouldn't be having this problem." The Labor Council has endorsed Quinn's opponent -- a Democrat -- even though Quinn voted against NAFTA, against the TEAM Act, led the fight for the Family and Medical Leave Act, and authored the bill in the House to hike the minimum wage.
<p>
Quinn is appealing the local decision to the state AFL-CIO, but it looks bleak for a reversal. According to the state director, overturning the decision remains questionable. "Basically we don't feel that the labor agenda has progressed much this year," she said. The state AFL-CIO will announce their endorsements mid-September.

<a name="team">
Teamsters Will Be Teamsters
</b><br>
The Teamster's nominating convention at the Philadelphia Convention center was disrupted early on by shouts, jeers and rude chants by supporters of James Hoffa, the challenger to incumbent president Ron Carey. Carey's detractors claim that he has taken power from the locals, denied democratic process to reform-minded Teamsters, and drained the union's finances. At the convention, Carey refused to allow anyone to speak in opposition to his appointment of 120 unelected delegates. A voice vote on the issue was held, and Carey declared victory despite an apparent majonty of opposing votes. He ignored calls for a stand-up vote, and pandemonium ensued.
<p>
The booing, cheers, and catcalls drowned out the Pledge of Allegiance, Carey's speech, and those of everyone else who came to the podium with the exception of Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua's invocation. Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA) was invited to speak, but both his introduction by Carey and the Senator's attempted remarks were overpowered by the anarchy. Afler delivering a scathing criticism of the Teamsters' behavior, Specter left in disgust. When asked whether the day's disruption had discredited the union, one official responded, "We're Teamsters, we're not choir boys."

<a name="one"></a>
 <center><h2>Right-to-Work Law Goes Down in Senate</h2></center><p>
Twenty-one states have right-to-work rules, but the Senate didn't come close to applying the law nationwide.  The law would bar union contracts from requiring nonmembers to pay dues as a condition of employment.<p>
Sounding like a limited government type-of-guy, Senator Ted Kennedy used the following rationale in leading the charge to kill the bill.  He said:<p>
We do not want the long arm of the federal government interfering with the legitimate interests of the states.<p>
<hr>
<a name="two"></a>
 <center><h2>Clinton: Not a TEAM Player</center></h2><p>

The Teamwork for Employees and Management (TEAM) Act was approved by the Senate (53 to 46) yesterday, with identical legislation overwhelmingly approved by the House last year.  <p>
But don't expect the President to sign the legislation even though he touts the concept of teamwork in the workplace. Organized labor deeply opposes the measure, and surely Clinton will veto it. <p> 
The TEAM Act amends the National Labor Relations Act to permit teams composed of employees and employers in nonunion settings to address mutual concerns in the workplace including scheduling, work assignments, health and safety issues, training, job descriptions and work rules.<p>
Clinton portrayed the TEAM Act as a vehicle for company-dominated unions to suppress workers and undermine employees rights to elect their own representatives.<p>
Many businesses have abandoned the workplace teams practice in fear that they may become the target of a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) complaint, with the Board ruling against them as they have with several companies.<p>
The only TEAM Clinton is on these days is big labor.  Another election-year payoff appears to be in the works.<p>

<a name="three"></a>
<center><h2> Labor Chat</center></h2><p>

A chatroom on the Internet found some rank-and-file members disillusioned with their former union.
In this case, former members of the Wisconsin State Employees Union were lamenting about the AFSCME (American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees) judicial process.  Not happy with how their local union was operating, a union member thought AFSCME could help.  
According to the former union member:<p>
Anyone that's gone through AFSCME 'judicial process' knows it's essentially a political process designed to suppress union democracy.  That's true for the labor movement, and which is part of the reason there's only about a 16% national union membership.  Think about it: Who wants to pay dues to be suppressed?
Good question - and one which more union members are asking.<p>
 
 
  <hr>
<a name="four"></a>
 <center><h2>Another One Bites the Dust, Part III</center></h2><p>
Another union boss being ousted for corruption may sound like just another ho-hum story, but its big news for the 26,000 members of the Carpenters District Council in New York.<p>
The union took action against the local leadership after discovering well documented ties between several New York crime families and district council leaders, the preferential treatment of individuals tied to crime families at the expense of rank-and-file members, the use of union funds to pay the legal costs of defending council leaders against charges of corruption and the misuse of members benefit funds.<p>
One of the ousted leaders, Council President Frederick W. Devine, succeeded Paschall McGuinnes who is the current secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department.  Devine, who was earning $360,000 a year, allowed preferential hiring for mob-tied workers at a major New York City construction project, and attempted to establish a labor-management cooperation fund that would have paid him an additional $175,000.<p>
<hr>
<a name="five"></a>
 <center><h2>An Inspector In Every Worksite</center></h2><p>

As reported in past editions of Labor Watch, the  Labor Party was founded in Cleveland, Ohio June 6 - 9.  Labor Watch promised to bring you more platform highlights that define the agenda of the new party.  In platform item #15, the Labor Party calls for an increase in the number of worksite inspections as well as the placement of in-house inspectors in all workplaces.  <p>
The platform reads:<p>
<ul>
<li><i>For starters, we need the right to act and to enforce any and all safety and health regulations.
We call for national legislation to train and deputize workers to be on the job inspectors in each and every workplace.<p>
<li>Such inspectors should be protected against corporate harassment and discrimination and should be able to do their job without fear of reprisal.<p>
<li>Such inspectors should have the power to shut down hazardous operations; enforce the right of every worker to refuse unsafe work;should have the power to investigate incidents to uncover their root cause; and to force the implementation of their findings.<p>
</i><ul><p>
In other words, the Labor Party is simply calling on business owners to allow the government and unions total management control of their operations.<p>

<P>
<a name="one"></a>
<B><i>The NLRB <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> Unabashed
Advocate for Big Labor<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Here is the ultimate proof that Organized Labor has received what
it paid for <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> a National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) that will satisfy the union agenda in every
instance.
<P>
Last week, NLRB Chairman Gould cast aside all sense of propriety,
decorum and lip service to impartiality by publicly denouncing
the TEAM Act, a bill to promote workplace cooperation.  Using
such rhetoric terming the bill &quot;classic Republican overkill,&quot;
 while renaming the measure the &quot;Employer Domination Act,&quot;
Gould left the arena of ideas and wholly joined the AFL-CIO propaganda
machine.
<P>
NLRB board members are judges.  The Labor Board is not supposed
to be the policy arm of the Clinton Administration, the Democratic
National Committee, nor the AFL-CIO. Gould has not only chosen
to embroil himself in a major legislative controversy, he's proven
himself an unabashed advocate of big labor rather than an impartial
judge of the law.
<P>
Just last month, as reported in <I>Labor Watch,</I> the Clinton
NLRB reversed long-standing law by giving unions the power to
shut down businesses in their effort to unionize separate companies.
 That case, involving a construction firm, established the new
rule of law that unions are free to strike, harass, and destroy
companies with which they have no bargaining relationship, so
long as the unions claim they are entitled to the type of work
in question; i.e., as part of a work preservation effort.
<P>
As Bill Gould showed last week, what John Sweeney and labor leaders
want from the NLRB, John Sweeney and the labor leaders get.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"> </a>
<i><B>Proposed Legislation Strengthens Beck Decision
<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Workers will have a right to know how labor leaders spend their
union dues under new legislation introduced by House Republicans.
 The Worker Right To Know Act, H.R. 3580, strengthens provisions
under the <I>Beck</I> decision, which allows workers to obtain
a rebate of the portion of their dues not related to collective
bargaining.
<P>
Key provisions under the Worker Right to Know Act:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT>Require unions to get annual
written authorization from each worker before accepting or demanding
payment of money  not spent for collective bargaining and contract
administration; i.e., for political purposes;
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Establish an independent
auditor to determine the percentage of dues money that is spent
on collective bargaining or noncollective bargaining;
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Prohibit unions from forcing
workers to join and pay dues as a condition of employment;
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Allow workers to participate
in a union without paying the portion of dues that goes towards
non-collective bargaining activities; and
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Require unions to report
annually to the Department of Labor on how dues money is spent.
<P>
AFL-CIO President, John J. Sweeney labeled the new bill as &quot;a
calculated effort to chill our exercise of First Amendment rights
to inform members and the public about attacks this Congress is
leading against working families.&quot;
<P>
In reality, the legislation simply gives workers more protections
and say over how their union dues is spent.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<a name="three"></a>
<B><i>The Little Theater that Could<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
A small, nonprofit children's theater in New York City could boast
of standing-room-only if not for the fact that the crowds have
been union pickets.  The New Victory Theater on 42nd Street has
been the target of big Broadway unions who are trying to muscle
their way on stage.
<P>
New Victor uses nonunion workers, which helps keep ticket prices
down.  The theater's practice has not received warm reviews from
the labor unions, including ushers, makeup artists, and press
agents.  They fear that potential new neighbor, Disney, will follow
New Victory's lead when they move in down the block.  In the meantime,
the show will go on, union pickets and all.<BR>
<P>

<i><B>New Labor Party Imports European Model for Economic
Disaster<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
As reported in the June 6 edition of <I>Labor Watch</I>, a new
American Labor Party met June 6 - 9 in Cleveland, Ohio.  The Labor
Party agreed to 16 principles that they would pursue as part of
their legislative and political agenda.  <I>Labor Watch</I> will
periodically list these principles <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
in this edition, we highlight Principle 6:
<P>
<CENTER>Less Work, More Money<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Labor Party calls for amending the Fair Labor Standards Act
to:
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> A 32-hour, 4-day work week
(without loss of pay or benefits).
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Provide a minimum of double-time
pay for all hours worked over 32 hours a week and 8 hours a day.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> Forbid compulsory overtime.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> An hour off with pay for
every 2 hours of overtime.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> 20 mandatory paid vacation
days plus all federal holidays.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">-</FONT> One year paid leave for every
7 years of work.
<P>
Together with the Labor Party's call for universal health care,
paid family leave, free child and elder care for all, and a constitutional
requirement that all Americans be guaranteed a job at (a minimum)
of $10 per hour adjusted for inflation <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
they claim these proposals will help create millions of new jobs.

<i><B>Taxpayer Outrage:  Union Officials' Salaries Paid with
</B></i>
<P><i>
<B>Medicare &amp; Social Security Trust Fund Dollars<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
And you thought labor unions were opposed to reforming  Social
Security and Medicare only because they cared about elderly Americans
being tossed onto the mean streets - hah!  The real reason has
recently emerged from scant media reports exposing blatant federal
subsidies to unions.
<P>
According to a June 6 editorial in the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>:
<P>
<I>The practice in question happens at the Social Security Administration.
 The federal agency pays the salaries of employees who work full
time or part time on labor union business.  It pays them from
the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, which most taxpayers
wrongly assume go exclusively to pay the retirements and health
care of U.S. workers.</I>
<P>
<I>It is all very legal.  Federal law requires it.  In fact, the
law also requires Social Security to provide office space and
administrative support services to its unions.</I>
<P>
According to the editorial, Social Security employees paid $4.8
million in union dues last year.  Still, taxpayers subsidize about
145 full-time and 1800 part-time union officials.  Under Clinton's
tenure (citing <I>Dallas Morning News </I>figures): <I>the amount
spent by Social Security on union business increased 83% to $11
million from 1993 to 1995...The number of employees who worked
full time as union representatives increased 81% during the same
period.</I>
<P>
Of course, the $4.8 million the unions collect in dues could easily
cover union officials' salaries <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
but why bother when the taxpayer is picking up the tab?
<P>
Recent studies show that Medicare will be bankrupt by 2001 and
Social Security by 2029.  And if unions keep pigging-out in their
share of trust fund money by beefing up both part time and full
time union staff, the trust funds will surely be empty sooner
than their anticipated bankruptcy in 2013.<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="two"></a>
<B>Irrational Labor Relations Board<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Once again the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has been
slapped down by a federal appeals court for stacking the law against
employers.  The NLRB sought to force employers to hire union activists
who apply for positions that have  access to confidential and
sensitive labor relations information.
<P>
The Clinton NLRB required that an employer must produce objective
evidence showing that an applicant for a confidential job would
be disloyal to the employer.  Union membership or union activities
were not considered sufficient grounds.  The appeals court in
the Seventh Circuit rejected the NLRB position,  explaining that
the rule had &quot;no rational basis,&quot; that it &quot;is not
a <B>rational</B> construction of the Act,&quot; and &quot;requires
an employer to make an almost impossible showing.&quot;
<P>
The case was sent back to the Clinton appointees who no doubt
will make another stab at curtailing employer rights.<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="three"></a>
<B>Big Labor Getting On Democrat's Nerves <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
Columbus Mayor Seeks 'Management Rights'<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
The current Mayor of Columbus, Ohio <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
known throughout his six years in the state Senate as a liberal
Democrat <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> has apparently
had it with Ohio's &quot;obstructionist&quot; collective bargaining
law.  Mayor Michael R. White detailed his frustrations with the
law in a May 20 letter to Senate President Stanley Aronoff, a
Republican from Cincinnati.
<P>
The letter, also sent to Governor George Voinovich, comes as White
has attempted to privatize some city operations, and improve city
services in an effort to save money.  According to the <I>Cleveland
Plain Dealer</I>, White asked the state legislature to change
the 13-year old law.  The letter      contends that the law permitting
government workers to organize &quot;has become a tool of unions&quot;
and has caused the &quot;emasculation of meaningful management
rights.&quot;  White also criticized the State Employment Relations
Board because the collective bargaining law had been distorted
by the board's rulings.
<P>
While conservatives are jubilant over their newfound ally in Mayor
White, union reaction has been bitter.  The head of the Cleveland
Police Patrolemen's Association said, &quot;The guy's got a lot
of nerve.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="four"></a>
<B>A Kodak Moment We Wish We Had<BR>
</B></i>
<P>
Union summer &quot;Boot Camp&quot; unleashed the new generation
of union activists this week, and AFL-CIO President John Sweeney
took an active role in training sessions.
<P>
In Boston, Sweeney role-played a &quot;hostile employer&quot;
with the young activists in order to prepare them for the organizing
campaigns of hospital workers, city employees and laundry workers.
<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="five"></a>
<B>Union Rank-and-File vs. Labor Dictators<BR>
</B><i>
<P>
&quot;I've always been taught that unions are a brotherhood. 
To me this is more like the Mafia.  We are not supposed to come
out and use our own heads.  But this is not communism.  You don't
just vote for the party anymore.&quot;
<P>
<FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> Carrie Duhon, school bus
driver. As quoted in  <I>The Washington Times</I> on her local
Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers International Union wanting
to endorse Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX), but told &quot;...they
couldn't do it.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<i><a name="six"></a>
 <B>Minimum Wage Quote<BR>

Hiking the minimum wage is &quot;the wrong way to raise the incomes

announce the formation of an American labor party.  While the
name of the party has yet to be decided upon, its agenda and political
strategy has been well conceived.
<P>
The labor party will not endorse candidates (it believes the Democrat
Party has moved too far to the right) or run candidates for office
for several years, but it does intend to be a major political
force on issue advocacy and use the party to &quot;frame the nation's
political debate in terms of class <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
a broad working class against irresponsible, unacceptable corporate
power.&quot;  According to a May 27 article written for <I><B>In
These Times</B></I> (a twice-monthly left-leaning newspaper),
labor party advocates claim that its union supporters now number
over 1 million people <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> or
6% of the labor movement.
<P>
According to the article, the labor party's statements of principle
include the following <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> &quot;a
constitutional right to a job at a living wage; an income stability
fund to protect workers against job dislocation and downsizing
(see <I><B>Labor Watch</B></I> May 10, Issue 12 on New Jersey
proposal); free higher education for all; assurances of basic
social needs (single-payer health care, longer paid vacations,
affordable day care); and shorter work time.&quot;  The principles
also include union dominance in the workplace and &quot;just transition
to a non-polluting economic system and genuine equality of opportunity.&quot;
<P>
Interestingly, the party's chief organizers and advocates say
that they've made a major effort to &quot;minimize the influence
of small sectarian left groups.&quot;
<P>
Lastly, both labor party organizers and the AFL-CIO see their
goals as complimentary as the agenda of the new party is &quot;not
all that different&quot; from the unions.<BR>
<P>
<a name="two"></a>
<B><i>Going Postal<BR></i>
</B>
<P>
A new theory behind workplace violence was unveiled at the recent
meeting of the National Academy of Arbitrators <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
and all indications are that attendees may be in need of having
their heads examined.
<P>
Psychologists and unions now attribute incidents of employee violence
to failures in the workplace <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT>
<U>not</U> &quot;bad people,&quot; or &quot;crazy workers.&quot;
 For example, workplace factors that lead to violence can include
an employee reaction to unbearable workplace stress, such as downsizing
or the interaction with a person, or a situation.
<P>
While unions were quick to pin the blame of this serious issue
directly on human resource managers and employers, they were slow
to provide helpful solutions to the problem.  Unions denounced
the use of preventative measures, such as psychological profiles,
to help identify potentially violent employees.  According to
an official with the public-employee union American Federation
of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), lots of profiles
of violent employees &quot;sound like the profile of a good union
steward.&quot;<BR>

<B><i>LIUNA Turns to Print Campaign to Clean-Up It's Image</i></B>
<P>
<B>Blames &quot;Right-Wingers&quot; for Its Trouble</B>
<P>
Feeling a little sensitive about being exposed for a rich history
of corruption and its ties to organized crime, the Laborers International
Union of North America (LIUNA) was compelled to purchase a full-page
ad in <I>The Washington Post</I> this week to &quot;answer its
critics.&quot;  Of course, LIUNA officials charged &quot;right-wing
extremists&quot; for their own internal troubles.
<P>
In a lengthy discourse (1849 words) the full-page ad reveals LIUNA's
own wrongdoings.  Boasting that LIUNA has implemented &quot;a
tough new Ethics and Disciplinary Code with zero tolerance for
any form of misconduct,&quot; the union is also proud of the fact
that it has hired, full-time, &quot;a former top official in the
Justice Department's Organized Crime Unit,&quot; and a former
top official in the investigative unit of the FBI.
<P>
The full-page ad, in essence, documents the massive irregularities
and corruption which has plagued the union for years.
<P>
The ad then proceeds to blame Republican leaders (&quot;Opponents
of Change&quot;) and &quot;Moronic Media Coverage&quot; for making
fraudulent charges against LIUNA.  These &quot;charges&quot; just
happen to be the details of the facts so competently described
in LIUNA's lengthy full-page ad.  While LIUNA wrote extensively
in the ad about their own problems and the corrective actions
they were taking to clean up the union, the only charges of &quot;Right-Wing
Mud-Throwing&quot; detailed in the ad were that House Speaker
Gingrich and Majority Leader Armey &quot;are dusting off all of
the old, discredited myths and buzzwords: big labor, out-of-touch,
union bosses.&quot;  LIUNA also takes aim at a recent <I>Reader's
Digest</I> article that chronicles the history of LIUNA and its
current leader, Arthur Coia.  LIUNA, in the ad, had nothing to
say about Coia's questionable ties to organized crime, and only
took aim at the details of the ongoing investigation of the union
by the federal government.
<P>
In effect, LIUNA took out the full-page ad to report that it has
been forced to take massive and unprecedented corrective measures
to clean up its operation, and is blaming &quot;right-wing extremists&quot;
for further reporting on and exposing its problems.  LIUNA boasts
of its clean-up efforts, but the question remains:  If LIUNA were
accountable to its members, and ran the union in an ethical and
legal manner, would the full-page ad been necessary in the first
place?
<P><a name="two"></a>
<B><i>Teachers Plan Fall Agenda</i></B>
<P>
<B>'96 Elections - Not the Classroom - Focus of Meeting</B>
<P>
The National Education Association (NEA) just completed a three-day
meeting with congressional contacts to devise a strategy for teachers'
unions in the fall elections.  The NEA and the American Federation
of Teachers (AFT) are the two main unions, with over three million
members.
<P>
According to <I>Investor's Business Daily</I>, a study of the
NEA's liberal legislative agenda shows that they and the American
Federation of Teachers are firmly established in the liberal tax-and-spend
pro-union Democrat camp.  In 1994, for example, Democrats got
99% of its PAC money, and 99% of the AFT's.  Passage of everything
on the NEA's spending &quot;wish list&quot; that year would have
cost taxpayers an extra $702 billion a year.  That shakes out
to $10,544 a year in additional taxes for a family of four.  In
addition, the NEA's plan would increase the size of government
by nearly 40%.  Of course, most of the issues on their list have
little or nothing to do with education.

<i><B>Rank-and-File vs. Sweeney:</i></B>
<P>
<B>AFL-CIO &quot;Officially&quot; Against MSAs Despite Popularity
Among Membership</B>
<P>
An official publication of the AFL-CIO, the <I>Trade Union Courier</I>,
is publicly on the record in support of Medical Savings Accounts
(MSAs), but the union's president, John Sweeney, has made it official
that the AFL-CIO will help Senator Ted Kennedy, and oppose MSAs
in health care reform legislation currently moving through Congress.
<P>
At the same time that America's &quot;Leading Labor Newspaper&quot;
is advocating that &quot;Congress should pass MSAs right now&quot;
(and as 50,000 United Mine Workers in West Virginia enjoy the
benefits of their negotiated MSAs), AFL-CIO chief Sweeney and
other union leaders who apparently don't heed the call of rank-and-file
members have stated the union's staunch opposition to MSAs.
<P>
The article entitled &quot;Who's Making Your Healthcare Choices?
MSAs let you do what is best for you,&quot; reveals that perhaps
labor leaders are not representing what's in the best interest
of the rank-and-file.  The article states:
<P>
<I>You've heard the MSA arguments; its rich versus poor, healthy
versus the sick, Democrats versus Republicans.  But who is speaking
for you?</I>
<P>
<I>Maybe no one; or worse maybe they are putting words in your
mouth.  You are not alone in thinking this is a good idea.  A
lot of rank and file members feel as you do.</I>
<P>
<I>. . . Let them (members of Congress) know that it should be
up to you to pick your own doctor, not some politician or HMO.</I>
<P>
<I>Let them know that you are wise enough to make the decisions
that are best for you.</I>
<P>
During the past several months, those favoring government control
of the health care system (like Ted Kennedy, and his friends on
the left like John Sweeney) have been fighting against the inclusion
of MSAs in health care reform.
<P>
The total disregard that Sweeney has displayed for his member's
views was recently uncovered in a poll conducted by Luntz Research
for Americans for a Balanced Budget.  The poll concluded that,
overwhelmingly, union members want a balanced budget, and tax
cuts (among other initiatives pursued by the Republican-led Congress)
which Sweeney is fighting <U>against</U> in Washington, and through
a multi-million dollar attack ad campaign funded by his members'
dues.  The rift over MSAs is just another example of Sweeney taking
liberties with his newfound power as chief of the AFL-CIO - putting
the name of the union behind efforts to kill legislation that
is contrary to the wishes and views of his membership, and aggressively
bankrolling media and political campaigns to reinforce Sweeney's
leftward views and desire to return the Congress back to Democrat
control.
<P>
The <I>Trade Union Courier</I> is published out of New York City.
Its circulation is the 1.4 million members of the AFL-CIO.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback: NLRB Decision Allows Disruption of
Construction Markets</B></i>
<P>
Late last week, the Clinton National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
issued its most blatantly pro-union decision yet.  The NLRB ruled
that construction unions can demand, strike over, and enforce
so-called &quot;anti-dual shop&quot; clauses.  This decision could
force contractors to shut down nonunion subsidiaries, or impose
union membership on nonunion workers without a secret ballot vote.
<P>
The case arose over a decade ago when the Painters union sought
to block open shop (nonunion) encroachment into what it considered
union markets.  The same union that for years fought paint rollers,
spray painters and other labor-saving devices for its workers,
has tried to prevent union contractors from setting up &quot;dual
shop&quot; organizations.
<P>
Dual shops allow construction firms to operate both union and
open shop companies in order to compete in distinct markets for
construction services.  For example, government work, because
of the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage law, has become a special market
niche for union firms.  Residential and most commercial construction
work across the country today is built nonunion.  In order to
compete for government and private work, a parent firm must operate
separate and distinct subsidiaries.
<P>
The NLRB ruled that &quot;anti-dual shop&quot; contract terms
will be considered legal <U>despite</U> the prohibitions in the
statute against imposing contract terms on neutral employers.
 The immediate result of the decision will be the immediate demand
by construction unions that contractors shut down open shop subsidiaries.
 While business spends the next several years fighting such crippling
demands, the courts must sort out the NLRB's shaky reasoning.
 The outcome of the Clinton NLRB's gift to unions will be higher
construction costs, major business disruptions and lost opportunities
for workers.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>No Comment from Clinton on </B></i>
<P>
<B>&quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot; Proposals</B>
<P>
At the White House Conference on Corporate Responsibility on May
16, President Clinton stressed good &quot;corporate citizenship&quot;
but was mute on his support for proposals advocated by Labor Secretary
Reich and leading Democrats that give special tax breaks and regulatory
favors to businesses that institute government-preferred employee
programs.
<P>
Honoring businesses (mostly large) that provide an array of benefits
for their employees, the President also announced the creation
of the &quot;Ron Brown Corporate Citizenship Award.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot; proposals have been pushed
by the labor unions, Reich and key supporters in the Congress,
but the business community has been less enthusiastic about having
to adopt cookie-cutter employee benefits programs in order to
receive special tax breaks.  With the higher fixed labor costs
associated with such programs (as in the non job-producing economics
of Europe), such rigid programs will make it more difficult for
employers to hire new employees.  Interestingly, small businesses
(the job creating engines of the U.S. economy) were not featured
at the White House event.  According to Clinton, all of the very
financially healthy corporations featured at the event &quot;proves
you can do the right thing and make money&quot;  - but for many
small businesses, the Clinton tax increase and proposed minimum
wage hike won't even give small start-ups a chance.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Greed Crosses Union Lines</B></i>
<P>
Some members of the AFL-CIO's Building and Construction Trades
Department (BCTD) feel that the Laborer's International Union
of North American (LIUNA) is overreaching its jurisdictional boundaries
in its zeal to add new members to its declining rolls.
<P>
In a recent meeting of the fifteen BCTD union bosses, the Bricklayers'
chief John Joyce called for a censure on Arthur Coia's LIUNA &quot;for
its predatory objectives and behavior.&quot;  In LIUNA's &quot;expansionist
program,&quot; organizing methods allegedly have included cash
bribes and job offers to lure over representatives of other unions,
as well as negotiating to include the definition of other crafts
in their own collective bargaining agreements.  Joyce claims the
Plasterer's Union has had problems with LIUNA's encroachment on
their territory, and feels his bricklayers will be next.
<P>
Although members of the construction unions have for years bickered
and battled over jurisdictional issues, Joyce stated that the
censure was proposed because LIUNA &quot;has exhausted everyone's
patience.&quot;  But Joyce may have another motive in taking such
a hard line against LIUNA.  Coia supported the opponent of Joyce
ally, Robert Georgine, in the last BCTD presidential election.
<P>
Instead of censure, the BCTD gave LIUNA 30 days to resolve its
problems and make peace with the other unions to demonstrate solidarity.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>But Another Controversial Payback Struck Down Again by the
Courts</B></i>
<P>
Last week, the full court of appeals in Washington, D.C. refused
to cooperate in President Clinton's effort to tilt the balance
of power in labor's favor.  By a 9 to 2 vote the court rejected
the Administration's request for a rehearing of the decision to
invalidate the Clinton Striker Replacement Executive Order. 
<P>
That order would have prohibited federal contractors from hiring
permanent replacements during strikes and other labor disputes.
 If it had stood, a large group of employers would have been defenseless
against exorbitant demands by unions.  In February, however, a
panel of the D.C. Court of Appeals struck down the Executive Order
because it conflicted with clear, longstanding labor law principles.
<P>
The full court decision issued last week left no doubt that the
rule of law is superior to the President's wishes to pander to
unions. Terming the Administration's arguments &quot;far-fetched&quot;
and &quot;silly,&quot; the court refused to reconsider the earlier
decision of the three-judge panel.  The case in now likely to
go to the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i> <B>Starting Wage Fact</B></i>
<P>
Within one year, more than 60% of workers earning the minimum
wage will receive a raise of at least 20%.  This is as much as
the Clinton Administration's proposal but without the job loss.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Unions Follow Corporate America's Lead</B></i>
<P>
Consolidation.  Efficiency.  Layoffs.  These facts of corporate
life have come to the union movement.  The Laborers Union has
ordered the consolidation of 10 of its locals in New York City.
 Emulating the best in the corporate public relations field, the
union spokesman announced:  &quot;We realize that this will cost
some local union officers their jobs, but...members were paying
too much for the services they were receiving.&quot;
<P>
The union's restructuring was a matter of survival, but not from
the forces of competition like businesses face.  The District
Council of the union has been operating under a Trusteeship since
settlement of a Labor and Justice Department lawsuit in 1994 alleging
corruption.  The New York reorganization was required because
an investigation found that the structure was &quot;organizationally
and financially inefficient.&quot;  More damning, the union setup
provided &quot;unacceptable opportunities for organized crime
to corrupt the internal operation of the locals.&quot;
<P>
<a name="two"></a><i><B>Union Sued By Workers - Broke &quot;Job Security Vow&quot;</B></i>
<P>
According to an article from the Institute for Global Communications
(a labor internet news group), forty laid-off workers from the
Bath Iron Works Corp. are suing the Industrial Union of Marine
and Shipbuilding Workers of America.  The workers are suing on
the grounds that the union assured them of continuous employment
through 1997.
<P>
The union's lawyers claim that the workers should be suing the
company, not the union.  But according to one worker, who is now
on  welfare and trying to feed his family of four on $242 per
week, a union rep. was present at each worker interview stating
that &quot;everything would be ok.&quot;
<P>
The workers are seeking damages for lost wages, emotional distress,
and want to be reimbursed for union dues collected during their
employment.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>NLRB Advocacy Put on Hold...For Now</B></i>
<P>
The Congress passed, and the President has signed, a significant
provision curbing an abuse of power by the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB).  As part of the 1996 spending bill enacted recently,
the Labor Board cannot spend any money to finalize its infamous
&quot;single location bargaining unit&quot; rule.
<P>
That rule has been roundly criticized by small business owners
as a blank check for union organizers to more easily organize
retail shops, restaurants and other businesses across the country.
<P>
According to a recent article by Bloomberg Business News, it is
estimated that a unionization effort at a small business would
cost the business as much as $100,000 to hire a lawyer and labor
negotiator.
<P>
The recently enacted ban remains in effect through this fiscal
year, September 30, and NLRB officials have said no final action
would be taken until Fall.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>New Jersey and You - Downsizing Together</B></i>
<P>
A New Jersey union is launching a grassroots campaign to support
proposed legislation that would financially punish businesses
that downsize.  &quot;The Job Destruction Penalty Act&quot; was
introduced in the New Jersey Assembly on May 2.   It would require
companies of 100 or more employees to give 2 months of severance
pay (for each year of service) to permanently laid-off workers.
 In addition, a fine of $4,000 per employee, per lay-off would
be levied against the company, and (in theory) would be given
 back to the community to help off-set the job and tax revenue
loss.  The New Jersey Industrial Union Council is leading the
grass- roots mobilization efforts.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Clinton Asks Americans to Celebrate Labor's Rich Heritage</B></i>
<P>
On May 3, President Clinton proclaimed May 1996 &quot;Labor History
Month.&quot;  The President calls on all Americans to &quot;observe
this month with ceremonies, activities, and programs that encourage
reflection on the labor movement's heritage and its many contributions
to the creation and maintenance of a just America.&quot;
<P>
In his proclamation he extolled the virtues of unions and declared
that &quot;Each new generation of workers must embrace the activism
that has characterized labor's rich history...&quot;
<P>
Indeed, Americans will find a rich history, but unfortunately
the highlights of the labor movement are equally matched with
&quot;lowlights,&quot; including corruption, extortion and scandal.
 Of course, none of this is mentioned in the President's official
proclamation.
<P>
Could you imagine if &quot;each new generation&quot; embraced
AFL-CIO V.P.  Richard Trumka's  techniques?  <I>Labor Watch </I>readers
remember Trumka's kind remarks to those who don't see things his
way: &quot;...we'll knock you flat on your --.&quot;  
<P>
Traffice terrorism, hostile and unethical corporate campaigns,
violent strikes, bomb threats, and labor leader corruption are
other items looked over by the Clinton proclamation.
<P><a name="six"></a>
<i><B>White House to Sponsor Conference on</B></i>
<P>
<B>&quot;Corporate Responsibility&quot;</B>
<P>
On May 16, the White House will bring in its choice of the country's
&quot;best companies&quot; and sponsor a conference on good corporate
citizenship.  The CEOs that received the White House seal of approval
will breakfast with the President and participate in panel discussions
at Georgetown University.  Topics to be discussed will probably
include:  Family-Friendly Workplaces, Economic Security, Investment
in Employees, Partnership with Employees, and Safe &amp; Secure
Workplaces.
<P>
According to a copy of &quot;The President's Corporate Citizenship
Challenges&quot; distributed on March 23, ways that companies
can best help employees (in the above-mentioned areas) is by getting
them involved in the workplace, and by giving them a voice.  
<P>
Union organizing, as a way to help employees, is not mentioned.
 In fact, Clinton's &quot;Challenges&quot; sound very much like
the TEAM Act, legislation passed by the House and being pursued
by Sen Dole along with the minimum wage hike.  The unions strongly
oppose the TEAM Act.

</blockquote>
<P>
These were just two of the quotes that Luntz Research received
in a recent survey of union members to gauge rank-and-file sentiment
regarding big labor's heavy investment in congressional races.
 The unions are targeting Republican members in order to help
return the Congress to Democratic hands.  Over 1,000 union members
were surveyed for Americans for a Balanced Budget from April 23
- 28.
<P>
Key findings include:
<P>
<ul>
<li>By an overwhelming 84% to 9% margin, union members want to force
their leaders to explain what happens to their dues, where the
money is spent and why.
<P>
<li>Campaigns and politics <U>are</U> <U>not</U> the priorities of
the rank-and-file - only 4% said engaging in political election
activities were important.  Preserving jobs came out on top at
58%; increasing wages and benefits was second at 27%; and improving
the image of unions was third at 8%.
<P>
<li>Who is John Sweeney?  The rank-and-file membership would like
to know too.  Only 18% knew of him well enough to offer an opinion
of him.  82% had no opinion or knowledge of him.
<P>
<li>Rank-and-file members are not aware that they have a right to
get a refund for dues spent on political activities, despite union
leaders comments to the contrary.  Only 19% knew of this right.
 More strikingly, one-fourth of those belonging to a union for
two or more decades know about their right to a refund. Needless
to say, the union leadership has not publicized the issue with
its rank-and-file.
<P>
<li>Union members reaction was hostile to the fact that $35 million
dollars of their dues is being used to defeat Congressional Republicans.
 Overall, 41% are &quot;strongly opposed&quot; to the effort while
21% &quot;somewhat oppose&quot; it.  Of those supporting the campaign,
15% &quot;strongly support&quot; it, while 16% &quot;somewhat
support&quot; the effort.
</ul>
<P>
On specific issues, the rank-and-file membership appear to be
more in line with Republican-led initiatives. In fact, the union
leadership has pumped millions of dollars into lobbying and media
campaigns that run counter to the wishes of their membership.
<p>
For example:
<P>
<ul>
<li>By an 82% to 11% margin, union members support the Balanced Budget
Amendment.
<P>
<li>Welfare reform  that requires recipients to work is supported
by union members by 87% to 7%.
<P>
<li>The $500 tax credit pushed by the GOP is supported by 78% of those
surveyed.
</ul>
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Union Boss Lashes Out at Government Bureaucrats</B></i>
<P>
Sounding like an outraged small business owner, Bricklayers Union
boss John T. Joyce recently complained, &quot;If the [Labor Department]
is going to keep coming up with new technicalities and making
decisions on the flip of a coin, it is futile to try to do it
the right way.&quot;  The reason for Joyce's outburst: A DOL lawsuit
challenging his reelection for a fourth five-year term as international
union president.
<P>
The lawsuit, seeking to rerun the election, alleges widespread
use of union funds for payment of campaign personnel, improper
electioneering, and use of union equipment and resources by the
Joyce campaign.  Joyce defeated challenger Gerald Carlisle by
1,995 votes out of 88,235 votes cast.
<P>
&quot;This is precisely the senseless misuse of bureaucratic power
that erodes public confidence in the federal regulatory process,&quot;
Joyce laments.  &quot;In the case at hand, DOL understands neither
the law they administer nor the organizations they regulate.&quot;
<p>
At last - we agree on something.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Kennedy and Labor Bosses Fighting Against Tax Free MSAs</B></i>
<P>
Labor leaders have joined the chorus of those condemning medical
savings accounts (MSAs).  In the weekly edition of <I>Work in
Progress</I>, an AFL-CIO publication, MSAs are described as &quot;controversial&quot;
calling them tax breaks for the healthy and wealthy.  
<P>
As confirmed by the Luntz survey, labor leaders seem to be out
of touch with their rank-and-file membership.  This certainly
proves to be the case with  MSAs.  Case in point: the United Mine
Workers of West Virginia bargained to get a MSA prototype in their
contracts.  According to the <I>Courier-Journal</I> of Louisville,
Kentucky, &quot;Each contract year, the company gives members
$1,000 for out-of-pocket health care costs; $1,000 is the deductible.
 Members not using the money for health care can keep it.&quot;
 Sounds like a MSA to <I>Labor Watch</I> staff.
<P>
Labor's &quot;hero&quot; Ted Kennedy is of course fighting against
MSAs - he prefers that the mine workers be taxed unfairly for
their health care benefits rather than giving them tax parity
with big corporations.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Sweeney Youth Unleashed</B></i>
<P>
<i><B> &quot;Union Summer&quot; Campaign Begins June 1</B></i>
<P>
Political activism, union organizing and garden variety militancy
are the activities of AFL-CIO boss John Sweeney's summer internship
program.  Enlisting up to 1,000 young people from across the country,
Sweeney vows to put them to work &quot;planning, phone calling,
door knocking, organizing, and demonstrating.&quot;
<P>
At a press conference and barbecue on May 1, the union chief identified
the corporate campaign against the Detroit Newspapers as well
as Service Workers Union organizing drives as two of the projects
to which the interns will be assigned.  Sweeney also acknowledged
that the political activists will be put to work on grassroots
minimum wage fights at the state and local level, and agitating
against the California Civil Rights Institute.
<P>
Sweeney Youth will be deployed to cities across the United States
for three-week stints. The activists will receive training, free
housing, and a stipend of $210 per week.
<P>
(For a list of cities the interns will be sent to, contact SBS
Foundation at 202-785-0238.)

<i><B>AFL-CIO Grades It's Congressional Targets</B></i>
<P>
The  latest propoganda from an AFL-CIO mail campaign was given
to <I>Labor Watch</I> staff.  The mailing, a &quot;report card,&quot;
targeted 33 House members who received mostly &quot;Fs&quot; from
the union -  31 of the targets were Republicans, and 2 were Democrats.
 At first glance, the direct mail campaign appeared &quot;bi-partisan&quot;
- until it was discovered by <I>Labor Watch</I> staff that the
2 Democrats are leaving Congress.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<I><B>Another Payback</B></I><B>: Clinton's Latest Agent for Unions</B>
<P>
Add the Security &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) to the list of
federal agencies dedicated to boosting the union agenda.  This
winter, the SEC ordered the Dupont Company to include in its proxy
statement, a proposal by its union to dedicate a seat on the board
of directors for a union member.
<P>
The company had opposed the election of a director that &quot;represents
a particular point of view or particular constituency other than
shareholders as a whole,&quot; reports the <U>Daily Labor Report</U>.
 The SEC ignored the management view and ordered inclusion of
the proposal that was drafted by the Independent Brotherhood of
Dupont Workers.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Employers Are Fighting Back:</B></i>
<P>
<B>Field Hearings Focus on &quot;Salting&quot; as a Corporate
Campaign Technique</B>
<P>
Some of unions' most abusive campaign tactics came under fire
April 12 as contractors and their employees took their cases to
a congressional field hearing in Kansas City.  At issue was the
union scheme of &quot;salting&quot; - work sites with union organizers
who file discrimination charges with the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB), disrupt work, and run-up employer costs.  Union
manipulation of the law and NLRB complicity were the primary themes.
<P>
Gregory E. Hoberock's testimony was typical:  &quot;Forcing employers
to hire persons whose intent is to bankrupt the employer does
not make sense.&quot;  His family-owned business in Union, Missouri,
suffered dozens of frivolous charges filed with the NLRB at a
cost of $15,000 to $25,000 in legal fees.
<P>
The hearing was called by Rep. Harris Fawell (R-IL), Chair of
the House Opportunities Committee Employer-Employee Relations
Subcommittee, and Small Business Committee Chair Jan Meyers (R-KS).
 Rep. Fawell has introduced, H.R. 3211, the &quot;Truth in Employment
Act,&quot; addressing the problem of salting.  As he stated at
the hearing, H.R. 3211 &quot;merely seeks to alleviate the legal
pressure imposed upon employers to hire individuals whose overriding
purpose for seeking the job is not to become a bona fide employee,
but to organize the employer's workplace and/or otherwise inflict
economic harm on the employer.&quot;
<P>
The criticism of salting was not limited to business owners. 
Electrician Richard Oberlechner complained, &quot;We are tired
of the harassment tactics [by unions], both on a company basis
and against us individually.&quot; Echoing the concerns of many,
he stressed, &quot;We do not want our future jeopardized for the
monetary gains of others.&quot;
<P>
The message to Congress was compelling.  &quot;Right now it is
David facing not one, but two Goliaths...the unions with their
large coffers and the NLRB,&quot; said David Meyer of Meyer Brothers
Building Co., a Blue Springs, Missouri general contractor employing
50 workers.  He concluded, &quot;Small businesses are the backbone
of our country.  Please do not stand by and watch the small businesses
and our FREE ENTERPRISE system be destroyed by the unions and
a tax-supported branch of our government.&quot;
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>As John Sweeney Sees It </B>- </i>
<P>
<B>Labor <I>Can't</I> Do It On It's Own</B>
<P>
&quot;We're in the battle of our life,&quot; declares AFL-CIO
President John J. Sweeney.  &quot;If we don't change this Congress,
believe me, we've only seen a taste of what their agenda will
be.&quot;
<P>
With this rallying cry, Sweeney told a conference of the New York
State Labor-Religion Coalition that the key to labor's strategy
for the future is building coalitions with religious, environmental
and other groups.  Also key, according to Sweeney, is electing
a Democratic Congress.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Minimum Wage Madness</B></i>
<P>
Maybe Republican members of Congress supporting a $1.00 increase
in the minimum wage need to contact the Democratic Leadership
Council (DLC) to get a primer on why the wage hike is bad for
business and bad for workers.  
<P>
According to the DLC, the &quot;moderate&quot; Democratic institution
once led by President Clinton, the wage hike is &quot;counterproductive,
raising prices for poor people while helping mainly middle class
families.&quot;  The hike would also &quot;reduce job creation
 for low- skilled people.&quot;
<P>
The DLC continues, &quot;Increasing the minimum wage would produce
a regressive transfer, making most poor people a little worse
off in order to improve the lives, at least for a time, of a group
of people which is predominately non-poor.&quot;
<P><a name="six"></a>
 <i><B>Starting Wage Fact</B>:</i>
<P>
The 90-cent starting wage hike will directly cost business $12.3
billion over the next 5 years according to the CBO.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback Owed</i> - Clinton Coordinated Closely
With </B>
<P>
<b>Unions During Government Shutdown</b><P>
Led by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE),
the unions helped President Clinton develop his confrontational
strategy with Republicans over the budget, and were informed that
the shutdown, as well as a delay in increasing government's borrowing
authority, would not adversely impact government operations and
 social security,  or  other transfer payments.  At the same time,
the Treasury Dept. was telling the public exactly the opposite.
 According to an April 1, <I><B>Washington Times</B></I> story,
the AFGE did not tell members about Treasury's use of retirement
funds.  Instead it sent weekly alerts to its members warning about
the default's &quot;danger.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>The Reich Report: Mixed Messages</B></i>
<P>
Is the U.S. economy creating high-wage or dead-end jobs?  The
answer depends on what soil Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich is
standing.
<P>
In France earlier this month, Reich defended the 8.4 million jobs
that have been created while the Clinton Administration has been
in office.  Apparently, Europeans are under the impression that
these are low-skilled and low-wage jobs.  He and the Administration
boasted that &quot;the fastest growing job categories in the U.S.
are the highest paying ones...60 percent of those new jobs are
high-wage positions in areas such as finance, telecommunications,
and other high-tech areas.&quot;
<P>
At home, Reich follows the union cue and bemoans the &quot;anxious
class&quot; fearful of dead-end jobs.  The Labor Secretary's friends
at the AFL-CIO dictate a similar message.  A union resolution
declares:  &quot;Loaded with debt... threatened with downsizing
and outsourcing, and a growing pool of low-wage, no-benefit contingent
labor, American workers are frustrated, anxious and angry.&quot;
 
<P>
Except for some unwarranted credit taking, Reich was on the ball
while in France.  The next time he speaks on the issue in the
U.S., employers hope he speaks as glowingly about American jobs
as he does overseas.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>The Corporate Campaign: USA Today, Now More Than Ever</B></i>
<P>
It's official, reading<I><B> USA Today</B></I> is now politically
incorrect.  Top union boss John Sweeney has ordered unionists
not to buy or advertise in the national newspaper because its
owner, Gannett Publishing, has refused to yield to union demands
in Detroit.  A similar &quot;Do Not Buy&quot; order went out against
<I><B>The Miami Herald</B></I>, the flagship paper of Knight-Ridder.
<P>
The much publicized union strike against the<I><B> Detroit Free
Press</B></I> and <I><B>Detroit News</B></I> is going into its
ninth month.  Undaunted by formal complaints by the government
and by legal action arising out of the strikers' campaign of violence,
the union hopes to broaden public awareness of their dispute.
 As AFL-CIO leader Richard Trumka vowed last month, &quot;We will
be moving on a rather nationwide basis to expose what Gannett
is doing to workers in Detroit.&quot;
<P>
The unions have recently gone into competition with the Detroit
papers by publishing their own &quot;Sunday Journal&quot; for
which they are soliciting advertisers.  No doubt the real Detroit
newspapers are not worried about the new weekly.  With union work
rules, featherbedding, and grievance procedures, it is highly
unlikely that the strikers' &quot;Sunday Journal&quot; will turn
a profit in this lifetime.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Labor Chat - Spiked AFL-CIO Survey From '94 Resurfaces on the
Internet</B></i>
<P>
According to a 1994 posting on Labor Talk, an on-line newsgroup
through the Institute for Global Communications, a '94 survey
commissioned by the AFL-CIO was too embarrassing to share with
the public - or its own members for that matter.
<P>
The survey, &quot;Being Heard,&quot; included these findings:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Of the 4 out of 5 Americans living in non-union households,
only 29% have positive feelings about unions, 39% negative, and
32% neutral.
<P>
<li> Only 25% feel that unions are concerned about all working
people - 65% say that unions are concerned only about their members.
</ul>
<P>
The authors of the report, a pro-labor consulting firm, also concluded
that the unions were perceived as &quot;undemocratic institutions,&quot;
increasingly irrelevant, and &quot;outdated, old-fashioned, hidebound
guardians of the status quo.&quot;  According to the Labor Talk
article, the report was published on March 21, 1994.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Union Money Making &quot;Fad&quot;</B></i>
<P>
Like a sponge to water, organized labor has taken to soaking money
from the U.S. Treasury.  According to the Federal Assistance Awards
Data System (FAADS), unions receive over $39 million per year
in grants through not-for-profit organizations, and the U.S. Department
of Labor.  The following unions and their affiliates were some
of the recipients during 1993-1994:
<P><pre>
AFL-CIO    				$2,038,000
<P>
AFSME       				$148,000
<P>
American Fed of Teachers     		$143,000
<P>
American Nurses Assoc.        		$965,000
<P>

<P>
National Education Assoc.       	$385,000
<P>
Teamsters       			$3,542,000
<P>
Service Employees Int'l Union		$137,000

<blockquote>
<i><B>Pressure from the Pressmen</B></i>
<P>
The Clinton National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has shown its
prounion colors, judging from a recent Court of Appeals decision.
 It appears that the union-packed NLRB has forgotten the violence
that marked the 1985 strike against the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>
stirred by the hiring of replacement workers.  The strike ended
in 1986, and by May, 1989 the process of reinstating striking
workers was well on the way.  The Pressman's union has since been
seeking the names and the addresses of replacement workers who
are still employed at the <I>Tribune.</I>
<P>
The NLRB ordered the <I>Tribune</I> to furnish the names and addresses
of replacement employees to the union on the basis that the &quot;passage
of five years since the violence tilted the balance in favor of
disclosure.&quot;   A ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit has however, refused to enforce the NLRB order.
 Violence against replacement workers during the strike included
tire slashing, death threats, as well as the stabbing of a delivery
driver. 
<P>
The <I>Tribune</I> offered to conduct a third party mailing to
the replacement workers, would permit communications during nonwork
times, the posting of union notices on company bulletin boards
and allow distribution of union notices in nonwork areas.  Replacement
employees could also choose to provide the union with their own
address.  This was not good enough though for the union or its
supporters on the Labor Board. The federal court disagreed with
both the NLRB and the union to ensure employee protections.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Whose Rights Are They Anyway? </B></i>
<P>
Employees have the right to object to union political activities,
but it is illegal for employers to tell them so.  That is the
argument behind a complaint filed by the General Counsel of the
Labor Board against nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises.
<P>
The company has been cited for breaking labor laws by notifying
employees of their rights under the Supreme Court's <U>Beck</U>
decision.  That case recognized the right to object to paying
the portion of compulsory union dues which is spent on political
causes opposed by the employee.
<P>
The Clinton NLRB recently ruled that unions are not required by
law to give their members effective notice of their <U>Beck</U>
rights.  If the Labor Board is successful in its case against
Beverly, employers will be prohibited from letting their employees
in on this secret.  That leaves to Clinton appointees the task
of spreading the word about rights the unions oppose.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>No Minority Rights</B></i>
<P>
Like all democratic institutions, union bosses are supposed to
represent the views of their constituents - the dues paying members.
 So if a large share of union members vote Republican, the elected
union officials pay heed, right?
<P>
You be the judge.  A recent Communications Workers of America
(CWA) union poll showed that its members favored President Clinton
over Bob Dole by 53% to 27%.  The union's executive council unanimously
endorsed the Clinton-Gore ticket.  CWA President Mort Bahr says
&quot;our jobs is to make sure the 53% [favoring Clinton] stays.&quot;
 Bahr is also reported to have charged his members to work for
the election of  Democrats to the U.S. House in an effort to recapture
the chamber.

<i><B>Attention Blue Light Shoppers -</B></i>
<br>
<B>Campaign Targets K-mart</B>
<P>
One of America's retail giants is experiencing a text book corporate
campaign.  The target: Kmart.  Unions are working every angle
to convert productive employees of the company into dues paying
members so they can attack every level of the company's operations.
<P>
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Union of Needletrades
Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE) are seeking employee
representation on the company's board of directors.  They are
also pressing for annual board elections for all directors and
the elimination of retirement plans for nonemployee directors.
 The unions believe that their representation on the board will
also improve Kmart's stock value. 
<P>
The Teamsters represent a small percentage of Kmart employees
and own 500,000 shares of the company's stock.  UNITE is currently
seeking to organize over 500 Kmart employees in Greensboro, NC.
 Last fall, the union made allegations of discriminatory employment
practices and instituted a consumer boycott - standard tactics
in corporate campaigns.
<P>
The unions are backing Stephen Hester for Kmart's board.  Hester's
speciality is  employee stock ownership programs, and he is credited
with helping unionized employees of Northwest Airlines gain stock
ownership and representation on its board of directors.
<P>
The Teamsters and UNITE blame the lack of  an  independent voice
on the board of directors for the decline in Kmart's stock value.
 They see Kmart competitor, Wal-Mart, gaining  a significant share
of the market.  No doubt when the unions decide to take on non-union
Wal-Mart, they will  conclude that Wal-Mart's competitive edge
could vastly improve with union representation.

<B>Sweeney Youth to be Trained for &quot;Union Summer&quot;</B>
<P>
AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney wants to train members of the
MTV generation to be union activists.  Desperate for new dues-paying
members, he has devised a plan to recruit the children of existing
members - and other young people - into service this summer. 
Participants will promote the joys of union membership under the
guise of social justice.
<P>
The three-month boot camp, called &quot;Union Summer,&quot; will
immerse young recruits in union rhetoric, teach the the principles
of union activism and put them to work on organizing campaigns
and union projects around the country.
<P>
In a recruitment flyer for &quot;Union Summer,&quot; the AFL-CIO
asks prospects to &quot;join hundreds of workers and students
making history.  Spend three weeks in the streets and neighborhoods,
organizing for workplace rights and social justice.  Make this
a summer America will never forget!&quot;
<P>
&quot;Union Summer&quot; applications are currently being accepted.
 Applicants are asked to &quot;describe a defining moment or life
experience that relates to your desire to fight injustice.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<B>New Clinton Payback Revealed</B>
<P>
In a recent address before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House
Republican Conference Chairman, John Boehner (R-OH) revealed President
Clinton's latest payback to organized labor.  According to Boehner,
just two weeks before receiving big labor's endorsement, Bill
Clinton &quot;instructed the government's personnel office to
proved labor unions with the home addresses of all federal employees
in bargaining units - whether or not they are union members.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Labor Watch</B></I> pondered the potential uses of this
data:  re-elect Clinton campaign, political literature, mailings
of related union propaganda, and personal visits to the homes
of nonmembers.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<B>Cookie Monsters: Tales from the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
The St. Louis Girl Scouts are the latest target of a union corporate
campaign.  Members of an electrical workers union local have threatened
a boycott, and are picketing two Girl Scout camps in Eastern Missouri
after a nonunion electrical contractor was awarded the work for
major renovations and construction at the camps.
<P>
Building and Construction Trades Council officials have warned
the area executive director of the detrimental impact upon her
organization over its failure to use union contractors.  She agreed
to try to change the decision.  The pickets remain camped out
while awaiting the final outcome, and plans to put the Girl Scouts
on the unions' &quot;We Do Not Patronize&quot; list were put on
hold.
<P>
The question remains as to whether union officials will issue
the ultimate boycott - a refusal to buy Girl Scout cookies.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<B>Union Backing</B>
<P>
A kindler, gentler union movement?  You decide.  Richard Trumka,
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer, recently whipped the Pennsylvania
union conventioneers into a frenzy with this rallying cry:  &quot;Our
message is that unions are back.  Get in our way and we'll knock
you flat on your (expletive).&quot;
<P><a name="five"></a>
<B>&quot;Government Stewardship&quot; of Unions  Lousy Says Union
Members</B>
<P>
Even Teamsters complain that government can't run anything right.
 In response to petitions from 12,000 rank-and-file members of
the union, two Members of Congress are seeking a review of the
effectiveness of the Independent Review Board (IRB), which oversees
the operation of the nation's largest labor organization.
<P>
In a consent decree with the Justice Department, the IRB was formed
in 1989 to root out organized crime within the Teamsters and monitor
its financial affairs.  Reps. Michael Flanagan (R-IL) and William
Lipinski (D-IL) report that union members &quot;contend the union's
financial condition has worsened in its years under government
stewardship&quot; and have called for an investigation.
<P><a name="six"></a>
<B>Rights on the Left</B>
<P>
Some Rights are more right than others, in the union mindset.
 Beating the union drum at the March 25 AFL-CIO convention in
Washington, Vice President Gore blasted Republicans and demonstrated
the Administration's affinity with Big Labor as he declared: &quot;To
them, the right to strike is a luxury...but to us the right to
strike is a right.&quot;
<P>
The right to work, on the other hand, is considered an unsavory
concept by the AFL-CIO.  National Right to Work is high on their
hit list of proposed legislation in these days of frantic efforts
to shore up dwindling union rolls.  If workers could no longer
be forced to join unions in order to keep their jobs, the decline
in union membership might just go into freefall.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - &quot;Prevailing Waste&quot;</B></i>

<P>
&quot;We were caught abetting fraud and incompetence, so give
us more money.&quot; That is the unmistakable message from the
Labor Department as it tries to explain a request to spend $3.75
million more to administer the Davis-Bacon Act.
<P>
Last year the Department of Labor stonewalled every effort to
expose fraud in the calculation of &quot;prevailing wages&quot;
which federal government contractors must pay under the Davis-Bacon
Act. Until pressure came to bear, the Department refused to provide
access to public documents or even to disclose the names of union
officials who submitted bogus data - data which the DOL says it
relies on to calculate wages. Without the dogged determination
of Oklahoma Commissioner of Labor, Brenda Reneau, who uncovered
the fraud, and the outrage of Reps. Cass Ballenger (R-NC) and
Pete Hoekstra (R-MI), the federal Department would have denied
any problems existed.
<P>
In an investigation by Reneau and her staff, it was found that
&quot;certain parties&quot; submitted bogus projects to the DOL
including inflated wage rates of ghost employees.
<P>
This week the DOL admits in the Clinton Budget that &quot;the
current [wage determination] system's reliance on the 'third party'
data submissions has recently exposed the vulnerability to manipulation
through submission of false or selective data, and raises serious
questions about the accuracy of some of the wage determinations
that are issued.&quot;
<P>
The Labor Department's answer to those questions: Pour about $4
million more into the black hole of Davis-Bacon. In the near future
ABC t.v. program<I> 20/20</I> will air a special report on Davis-Bacon.
Investigative reporter, John Stossel produced the segment.

<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA: </i>
<br>Clinton Appointee Fired for
Aiding a Corporate Campaign - Big Labor-Big Government Incestuous
Relationship Exposed</B> 
<P>
A top Department of Labor (DOL) appointee has been forced from
office because of his efforts to abet a union's corporate campaign.
Richard Sawyer, Labor Secretary Reich's chief representative in
the West, lost his job March 8 for contacting Hewlett-Packard
Co - threatening the company that the DOL would seize its products
- because its janitorial service, (which the Service Employees
union are attempting to organize) was &quot;going to get caught
doing bad things eventually.&quot; Mr. Sawyer is a former Service
Employees International Union (SEIU) local president.
<P>
The target of the corporate campaign was Somers Building Maintenance
in Sacramento, California. Board member for the company, Randy
Schraber, said, &quot;We were the subject of wrongdoing, and we're
pleased to see that it won't happen to another company.&quot;
<P>
Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-MI) had investigated the incident and concluded
that Mr. Sawyer had &quot;disclosed investigative information
which was damaging to Somers,&quot; and &quot;influenced the Department
of Labor's Wage &amp; Hour Division in an attempt to intimidate
Somers into recognizing the union.&quot; After Hoekstra made Sawyer's
action public, the DOL was forced to oust the presidential appointee.
<P>
An Inspector General's (IG) report investigating the California
incident confirms allegations that Sawyer threatened Hewlett-Packard.
The report also showed that no actions had been taken against
Somers in regards to charges that they violated wage and hour
laws. Half of California's wage and hour investigators had been
assigned to the Somer's case. According to Mr. Schraber, the investigators
found that the janitorial company actually <I>overpaid</I> its
workers between $300 - $600.
<P>
SEIU has quickly come to the defense of Sawyer by mobilizing California's
unions in a lobbying effort aimed at President Clinton and Reich
on his behalf. Hoekstra's subcommittee is planning to hold hearings
on the DOL's political motivation behind the Somer's incident
and other cases. The subcommittee will also look into alleged
politicization of OSHA and the National Labor Relations Board.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>AFL-CIO TO MEET IN WASHINGTON - </B></i>
<br>
<B>CLINTON ENDORSEMENT, SWEENEY TAX LIKELY</B> 
<P>
The AFL-CIO is expecting over 500 union delegates to gather at
the Capitol Hilton in Washington, D.C. next week. The union leaders
are expected to endorse President Clinton's reelection bid, and
ratify a special assessment on each union member to help subsidize
AFL-CIO Chief Sweeney's political and organizing agenda. Central
Council leaders will hold meetings on Sunday, March 24, and state
federation delegates will meet through Tuesday, March 26.
<P>
A key agenda item is the 15 cents monthly fee that each union
member will be charged, adding $2 million per month to union coffers.
The funds will go to pay for a $35 million dollar &quot;grassroots
campaign&quot; to heavily promote unions, as well as subsidize
an ongoing series of political ads targeting freshman Republican
members of Congress for elimination in this fall's elections.
The funds will also be used to step up the use of corporate campaigns.
Unions hope that the campaign will rally support for their political
agenda and establish a permanent pool of 100 union grassroots
activists in each Congressional district.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Time Out for Teamsters</B> </i>
<P>
Grand theft is a felony which carries hefty prison terms and loss
of voting rights for life; but for Teamsters bosses, it brings
a one-year suspension. That is the penalty imposed by Teamsters
President Ron Carey against three Minnesota Teamsters officials
who were guilty of embezzling funds from their local.
<P>
In addition to their suspension, the three will be barred from
holding any Teamster office for two years. A fourth official was
permanently barred from membership or holding office, and all
must share in fines totalling $189,000.
<P>
An internal report by a court-appointed Independent Review Board
found numerous questionable practices, including selling union
cars at markedly discounted rates, and charging members fees to
attend their own union meetings.

<i><B>The Reich Report</B></i>
<P>
Labor Secretary Robert Reich touts &quot;corporate responsibility&quot;
on the speaking circuit, but it appears he has been a little more
than irresponsible with taxpayer dollars.  According to a <I>Wall
Street Journal</I> article, the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP)
contends that  Reich sidestepped federal guidelines by rushing
a printing job to an all-night copying service without &quot;prior
approval.&quot;  The JCP has rejected Reich's request to pay Kinko's
of Washington for the unapproved printing job.  Labor officials
finished President Clinton's &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights&quot;
too late they say to have the Government Printing Office (GPO)
do the job - the document was ready for printing late in the evening
on the eve of the State of the Union address last year.  The 18-page
document will reportedly cost taxpayers $31,380 - if Kinko's ever
gets paid - compared to the GPO price of $500.  Rep. Pete Hoekstra,
chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation
is apparently outraged by the waste.  The Labor Department contends
that the incident is turning into &quot;something political.&quot;
 
<P>
Perhaps the &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights&quot; should have
included a section on the responsible use of tax dollars by government
officials who portend to represent the hard-working middle class.

<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA:</i><br>CORPORATE CAMPAIGN TARGET FIGHTS BACK
- VICTORIOUS OVER SEIU MILITANT TACTICS</B>
<P>
A Washington, D.C. jury may have stopped  a local Justice for
Janitors &quot;in-your-face&quot; campaign in its tracks.  The
decision may have an effect on similar cases nationwide according
to the winning attorney.
<P>
On October 21, 1993, Justice for Janitors invaded the headquarters
of United States Service Industries, Inc. (USSI), a janitorial
company that cleans office buildings in the D.C. area.  The nationwide
Janitors' campaign is the brainchild of former Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) leader John Sweeney who now heads the
AFL-CIO.  
<P>
According to a press statement released by USSI, Justice for Janitors
assaulted an officer of the corporation, and kept employees imprisoned
for several hours preventing them from leaving the building. 
<P>
Three USSI employees sued.  The Union settled with one employee,
and the other two went to trial.  A jury found there was an assault
and battery, as well as false imprisonment of both employees.
 One employee was awarded $1,000, and the other $2,000 in compensatory
damages by a jury verdict on March 11, 1996.  In addition, $30,000
in punitive damages were awarded on March 13, 1996, as a result
of clear and convincing evidence that the union demonstrators
were motivated by ill-will and willful disregard for the rights
of others.
<P>
USSI attorney, Joel Keiler, believes that future activities of
this kind could result in much larger punitive awards.  Keiler
also believes that individuals and companies nationwide will use
this verdict in their impending lawsuits, as will many of those
who were trapped by demonstrating SEIU &quot;Janitors&quot; who
blocked traffic on the 14th Street Bridge and the Roosevelt Bridge
in Washington, D.C.  last year.

<i> <B>NLRB's Gould Continues Campaign For Single-Site Rule</B></i>
<P>
Earlier this week in Tampa, Fla., National  Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) Chairman William Gould continued pushing for his proposed
single-site facility rule - a rule designed to help unions more
easily organize small businesses, and single units of multifacility
businesses such as fast-food restaurant chains.
<P>
The single-site rule would be a boon for AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney,
who wants to make good on his promise to more aggressively and
successfully organize the largely non-union service sector.  The
single-site rule applies one-size-fits-all standards to organizing,
applying illegitimate union organizing preferences over legitimate
market and business issues.  Opposition from the Republican Congress
and the business community has been fierce on the issue, but Gould
predicted that the NLRB would prevail.

<b><i>How</i> NOT <i>to Win Friends and Influence People</B></i>
<P>
Hoping to unionize thousands of Kaiser Permanente workers in North
Carolina, organized labor in that state has joined regulators
in denouncing the quality of care provided by the big HMO.  Criticizing
the product a company manufacturers may work in the case of bluejeans,
but a fatal flaw exists in the union's strategy  of attacking
the delivery of health care.  The unions are criticizing  the
very people they hope to organize - the HMO health care workers.
<P>
Of course, a &quot;fair&quot; contract is the cure prescribed
by the labor bosses.  They also hope it will undue any public
relations damage caused by the unions' smear campaign against
Kaiser Permanente workers.

<i><B>Minimum Wage Campaigns Take Off in the States</B></i>
<P>
As part of their multi-faceted election-year strategy to galvanize
union members to the polls, labor unions and allied groups are
aggressively attempting to put minimum wage increase initiatives
on the ballot in the upcoming November elections.  The AFL-CIO
is leading the signature gathering charge in most states with
the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN)
lending a hand.  Signature drives are up and running in Arizona,
California, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, and Oregon - with other
states targeted for activity soon.
<P>
On March 25, the AFL-CIO will hold a special meeting in Washington,
DC to kick-off their &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; road show
(while at the same time increasing their own rank-and-file union
membership dues.)  The 29-city tour will promote the minimum wage
issue.  States that are currently considering starting wage increases
in state legislatures are also targeted for a campaign stop. 
For a complete listing of efforts to increase the starting wage
at the state and local level, contact Ren&eacute;e Stikes at 202-785-0238.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Old Salt</B></i>
<P>
The career of the new chief organizer for the AFL-CIO, Richard
Bensinger, proves that unions are doing nothing new.  They're
just more blatant about it.
<P>
In the 1970's, while working as a paid union organizer, Bensinger
went undercover at a nonunion apparel plant in Colorado.  He was
quickly promoted into management, and was able to feed the union
valuable information on the company's response strategy to an
organizing campaign.
<P>
Today's unions, particularly those in the construction industry,
forego undercover work and opt instead to smother nonunion competition.
 The so-called &quot;salting campaign&quot; orders union members
to (1) apply for work at the target company, (2) make clear their
union affiliation, (3) organize other workers, if hired, (4) file
NLRB charges if not hired, (5) lure away good employees to work
for union contractors, and (6) generally create bedlam and other
problems on the job site - all at the direction of the union.
<P>
Bensinger is now directing the salting scheme nationwide that
he perfected in Colorado 20 years ago.  He serves as Deputy Director
of the AFL-CIO Organizing Institute.
<P>
Bensinger was quoted recently as saying: &quot;We're not crazy
radicals out to destroy a company; we're into cooperating with
a company...&quot;
<P>
The Electrical Workers are a little more honest about the real
purpose of salting campaigns: &quot;to threaten or actually apply
the economic pressure necessary to  cause the employers to...raise
his prices to recoup additional costs, scale back his business
activities, leave the union jurisdiction, go out of business,
and so on.<I> (IBEW Union Organizer Manual) </I>

<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA: Palming Off Jobs </B></i>
<P>
<B> An Update From the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
Anywhere but in labor relations, barely mustering a support rate
of 14% is considered an abysmal failure.  But the Palm Restaurant
of Boston knuckled under to &quot;public pressure&quot; when 27
of 200 local celebrities refused to let their caricatures be hung
on the eatery's walls due to union complaints.
<P>
<I>Labor Watch</I> readers may recall this latest corporate campaign
which discovered this  particular victim's unique charm and sought
to destroy it.  The restaurant's well-known &quot;wall of fame&quot;
honors local notables as its feature attraction.  Construction
unions waged their anti-caricature campaign because they were
offended that the restaurant selected an open shop contractor
who bid 38% below the union competition.
<P>
Of the 200 celebrities offered spots on the restaurant walls,
only 27 - or less than 14%  - sided with the union and refused
to participate.  One of those sympathizers, Boston Mayor, Thomas
Merino, negotiated a deal that requires the restaurant to rebid
up to $100,000 of work using union workers.  All future work is
slated to go to union firms.  Even as the country approaches the
21st century, organized labor continues to demonstrate that an
aggressive minority - 15% union membership in the work force,
14% of celebrities - can overcome market and economic logic.

<P>
&quot;If Affirmative Action goes down, Davis-Bacon, the Service
Contract Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act and the minimum wage
bill will all follow,&quot; said AFL-CIO boss John Sweeney to
Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.  Now those fighting labor's
agenda know where to start.

<i><B>The Check is Not in the Mail</B></i>
<P>
What is it about the Post Office that promotes antisocial behavior?
 Postal union presidents are lambasting Postmaster General Marvin
Runyon in the harshest of terms for &quot;stingily, crassly, and
greedily&quot; postponing a cost of living increase for two weeks.
 The amount withheld from employee paychecks?  Four dollars.
<P>
Postal worker unions typically tie up the legal system by filing
petty complaints - amounting to 7% of the National Labor Relation
Board's entire case load. Forget the rain, sleet, and dark of
night ... a national grievance over a delayed increase of $4.00
is now worth halting mail delivery.

Employee complaints to OSHA increase during labor unrest, according
to an extensive Associated Press (AP) analysis.  Over a third
of job site inspections prompted by complaints at unionized facilities
turn up no violations at all, says the AP study.  Complaints filed
by nonunion workers are more likely to lead to real safety problems
the study concludes.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - When Even 99% Is Not Enough</B></i>
<P>
The AFL-CIO is complaining about a recent decision by the Clinton
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) which went 99% of the way
to gutting important employee protections from union abuses. 
Eight years after the Supreme Court ruled that workers <U>cannot
be forced </U>to pay for the political activities of unions, the
Board issued its first interpretation of the so-called <U>Beck</U>
decision.  Except in the clearest form of political bankrolling,
according to the NLRB, unions are free to spread out their costs
among all members.
<P>
What has the unions so upset is the one part of the case that
went against them.  As AFL-CIO attorney Jon Hiatt said: &quot;Perhaps
the most significant - and distressing - aspect of the decision
is the holding that unions have a legal obligation to affirmatively
tell employees that they do not have to become union members.&quot;
 
<P>
<B>The unions are outraged that employees must be informed that
union membership is a choice, not a mandate.</B>
<P>
National Right-to-Work Committee spokesman Tom McCorville had
these comments regarding the real victims of the case:
<P>
&quot;A string of Supreme Court precedents have been ignored.
 Instead, the Clinton-appointed NLRB has genuflected to Big Labor
in an election year - when employees are most in need of protection
against forced dues politicking.  As far as Big Labor's forced-dues
funded political activities goes, it's business as usual.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>The High Price of a Sweeney Presidency</B></i>
<P>
AFL-CIO head John Sweeney promised to spend $35 million on political
activity this year to reportedly &quot;defeat Republicans,&quot;
but he never said where the money was going to come from.  It
now appears that Sweeney's &quot;American Needs a Raise&quot;
campaign will probably come out of the pockets of the rank-and-file
membership.
<P>
The high price of Sweeney's new campaign is in need of a new &quot;spending
stream.&quot; Consequently, a special convention has been called
for in late March to approve a new &quot;assessment&quot; on each
union member to subsidize Sweeney's political action agenda. 
The new &quot;Sweeney Tax&quot; is expected to cost members 15
cents per month (generating $20 million).  Each affiliated union
is expected to kick in a contribution as well.
<P>
Sweeney promised to recruit hundreds of thousands of new members
to invigorate the labor movement.  But it looks like he's going
back to the trough to further milk the rank-and-file membership
in order to subsidize an uninspiring union agenda.  
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S Real Agenda: Creating Some Havoc</B></i>
<P>
<B>Tales from the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
The following is the first installment in a case study on how
unions today try to crush those companies that fail to cave in
to their demands.  The case - the seven month old Detroit newspaper
strike.
<P>
Until now, the strike against the <I>Detroit Free Press</I> and
the <I>Detroit News</I> has utilized anticipated tactics:  replacement
workers have been terrorized, advertisers have been intimidated,
and NLRB charges have flowed.  The unions have proudly declared
that the newspaper companies have lost substantial amounts of
money, fostered bad will in the community, and the loss of newspaper
circulation will take a long time to rebuild.
<P>
The unions are now exploring ways to &quot;create some havoc -
to find leverage...,&quot; says Teamsters boss Ron Carey. Lately,
activists have been distributing propaganda at the headquarters
of <I>Detroit Free Press</I> parent Knight-Ridder, and its own
flagship paper, <I>The Miami Herald</I>.  Actions against <I>Detroit
News</I> owner Gannett are being promised at its <I>USA Today</I>
headquarters in suburban Washington.  As AFL-CIO leader Rich Trumka
vowed, &quot;We will be moving on a rather nationwide basis to
expose what Gannett is doing to workers in Detroit.&quot; 
<P>
What those moves will be is an indication of how far organized
labor will go in the 1990s to preserve featherbedding and other
rampant union abuses.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Achy Breaky Kneecaps</B></i>
<P>
Billy Ray Cryus' dad is living his own version of the country
singer's smash hit, &quot;Achy Breaky Heart.&quot;  Ron Cyrus
has a number of jobs.  The senior Cyrus is the head of the Kentucky
AFL-CIO, a state Representative for Flatwoods, and Chairman of
the Labor &amp; Industry Committee in the state legislature.
<P>
Ron's latest opus is a bill to prohibit employers from hiring
permanent replacements during strikes in the strike-happy state.
 Billy Ray may make his fans swoon, but Dad appears satisfied
with bringing companies to their knees.
<P><a name="five"></a>
 <i><B>Command and Control Corporate Welfare</B></i>
<P>
Senate Democrats unleashed a set of proposals this week to appease
every ally of their party, while providing a boost to themes echoed
by Labor Secretary Robert Reich and - not surprisingly - principles
found within Labor's &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; campaign.
<P>
The plan, called &quot;Building Allies for America's Working Families,&quot;
links business tax cuts and de-regulation to liberal, anti-business
precepts of class warfare, and statist ideals of  &quot;corporate
social responsibility.&quot;  Of course, the program is saturated
with union promotion.
<P>
In order to qualify for a tax cut, a company must limit CEO pay,
participate in a collectively bargained (union) pension plan utilizing
an employee trustee, invest in employee training on an ongoing
basis, and meet other standards that (for the most part) give
unions and the government control of participating businesses.
 The &quot;Building Allies&quot; program not only echoes AFL-CIO
themes, but is an integral part of the union's rebuilding effort.
 That is why &quot;Building Allies,&quot; in the name of economic
policy to help the struggling middle-class, also calls for treble
damages and debarment against businesses that violate labor laws.
<P>
As one commentator remarked, &quot;'Building Allies' is simply
more public relations gloss on the &quot;Unions Need a Boost&quot;
campaign by the new AFL-CIO leadership.

<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - Putting Unions First</B></i>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore paid homage to assembled union leaders
at their annual Bal Harbour, Florida retreat last week.  Mr. Gore
promptly delivered the President's response to union demands.
 The following is a partial score card:
<P><pre>
<i>Union Demand</i>   				<i>Administration Position</i>
<P><hr><p>
Veto OSHA Reform			Veto Promised

</pre>
<hr>
<P>
The AFL-CIO has set March 25th for its vote on whether to endorse
President Clinton for reelection.
<P><a name="two"></a>
 <B>A Dose of Democracy - Send in the U.N.?</B>
<P>
The Laborers International Union has a rich history of corruption.
 The Justice Department thinks it can change that with a healthy
dose of democracy.  The union has agreed to its first rank-and-file
election of officers, scheduled for September.
<P>
The Laborers leadership agreed to reforms in order to rid the
union of its tainted past of corruption and links to organized
crime, and to avoid a government takeover of its operations. 
The old system was so fraught with cronyism and fraud that a federal
overseer must now spend months devising election rules, teach
union members how to exercise rights they did not previously enjoy,
and monitor 500 local meetings where convention delegates are
selected.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S Real Agenda:</B></i>
<P>
<B>Corporate Campaign Exposed</B>
<P>
Apparently organized labor's concerted effort to bring corporate
America to its knees devolves to the downright petty.  Construction
unions in Boston are trying to shame the Palm Restaurant into
paying prix fixe when a la carte makes more sense.
<P>
The unions are not picketing the site of the new restaurant. 
They are not attacking the company's building permits or filing
frivolous lawsuits.  They are not even trying to block financing
for the project by threatening local bankers.  Rather, <I>The
Wall Street Journal</I> reports that the building trades unions
are threatening the decor of the restaurant to force the Palm
to fire a non-union contractor and submit to build on the union's
terms (at a 38% premium).
<P>
Hoping to decimate the collection of celebrity caricatures which
adorn the walls of each Palm location, the unions are begging
local notables to pull their faces from the walls of the Palm.
 Several have acquiesced  - Sens. Ted Kennedy and John Kerry,
<I>Atlantic Monthly </I>editor Jack Beatty, and legal beagle Alan
Dershowitz.  Some, less sympathetic types, might consider this
urban renewal.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Letter Carriers Are Big Winners in Oregon Vote-by-Mail Election</B></i>
<P>
According to a <I>Washington Times</I>  mention entitled &quot;Delivering
the Vote,&quot; the labor unions were quite pleased (in more ways
than one) with Oregon's recent special election.  The newspaper
notes:
<P>
&quot;The National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC), AFL-CIO
carried two headlines in its newsletter concerning Ron Wyden's
recent election to the Senate.  &quot;Letter Carriers Major Factor
in Wyden Oregon Senate Win,&quot; the NALC bulletin said.  &quot;Vote-by-Mail
Balloting Receives Praise.&quot;   
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>AFL-CIO Charged with Crossing the Line in Campaign Activity</B></i>
<P>
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) filed a
complaint last week with the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
charging that &quot;PROJECT '95&quot; - an AFL-CIO special campaign
 - violated the law because its goals were to defeat House Republicans
using union members' dues.  The NRCC charges that the AFL-CIO
was engrossed in &quot;active electioneering&quot; in Federal
campaigns.  House Republicans on the PROJECT '95 target list were
saturated with radio and television advertising, and other outreach
activities in their congressional districts.  According to the
NRCC though, PROJECT '95 was coordinated with the Democratic Party
- the list of targeted House Republicans was distributed at a
key meeting of assembled House Democrats.
<P>
&quot;The AFL-CIO's PROJECT '95...misused the dues paid by the
hard-working men and women who belong to the member unions,&quot;
states a NRCC press release.  The NRCC also charges that AFL-CIO
chief John Sweeny's proclamation that the union will use $35 million
of its treasury to defeat Republicans in 1996 also violates federal
election law.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - Fox in the Henhouse</B></i>
<P>
The name Sarah Fox is soon to become synonymous with the most
cynical form of union power grab.
<P>
Under attack for three years for politicizing the National Labor
Relations Board, the Administration pushed the envelope further
by naming Ted Kennedy's chief labor strategist to a recess appointment.
 Acting in the dead of night with questionable legal authority,
President Clinton installed the legislative specialist in the
role of labor law judge for a &quot;temporary&quot; appointment
for up to two years.
<P>
Control of the Labor Board gives the unions an opportunity to
revitalize their agenda.  Through selective enforcement of the
labor laws, complicity in union harassment campaigns and abolition
of long-standing employer protections, the pro-union NLRB will
seek to shift the balance of power clearly in favor of labor.
 Not to mention the fact that the Board rules on allegations of
unlawful union conduct as well.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Reich Rhetoric</B></i>
<P>
The key solution to &quot;our greatest remaining challenge&quot;
is a strong union movement.  That is the declaration of Labor
Secretary Robert B. Reich in an official publication from his
Department.
<P>
Citing a host of newly discovered evils in the economy, Reich
declares, &quot;Closing the gap between paychecks and profits
is our greatest remaining challenge.&quot;  In addition to the
usual liberal solutions of raising the minimum wage and spending
more on training, Reich offers these telling steps:  <B>Enforcing
the Nation's labor laws</B> (against employers) and <B>Maintaining
a strong labor union movement.</B>
<P>
He states, &quot;Building strength through numbers is perhaps
the most important way workers can boost their bargaining power
in order to earn a family wage.&quot;  <I><B>Translation:  </B></I>Pandering
to union leaders in official Labor Department documents is perhaps
the most important way for Bill Clinton to secure labor's endorsement.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Big Labor's Real Agenda:</B></i>
<P>
<B> Corporate Campaigns . . . Extortion by any other name</B>
<P>
Anywhere else but under the labor laws, actions to disrupt work,
run up costs and intentionally drive the company out of business
would be considered both criminal and tortuous.  But because unions
are considered &quot;special,&quot; the rules of law do not apply
to their so-called corporate campaigns.
<P>
The Electrical Workers describe their goal as follows:  &quot;to
threaten or actually apply the economic pressure necessary to
cause the employer to...raise his prices to recoup additional
costs, scale back his business activities, leave the union's jurisdiction,
go out of business, and so on.&quot;  (<I>IBEW Union Organizing
Manual)</I>
<P>
Again...extortion by any other name. 
<P><a name="four"></a>
<I><B>Two Wrongs Make a Filibuster</B></I>
<P>
Remember the scene in &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;
in which Jimmy Stewart filibusters for hours <U>against </U>corruption
and wrong.  On behalf of the unions, Democrats are filibustering
the Labor Department funding bill in <U>support</U> of wrongdoing.
<P>
That bill in the Senate has a provision that would block enforcement
of President Clinton's Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors
from hiring permanent replacements for strikers.  The Order was
recently ruled <U>illegal </U>by a federal court - but organized
labor's friends keep filibustering.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Unions Decline Further, </B></i>
<P>
<B>Except When Government is There</B>
<P>
Union membership continues to decline, this time by 300,000 workers
in 1994 to below 15% of the work force.  Where do unions remain
strongest? In industries with the closest relationship to government.
<P>
Federal, state and local governments employ about 6.9 million
union members, or about 37.8% of public employment.  In the private
sector, heavily regulated industries such as transportation and
public utilities had the highest level of unionization at 27%.
 Construction followed with 18%, helped in large part by the Davis-Bacon
Act and other laws which inflate public construction costs and
protect unions from competition.
<P>
Labor's former stronghold, manufacturing, continued its rapid
decline, suffering fully one-fourth of the overall loss in union
members for the year.  Not surprisingly, manufacturing in recent
years has moved further away from cohabitation with government
toward free competition.

<h2>
 Clinton probably won't be a TEAM player<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen kerrigan</a>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<hr>
August 1996 -- By far, the most effective and beneficial trend
in recent decades has been the empowerment of workers through
participation in quality circles, safety committees and other
&quot;teams.&quot;  While hundreds of businesses use the team
approach -- which allows managment and employees to confer over
issues of mutual concern and interest -- recent rulings by the
National Labor Relations Board have many employers concerned that
teams violate existing labor laws.
<P>
To correct the bias of the Depression-era law, both Houses of
Congress passed the TEAM, or Teamwork for Employees and Managers
Act -- legislation that creates a safe harbor for workers and
management to confer over issues of shared interest.
<P>
Section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act makes it an
unfair labor practice for an employer to &quot;dominate or interfere
with the formation or administration of any labor organization
or contribute financial or other support to it...&quot;  The purpose
of the law then, was to outlaw sham unions created by a company
to avoid true unionization of the employer's workplace.
<P>
In the ensuing six decades since the law was written, the workplace
has experience tremendous changes, thus making the Depression-era
law outdated and restrictive.  In 1992, the NLRB ruled that many
cooperative teams are illegal in nonunion settings.  Critics claim
that the board ignored the fact that teams are established to
address important business concerns such as quality or production.
 Worker-management cooperative teams that took up topics such
as wages, hours and working conditions, traditionally the domain
of labor unions, were treated under the law in the same manner
as if managment had created a full-blown company union.  Numerous
other decisions have further narrowed the usefulness of teams.
<P>
Organized labor opposes the TEAM Act, claiming it allows for the
formation of company-sponsored unions while hindering union organizing.
 Supports of the act vehemently disagree.  They say it provides
an outlet for employees to express their concerns and offer opinions
when no union is on the scene.  And, with only 11 percent of the
private work force represented by unions, the number of workers
who could participate in the team concept is considerable.
<P>
David Thompson, Workplace Counsel for the Washington-based Business
Leadership Council, says passage of the TEAM Act by the Congress
represents a clear turning point in workplace policy.
<P>
&quot;We are glad to see that the House and Senate both rejected
the charge of union leaders that company efforts to solve problems
through consensus were part of a vicious plot to institute company
unions,&quot; says Thompson.
<P>
According to Thompson, labor leaders will oppose any effort to
modernize the law because it weakens their political influence
and sends them down the road to irrelevancy.
<P>
&quot;Workers and management understand the need for companies
to prosper in order to stay competitive in this highly-competitive
global economy.  That is why workplace cooperatio through the
team approach is so popular,&quot; adds Thompson.
<P>
Sen. Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Bond, Rmo., chairman of the Senate
Small Business Committee, hailed the passage of the TEAM Act by
the Senate as a major victory for small business.
<P>
&quot;This is a common-sense measure that provides those 90 percent
of employees in America who do not belong to labor unions a stronger
voice in their workplace,&quot; he noted.
<P>
The TEAM Act will make its way to the White House, but President
Clinton has promised union leaders that he will veto the bill.
 The business community has responded that the veto would represent
more political pandering to labor leaders in exchange for the
exorbitant sums of money they are putting into key congressional
races to defeat Republicans.
<P>
Thompson of the BLC says it's a sad commentary on the state of
political affairs when the president of the United States would
hold back the growth, productivity and competitiveness of American
business in order to appease special interests.
<P>
Bond agrees and adds that President Clinton's failure to sign
the TEAM Act into law would prove beyond any doubt that he is
no friend of the small-business entrepreneur.

August 1996 -- On or before September 14, 1996, the U.S. Senate
will vote to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) -- a
treaty with lofty goals to rid the world of chemical weapons.
 Meanwhile, thousands of American businesses are still unaware
that they will be forced to help end the production and stockpiling
of these treacherous weapons.  
<P>
For the first time in U.S. history, businesses using chemicals
for legitimate commercial purposes would be subject to international
inspections conducted by an agency falling under the umbrella
of the United Nations.
<P>
Opponents of the CWC are not only concerned that thousands of
small and medium-sized businesses would have to comply with extra-stringent
reporting requirements, but also question whether the treaty would
stop the proliferation, use and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
<P>
It is not only the big chemical companies that fall under the
treaty's new regulatory requirements, but small and medium-sized
ones that will be required to fill out burdensome paperwork and
host international bureaucrats through on-site inspections.
<P>
 Paint manufacturers, distilleries, automotive, biotechnology,
pharmaceutical, textiles, food processing and cosmetic companies
for example, could fall under the CWCW as a result of the chemicals
they use for legitimate manufacturing purposes.
<P>
According to information supplies to the Senate by the Arms Central
and Disarmament Agency, between 3,000 and 8,000 companies will
be affected by the treaty.
<P>
While several government agencies reviewing CWC document the cost
of the new treaty at $200 million per year, many experts conclude
that the costs will be much higher.  
<P>
Baker Spring of the Heritage Foundation suggest that the indirect
costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the loss of confidential
information are difficult to estimate, but &quot;billions in losses
are not out of the question.&quot;
<P>
Businesses covered by the CWC treaty would have to submit reports
to a new U.N. body called the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons on each chemical they use.  It is estimated
that the paperwork will take a firm about nine hours for each
&quot;Schedule 1&quot; chemical its production process uses, 7.2
hours for each &quot;Schedule 2&quot; chemical, and 2.5 hours
for each Schedule 3 chemical it uses.  
<P>
Many businesses both large and small use hundreds if not thousands
of chemicals in their manufacturing process.  Under the CWC, affected
businesses will be subjected to two types of inspection -- routine
and challenge.  The Defense Department estimates that large companies
could incur costs as high as $500,000 per inspection and small
firms may incur costs between $10,000 - $20,000.  Each business
inspected also must pick up the tab for the inspectors meals and
lodging.  
<P>
The inspectors would represent various countries signing the CWC,
but not the United States. 
<P>
 Besides sharing proprietary business information with international
inspectors, inspections may also involve production shutdown.
 Private businesses just learning of CWC implications are concerned
that such visits may compromise confidential business information
and produce significant costs.  
<P>
One medium-size company alerted the Senate that they use over
5,000 different chemicals in their production process of household
products and that the reporting system would impose a significant
administrative burden.  
<P>
Most disconcerting, though, is the claim by foreign policy experts
that rogue countries that harbor chemical weapons are not planning
to sign the treaty.  As non-signatories to the treaty, countries
such as Egypt, Iraq, North Korea, Syria and the Republic of China
will not be bound by CWC's provisions. 
<P>
 At the same time, American businesses will pay a huge price and
suffer real losses for a treaty whose goals cannot be met because
rogue countries will continue to stockpile and produce chemical
weapons.

Will You Be Required to File Electronically?<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<hr>
The one thing that annoys business owners about Washington, D.C.
is the fact that they often find out about a new rule or regulation
well after it has been signed into law.  Most recently, thousands
of small and medium-sized businesses have been receiving notices
from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about a new law passed
under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which requires
more businesses to start filing their payroll taxes electronically
by January 1, 1997.<BR>

<P>
An unrelated provision to the 1993 NAFTA legislation required
that the federal government build a nationwide Electronic Federal
Tax Payment System (EFTPS) in order to receive federal depository
taxes electronically.  The new program began with 800 of the largest
U.S. businessses on January 1, 1995, and 800 more were added to
the mandated system at the beginning of 1996.  On January 1, 1997,
1.2 million more businesses were slated to become mandated electronic
filers.  That deadline has been extended to July 1, 1997 due to
the efforts of Senator Kit Bond (R-MO), Chairman of the Senate
Small Business Committee, and other business allies on Capitol
Hill.<BR>

<P>
According to phase-in requirements of the IRS' EFTPS, businesses
whose aggregate federal payroll tax deposits exceding $50,000
must begin depositing these taxes electronically.  The IRS began
informing small companies of the requirement with the following
notice: &quot;YOU MUST ENROLL AND DEPOSIT ELECTRONICALLY.&quot;
 To all the recipients of the IRS mailing, the notice came from
out of the blue.<BR>

<P>
When small businesses started complaining to members of Congress
about the surprise notices, Senator Bond and others stepped in
to help those targeted by the fast approaching deadline.  In a
July 24 letter sent to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and IRS
Commissioner Margaret Richardson, Sen. Bond wrote that many small
busineses did not understand what the IRS notice meant in practical
terms.  Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-AK), ranking minority member of the
committee, co-signed the letter.<BR>

<P>
Senator Bond said that some small businesses in response to the
notices thought that the IRS would start &quot;debiting bank accounts
without taxpayer permission, while others believe that they must
invest in new computer and telephone systems in order to conduct
the transfers.&quot;<BR>

<P>
In another letter to Senator William Roth (R-DE), Chairman of
the Senate Committee on Finance, over thirty business organizations
-- including the American Payroll Association -- expressed concern
that the EFTPS system will not be prepared to handle over 1.3
million new electronic filers.  In addition, the business groups
assert that the IRS is not adequately education those obligated
to electronically file.<BR>

<P>
For example, the letter points out that in a recent meeting of
over 600 Certified Public Accountants held in Boston, not one
of the attendees knew of the mandate.  In addition, a survey city
by the letter confirms that most of the businesses falling under
the next phase-in are unaware of the new filing commitment --
over 70% of &quot;soon-to-be mandated taxpayers are not aware
of these requirements.&quot;  Also, spot calls of IRS district
offices have revealed that the tax-collecting agency's employees
are not even aware of the new requirements.<BR>

<P>
According to Sen. Bond, the need for the IRS to communicate more
effectively with small business taxpayers falls under the Small
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) which became
law in March.  Under SBREFA, federal agencies are supposed to
publish regulations in &quot;Plain English&quot; so that small
businesses can comply with the law.<BR>

<P>
Following the various letter writing campaigns to the IRS and
key committee chairman, the IRS published a Legislative Fact Sheet
on July 29.  In that four page summary, the IRS provides an overview
of the EFTPS in a question &amp; answer format.<BR>

<P>
Even so, for some business groups and others opposed to the phase-in
requirement, the new mandate will create a major new cost burden
that will disrupt many businesses.  Also, of the two options offered
by the IRS for electronic payment -- Automated Clearing House
&quot;Credit&quot; or &quot;Debit&quot; -- many small businesses
may not be able to select the credit option because local and
rural banks are not equipped to offer it.<BR>

<P>
Most problematic however is the fact the IRS and the Treasury
Department will not test the system first to determine if it will
properly work.  The business organizations writing to Congress
estimate that about 2 million businesses will be required to enroll
in the system, which means that financial agents will be processing
16,600 enrollments per day.  And if each taxpayer has two questions,
the IRS will be answering about 33,000 inquiries per day.<BR>

<P>
Under the new Small Business Jobs Protections Act passed early
August (the bill that hiked the minimum wage), the January 1997
deadline has been extended to July 1, 1997 so that businesses
can more fully understand how to comply with the new electronic
filing law.  The extension also gives the IRS more time to fully
educated small business, banks, payroll processors, and accountants
about the procedure.<BR>

<P>
Those businesses with less than $50,000 in payroll taxes may want
to take this opportunity to find out more about the requirements
-- 1999 the requirement drops to $20,000.<BR>

<P>
Is the IRS capable of answering questions that hundreds of thousands
of businesses will have about filing electronically, and will
they be prepared to fully implement the program on July 1, 1997?
 According to question #14 on their recent Legislative Update,
if a taxpayer does not understand the enrollment process, form
or instructions, they can call 1-800-555-4477 or 1-800-945-8400.

<h2>Chairman of House Small Business Committee A True
Champion<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<P>
<hr>
<br>
 Recently I had the opportunity to talk with the
Chairman of the House Small Business Committee. The topic was
the accomplishments of the 104th Congress regarding small business
issues.  Chairman Jan Meyers (R-KS) was proud of the record of
the 104th Congress, but expressed frustration with President Clinton
as many of the small business initiatives fell victim to his veto
pen.<BR>
<P>
The frustration stems from the fact that key tax
and regulatory reforms had &quot;enough support to pass both Houses
of Congress.&quot;  In addition, all of the reforms were priorities
that were recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business
-- an event called for by the President.  For example, legislation
to cut capital gains taxes, tort reform, increased expensing for
small businesses, and estate-tax reform, were passed by the House
and Senate (some by large margins with bipartisan majorities)
but rejected by the President.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers identified several reasons why more ground
wasn't won on behalf of small business.  For one, the Republicans
lost the media battle on key issues.  Also, the President portrayed
small business legislation as dangerous and unfair.  &quot;It's
difficult for us to respond to his type of bullypulpit,&quot;
stated Meyers.<BR>
<P>
 Many members of Congress feel that both the press
and the President successfully depicted Republican-led reforms
as &quot;extreme.&quot;  The multi-million dollar ad campaigns
sponsored by organized labor and environmental groups echoed this
theme.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;The tax issue is especially easy to demagogue,&quot;
says Meyers.  The Chairman refers to the fact that it is easy
to communicate in a ten-second sound bite that something &quot;benefits
the rich&quot;  According to Meyers its more difficult to quickly
articulate how cutting capital gains taxes provides job-creating
small businesses with access to capital to help start or grow
their enterprises.<BR>
<P>
Despite some of the criticism that Meyers has for
the President, she's more upbeat than critical and feels that
the Congress has indeed advanced the small business agenda on
Capitol Hill.  For one, she has changed the focus of the Small
Business Committee to actually focus on small business issues.
 The Committee's agenda is not random or personal, but one driven
by the needs of small businesses.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;We went to the small business community to
see what is important to them -- then we went after these issues,&quot;
says Meyers.<BR>
<P>
 Small business owners and various groups in Washington
representing the small business community feel welcome in Rayburn
2359 -- the committee hearing room where all the action takes
place.  Scores of small business owners and entrepreneurs have
been invited to testify before the Committee to deliver their
personal accounts of how they have been impacted by regulation
and taxes, or how they would benefit or possibly be hurt by legislation
before the Congress.<BR>
<P>
 And Meyers is proud that some pieces of legislation
originating in her Committee were signed into law by the President.
 For one, the Regulatory Flexibility Act has been strengthened
to protect small businesses from burdensome regulations.  The
strengthening of the Act will make, &quot;regulatory agencies
look more closely at rules and regulations and their impact on
small businesses before they put them out,&quot; states Meyers.
<BR>
<P>
 Under the leadership of Meyers, the health care
tax credit given to small businesses was increased from 25% to
30% and made permanent.  &quot;It was wrong for small businesses
to come to Congress each year and beg to have this credit extended.
 They couldn't plan for the future,&quot; she says.<BR>
<P>
 The Paperwork Reduction Act was also signed into
law requiring that the federal government reduce the paperwork
burden on Americans by 10% in its first year, and 5% annually
thereafter.<BR>
<P>
 The Committee has jurisdiction over the Small Business
Administration (SBA), and Meyers reports that they have been able
to trim the size of the agency &quot;without taking away a single
program of vital importance to small business.&quot;  The SBA's
budget was trimmed from $800 million to $500 million with its
popular loan programs intact.  The Chairman's goal was to provide
diligent oversight of the SBA loan program to ensure it remains
sound with a relatively low loss rate.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers has served on the Committee since 1985, and
admits that their are tough challenges ahead both for the Congress
and small business.  Earlier this year, she announced her retirement
from Congress and hopes to tackle one more issue before her departure..
 That issue is the SBA's 8(a) program -- a program that awards
contracts to minority-owned business noncompetitively.  Meyers
feels the program is riddled with fraud and abuse, and directly
contradicts the recent <U><I>Adarand</I></U> decision by the Supreme
Court.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers believes that the program began with good
intentions, but is now out of control.  According to Meyers, of
the $4.37 billion awarded in 8(a) contracts, only 9% are awarded
competitively.  The government can save taxpayers over $1 billion
if these contracts were competitively bid.  The Government Accounting
Office (GAO) reports that the 8(a) program has failed to foster
self-sufficiency for its small business participants.  According
to a GAO report, &quot;SBA's success in helping disadvantaged
firms to become self-sufficient and competitive was minimal...many
firms relied on 8(a) contracts and viewed the program an end in
itself.&quot;<BR>
<P>
 Meyers admits that because she has decided to tackle
this issue -- her preference is to abolish the 8(a) program --
she may leave Congress on a controversial note.  But Meyers feels
she has an obligation to address the issue.  &quot; I don't feel
comfortable leaving Congress without addressing this costly problem&quot;
she says.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Whatever note she happens to leave on, the small
business community in Washington is unanimous that Chairman Meyers
has been a champion of small business during the 104th Congress.

<H2>Cost Of Government Makes July 3 A Special Day</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr><p>
<blockquote>
On July 4, the United States celebrates its independence from Britain. On the same day, a Washington-based group says, Americans can celebrate their independence from having just paid their share of the cost of government.
<p>
Americans for Tax Reform, a government watchdog and taxpayer advocacy organization, figures that Americans spend more than half the calendar year working for the government. Cost of Government Day according to ATR, "is the date of the calendar year on which the average American has earned enough gross income to pay off all his or her direct and hidden taxes" - hidden taxes being the cost of regulation.
<p>
AU federal, state and local outlays (taxes plus borrowing) are included in Cost of Government Day. Although much of the public has become familiar with Tax Freedom Day - calculated by the Tax Foundation as the date when the average American's  earnings cover her tax bill - ATR believes it is important to include regulatory costs as well.
<p>
Cost of Government Day is calculated to help people understand the combined cost of the tax and regulatory burden. "The extra money and human resources businesses must spend to comply with regulations is just as much a financial burden on consumers as direct taxes. Regulations are essentially hidden taxes," says ATR President Grover Norquist.
<p>
According to the group, regulations are passed on to the consumer in the  of higher prices. Also, most economists acknowledge that regulatory costs are passed along from employers to employees in the  of lower wages while constraining a business's ability to invest and grow.
<p>
ATR has calculated the cost of government in 1996 at $3.38 trillion. That breaks down to $13,000 for every man, woman and child in America. Of that total, nearly $1 trillion results from federal and state regulation. The federal government alone accounts for more than $739 billion in hidden regulatory costs (more than $2,800 for every man, woman and child in America).
<p>
According to ATR, the total cost of state and local regulations is vastly underestimated because no quantifiable data has been assembled to account for all costs. For example, the costs associated with state and local environmental protection, worker safety and consumer protection are not included.
<p>
The cost of federal regulations, however, has been calculated by Rochester Institute of Technology Professor Thomas D. Hopkins, a leading authority on regulatory costs. Recently Hopkins conducted a study for the U.S. Small Business Administration documenting the impact of regulations on smaller companies. Hopkins found that the average federal regulatory cost per worker in smaller firms is three-quarters higher than for larger businesses.
<p>
And when businesses are surveyed, they consistently bemoan the burdensome nature of regulations. For example:
<ul>
<li>In March, the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis reported that 52 percent of midsize companies surveyed said government regulation is their biggest challenge.
<li>In a recent survey of small manufacturers conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers, nearly half reported that regulations had prevented their hiring new workers.
<li>The SBA says that small-business owners spend 1 billion hours each year filling out government forms at a cost of $100 billion.
</ul>
Although most surveys have found that Americans believe federal regulations do more harm than good, this sentiment has not translated into a major regulatory overhaul in the federal government.
<p>
In fact, just the opposite has occurred. The Clinton administration's regulatory budget has
grown much faster than federal spending. And between 1989 and 1992 - during the Bush administration - the government burden on small business increased more than 34 percent, according to the House Joint Economic Committee.
<p>
Not only are businesses saddled with higher costs due to increased regulations, but county governments will be forced to spend almost $3 billion by 1998 to comply with mandates imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act, according to estimates by the National Association of Counties.
<p>
Still, the ATR's Norquist believes Cost of Government Day will eventually roll backward instead of forward.
<p>
"While the new Congress has been attacked by defenders of the status quo for wanting to reform regulations and cut taxes for working families and small businesses, ATR believes we have only seen the beginning of the debate to overhaul the tax system, trim the size of government, and relieve Americans of burdensome regulations."
<p>
The 1996 elections will be a referendum on the size and scope of government, he believes.
<p>
While most Americans will be observing the country's independence on the Fourth of July, ATR hopes they also will observe what the government has cost them on July 3. According to Norquist, being informed is the first step to helping his group move Cost of government Day several days backward each year.

<H2>How Much Do You Pay Uncle Sam Each Week?</H2><br>

<blockquote>
What government costs taxpayers has been well-documented by many groups. And it's beginning to get even more attention.
<p>
According to the Washington-based Tax Foundation, "Tax Freedom Day" fell on May 7 this Year. That date marks the point at which the average American's earnings covered his or her tax bill for the year. "Cost of Government Day," a day calculated by Americans for Tax Reform, goes further by including taxes, regulations and total government spending. According to that group, the average person has not finished paying the government until July 3. Now, a Michigan-based group wants to remind workers how much government costs each pay period by including the information on payroll stubs. The Mackinac Center for Public Policy has developed "The Right to Know Payroll Form" to show workers the cost of government and how these costs translate into less take-home pay.
<p>
For years, watchdog groups have warned that increased regulation and taxation mean employers must pass costs on to employees through lower wages and fewer benefits. The right-to-know form shows how these mandates quickly add up to sizable amounts for each employee.
<p>
"Many workers don't realize the actual cost that government imposes through its spending and regulations. The Right to Know Payroll Form helps citizens become better able to participate in the democratic process because it makes them better informed," said Mackinac Vice President Joseph Overton.
<p>
Beyond the usual pay-stub information of state and federal income tax and Social Security payments, the Right to Know Payroll Form includes:
<ul>
<li>The employer's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes.
<li>The employer's unemployment insurance and workers' compensation costs.
<li>The costs of administering the taxes.
<li>The costs of complying with state and federal personnel-related mandates, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act and Family and Medical Leave Act.
</ul>
Employers are hit with additional regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies. So, for most businesses, the right-to-know effort hits only the tip of the regulatory iceberg.
<p>
The business community has responded positively to the Mackinac project. According to Mackinac spokesperson Joseph Lehman, "dozens of private businesses are working to implement the.system right now."
<p>
The center launched their effort on Tax Freedom Day and continues to recruit employers to use the system.
<p>
In addition to employers in the private sector, Mackinac has found an unlikely partner - the state of Michigan. Starting in July, more than 60,000 state employees will receive revised pay stubs documenting how much money it takes to keep them on the payroll.
<p>
The new payroll stubs will include how much the state pays for the employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes and the state-paid portion of health insurance and other benefits.
<p>
According to the center, developing the data for a right-to-know form is simple. Beyond the standard payroll deductions shown on the typical pay stub, the form lists all the employer's costs. Such items as the employer's share of payroll taxes per employee, easily quantifiable government mandates and the administrative cost of compliance are included.
<p>
The employer's costs are itemized and deducted from the Estimated Payroll Allocation to produce gross pay. The withholding tax is subtracted from gross pay to produce net pay, just as most payroll forms do now.
<p>
According to the center's brochure promoting the right-to-know program; both employers and employees benefit. 
<p>
Workers understand better how government-imposed mandates affect job creation and growth. Employers understand better how mandates and taxes impact workers' pay.
<p>
For small companies, this is especially critical because they feel more harshly the effects of mandates and taxes.

<H2>Right To Know Form Shows Payroll Bite</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
The amount that government costs taxpayers has been well-documented by a variety of groups.
<p>
According to the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation, "Tax Freedom Day" fell on May 7 this year. That date marks the point at which the average American's year-to-date earnings covers his tax bill for the year. "Cost of Government Day," a day calculated by Americans for Tax Reform, goes further by including taxes, regulations and total government spending. According to that group, the average person works for the government until July 3.
<p>
Now, a Michigan-based group, wants to remind workers how much government costs them each pay period by including this information on employee payroll stubs. The Mackinac Center for Public Policy has developed "The Right to Know Payroll Form" to show workers the cost of government and how these costs translate into less take-home pay.
<p>
The Mackinac Center says that workers will benefit from the new pay stub because it shows employees the cost of government programs and mandates.
<p>
For years, watchdog groups lamenting the size and scope of government have warned the public that increased regulation and taxation mean that employers have to pass these costs on to employees through lower wages and fewer benefits. The Right to Know Form breaks down those costs by showing how these mandates quickly add up to sizable amounts per employee.
<p>
"Many workers don't realize the actual cost that government imposes through its spending and regulations. The Right to Know Payroll Form helps citizens become better able to participate in the democratic process because it makes them better informed," said Mackinac Vice President Joseph Overton.
<p>
Although pay stubs already show the employee's share of state and federal income tax and Social Security payments, the Right to Know Payroll Form includes other costs. These unseen costs include the employer's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes; the employer's unemployment insurance and workers' compensation costs; the costs of administering such taxes; and the costs of complying with state and federal, personnel-related mandates, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act and Family and Medical Leave Act.
<p>
Employers are hit with additional regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies. So for most businesses, the right to know effort only hits the tip of the regulatory iceberg.
<p>
The business community's response to the Mackinac project has been positive. According to Mackinac spokesperson Joseph Lehman, "dozens of private businesses are working to
implement the system right now."
<p>
The Mackinac Center launched the effort on Tax Freedom Day and is actively recruiting employers. Although many employers in the private sector have called the center to pledge their adoption of the payroll form, Mackinac has found an unlikely partner - the state of Michigan.
<p>
Starting in July, more than 60,000 employees of the state will receive revised pay stubs, which will document how much is paid to keep them on the payroll. While Michigan did not include all Right to Know Payroll Form recommendations, the new payroll stubs will include how much the state pays for the employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes, and the state-paid portion of health insurance and other benefits.
<p>
According to the center, developing the cost data to use for a firm's own right-to-know form is simple. Beyond the standard payroll deductions that are shown on the typical pay stub, the Right to Know form extends payroll accounting to include all the employer's costs. Such items as the employer's share of payroll taxes per employee, easily quantifiable government mandates and the administrative burden of complying with such costs are included.
<p>
Firms participating in the program have used accountants and tax and benefits managers to calculate these costs to determine the average cost per employee. Once the costs are estimated, they are added to the gross pay to produce an Estimated Payroll Allocation.
<p>
On the form, the employer's costs are itemized and deducted from the Estimated Payroll Allocation to produce gross pay. The withholding tax is subtracted from gross pay to produce net pay, just as most payroll forms do now.
<p>
According to the center's brochure promoting the Right to Know program, both employers and employees benefit. Workers will better understand how government-imposed mandates impact job creation and growth.
<p>
Also, employees will better understand how mandates and taxes impact workers' pay. For small firms, this is especially critical as mandates and taxes are more harshly felt by this sector of the economy.

<H2>Wage Hike Won't Help The Poor But Will Hurt Business</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Who would have thought our nation's small businesses would be facing a mandated increase in their labor costs under a Republican-controlled Congress? President Clinton had the opportunity to push through a minimum-wage increase during his first two years in office, but chose not to.
<p>
But the politics of an election year are shifting into high gear, and each party is looking for ways to shore up its base of support. For the Democrats, an increase in the minimum wage is the perfect way to show the American public that they care about the working class. It also ensures that the labor unions will continue to support the Democrats' campaign to win back control of Congress.
<p>
Increasing the minimum wage will do little to help the working poor in America, but the emotional appeal of the issue obviously benefits the party that is pushing it. To that extent, the Republicans don't want to appear uncaring, so they're working to craft a package they feel will more adequately respond to the needs of the working poor.
<p>
But first, some of the facts regarding who benefits from an increase in the minimum wage:
<ul>
<li> According to the Democratic Leadership Council, a moderate group of Democrats that Clinton once headed, more than 70 percent of minimum-wage workers are in families that are well above the poverty level. Nearly 40 percent of the workers are in families with incomes in the top half of the income distribution.
<li>Of the 1.96 million workers who earned the minimum wage in 1995, 59 percent were 24 years old or younger, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<li>Analyzing the 12 million workers who make between $4.25 and $5.15 an hour (the proposed new wage), the Employment Policy Institute found that only 9 percent of these workers are married and their families' sole wage earner. Only 3 percent are single parents.
<li> Also, according to Employment Policy Institute, the average wage of minimum-wage workers increases from $4.25 to $6.08 an hour within a year.
</ul>
Wage-hike proponents say that the minimum wage is at a 40-year low. But this declaration, made often by Labor Secretary Robert Reich, compares apples to oranges. Forty years ago, the minimum wage applied mostly to skilled jobs in manufacturing and transportation - restaurant and retail jobs were exempt. Reich and his fellow wage-hike crusaders are essentially comparing the pay of skilled workers yesterday to unskilled workers today.
<p>
Of course, the small-business lobby in Washington is not surprised that it must continue to fight wage-hike proposals. According to an industry representative fighting against the wage increase, "The American public continue to support an increase in the starting wage because it's a feel-good proposal. Unfortunately, most Americans do not understand the harmful effects of artificial wage hikes - they cost jobs and cause price increases for the working poor."
<p>
The Democratic Leadership Council appears to agree. In a recent position paper on the wage increase, the council asserts that "the costs of an increase ... would be borne disproportionately by lower-income families" because they would be forced to pay higher prices. The council calls this a "regressive transfer, making most poor people a little worse off in order to improve the lives, at least for a time, of a group of people that is predominately nonpoor."
<p>
Recognizing this dynamic, one Republican freshman has come up with a creative idea to allow minimum-wage workers to keep more of their pay rather than allowing the government to eat away at their wages.
<p>
Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., proposes allowing minimum-wage earners to keep the payroll taxes that are currently withheld from their paychecks. McIntosh is calling his increase proposal the Minimum Wage Tax Cut. According to the freshman member, the proposal would increase the take-home pay of those earning the minimum wage without causing the job losses that a government-mandated wage hike would produce. It's estimated that an increase in the minimum wage would cost the economy 300,000 to 500,000 jobs.
<p>
McIntosh's proposal would cut federal taxes for workers earning between $4.25 and $5.25 an hour by allowing them to keep federal income, Social Security and Medicare taxes - now deducted from their paychecks. The proposal would raise workers' net hourly rate to $4.57, compared with the current $3.76 when federal withholdings are deducted.
<p>
"What proponents of raising the minimum wage to $5.15 don't tell you is that after federal taxes are deducted, workers will only take home $4.56 an hour," McIntosh said. "By avoiding government-mandated wages, taxes can be cut for minimum-wage earners and their weekly paychecks will increase," he added.
<p>
Early estimates of the McIntosh proposal by the Congressional Budget Office show that it could cost $8 billion to $10 billion annually. To make up the difference, McIntosh proposed cutting federal welfare by 10 percent, amounting to $9 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the 90-cent wage increase will cost businesses about $12.5 billion over five years.
<p>
But whatever the wage hike will cost the business community, most of the evidence proves that the real losers would be lower-skilled workers who become priced out of the labor market.

<H2>Small Businesses Fighting For Medical Accounts</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>
Another health-care reform battle is brewing on Capitol Hill. But rather than fighting against employer mandates, small-business organizations and their allies are fighting to include medical savings accounts in health-care legislation this year.
<p>
What is an MSA? An employer takes a portion of funds currently spent on health insurance and deposits it into an MSA - up to $2,000 for an individual or $4,000 for a family.
<p>
The money can be used to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses. Some can be used to purchase a catastrophic policy covering all medical expenses after a deductible is met. And, at the end of the year, the insured can keep any unused MSA funds.
<p>
This provides an incentive for the insured to shop around for healthcare needs - injecting much-needed competition into an industry in which the third-party payment system has left the consumer with no incentive to spend less.
<p>
Under the Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996 passed by the House of Representatives, individuals and the self-employed could deduct from their federal taxes 100 percent of the funds deposited in their MSAs. This would be in addition to the 35 percent of a catastrophic policy premium they are already allowed to deduct.
<p>
This feature, say MSA advocates, would make individual taxes fairer in comparison to what corporations pay. And tax equity, combined with the portability feature, would help
solve the "job-lock" problem experienced by so many Americans who want to change jobs.
<p>
The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill in the Senate does not include an MSA provision. Key Democrats have said MSAs were too controversial to include, and they are aggressively working to make sure that MSAs are kept out.
<p>
MSAs have long been supported by small business. At the White House Conference on Small Business in June 1995, the adoption of MSAs was a key recommendation delegates sent to the president and Congress. In fact, it's estimated that nearly 3,000 businesses - mostly small and medium - are currently using an MSA prototype.
<p>
Evidence reveals that MSAs help reduce health-insurance costs for businesses, while giving employees greater physician choice and control over health-care spending.
<p>
That's why MSA supporters are baffled at flip flops-taken by politicians who have been long-time supporters. In particular, minority leaders Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., in the House and Tom Daschle, D-S.D., in the Senate are leading the charge against MSAs, despite the fact that both were champions of MSAs in the previous Congress.
<p>
Less than two years ago, when asked about the prospect of MSAs being included in health-care reform, Gephardt responded, "Absolutely. This is an idea the Ways and Means Committee has worked-on for three or four years. It's very popular . . . I think it's a great option."
<p>
In fact, MSAs unanimously passed the Ways and Means Committee in the last Congress. Every member of the committee, with the exception of one Democrat, voted for them. In the current Congress MSAs were included in the bipartisan balanced-budget package sent to President Clinton, which he subsequently vetoed.
<p>
Just recently, Sen. Daschle referred to MSAs as the "Dr. Kevorkians of health reform, but in the last Congress he cosponsored the Medical Cost Containment Act of 1992, which according to the legislation, "would allow employers to provide their employees with an annual allowance in a Medical Care Savings Account to pay for routine health-care needs."
<p>
MSA advocates say the flip-flops exhibited by Daschle and Gephardt smack more of partisan politics than a newfound skepticism of MSAs.
<p>
"This is what the American people hate about Washington," said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a longtime advocate of MSAs.
<p>
"Because some Democrats view this as a simple case of Republicans getting credit for a popular reform, they are stonewalling with the hope of receiving some sort of partisan gain," Norquist added.
<p>
With recent reports showing that proposals like Kennedy-Kassebaum have been an abysmal failure in states that have enacted similar reforms - such as the total collapse of the health-insurance system in Washington state - antics on Capitol Hill to kill MSAs may backfire.
<p>
According to MSA advocates, a grassroots revolution is brewing in favor of the reform, especially among small businesses and the self-employed. Indeed, President Clinton is attempting to reach out to constituencies that he has not been too popular with in the past. The support of MSAs may be one of those issues he finally embraces.

<H2>'A-Corps' Plan Would Hobble Small Business</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Democrats and Republicans are both marketing themselves as job creators and wage boosters, placing American business at the center of their policy prescriptions. Their proposed solutions, though, are ideological opposites.
<p>
To Republicans, the key to robust economic growth, higher wages and more jobs lies in providing businesses with significant tax and regulatory relief.
<p>
Their solutions also include giving individuals the widest options available for obtaining financial security, education and training, and benefits such as health care through the equalization of tax benefits.
<p>
Democrats believe American business won't help workers on its own and that the federal government must provide the incentives to encourage business to do so.
<p>
According to Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, "If we want companies to do things which do not necessarily improve the returns to shareholders, but which are beneficial for the economy and society as a whole . . . we have to give business an economic reason to do so."
<P>
But rather than provide all businesses with across-the-board tax and regulatory relief, proposals being offered by Reich and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate would reduce taxes and regulations only for companies that achieve "certain minimum requirements."
<p>
Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Task Force on High Wage Jobs, recently released a package of proposals aimed at alleviating economic insecurity and wage stagnation.
<p>
The report, titled "Scrambling to Pay the Bills: Building Allies for American Working Families," would provide businesses with favorable tax and regulatory treatment if they meet certain tests established by the federal government.
<p>
"A-Corps" businesses would be required, for example, to meet some of the following standards: 
<ul>
<li>Contribute an amount equal to at least 3 percent of payroll to pension plans.
<li>Commit an amount equal to at least 2 percent of payroll for employee training.
<li>Offer all U.S. employees a health-care plan approved by the government. Employers would have to pay at least 50 percent of the plan's cost.
<li>Give employees the option of participating in a profit-sharing, stock option or stock ownership plan. An employee-elected trustee would manage the plan.
<li>Place caps on compensation for the chief executive officer and other employees.
<li>Make sure at least 90 percent of plant and equipment purchases, and employment costs resulting from product and service production, delivery and consumption in the United States occurred in the United States.
<li>Meet or exceed all occupational, safety and environmental standards.
<li>Pay dues and belong to an industry association approved by the Department of Commerce.
</ul>
Businesses meeting the criteria would be given a favorable tax rate, their current corporate income tax replaced with a "business activities tax." Under a BAT plan, payments companies make to other businesses, including the purchase of new equipment and plant construction, are subtracted from taxable income. Only imports would be taxed.
<p>
A-Corps participants would receive a lower tax rate than nonparticipating businesses, though the proposal doesn't specify what those rates might be. However, under the BAT system, small businesses with gross annual receipts of $100,000 would be exempted from the tax.
<p>
In terms of regulatory relief for A-Corps participants, businesses would still be required to meet all federal laws, but could get quicker review and decision-making from federal agencies; participate in voluntary compliance programs; and take advantage of safe-harbor provisions from certain regulatory requirements.
<p>
Qualified A-Corps companies would also be given special treatment in bidding on government contracts.
<p>
Critics of Bingaman and Reich's approach charge that the "most-favored" corporate method is flawed in that businesses could not possibly participate in the A-Corps program without giving up control to the federal government.
<p>
In addition, they say, the proposal assumes businesses do not value workers - a predisposition that runs counter to reality. An economic policy update issued recently by the Senate Joint Economic Committee contends the "corporate responsibility" proposals would "make workers more dependent on their current employers at a time when public policy should be encouraging individual responsibility through upward mobility and portable benefits."
<p>
In addition, the IEC report argues that these policies would discriminate against small businesses and the self-employed.
<p>
According to the report, "because [small businesses] need to invest in building the business, they're less likely to have the free cash to spend on 'corporate responsibility.'
<p>
Also, says the study, a more prudent course would focus tax benefits on individuals, whether or not they receive health insurance, pension plans and worker training from their employers or elsewhere in the marketplace.
<p>
The best way to help the economy and individuals would be to expand individual retirement accounts, make pensions truly portable by allowing individuals the same tax benefits as company-sponsored plans, enact medical savings accounts and lower the marginal tax rates for all.
<p>
As Democrats and Republicans on the campaign trail and in Washington struggle to articulate their competing messages to the American people, small businesses already know what needs to be done to allow their businesses to grow and succeed. Entrepreneurs need help competing against global competitors.

<H2>Finally, Congress Moves To Limit Tax Increases</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
Most analysts agree that reviving tax cuts is a political nonstarter this year. Congress approved a balanced-budget package coupled with tax cuts for small business, but it stopped short at President Clinton's desk.
<p>
With April 15 fast approaching millions of small business owners and taxpayers look at the annual ritual with anger and frustration. But certain members of Congress are banding together to make sure that raising taxes will be just as difficult as cutting them.
<p>
On April 15, the House of Representatives will vote on a Tax Limitation Amendment to the Constitution that would require a two-thirds majority vote of each house of Congress to increase taxes. The effort is being led by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, along with a bipartisan group of House members including Pete Geren, D-Texas; Ralph Hall, D-Texas; and John Shadegg, R-Ariz.
<p>
On the same day, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights will hold hearings on a companion resolution to the tax-limiting amendment, introduced by Sen. Jon Kyle, R-Ariz.
<p>
Proponents of the amendment contend a constitutional requirement is absolutely necessary to protect taxpayers from the unending tax increases that followed the adoption of the 16th Amendment in 1913. Before the 16th Amendment was enacted, no income tax was allowed. Since then, federal tax collections have climbed more than 175,000 percent.
<p>
Tax-limitation amendments are not untested. Already, 28 states have some form. Ten have adopted the majority legislative vote to approve higher taxes, and one-third of states require more than a majority, according to Americans for Tax Reform.
<p>
Studies have shown clearly the effect of higher taxes on economic growth. A 1993 study by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress tracking state economies during 1989 to 1993 found:
<ul>
<li>The top 10 income tax-increasing states lost nearly 200,000 jobs from 1989 to 1993. The top 10 income tax-reducing states created nearly 1 million.
<li>Unemployment rose by 2.3 percent in the states that increased taxes the most, but only by .3 percent in the income tax-cutting states.
<li>Income per family of four fell by an average of $600 in the tax-increasing states, and rose $150 in the top 10 tax-cutting states.
</ul>
Tax increases are especially hard for the small-business, entrepreneurial sector, which the United States depends on for creating jobs.
<p>
The 1993 tax hike, for example, was sold as a plan to soak the rich but the majority of those affected were small businesses. A 1994 Small Business Survival Committee survey found that 28 percent of respondents raised prices, 26 percent postponed expansion plans, 14 percent terminated one employee, and 9 percent were forced to take two of the actions.
<p>
Tax-limiting proponents say the 1993 tax hike never would have made it into the history books if the two-thirds majority requirement had been in place. The increase passed by only one vote in the House and Senate.
<p>
According to Americans for Tax Reform four of the last five tax increases were passed with less than a two-thirds majority. They added $666 billion to the tax bill of American taxpayers.
<p>
Does a tax limitation requirement have the support of the public? In 1992, a National Taxpayer's Union Foundation survey found that 78 percent of respondents favored "a constitutional amendment that would- limit the growth of federal taxes."
<p>
More recently, delegates to the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business recommended to the president and Congress that a two-thirds majority requirement be adopted.
<p>
Taxpayers may want to tune into C-SPAN April 15 to see which members of Congress argue to limit increases and which members argue for unlimited power to dig deeper into their pockets.

<H2>Immigration Reform Taking Center Stage</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
If anyone forgot that the immigration issue is emotionally charged, Republican presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan is aggressively reminding America about the issue's volatility.
<p>
Among other measures, Buchanan proposes to erect some type of stronghold along the southern border of the United States and impose a five-year moratorium on legal immigration.
<p>
Congress, meanwhile, is prepared to take action on immigration reform legislation, and the business lobby in Washington is gearing up to oppose provisions that would put employers at the center of enforcing the nation's immigration laws.
<p>
American Business for Legal Immigration - which was formed to protect legal employment immigration - recently held a press conference in Washington to announce its opposition to Wyoming Republican Sen. Alan Simpson's immigration proposal, the Immigration Reform Act of 1995. Simpson's legislation calls for the following:
<ul>
<li>A 35 percent cut in business-related immigration each year, equating to a reduction of 50,000 employment-based visas (from 140,000 to 90,000);
<li>requiring employers who hire legal immigrants to subsidize training programs for U.S. workers;
<li>new taxes - each employer would be required to pay either $10,000 or 10 percent of the foreign worker's annual compensation package (whichever is higher) to the U.S. government;
<li>more regulations, restrictions and paperwork.
</ul>
Simpson's bill attempts to tackle both illegal and legal immigration reform in one sweeping measure. But ABLI contends that it is misguided to combine the two issues, blurring the distinction between the value that skilled legal immigrants bring to the U.S. economy versus a different set of concerns Americans have with illegal immigration.
<p>
"Although Simpson's proposal does seek to address the issue of illegal immigration in the U.S., it confuses legal and illegal immigration and unreasonably threatens the competitiveness of American business in today's global marketplace," says ABLI Director Jennifer Eisen. ABLI strongly supports differentiating between the problems posed by illegal immigration and the benefits of legal immigration.
<p>
ABLI members defend their need to search for and hire skilled talent where they can find it to boost U.S. competitiveness. The coalition also contends that in a highly competitive global economy, it is unrealistic for U.S. policy leaders to attempt to hinder and micromanage employer personnel decisions on top of the current requirements in the legal immigration system.
<p>
According to Kirby Dyess, corporate vice president of Intel Corp., his company already wades through six inches of government forms to comply with regulations and paperwork for each foreign professional it hires. The cost per employee is approximately $7,000 to $10,000. "We don't go through all of this time and expense to displace U.S. workers," Dyess says.
<p>
Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, agrees with Dyess. Miller explains that the overhead costs associated with hiring a foreign worker today are sufficient to make it the last resort for most employers. As a result, the current ceiling for business visas is not being reached. ABLI says that employers use about 93,000 of the 140,000 employment-based visas available.
<p>
ABLI also asserts that legal immigrants stimulate domestic job growth by bringing much-needed expertise, technological skill and patented concepts to the nation's industries and economy. Innovations by legal immigrants have propelled American companies to new successes and have allowed these companies to capitalize on new product inventions and technologies.
<p>
ABLl and its members agree that illegal immigration is a problem that must be addressed. Although efforts to split the legislation to address legal and illegal immigration may win out, the business lobby is also concerned about provisions that attempt to stop illegal immigration.
<p>
For example, both House and Senate legislation include proposals to put into place a centralized employment verification system operated by the federal government. Employers would be required to call a government toll-free number to identify the worker as eligible and give the prospective employee's Social Security number.
<p>
During this big political year, politicians and U.S. presidential hopefuls are reacting to hot emotional issues. But quick and rash policy prescriptions for the nation's illegal immigration problem could end up hurting the U.S. economy more than it will help if both legal and illegal immigration are "reformed" in one sweeping measure.

<H2>OSHA Reforms Winding Through Congress</H2>
<p><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Despite the first session of the 104th Congress marking a historic change in the direction of the federal government, far-reaching legislative initiatives have been stalled by the ideological and procedural differences in the House and Senate.
<p>
The House can successfully boast of many tax, regulatory and fiscal reforms it passed in 1995. But without-similar action in the Senate, Congress can't claim a long list of legislative accomplishments, which provide the conventional yardstick by which the media and public measure a productive Congress.
<p>
As Congress-bashers contend that a "do nothing" Congress is the best kind, political analysts predict that President Clinton may exploit Congress' record and pull a page out of campaign history books in his attempts to secure a second term in the White House.
<p>
Just as Harry Truman ran successfully against a "do-nothing" Congress in 1948, President Clinton is considering that strategy in 1996. The "do-nothing" label is something Congress will try to avoid, so congressional leaders are taking a second look at their unfinished 1995 agenda.
<p>
Plenty of opportunities exist to pass meaningful tax and regulatory reforms without stirring up too much of a special-interest hornets' nest. The re-evaluation, say observers, will match targeted legislative opportunities with 1996 political realities.
<p>
OSHA reform is one such area where Congress may accept modest legislative gains. The President and Congress agree that the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) needs to be reformed. Differences arise, of course, when the degree of reform is discussed.
<p>
Republican Rep. Cass Ballenger of North Carolina proposed an OSHA reform bill last year in the House, and it appears that the Senate may soon act on a lighter version of his bill.
<p>
Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas is resurrecting the reform effort in the Senate, with Sens. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., taking lead roles through co-sponsorship of S.R. 1423, the Occupational Safety and Health Reform and Reinvention Act.
<p>
"Since OSHA was created 25 years ago, the agency has expanded its authority far beyond the original intent of Congress," Hutchison said. "As a result, companies must worry about compliance with standards and regulations that have little or nothing to do with real safety issues."
<p>
S.R. 1423 strives to address real safety issues instead of penalizing business owners for paperwork violations and minor infractions.
<p>
The costs of these so called violations can add up to big fines, as one small roofing company in Houston learned.
<p>
The company was fined 23 times for a total of $13,000 for the following violations: A cut in the insulation of an extension cord that was no longer in use, a bent rung on the bottom of a ladder and a splintered handle on a discarded shovel.
<p>
The Senate reform bill redirects OSHA's energy to consultation programs and voluntary compliance. The bill would codify the Voluntary Protection Program, which exempts employers from general inspections if they have excellent safety and health records.
<p>
There would also be a reduction in penalties for nonserious violations (for example, nonserious hazard citations would be lowered from $7,000 to $100), and penalties waived for nonsignificant violations. Warnings would be issued in lieu of citations, and OSHA inspector quotas would be prohibited.
<p>
Employees would be encouraged (not required) to complain to their employer before they call OSHA. Employee involvement in safety committees is also encouraged through federal labor law modifications.
<p>
Most critically for business, the bill recommends that the employer should not be held responsible if a trained employee disregards health and safety rules.
<p>
OSHA itself has recognized the need to change.
<p>
If there is general agreement on basic principles, is it possible that an OSHA reform bill could move through both houses of Congress and on to the president for his signature?
<p>
Perhaps, but organized labor could deal a blow to even minor reform efforts. Labor unions are opposed to OSHA tinkering, which puts the president in a pickle if a reform bill makes its way through both chambers of Congress. The president is dependent on labor's support and big money for the '96 election.
<p>
Signing an OSHA reform bill backed by the majority of Congress could prove to the electorate and small businesses that the president indeed is governing like a "New Democrat." There's a good chance, though, that election-year friends like the "Old Democrat" much better.

<p>
If you ask most small-business owners, every politician talks a good game of making our
nation's tax system less burdensome. The immense task of overhauling the system, though, keeps most politicians talking. Tax reform is again taking center stage, and perhaps in the near future, tax system overhaul may actually become a reality.
<p>
Many small businesses agree with Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes when he says we need to "drive a stake" through the current tax system.
<p>
The small-business sector - responsible for most of the dynamic growth in the economy - fares the worst under the current system. Not only do high taxes inhibit small business growth and job creation, but compliance costs can be financially draining.
<p>
According to a 1991 Tax Foundation report, small companies spent at least $382 in compliance costs for every $100 paid in taxes.
<p>
In addition, it's estimated that businesses squander 3.4 billion hours in tax-related paperwork. And the cost of compliance is big business; more than $200 billion is spent on complying with tax laws.
<p>
Forbes advocates a "pure" flat tax, while . Dole's vision of reform is a "fairer and simpler" type of system.
<p>
Bold tax reform efforts received a big boost from an economic soul mate of Forbes. Jack Kemp, chairman of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, released a long-awaited report whose aim is to help guide and shape the debate to overhaul the system. With such high-profile attention given to the issue, tax reform is destined to become a major election-year issue.
<p>
Kemp's Tax Reform Commission begins the report by recommending to Congress and the president "that the current Internal Revenue Service Code be repealed in its entirety."
<p>
No mincing of words there. The principles guiding the new tax code would have to stand up to the TRC "tax test:"
<p><ul>
<li>Economic growth through incentives to work, save and invest;
<li> fairness for all taxpayers;
<li> neutrality that lets people and not government make choices;
<li> visibility to let people know the cost of government;
<li> stability so people can plan for the future.
</ul>
The TRC advocates that the "failed system" be replaced with a single low rate, taxing income only once with a generous personal exemption and full deductibility of the payroll tax.
<p>
The TRC stops short of advancing one type of tax system over another and does not suggest what the single low tax rate might be. (Forbes suggests a 17 percent rate starting at income above $36,800 for a family of four - below that income level, no taxes would be owed.)
<p>
To end the current tax code bias of rewarding consumption over saving and investing, the report says that the tax system "either must let savers deduct their saving or exclude the returns on the saving from their taxable income. It must also end double-taxation of businesses and their owners and permit expensing of investment outlays."
<p>
The report also recommends that capital gains taxes be abolished. Although the commission recognizes that estate and gift taxes make "little sense," it does not call for the elimination of such taxes, which prove particularly burdensome for family owned businesses.
<p>
The commission strongly endorses full deductibility of payroll taxes for employers and employees. If federal payroll taxes are tax-deductible, taxes would be determined on a worker's real net income.
<p>
Once a tax rate is set into place, the commission recommends that a two-thirds majority vote in Congress be required to raise taxes. For most tax reform advocates, this is critically important. As the law now stands, it only takes a majority vote in Congress to raise taxes and a supermajority to lower them.
<p>
Although many business organizations cheered the results of the TRC recommendations, most concluded that the real work lies ahead. The commission's report is not long on details, and the political realities of implementing such reforms depend on whether those in public office in 1997 will defend the current tax system by tinkering around the edges or totally dismantling it.

<h2>Small-Business Agenda Faces an Uphill Battle</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<P>
<hr><P>



What happened to the year of small business?  In 1995, the 104th Congress 
championed a legislative agenda to foster entrepreneurship and small-business growth.  But 
advancing small-business legislation proved to be more difficult than most Washington observers 
expected.  Many of the issues that were priorities of the small business lobby were labeled by the 
Clinton administration as giveaways to the rich or special breaks for big business.<p>
For example, efforts to reduce capital gains and estate taxes have been decried as 
benefitting a special few.<p>
And legislation that would have made federal government regulators more accountable to 
small business has been portrayed as a legislative license for big corporations to pollute the 
environment.<p>
Even when Congress and President Clinton eventually sign off on a budget agreement, 
incentives that were specifically targeted for small business will be vastly watered down or 
tossed aside in the name of compromise.<p>
What can small businesses and entrepreneurs expect from Congress and the Clinton 
administration in 1996?<p>
Election years tend to produce a stale legislative environment so the answer may very 
well be "not that much."  On the other hand, the president may attempt to solidify his traditional 
base of support during the election year by offering proposals that translate into votes at the 
ballot box in November.<p>
For example, the president's inclusion of a federal minimum wage increase in his budget 
plan represents an olive branch to labor unions, which view the administration's stand on labor 
issues as weak.<p>
In Congress, business proponents  --  mostly Republicans  --  will continue to advance 
issues popular with the small business community.  Important matters to small businesses, such 
as overhauling the nation's tax system as well as tax and regulatory reform in general, will 
continue to generate scores of congressional hearings and legislative proposals in Capitol Hill.<p>
When push comes to shove, though, will small business see substantive reforms?<p>
The Small Business Survival Foundation recently revisited the agenda set forth by nearly 
1,800 small business delegates at the June 1995 White House Conference on Small Business.  
The following is an update on the top five recommendations that came out of that conference:<p>
<b>Issue No 1:</b> Independent Contractor Clarification.  Most small businesses believe the 
IRS's 20-factor test to determine the employment status of independent contractors is too 
subjective.<p>
  Republican Jon Christensen of Nebraska introduced legislation to clarify the definition 
of independent contractors and streamline the current 20-factor test to only three criteria.<p>To date, the House Ways and Means Committee has not acted on the legislation, and the 
administration has opposed efforts to simplify the 20-factor test.  However, Christensen's efforts 
are expected to receive a hearing by the powerful tax-writing committee in the near future.<p>
<b>Issues No 2:</b> Meal and Entertainment Deduction. Conference delegates called upon 
Congress and the president to enact legislation allowing a 100 percent tax deduction for meals 
and entertainment.  Recent tax laws reduced the deduction to 50 percent.  Although the 100 
percent deduction may be a priority of small  business, it ranks low as an action item in 
Congress.  Politically, the issue would be a ripe target for opponents, who will label it as just 
another perk for the wealthy.<p>
<b>Issue No 3:</b> Regulatory Flexibility Act/Regulatory Reform.  Small business wants federal 
regulatory agencies to determine the costs of their proposed rules and regulations on the small 
business sector.  Amending the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as recommended by conference 
delegates, would increase the likelihood that cost-impact studies are done by regulators.<p>
The act, combined with a host of other regulatory reforms, passed the House but has 
stalled in the Senate.  Most observers believe all efforts to reform the regulatory system are dead 
for 1996.  Clinton has called the House measures, and similar legislation in the Senate, "too 
extreme."<p>
<b>Issue No 4:</b> Repeal the Federal Estate Tax. Family owned businesses are especially hard 
hit by high estate and gift taxes.  Many businesses fail to make it to the next generation due to the 
burdensome nature of such taxes.  Conference delegates overwhelmingly voted to repeal these 
taxes.  The estate-tax issue has become political fodder for class-warfare rhetoric. Even minor 
efforts to increase the estate-tax exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 have been vastly watered 
down.  The Clinton administration opposes abolishing estate and gift taxes but some estate tax 
relief will probably make it to a final budget deal.<p>
<b>Issue No 5 (tie): </b>Superfund Reform and Health-Care Reform: Many small businesses get 
trapped in what is known as the Superfund web, held liable for expensive government 
environmental cleanup schemes when their actions were legal at the time they disposed of waste.  <p>
Republican Mike Oxley of Ohio has introduced legislation to reform Superfund, but the 
bill does not repeal retroactive liability before 1987  --  a key component sought by reform 
proponents.  Even if a weak bill makes it to the president, he would likely veto the legislation.  <p>
The No. 1 reform on the health-care wish list was the adoption of tax-deductible medical 
savings accounts.  MSAs are included in the budget plan passed by Congress but are opposed by 
the Clinton administration.  Supporters believe that MSAs will probably be part of a final budget 
agreement. <p>
Conference delegates also called for the 100 percent tax deductibility of health care costs.  Small businesses will most likely see an increase to 50 percent phased in over a seven-
year period.<p>
On an optimistic note, at least small businesses won't have to ward off major proposals 
that increase their taxes or regulatory burden.  The only redflag is the President's proposal to 
raise the minimum wage.  A threat perhaps, but the small business lobby has become too 
powerful to allow this to happen.

<h2>Rhetoric throttles aid for small businesses</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
While some people would have you believe otherwise,
the small-business provisions within the Contract With America
amounted to only minor changes.  Now, even the small-scale tax
and regulatory reforms proposed within the contract have been
watered down.
<P>
Many of the contract's key provisions, such as regulatory relief
and legal reform, have either died in the Senate or have been
put on the back burner until after the protracted budget battle.
<P>
Special-interest groups opposed to tax and budget cuts, as well
as reforms that would make bureaucrats more accountable, have
painted the contract as extreme.  Labor unions alone have pumped
more than $2 million into media ads to decry proposals that &quot;drastically
cut&quot; Medicare and pare back safeguards that protect worker
safety and the environment.
<P>
Medicare reform is a perfect example of how the public has swallowed
distorted ad campaigns without checking the facts.  According
to a recent survey by Public Opinion Strategies, most Americans
are woefully misinformed about the basic facts regarding Medicare
reform proposals.
<P>
Under the GOP plan, Medicare's budget would undergo a slower rate
of growth in spending than under current law.  In fact, if Medicare
reform were left up to the 1,000 Americans who responded to the
Public Opinion Strategies survey, reform opponents would have
had a severe problem on their hands.
<P>
For example, when it was explained that the GOP plan would increase
spending for Medicare by 45 percent over the next seven years
--- twice the projected rate of inflation --- 80 percent of those
polled believed the increase was too high.
<P>
The GOP plan increases spending per recipient from $4,800 to $7,100
over the next seven years.  But when asked what they thought the
GOP plan would do, 27 percent said that the plan would cut spending
below $4,000; 24 percent said spending would remain the same;
and only 22 percent most accurately portrayed the plan --- that
it would increase spending per recipient.
<P>
The problem, according to Medicare reform supporters, is that
the American public has been consistently exposed to misleading
ads and political rhetoric.
<P>
According to Pam Bailey, president of the Healthcare Leadership
Council and co-chair of the Coalition to Save Medicare, President
Clinton's plan was not very different from the GOP's.  Under the
plan approved by Congress, the government would spend $1.65 trillion
on Medicare over seven years.  Under the president's plan, it
would spend $1.682 trillion.
<P>
Political rhetoric can be blamed for the demise of many tax and
regulatory changes that would have benefited millions of small
businesses.   Interest groups supportive of the status quo were
quick to distort Republican proposals, which were supported by
many Democrats as well, as giveaways to big business.
<P>
Sure, big companies would have marginally benefited from the changes
proposed by Republicans.  But small businesses would have been
the main beneficiaries.
<P>
Small businesses will see <I>some</I> tax relief and incentives
soon, but according to most small-business groups, the results
are a big disappointment compared with original expectations.
 Small businesses can probably expect a $25,000 expensing provision,
a capital gains tax reduction and targeted estate tax relief for
family-owned businesses.  The final agreement, however, will mandate
that the tax provisions be phased in over seven years.
<P>
Home office users can say goodbye to efforts this year to clarify
the home-office deduction.  But on a more positive note, the self-employed
will see an increase from 30 percent to 50 percent in the amount
they can deduct for health-care expenses (phased in over seven
years).
<P>
Distortion and political rhetoric may help guardians of the status
quo avoid passing reforms that put the country back on a track
of fiscal stability, while helping millions of small business
owners and entrepreneurs create jobs.  But for these millions
of small business owners, the truth is generally reflected in
their bottom lines, which the government plays a big part in helping
or hindering.

<h2>Balanced budget means bottom-line gains</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
 &quot;Balanced budget means bottom-line gains&quot;
Will balancing the federal budget have a real
impact on our economy, or is it merely a populist issue that picks
up votes at the ballot box?
<P>
As Congress and President Clinton bicker over the details of a
seven-year plan to balance the budget, recent public opinion figures
still show widespread support for the effort.
<P>
An early November survey conducted by Alexandria-based Public
Opinion Strategies showed 83 percent of 1,000 registered voters
said it was important to balance the federal budget in the next
seven years.
<P>
At the same time, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was predicting
wholesale chaos in the financial markets if Congress didn't increase
the federal debt limit.  But 69 percent of those surveyed said
the debt limit should not be increased without a balanced budget
in place.
<P>
Of course, the November deadline passed, Congress and the White
House reached a temporary agreement to re-open government after
a brief shutdown, the country's debt obligations are being paid
and the financial markets appear robust as ever.
<P>
In the end, you may ask:  Does a balanced budget really matter?
 And more importantly, how will a balanced federal budget affect
the livelihood of American families, businesses and individuals?
<P>
A recent crop of economic reports has concluded that balancing
the federal budget will have broad economic benefits and tangible
bottom-line gains for families, individuals and almost all sectors
of the American economy.
<P>
Economists at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank
in Washington, conclude that GOP plan to balance the budget --
with tax cuts -- will lead to greater business investment, higher
earnings per hour and faster economic growth than under current
law.
<P>
Heritage economists found the following would occur  with a balanced
budget in place:
<UL>
<LI>Gross Domestic Product would grow by $10.8 billion more than
under current law in the year 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $32.1 billion in real disposable
income from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $66.2 billion in consumption
expenditures from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential
fixed investment from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be and additional 104,000 housing starts from
1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be a decrease of .4 percent in the conventional
mortgage rate --- meaning that a homeowner would save about $10,000
over the life of a $100,000, 30-year mortgage;
<LI>auto sales would increase by 600,000 units over the next seven
years --- that's $10 billion worth of cars.
</UL>


<P>
Another report has more good news.
<P>
With the government taking a smaller bite out of the economy,
interest rates should fall dramatically, according to the Senate
Joint Economic Committee.
<P>
A report from the Committee showed that a typical American family
could save nearly $1,800 a year in loan payments if the Republican
plan to balance the budget passes.
<P>
For example, a family with a $75,000 mortgage, a $15,000 auto
loan and an $11,000 student loan could save $1,800 a year if interest
rates drop just one percentage point.
<P>
The national debt of all consumer borrowing for home mortgages
and auto debt is $4.8 trillion --- a 1 percentage point drop in
interest rates would save more than $48 billion per year.
<P>
&quot;Clearly, the benefits of a balanced budget would extent
to all Americans,&quot; says Grover Norquist, president of Americans
for Tax Reform.  With the public still on the side of balancing
the budget, observers believe that the President will accept most
elements of the Republican plan.

<h2>Are union leader's tactics too divisive?</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>

</center><hr><P>
The power wielded by labor unions has deteriorated
in recent years.  Even labor officials admit their political clout
is not what it used to be.
<P>
Lower membership combined with labor officials' inability to aggressively
advance their agenda has caused severe rifts within the labor
movement.  These same factors led to the unprecedented election
of a new AFL-CIO president and probably will lead to more aggressive
organizing strategies.
<P>
On Oct. 25, John Sweeney - then president of the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) --- defeated acting federation leader
Thomas Donahue for the AFL-CIO presidency.
<P>
Sweeney's win marked a historic moment for the AFL-CIO; his run
for the presidency was the only contested election in the federation's
40-year history.
<P>
As head of the SEIU, Sweeney increased its membership by 37 per
cent.  The SEIU under Sweeney also enjoyed a reputation for effective
organizing and activism --- points labor sees as critical to rebuilding
its political clout.
<P>
While Sweeney's performance at SEIU was striking in comparison
to other unions' activity, the methods used to bolster both its
membership and effectiveness have been questioned not only by
those who were the target of its tactics, but fellow union heads
as well.
<P>
During and after his election, Sweeney forcefully stated that
he will embrace civil disobedience and militancy &quot;if necessary.&quot;
 Sweeney found it necessary to use such tactics at the SEIU and,
based on his past success using such methods, is expected to employ
militant activism at the AFL-CIO.  Sweeney will also have a bigger
budget to work with.
<P>
While most unions spend about 5 percent of their budget on organizing
activities, the SEIU spends five times that amount.  Sweeney promised
to do the same at the AFL-CIO and committed $20 million of its
budget to union organizing efforts.
<P>
In addition to a strategy of funneling money directly to local
unions, Sweeney's goal is to train 1,000 union organizers over
the next two years to assist AFL-CIO members nationwide.
<P>
Metropolitan areas already have a taste for Sweeney's brand of
activism, and union watchers warn that businesses, as well as
local governments, should prepare for this larger campaign of
&quot;in your face&quot; activity.
<P>
For example, the SEIU and its local unions have tried to disrupt
businesses and local governments in the following manner:
<UL>
<LI>To protest cuts in Washington's budget, Justice for Janitors
(a campaign arm of the SEIU) blocked three main highways during
morning rush hour, delaying commuters for two hours.  Other cities
have also experienced this traffic tactic.
<LI>A Detroit SEIU Local protested the popular North American
International Auto Show because it &quot;portrays life in Detroit
as better than it actually is.&quot;
<LI>Noted real estate developers in major cities, including Atlanta
and Washington, have been targeted by the SEIU's Justice for Janitors
because their agenda demands they pay more of their &quot;fair
share&quot; of taxes.
</UL>

<P>
Sweeney has promised to use the &quot;corporate campaign&quot;
with greater frequency to get concessions at the collective bargaining
table that ordinarily would not be forthcoming without outside
pressure.
<P>
The strategies used by unions in corporate campaigns include targeting
a business with intense media pressure --- both earned media and
paid advertising; thwarting critical business plans by organizing
coalitions around their defeat; filing frivolous charges against
a business with government agencies (local, state and federal);
and helping to pass stock-holder resolutions that promote union
crusades.
<P>
The AFL-CIO and Sweeney can also count on the support of the Clinton
Administration and U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich to aid the
AFL-CIO's resuscitation and agenda.
<P>
Clearly, President Clinton must rebuild bridges with labor and
will show a marked interest in its agenda during the upcoming
election year.  Sweeney has promised to punish all elected officials
-- including Democrats -- who do not support labor's objectives.
<P>
Whether Sweeney will succeed in his new role is questionable at
best.  His grand promises to win labor back the political clout
it once had, while simultaneously adding 250,00 workers to its
membership rolls, appear to be a tough road indeed.
<P>
More importantly:  How much is Sweeney willing to alienate labor
from the general public through the use of militant tactics to
achieve short-term objectives?  Not all of labor's rank and file
agree with Sweeney's tactics.
<P>
As former AFL-CIO president Donahue stated in his keynote address
at the convention where he lost the election:  &quot;We must worry
less about building bridges to the rest of society.  We must enlist
the support of the public, not inconvenience as many as possible.&quot;
<P>
The acceleration of unions' decline could indeed quicken under
the AFL-CIO leadership of Sweeney if he chooses the opposite course.

<title>Kerrigan:  Why state health-care reforms are failing -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<i>November 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2>Why state health-care reforms are failing</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center><hr><P>
 While President and Mrs. Clinton appear to have
put aside their interest in the nation's so-called &quot;health-care
crisis&quot; for now, the issue has not gone away - especially
for small businesses and entrepreneurs struggling to purchase
insurance for themselves and their employees.
<P>
Washington terms such as &quot;employer mandates&quot; &quot;community
rating&quot; and &quot;guaranteed issue&quot; have suddenly become
staple household vocabulary due to television commercials and
radio talk show hosts.  Ad ideological clashes still exist on
how to make health insurance more accessible and affordable for
all Americans.
<P>
The Clinton plan modeled previously enacted state-based reforms
to achieve universal coverage.  Opposing sides of the debate have
each provided their own analysis of what would occur upon implementation
of the state reforms on a national scale.
<P>
According to Clinton plan advocates, health-care heaven-on-earth
would ensue, while critics have claimed a massive case of the
health-care horrors.
<P>
With the passing of another year, though, the results of these
state reforms have become much clearer.  The reforms included
in the Clinton plan have produced distorted consequences for both
policy holders and insurance companies.
<P>
Experts point to two very specific reforms that have caused headaches
for state legislators and governors who believed making everyone
pay the same insurance rates, and letting consumers get insurance
whenever they needed, was sound public policy.
<P>
Community rating and guaranteed issue became the foundation of
these now-failing reforms.  Pure community rating requires that
everyone pay the same premiums for health insurance regardless
of their age or health risks.  So a healthy 28-year-old pays the
same rate as a 58-year-old smoker.
<P>
For most younger people, who have fewer health risks, logical
economic decision-making forces them to drop coverage.  The massive
decrease in policy holders, especially healthy ones, has driven
companies to jack their rates even higher, causing additional
budget-wary consumers to drop insurance.
<P>
Guaranteed issue essentially requires insurance companies to supply
health insurance to all individuals no matter what their medical
disposition at the time.  Under this scenario, the incentive for
individuals to avoid paying for health insurance until they are
confronted with a serious medical problem are clear.
<P>
The increased costs for insurers are substantial and obviously
passed along to consumers in terms of either higher insurance
rates of fewer insurance choices.
<P>
States have not found the promised utopian effect from these reforms.
 Instead, thousands are dropping their health-care plans altogether
because of skyrocketing premium rates.  In effect, fewer people
have health-care insurance and fewer are in the market to purchase
policies because of high rates as well as the incentive to buy
insurance only when needed.
<P>
States now find that health-care accessibility and affordability
problems have become far worse, not better.  For example:
<UL>
<LI> New York imposed community rating on the small and individual
insurance market in 1993.  Since then, several major insurers
simply stopped serving the market altogether, and by some estimates
more than 500,000 New Yorkers dropped their coverage due to skyrocketing
costs.    
</UL>

<P>
The New York Department of Insurance reported that in some cases,
rates for a single, 30-year-old male increased by 170 percent.
<UL>
<LI>In 1992, New Jersey passed guaranteed issue and a phase-in
to pure community rating by 1997.  This summer, more than 100,000
New Jersey also mandates that anyone who wants insurance must
buy one of five state-designated plans.
<LI>In Vermont, The Burlington Free Press is calling for the repeal
of health-care reform enacted several years ago, which included
community rating and guaranteed issue, and prohibited individual
insurers from charging healthy people low rates.
</UL>


<P>
Now, these 7,500 healthy Vermonters who thought they were part
of a safety net are getting hit with a 60 percent rate increase
from Blue Cross.  The result?  They can't afford their health-care
plans so they are hoping state taxpayers will pick up the tab.
<P>
Not all groups appear to be sold on the negative consequences
of such mandates.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
for example, is crafting model state legislation that advances
the implementation of these failed reforms.  According to a recent
draft of the legislation (called the Small Employer and Individual
Health Insurance Availability Act), community rating and guaranteed
issue will be a part of the model act that is supposed to provide
guidance to states.
<P>
Interestingly, the NAIC's draft bill notes that &quot;this act
is not intended to provide a comprehensive solution to the problem
of affordability of health care or health insurance.&quot;
<P>
In the state of Washington, the legislature repealed an entire
health-care reform act due to the market perversions and impact
it had on state policy holders and taxpayers.
<P>
In other states, market-based reforms such as medical savings
accounts - which allow smaller enterprises to pool for insurance
purchases - and state risk pools to capture those who may be uninsured
are the wave of the future.  To date, 30 states have adopted state
risk pools, and 15 have enacted medical savings account legislation.
<P>
Even Washington, D.C., has gotten the message - no heavy-handed
reform bills coming from this Congress.  The primary reform measures
coming from the new Congress are medical savings accounts, purchasing
pools for small employers and the self-employed, the move toward
tax equity for entrepreneurs to allow laid-off employees to keep
their insurance.
<P>
Elected officials at both the state and national level appear
to be listening to their constituents and those who favor market-based
solutions in health-care reform.  But one wonders, will the NAIC
actually have an audience when it comes to presenting its solutions
- after it's finalized the model bill for making health-care more
&quot;available?&quot;

<title>Kerrigan: Superfund Program Needs Its Own Cleanup -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<i>November 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2>Superfund Program Needs Its Own Cleanup</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
 
With broad-based regulatory relief probably on
hold for this year, members of Congress are selecting the most
egregious agencies and programs to reform.
<P>
Superfund  --  a super wast according to its critics  --  is one
such program that has been particularly troublesome to small businesses.
<P>
In its 15-year history, and despite tens of billions of dollars
of both private and public expenditures, only a fraction of the
waste sites targeted by the Environmental Protection Agency under
Superfund have actually been cleaned up.
<P>
The federal government has spent $10 billion on Superfund and
forced private parties to kick in another $80 billion.  According
to a 1994 report in BusinessWeek, only 49 out of 1270 waste sites
&quot;have been completely cleaned up.&quot;
<P>
In theory, the Superfund can be used to clean up a site on the
EPA's National Priority List.  The EPA then tracks down &quot;potentially
responsible parties&quot; and assigns responsibility for waste
site cleanups.
<P>
Often, though, the EPA forces parties to undertake the cleanup
from the start.  Noncompliance without &quot;sufficient cause&quot;
results in a fine of at least $25,000 per day.
<P>
Who are these responsible parties?  Superfund extends the liability
for cleanup to practically any entity that may have a disposed
of waste in the specified EPA site.
<P>
They include large and medium-sized companies.  But they also
include dry cleaners, automobile dealers, butcher shops, pizza
parlors and more.  Nonprofit groups and public entities have also
been caught in the Superfund web -- hospitals, schools and local
governments have been casts as polluters.
<P>
Here are a couple examples of small businesses put under the gun
by the EPA's Superfund program:
<P>
&#183; Formal Ware Rental Services of Tulsa, Okla., was notified
by the EPA that it would be held responsible for the cleanup of
a local Superfund site because it paid someone $14 in 1972 to
haul trash to the site.
<P>
&#183; Bob Novak, owner of the Jolly Butcher Shop, had to fork
over $11,000 originally destined for store improvements, because
the glue from cardboard boxes that he shipped to Ludlow Sanitary
Landfill in New York was deemed hazardous.
<P>
The current liability scheme remains the root of the problem,
according to critics who want to overhaul Superfund.  In determining
liability, the EPA uses illogical criteria.
<P>
Superfund, for example, allows for strict liability that holds
parties accountable regardless of intent or negligence.  The liability
is also retroactive, meaning actions taken before the law was
enacted still apply.  Even if firms were in full compliance of
the law prior to 1980, Superfund still exposes them to liability.
<P>
Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore,
the EPA can require that one business pay for the entire cleanup,
without regard to the degree of its own contribution to the waste
site and without total consideration tot the total number of contributors.
<P>
No concept of fair share exists under Superfund.  A business targeted
 by the EPA for cleanup naturally files lawsuits against other
businesses connected to the waste site.  All parties then tend
to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.
<P>
In addition, the type of waste disposed of by a firm is not factored
into the liability scheme.  A firm depositing fairly innocuous
materials may still be held liable.
<P>
Lawyers benefit handsomely from the Superfund quagmire.  It's
claimed that as much as one-third of Superfund money pays for
legal fees alone.  
<P>
Several congressional committees, including the House Small Business
Committee, are starting their hearings on Superfund reform.
<P>
The &quot;Superfund Liability Equity and Acceleration Act,&quot;
which repeals the law's retroactive liability provisions and replaces
the joint and several liability standard, was recently introduced.
 Parties will be held liable for the amount they contributed and
no more.
<P>
Small businesses and taxpayers may begin to rest easier at night
knowing that the weekly task of putting out the garbage may be
less of a liability with forthcoming congressional action.  Perhaps
the environment will actually get cleaned up as well.

<title>Kerrigan:  Capital Gains Tax Cut Needs Inflation Hedge -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<center>
<i>October 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2> Capital Gains Tax Cut Needs Inflation Hedge</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
A cut in the capital gains tax is almost assured
this year.  Both the House and Senate are committed to the reduction,
and despite President Clinton's &quot;tax cuts for the rich&quot;
rhetoric, even he has hinted at supporting a capital gains tax
cut.  The House has passed legislation reducing the capital gains
tax from its current top level of 28 percent to 19.8 percent and
indexing the rate for inflation.  The measure calls for prospective
indexing (calculated from Jan. 1, 1995) on assets held for at
least three years.
<P>
It's expected that the Senate will pass a similar bill calling
for a 50 percent exclusion on capital gains income.  However,
it's unknown whether the Senate's version will allow taxpayers
to index for inflation.
<P>
According to investment experts and economists who favor cutting
(and eliminating) capital gains taxes, a huge expanse exists between
non-indexed and indexed capital gains tax rates.
<P>
Inflations can be a tax in itself by eroding purchasing power,
savings and investments.  The current nominal capital gains tax
rate is 28 percent.  However, when inflation is factored into
the capital gains equation, the real capital gains tax rate rises
substantially.
<P>
For example, on an investment with a one-year return of 10 percent,
assuming a 3 percent inflation rate, the non-indexed 28 percent
capital gains tax rate jumps to an inflation-adjusted rate of
40 percent.
<P>
Even with the proposed non-indexed rate of 19.8 percent, the real
rate on such an investment leaps to 28.3 percent.  And if inflation
reaches 5 percent, the rate doubles from 19.8 percent to 39.6
percent.
<P>
&quot;Lower rates of return and/or higher rates of inflation will
translate into even higher real capital gains tax rates,&quot;
says Ray Keating, chief economist of the Small Business Survival
Foundation.  &quot;These real capital gains tax rates act as severe
disincentives to investment and entrepreneurship,&quot; Keating
adds.
<P>
Without indexation, the government ends up taxing illusory profits.
 In fact, some individuals can wind up paying taxes on real capital
losses.  That is, after factoring for inflation, a nominal profit
on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor
still pays taxes on the nominal gain.
<P>
An investor's willingness to invest is substantially hindered
by taxing capital gains.  According to Keating and other economists,
indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains
determination  --  equalizing stated and real capital gains tax
rate.
<P>
The lower real rate would reduce uncertainty and generate investment,
economic growth and job creation.
<P>
If non-indexation is so unfair, they why isn't its passage guaranteed
as part of a capital gains tax reduction?  The apparent roadblocks
are money and complexity.
<P>
Although history has shown that reducing capital gains tax rates
actually yields higher revenue for the U.S. Treasury, budget leaders
in the Senate are advocating an agenda of &quot;revenue neutrality&quot;
 -- meaning that for every dollar of tax cuts, a dollar of spending
cuts must be enacted in order to balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
Accordingly, indexing capital gains tax rates for inflation will
cost the government more money, meaning political leaders will
have to cut spending more deeply.
<P>
Opponents also claim that indexing is too complicated for taxpayers
to figure out.  In reality, indexation would require merely one
additional step of multiplication for taxpayers.
<P>
&quot;If taxpayers in Great Britain and Australia can deal with
indexing, I'm sure U.S. taxpayers can as well,&quot; responds
Keating.  Keating adds that if the complexity of indexation is
so troubling to our elected officials, then the most simple reform
is still available -- elimination of the capital gains tax.
<P>
Since late last year, investors have been counting on the capital
gains tax proposal offered by the House.  According to investment
experts, the failure to deliver on the tax cut would be a blow
to capital markets.
<P>
Keating points out that start-up and high-growth companies would
particularly be hurt, noting that the potential returns on high-risk
investments would be lower --- therefore, so would equity prices.
 Trillions of dollars of locked-up capital would not be available
for investment opportunities.
<P>
Venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends
or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding
for entrepreneurial  enterprises.
<P>
More often than not, small-business funding comes from someone
the entrepreneur knows.
<P>
Although lowering capital gains tax rates provides an additional
incentive to investors in prospective high-risk ventures, inflation
still remains a silent force working against an entrepreneurial
boom.
<P>
With a new majority in Congress advocating &quot;tax fairness,&quot;
indexing capital gains for inflation is not only fair, but good
for economic growth as well.

<hr>

October 1995 --  The communications revolution has played a pivotal role in how America does business and impacts the personal lives of most Americans.  As Congress looks for ways to reduce the federal deficit, a debate has surfaced over the use of our nation's airwaves -- otherwise known as the "spectrum." 
<P>
Only twenty years ago, the average person could probably only identify a few uses of the spectrum -- namely broadcast television and  radio.  With technological advancements, though, have come more uses of the spectrum.  For example satellite TV, wireless computer networks and cellular phones all utilize the nation's airwaves.  And, the technological boom has caused the spectrum to jump in value.
<P>
Recognizing a handsome revenue source for the federal government, Congress in 1993 mandated that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction all licenses for new spectrum uses.   Recent auctions for the Personal Communications Services spectrum have raised more than $8 billion.  And, as budgetary pressures continue to bear down on the 104th Congress, spectrum auctions are being closely examined because of their revenue potential.
<P>
House and Senate Commerce Committees in the 104th Congress have been charged with raising $14 billion to help balance the budget by 2002.  Over the past several weeks, congressional hearings have revealed several areas that can be targeted to meet these tight revenue requirements.
<P>
A controversial but lucrative target for auctions are the airwaves now set-a-side for television broadcasters to develop high-definition television (HDTV).  In 1991, the FCC allocated six megahertz of extra spectrum for the broadcasters to make the transition to HDTV.  
<P>
After the switch, the broadcasters would then hand back their current channel, now used for analog TV transmission.  	But technology and the market outsmarted bureaucrats in Washington.  With technological gains, broadcasters can now provide digital (but not high definition) television utilizing a fraction of the airwaves.  In other words, rather than providing just one channel of HDTV, the broadcasters have the capability for multiple channels of digital television, while leaving space for other lucrative services.      
    
<P>
While the broadcasters still maintain that they will continue to develop HDTV with the allocated airwaves, they have also asked for "spectrum flexibility."
<P>
The flexibility will allow them to use the extra airwaves for any number of telecommunications services:  Six new channels of television, or 72 compact-disc quality radio signals, or cellular phone services, or interactive data services, or they can mix and match.
<P>
This proposal, however, does not sit well with telecommunication companies that have been required to purchase airwaves through auctions.  They view spectrum flexibility for broadcasters as a special government giveaway.
<P>
In a recent letter to Congress, the president of Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), Thomas A. Wheeler, expressed "shock and dismay as the broadcasters seek to ram through the Congress a special deal" that allows them to obtain new spectrum for free, while the wireless industry has had to pay $8 billion.
<P>
Like the broadcasters, members of CTIA did receive their initial spectrum allocation for free, but all subsequent wireless telecommunications spectrum has been acquired through auctions.    The broadcasters claim that they have been singled out, and the government has plenty of warehoused spectrum that should be auctioned off first before the broadcasting industry is disrupted.
<P>
The broadcasters also weigh in with their public-service responsibilities as an argument to exempt them from auctions.  And, they claim financial hardship in competing with other telecommunication industry players.
<P>
"If the spectrum earmarked for the transition to digital is auctioned, it will destroy the ability of local television stations to stay in business as the communications market moves to digital technology," Robert Wright, CEO of NBC, told the Senate Commerce Committee.     
<P>
Faye Anderson, Executive Director of the Council of 100, a national network of African-American Republicans, questions the broadcasters' claim of financial hardship, and the assertion that the government is sitting on a valuable reserve of spectrum.
<P>
Anderson points to the multi-billion dollar deals involving Disney's purchase of ABC/Cap Cities, and Westinghouse's bid for CBS to counter the argument that the broadcasters will not be able to compete in spectrum auctions because of a lack of capital.
<P>
Just how much money can be raised from the sale of the HDTV airwaves?    According to John Reidy, a managing director at the brokerage firm Smith Barney, Inc., who testified before the Senate Commerce Committee, $30 billion could go to the U.S. Treasury from the auctions.  Other experts say $30 billion is conservative.
<P>
With other important matters budgetary matters before Congress (such Medicare and welfare reform), industry observers and advocacy organizations are carefully following the spectrum issue as a barometer for "true change" in the Congress.

<title>SBB: Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2> Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase </h2>                                                     </center><hr>



September 1995 - Almost three years ago, then presidential candidate Bill Clinton stated that increasing the minimum wage is "the wrong way to raise the incomes of low-wage earners."  The wrong way back then, but the right way now as increasing the minimum wage is viewed as a politically popular strategy to reconnect with the Democrat's traditional base of working class Americans.
<P>
While most economists agree that minimum wage increases do more economic harm than good (both for workers and the economy), President Clinton has proposed a 21 percent increase from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour.
<P>
Democratic party leaders in the Congress are also working feverishly to include a minimum wage hike into welfare reform proposals, presumably to be acted upon this fall.
<P>
Studies conducted over the past 25 years have consistently concluded that with each 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, a corresponding 1 percent to 2 percent decline in entry-level employment results.  The General Accounting Office, the Brookings Institution, the Employment Policies Institute Foundation, the Congressional Budget Office and various Presidential Commission's have all reached this universal conclusion.
<P>
Even the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the "New Democrat" organization once led by the President, declared that "the minimum wage can be allowed to fade into history."
    <P>
As minimum wage hike proponents pose the issue as improving the living wage of lower-income workers, most businesses and their workers view minimum wage jobs as entry-level positions -- by which the majority of workers gain skills to move onto higher-paying work.
<P>
An independent study in 1992 demonstrated that within a 12 month period, 63 percent of American workers at the minimum wage earned higher wages.   Not surprisingly, about half of minimum wage employees were either young adults under the age of 21, or teenagers.
<P>
According to a study by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank in Washington, D.C., raising the minimum wage emotionally appeals to most Americans, but doing it would be a mistake.
<P>
According to the foundation study:
<P><ul>
<li>Raising the minimum wage will harm the nonworking poor by raising prices and destroying entry-level job opportunities.
<li>Raising the minimum wage does not generally help low-income households -- the increased income from minimum wage jobs would mostly go to families far above the poverty level, not to poor minimum wage workers.
<li>Employers will respond to a minimum wage increase by cutbacks in hiring, reducing workers' hours, or lowering pay and benefits and skipping pay raises -- responses that hurt, not help, workers.
<li>A $5.15 increase in the minimum wage will result in approximately 400,000 lost entry-level jobs.  A wage increase may result in more skilled workers being enticed into the job market, but fewer unskilled job opportunities (entry-level jobs) would be available.</ul>         
<P>
Grant Maloy, a small business operator from Orlando, Fl., testified earlier in the year before the Joint Economic Committee on the President's proposal to raise the minimum wage.  As the owner of a wholesale foliage nursery, Maloy stated that his industry pays $5.24 for entry-level work, well above the minimum wage.
<P>
"Wages have increased because of pressure both within the industry and from other industries, as well as the need to keep quality employees.  How is it possible that one central government can know what millions of businesses can afford to pay?  The answer is they can't," says Maloy.
<P>
According to Maloy, minimum wage policy is insincere.  While the government expects a business owner to pay a minimum wage, the owner himself may be making much less.  Maloy estimated that he was making about $2.00 an hour when he started his business.
<P>
Surveys of the American public continue to show widespread support for increasing the minimum wage, and in 1989 Congress overwhelmingly backed the last minimum wage increase -- more than 90 percent voted in favor of the hike.
<P>
Political experts agree that if a proposal to increase the minimum wage makes its way to the House or Senate floor for a vote, it may pass.  No member in Congress wants to be labeled as "anti-worker" despite the widespread research showing the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage on those it purportedly is supposed to help.
<P>
On the other hand, the public's dissatisfaction with Washington and misguided government attempts to solve every problem may indeed resonate with the minimum wage issue as well.
<P>
More importantly however, is how the public will view the President's proposal.  Is the President proposing to raise the minimum wage to truly help the working poor?  Or will the public perceive his proposal as a political ploy to gain votes in 1996.
<P>
What remains certain though, is the growing universal belief that the minimum wage does little for increasing job opportunities for those who need it most.

<title>SBB:  FDA's Stubborn Inefficiency is Killing Business and Jobs                                                                                                </title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center>
<h2>FDA's Stubborn Inefficiency is Killing Business and Jobs</h2>                                                 </center>
<HR>
September 1995 -- The 104th Congress is leaving no stone unturned in terms of its examination of federal government agencies.  OSHA, EPA, IRS, FBI, ATF, EEOC, and other agencies are being probed for inefficiency and counterproductive impact on American business.
<P>
Included in this review is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -- long held in high regard by the American public.
<P>
The FDA has squandered its goodwill with the industries it regulates, as well as with patient groups and politicians from Democratic and Republican camps for its growing inefficiency and unaccountability.  One major criticism, concerns FDA's severe shortcomings in approving new drugs and medical devices.
<P>
Breakthrough medical devices, for example, face lengthy approval times.  Although FDA guidelines maintain that the approval process is supposed to be completed within 180 days, independent studies have revealed that actual approval periods take anywhere from 437 to 840 days.
<P>
In testimony before the House Joint Economic Committee in 1994, Robert DeHaven of the American Electronics Association (AEA) testified that the FDA's "inordinately slow" regulatory process was threatening "the global competitiveness" of the medical device industry -- a $70 billion industry with more than 11,000 companies.
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the AEA found that 40 percent of medical device firms reduced their number of U.S. employees because of FDA delays, 29 percent boosted investment in foreign operations, and 22 percent moved U.S. jobs out of the country.
<P>
Robert Higgs, in a report for the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), notes that medical technology firms invested about $321-$333 million abroad annually from 1989 to 1991.  In 1992, though, "when the FDA abruptly made its enforcement and approval policies more onerous, capital outflow jumped more than 200 percent to $993 million."  
<P>
Along with the export of capital to international shores goes American innovation, entrepreneurship, high-paying jobs and our best growth industries say critics.
<P>
"The FDA seems more intent on exporting American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, rather than encouraging the production of U.S.-made drugs and medical devices," says Raymond Keating, chief economist with the Small Business Survival Committee.
<P>
U.S. pharmaceutical companies also face the same regulatory maze and bureaucratic gridlock as medical device companies.  Although established drug companies have learned how to deal with the FDA's red tape, longer approval periods mean higher development costs, which translate into higher drug prices for consumers.
<P>
Between 1986 and 1993, the median approval time for generic drug applications increased from 12 months to 38 months.  These time periods exclude FDA requirements placed on firms that extend development time.
<P>
In a study conducted by researchers at Tufts University for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,  drugs originating here often are available in foreign markets many years before becoming availability in the U.S.  For example, of all drugs approved in the U.S., 12 percent had been available in foreign markets for six to 10 years, and another 9 percent for more than a decade.
<P>
Despite the drug approval lag, safety does not appear to be enhanced in the U.S.  According to the Tufts study, although Great Britain gets drugs to market quicker that the U.S., safety discontinuations as a percentage of total new drug introductions are similar in each country -- 4 percent in Great Britain and 3 percent in the U.S.
<P>
As reports and criticism mount against the FDA, its staff and defenders contend that the agency is in dire need of more funds to keep up with its workload.  A look at the FDA's budget growth over the years shows that from 1989 to 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 52.6 percent -- or by an average annual real rate of more than 10.5 percent.  FDA's 1994 budget was just more than $900 million.
<P>
During those same years, the number  of employees grew by a substantial 25.3 percent, totaling more than 9,000.   Critics claim American taxpayers are paying more to get less.
<P>
Of course, a multitude of other industries are impacted by FDA regulation:  food, cosmetic, restaurant, retail druggist, manufacturers of medical devices and now the tobacco  industry has its own gripes about the FDA's heavy-handedness.
<P>
The key for Congress is balancing the concerns of the American public that the FDA preserve and protect the public health, with the concerns of business that the FDA's inefficiency has gone to far -- costing Americans jobs, as well as access to breakthrough drugs and medical devices.
<P>
Critics claim that FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler has spent too much time on aggressive enforcement and investigation of businesses rather than cooperating with the industries he regulates to move the approval process along in a timely manner.
<P>
Former FDA officials also cite Commissioner Kessler's obsession with regulating tobacco at the expense of other agency responsibilities.   A former chief FDA investigator sent a letter to the U.S. House Commerce Committee stating that, for example, the FDA's foreign inspection program was a "disaster waiting to happen."
<P>
According to a Washington, D.C. newspaper, the same official said that he attempted to meet with and contact Kessler several times on important matters " and was told by his secretary that if my topic was anything other than cigarettes, the commissioner would have no time for me."        
<P>
    With the FDA under attack from industry, Congress and patients groups who want faster approval times for life-saving drugs and medical devices, the agency may begin to change course and reinvent itself.   However, under mounting criticism from these constituencies, Congress itself may devise an FDA reform bill that forces  Kessler and his staff to put their time and resources into more productive efforts that save lives, American jobs and entire industries.

<title>Time to cut the fat out of Davis-Bacon Act</title>
</head>

<h2>Time to cut the fat out of Davis-Bacon Act</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
August 1995 - Early this summer, the National Policy Forum, a Washington-based
Republican think tank, released its Agenda for Small Business  --- a seven-point plan to ensurethe vitality and prosperity of the small-business, entrepreneurial sector.  The plan includes tax and regulatory relief, capital access measures, tort reform and several other proposals near and dear to small business.<p>
Item No. 7 on NPF's agenda is a very specific reform aimed at helping small businesses compete for federally funded construction projects.  It calls for the elimination of the Davis-Bacon Act.<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act mandates that a "prevailing wage" be paid to all workers on
federally funded construction projects in excess of $2,000.  The U.S. Department of Labor sets these wage rates for thousands of job classifications in scores of regions across the country.<p>
The Coalition to Repeal Davis-Bacon, a coalition of nearly 70 organizations ranging from the National School Boards Association to Citizens Against Government Waste, claims that prevailing wage rates are vastly inflated and generally reflect union rates.<p>
And the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 1995 that the Davis-Bacon act raises construction costs by at least $2.7 billion over five years.<p>
What's more, according to David Thompson, a Washington attorney specializing in labor law, Davis-Bacon creates an artificial market in which only large companies can compete.<p>
"Excessive paperwork requirements, arbitrary work rules and classifications and bloatedpay scales block access for small companies.  The law creates an unrealistic environment in which small local companies cannot afford to participate," says Thompson.<p>
Union leaders say wage rates set by the Labor Department do reflect market wage rates.  However, an investigative report done by the state of Oklahoma suggests that the wage surveying process itself may be corrupt.<p>
The report concludes that fraudulent wage data was submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor to "influence the outcome of U.S. Department of Labor wage surveys and, consequently, to take advantage of the taxpayers."<p>
In the voluntary wage-surveying process, any group or individual can submit completed
projects to help the Labor Department make its wage decisions.  In one example of fraud, asurvey claimed that 20 employees, compensated at $21.05 per hour, worked on a $2 million underground storage tank.  The investigation found that tank was never built.<p>
According to Oklahoma officials, if this type of fraudulent practice is occurring in one
place, it's probably occurring in others.<p>
"The prevailing wage law is premised on the false assumption that the government can
accurately determine what wage is prevailing.  There's no reasonable way to obtain true
prevailing wage information and therefore the entire system must be scrapped," says Ike Casey, executive vice president of Independent Electrical Contractors Inc.<p>
Members of Congress who support repealing Davis-Bacon contend that the market is the best determinant of wage rates.  That's why efforts for repeal are quickly moving through the House and Senate.  Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) has pushed a repeal bill through the Labor and Human Resources Committee, while legislation moving through the House is on an identical track.<p>
Repealing the Davis-Bacon will not be easy.  Labor unions and other beneficiaries of
Davis-Bacon will aggressively lobby Congress with a very effective argument  --- a vote to repeal Davis-Bacon is a vote to "cut our wages."<p>
Labor unions believe keeping Davis-Bacon is in all workers' interest, while supporters of
repeal feel it protects a privileged few at the expense of taxpayers.<p>

<title>A New Test For Independent Contractors</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>A New Test For Independent Contractors</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
August 1995 - There is plenty about the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that raises the ire of small business owners and entrepreneurs.  The 20-factor test utilized by the IRS to delineate between independent contractors and employees is one such issue causing both confusion and agitation.<p>
Clarifying the status of independent contractors has long been a concern for small
businesses and the self-employed.  The need for the IRS to provide a more concise, objective standard for independent contractors was the priority issue voted on by thousands of delegates at The White House Conference on Small Business earlier this summer.<p>
Rep. Linda Smith (R-Wash.), chairman of the Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance of the Small Business Committee, recently held hearings on the complexity of the issue as well as proposed legislation to amend the criteria used by the IRS.<p>
"For too long, the IRS has been retarding job growth and business expansion because of fear it will re-classify independent contractors as employees," said Smith in announcing her hearings.<p>
Rep. Jon Christensen (R-Neb.) agrees with Rep. Smith, and testified on legislation he
sponsored, the Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act -- a bill to modify and simplify the 20-factor test.<p>
"Almost everyone will agree that the 20-factor test is unclear and far too subjective.  It is quite possible to take two seemingly identical situations and find employee status in one, and independent contractor in another.  Nevertheless, in recent years the IRS has bludgeoned small businesses over the head with the 20-factor test," said Christensen.<p>

     Indeed many individuals who prefer to work as independent contractors have had their status challenged by the IRS.  Even though it may be an individual's choice to work autonomously, the test used by the IRS may re-classify them as an employee, causing back-taxes and penalties for the business contracting with the individual.<p> 
According to one recent study, the IRS has reclassified 439,000 independent workers
since the mid-1980s, resulting in the collection of $678 million in taxes and fines.  The IRS simply states that it is only doing a very tough job -- it attributes about $2 billion in lost revenues to employers who wrongly misclassify workers.<p>
Christensen's bill would not eliminate the 20-factor test, but simply provides an
alternative for those who comply with all income reporting requirements.  Rather than attempting to determine who is an employee, Christensen's legislation defines who is not an employee.<p>
"It establishes distinct, clear and objective criteria for those seeking to perform services as an independent contractor," says Christensen.<p>
The three-part test established by Christensen requires that an independent contractor
demonstrate independence, investment in his or her business, and a written agreement between the parties.<p>
While Part Three of the test, Contract, is easy to establish, demonstrating independence and investment each have several sub-tests.  The independent contractor is required to meet only one criterion of the sub-tests to satisfy that portion of the test. <p>  
For example, Part One of the three-part test is Investment.  The individual would have to satisfy one of the following sub-tests to satisfy Part One.  Does the individual:<p>
(1)  have a significant investment in training or assets; or<br>
(2)  incur significant unreimbursed expenses; or<br>
(3)  agree to work for a specific time or complete a specific result, and is liable for<br>
damages for failure to perform; or<br>
(4)  receive compensation primarily on a commission basis; or<br>
(5)  purchase a product for resale?<p>     
Under Part Two of the test, the independent contractor would also be required to meet 
one of several subtests to satisfy his or her independence.  <p>
If, however, the independent contractor and the business for whom services are being
provided do not comply with income reporting rules, the 20-factor test would apply to their business relationship.<p>
Acknowledging problems with worker classification, the IRS has developed reforms of
its own to deal with the controversial issue.  On August 2, it released a set of initiatives.<p>
"I've spent a lot of time talking with small businesses who believe this is a big
problem...We can do better, and will do better in handling worker classification issues," said IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson in a statement.<p>
In order to improve the administration of worker classification, the IRS would provide
greater training for their auditors, consolidate the review process when employers challenge the status of worker determinations, and better coordinate national enforcement to ensure consistency of worker classification by industry and region.  Anything else, says the IRS, can only be implemented through legislation.<p>
Critics contend the IRS initiatives are weak and meaningless.<p>
"I'm very concerned that the administrative programs the IRS may wish to strengthen, are actually part of the problem because there are still no clear rules for implementing them," said Chairman Smith.<p>
As technology and corporate downsizing continue to shape the independent workforce, the IRS will eventually be forced to simplify and clarify the status of independent contractors.  If the IRS doesn't, it will literally take an act of Congress to change the bias against independent contractors.  That change, is well under way.<p>

<title>OSHA Has Forgotten its Original Purpose</title>

<h2>OSHA Has Forgotten its Original Purpose</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
July 1995 - Business owners who've experienced an OSHA inspection get very emotional when talking about the government agency whose job it is to ensure that America's workplaces are safe and hazard-free.  According to many of these businesses, inspectors create a no-win situation by playing a "gothcha-game," with OSHA finding fault no matter how safe the work environment.<p>
Critics of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) claim that the agency has
completely turned away from advising on, and promoting workplace safety and health.  OSHA, claims business, is a complete adversary of business.<p>
According to Rep. Cass Ballenger (R-NC), Chairman of the Workforce Protections
Committee of the U.S. House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, OSHA's mission is enforcement driven -- find violations and issue penalties.<p>  
"In my view, nothing illustrates how OSHA has gone off the track more clearly than the
fact that today few, if any, employers would ever call OSHA and ask for assistance or advice on workplace safety or health," said Ballenger when introducing H.R. 1834, an OSHA reform bill. <p>
Called the "Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Act of 1995," Ballenger
thoroughly aims to change the way OSHA operates.<p>
A key reform of H.R. 1834 allows businesses to correct violations found by OSHA,
without paying a penalty when the citation is issued.  If a business fails to take corrective action, only then will a fine result -- not the situation today.<p>   
"It does not matter whether the violation is not threatening to any employees.  Nor does it matter whether the employer knew of the regulation -- he or she is presumed to know all of what is printed in the Federal Register, and the unending "compliance directives" from Washington," said Ballenger.<p>
Many businesses hire OSHA consultants in preparation for an inspection.  Even so,
inspectors generally find something wrong and a monetary fine is usually issued.  This is unfair according to Ballenger, and under his plan OSHA will work with employers to identify and correct hazards.<p>
Ballenger's subcommittee recently began holding hearings on OSHA reform, and heard from both supporters and detractors of  H.R. 1834.  Business organizations were extremely supportive of the measure, while representatives from organized labor were not pleased.<p>
Thomas Donahue, Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO ripped apart the measure by
calling it a "cruel and regressive measure that puts workers' lives in danger."<p>
"It [H.R. 1834] presumes that employers will act responsibly on their own, without
government oversight or intervention, in the best interest of workers, despite a long history demonstrating this not be the case for many employers," testified Donahue.<p>
Ballenger's bill does not remove enforcement, but shifts the balance 50-50 with non-enforcement efforts to be phased-in over three years.<p>
Expansion of non-enforcement programs in H.R. 1834 include:<p>
<ul>
<li>State consultation grant programs for on-site assistance to small businesses in high hazard industries.
<li>Increasing OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP)  -- which recognizes employers with exemplary safety programs and records, and grants exemptions from enforcement inspections.
<li>An emphasis on training and education to promote safe work practices for both
employers and employees.
<li>A new certification program to allow individuals to conduct workplace inspections.  A
business would not be inspected by OSHA as long as the business remained 
accident-free and had no employee complaints.<p></ul>
The Clinton Administration has also heard an earful from both employers and members
of Congress regarding OSHA's heavy hand.  In response to political pressure, and criticism from the business community, OSHA lowered financial penalty rates that were vastly increased by Labor Secretary Robert Reich.  OSHA assistant secretary Joseph Dear will not pursue controversial ergonomic rules which the agency has been preparing for years.<p>  
And, the Administration has put forward its own reform initiative that would "reinvent"
OSHA.  While recognizing the need for changes in OSHA, President Clinton believes
Republican plans go way beyond reform. <p>
"They're [Republicans] not trying to reform the system of worker protection as we are,
but instead to dismantle it," said Clinton.<p>
The Congress is scheduled to have more hearings on OSHA reform -- not soon enough for business groups who must deal with sometimes silly and outrageous regulations. <p>
The National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA), for example, has its own top-ten list of "favorite" roofing regulations.  Eight out of ten are OSHA inflicted.  For example, OSHA's rules:<p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibits gum chewing while roofing. 
<li>Require the posting of signs saying respirators are required even when they are not. 
<li>Require employers to train employees on hazards of exposure to deadly materials like chalk, lumber and dishwashing detergent.
<li>Fines employer if a roofer smokes on the job. <p></ul>
...and the list continues.<p>
According to Washington business leaders, the time has come to reform OSHA.  Craig
Brightup, Vice President of Government Relations at NRCA, says changes are long overdue.<p>
"Over the past 20 years, the very foundation of OSHA has held business completely in
the pejorative. They believe business cannot be trusted to implement meaningful health and safety programs themselves, and this is simply not true," says Brightup.<p>   
According to Brightup, H.R. 1834 is designed to reward and support businesses who
make a good faith effort, which most employers do.
While everyone, except organized labor, believe OSHA must be reformed, the question
remains as to how far the President will go to make the agency less burdensome.  With the '96 election cycle moving quickly upon us, the Administration needs the support of labor at the ballot box making business groups wary of the President's intentions.<p>

<title>Is It Time to Eliminate the Commerce Department?</title>
</head>
<center>
<h2>Is it Time to Eliminate the Commerce Department?</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
July 1995 - Former Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher recently referred to his old Department as "nothing more than a hall closet where you throw in everything that you don't know what to do with."  Presumably, Washington budget-cutters agree and have decided that its time to clean out the Department of Commerce's closet. <p>
The U.S. House and Senate recently passed balance budget resolutions that would erase the deficit in seven years.   The budget-cutting ax has been broadly wielded, cutting and eliminating many government programs and agencies which have traditionally  benefitted American business.  The Department of Commerce is one such program targeted for elimination by both the House and Senate budget plans.<p>
The Commerce Department has long been a target of conservative budget cutters who see the department as wasteful, inefficient and duplicative of other programs.<p>
The government's own watchdog agency, the Government Accounting Office (GAO),
uncharitably describes Commerce as well.  GAO reports that the department "faces the most complex web of divided authorities" sharing its "mission with at least 71 federal department, agencies and offices."  More than 60 percent of its budget is allotted to programs entirely unrelated to its mission.<p>
Legislation proposed in the House and Senate would eliminate most  of Commerce, while transferring, consolidating and privatizing its useful functions.  Rep. Dick Chrysler (R-Mich.) recently introduced "The Department of Commerce Dismantling Act of 1995" in the House, while Sens. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) and Lauch Faircloth (R-NC) introduced a companion bill in the Senate.<p>
"This is not just a reckless effort to slash programs for the sake of cutting government," said Chrysler.  Chrysler chaired a three month effort in the House to study and examine the Commerce Department.<p>
"If we found that a program was duplicative, we consolidated it.  If a program was better performed by the private sector, we privatized it.  If it was beneficial, we streamlined it," added Chrysler.<p>
In addition, programs found wasteful were eliminated.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that both Senate and House Commerce Department elimination measures would save taxpayers more than $7.765 billion over five years.<p>
What parts of Commerce would be eliminated, while others salvaged under the
Department of Commerce Dismantling Act of 1995?  Highlights include:<p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative functions of Commerce and the Office of the Secretary, General Counsel and Inspector General -- eliminated.  <b>Estimated savings -- $250 million.</b>
<li>Minority Business Development Agency -- eliminated.  Found to be duplicative of the functions of the Small Business Administration and private sector.<b>  Estimated savings -- $1.139 billion.</b>
<li>United States Travel and Tourism Administration -- eliminated.  Promotional activities already considered performed by the private sector, states, localities and public sector organizations.<b>  Estimated savings -- $75 million.</b>
<li>Technology Administration.  Gone are programs that specifically fund applied research  programs, and invest taxpayer dollars in new technology promotion.  The National Technical Information Service is privatized while the weights and measure functions of the National Institutes for Standards and Technology is transferred to the National Science Foundation.<b> Estimated Savings -- $1.872 billion.</b>
<li>Patent and Trade Office.  Transferred to Justice Department and supported through fees.<b>Estimated Savings -- $375 million.</b>
<li>Economic and Statistics Administration.  Bureau of Census transferred to Justice.  Bureau of Economic Analysis transferred to the Federal Reserve System. <b> Estimated Savings: $827 million.</b>
<li>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which accounts for more than 40 percent of Commerce's budget, would have its various functions privatized and
transferred to more appropriate agencies. <b> Estimated savings:  $2.338 billion.</b>
<li>Export and Trade Administration functions would largely be transferred to the Office of Trade Representative while other miscellaneous duties eliminated.  <b>Estimated savings -- $385 million.</b></ul><p>                   
The threat of closing Commerce's door has not brought with it a firestorm of protest from the Washington business lobby.  While some business leaders see the elimination of Commerce as the price to pay for a more fiscally sound government, others have remained silent on the prospects of its closure. <p>
A recent private survey conducted by Business Week magazine, however, found that 69 percent of  business CEO's  it polled favored eliminating the department.<p>
Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown remains the biggest advocate of preserving the
department.  In his efforts to save Commerce, Brown contends that the department is crucial to business and U.S. competitiveness.  Brown also believes that eliminating Commerce would leave a void for business in the Administration.<p>
"These plans to cut Commerce would eliminate business' voice at the Cabinet table just when we have created the most successful public-private partnership relationship in history," remarked Brown.<p>
Critics of  the Clinton Administration do not view Brown's presence during Cabinet
meetings as having been beneficial for business.<p>
Richard Rahn, Chairman of the Business Leadership Council remarked that "It's a sad commentary on the Clinton Administration when only one cabinet member thinks he represents the interests of business.   Secretary Brown is a spokesman for only a fraction of the business community.  All Cabinet members should have a shared agenda of economic growth and job creation through policies that include lower taxes and reduced regulations, a real pro-business agenda -- an agenda we have not seen from Mr. Brown or the Clinton Administration." <p>
With hardly a whimper from the business community to keep the doors of Commerce open, elimination may happen.  But President Clinton and Secretary Brown have made several political friends through Commerce Department activities (such as private trade missions abroad) and may ask those who benefitted to turn up the heat on Congress to stop its door from shutting for good.<p>

<title>SBB:  Worker Database Could Cost Businesses Billions</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h2>Worker Database Could Cost Businesses Billions</h2>
<p>
</center>

<hr>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- Nearly 4 million illegal aliens are living permanently in the United States. In response to a growing problem, momentum is building in Congress to create a national worker database which would verify the employment eligibility of all U.S. citizens and eligible immigrants.<p>

	Critics of the proposed system have voiced concern that a worker registry would cost taxpayers billions while adding an expensive regulatory condition on U.S. businesses.<p>

	At a time when elected officials are aiming to lift regulatory burdens on U.S. business, the critics say a worker registry would create more paperwork, cause more delays interfere with hiring decisions and spawn legal concerns because of unchartered civil rights issues.<p>

	The national worker registry was recommended by the Commission on Immigration Reform -- more widely known as the Jordan Commission -- chaired by former Rep. Barbara Jordan. The worker registry would be created by merging the databases of the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).<p>

	Legislation proposed by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, would require employers to call the worker registry system to verify that an applicant is legally authorized to work.<p>

	A forthcoming proposal in the House by Lamar Smith (R-TX) is expected to call for the establishment of a national worker identity card. The ID system would consist of a single tamper-proof card modeled after the social security card.<p>

	The Clinton administration has favored such an approach, as well as the national computer registry. In his proposed 1996 budget, President Clinton included $28 million to start integrating various government databases so the work registry can be developed.<p>

	The administration has also been testing its own program, the Telephone Verification System (TVS). With this system, businesses would be required to purchase special equipment to comply with worker verification.<p>

	For two years, nine companies have participated in the TVS project. The companies call
the INS to verify that non-citizens who apply for work are eligible for employment. A review of this project found that the INS could not accurately rely on the computer information 28 percent of the time and had to perform a manual search of its records.<p>

	According to a special report by the Justice Department, which evaluated the TVS project, secondary verifications were very burdensome to employers. Businesses, which already complain about the burdensome nature of the current employee verification system (the I-9 form), would have more forms to complete as part of the hiring process with a national computer registry. Employers would have to maintain authorization receipts on each employee they check through the new system. Employees subject to secondary verification will require yet another form.<p>

	Of serious concern to business groups and those involved with civil liberty issues, is the federal government's ability to competently manage the immense database. Accuracy of data will be critical to making the registry work, and both the INS and SSA have been widely criticized for inaccuracy in record keeping.<p>

	In California, for example, the INS admitted it lost 60,000 green-card applicant files. And the INS has experienced error rates as high as 30 percent. SSA has estimated that cleaning up its database would initially cost $122 million, and each year thereafter $30 million to maintain.<p>

	According to a 1988 General Accounting Office report, of about 210 million Social Security numbers active "at least 75 percent issued without proof of the individual's identity or citizenship."<p>

	With 65 million Americans changing jobs or entering the job market each year, even a 1 percent failure rate could be problematic -- 650,000 workers could be affected by even minimal errors.<p>

	In addition, those concerned about privacy have speculated that a centralized system would spur the government to include more information about individuals.<p>

	A key feature of the proposed is a monitoring system that tracks which companies access the system. The government would then have the ability to track business's hiring practices, as well as the individual employment history of every American.<p>

	With other major issues before the Congress such as deficit reduction and tax cuts, the proposed national worker registry has received little attention from the news media or the Congressional leadership in either the House and Senate. However, as such legislation makes it way through committees in both chambers, more Members of Congress are beginning to pay attention to the ramifications of a centralized worker registry.<p>

	Will Congress enact a data system affecting 100 percent of the population to combat the problem of 1.5 percent who live in the United States illegally.<p>

	Given the momentum to limit the size and scope of the federal government, the worker registry will indeed be put through a rigorous examination process in Congress. As more business groups learn about the proposed system, the debate will become even more rigorous.<p>

<title>SBB: The Consumers Added to the Equation of Health Care Reform </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2> The Consumers Added to the Equation of Health Care Reform </h2>                                                     </center><hr>



 June 1995 - This time last year, small business organizations were fighting against President and Mrs. Clinton's plan to radically overhaul our nation's health care system. The employer mandate, the centerpiece of the failed proposal, did not sit well with small businesses.  The "crisis" rhetoric seems to have toned down, but high health care costs along with the inability of many businesses to provide health care for their employees still remains a priority issue for our  nation's smaller employers.
<P>
The magnitude of the problem was recently confirmed at the White House Conference on Small Business where nearly two thousands elected delegates from all corners of the country gathered in Washington from June 12-15 to develop a national small business agenda for the Clinton Administration and Congress.  The dominant health care issue was tax equity.  Small businesses and the self-employed only want what corporations already have -- the ability to deduct 100 percent of their health care insurance expenses.
<P>
Is health care reform dead under the leadership of the new Republican controlled Congress?  The answer is no.  But rather than big government schemes and mandates, health care proposals are emerging from the new Congress that are more market-based.  One idea, that has been tried and tested in the private sector is tax free Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).  The concept has taken Capitol Hill by storm, and it seems that all serious proposals to reform our nation's health care cost problem include an MSA provision.

<P><b>Health Care's "Sick" Underlying Structure</b><P>
   The MSA, say its supporters, will re-establish the buyer-seller relationship between consumers and suppliers of health care services.  Under the predominant third-party system of payments, neither consumers nor providers have an incentive to be concerned about costs.  Therefore, costs naturally rise.
<P>
The two veins to the third party system, government involvement in the health care market (especially since the inception of Medicaid and Medicare) and an expanded definition of "insurance," have perverted health care costs while shielding the health care industry from real market forces that produce competition.   By definition, insurance is supposed to cover catastrophic and unforeseen events.  Today, health insurance plans cover small and predicable expenses.
<P>
Such an expansion of the definition of health insurance, says Small Business Survival Foundation Chief Economist Raymond Keating, "would be the equivalent of extending one's home-owners insurance to cover the costs of mowing the lawn, trimming bushes and painting the house."
<P>
Third-party payments have drastically increased over the past three decades.  In 1950, for example, government financed 25.3 percent of health care expenditures, private insurance 15.8 percent, and 58.9 percent was covered out of pocket.  According to the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</I>, by 1991, government financed expenditures equalled 43.9 percent, private insurance and other private sources 36.9 percent, and only 19.2 percent was out of pocket.  
The effect of the usurpation of the buyer-seller relationship has been steadily rising costs.  For example, per capita U.S. health care expenditure between 1965 and 1991 increased by 1,306 percent, versus a rise in the consumer index of 332 percent.

<P><b>Medical Savings Accounts</b><P>	The most common MSA scenario would shift standard health care plans to a split system of an MSA combined with a catastrophic plan.  A standard plan costing $5,000, for example, could be replaced with $3,000 going into an employee's MSA and $2,000 covering a catastrophic plan with a $3,000 deductible.
<P>
The employee withdraws funds from the MSA, penalty free, to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses.  Since the employee now has an established "budget" and is able to keep what he or she does not use by year-end, the employee has an incentive to comparison shop for health care purchases and needs.  As consumers become more concerned with costs, MSA supporters contend that health care providers are forced to be more cost sensitive in pricing health care services -- in other words real competition will be injected into the health care market.
<P>
According to Dan Perrin, Executive Director of the Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care, a 1.6 million member coalition of business organizations that support MSAs, lower income individuals would especially benefit from the reform.  "Under the current system, most people must shell out money until they reach their $500 deductible.  With an MSA, employees have immediate access to funds, easing financial concerns which makes them more happy," says Perrin.
<P>
The MSA account is also owned by the employee, and therefore portable.  Individuals can also build savings in their MSA accounts, which in turn helps offset health care costs in case the employee loses their job.

<P><b>MSA Legislation</b><P>
On June 13, Reps. Bill Archer (R-TX) and Andy Jacobs (D-IN) introduced the Family Medical Savings and Investment Act.  The centerpiece of the legislation includes the creation of MSAs.   At a time when the new Congress is working to be more budget conscious, detractors of MSAs contend that the bill will "cost" taxpayers too much.
<P>
However, Perrin claims that whatever the bill will cost (according to some Capitol Hill sources estimates have been placed at $1.18 billion over five years), it is as close to revenue neutral as you will get, but with dramatic results for our nation's health care system in terms of making health care more affordable for all Americans.  Businesses, too, will benefit from MSAs as administrative costs are reduced according to Perrin.  Forbes, Inc., using an MSA plan since 1991, has reduced its insurance premium costs by 27 percent.  
<P>
Perrin predicts that MSA legislation will be enacted by early fall.  According to other supporters, the current Republican leadership in Congress is anxious to address the health care reform issue, and believes that MSAs will empower individuals while providing incentives to save for expenses not covered in their health plans.  Businesses will be given an opportunity to participate or shift to a system that is more consumer-oriented and puts employees directly in control of their health care purchases.
<P>
The new Congress may not immediately give small businesses and the self-employed the equal tax treatment they are looking for, but perhaps they are giving Americans the opportunity to be consumers once again in the health care market.<P>

<title>Small Business and the Flat Tax</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>Small Business and the Flat Tax</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
May 1995 - While a hot, mid-summer debate is expected between the U.S. House and
Senate regarding the size and scope of tax cuts (if any at all), both chambers are moving full speed ahead on hearings to study a complete overhaul of our nation's tax system. <p> 
Committees in the House and Senate have already held hearings on the "flat tax"  -- a
simplified postcard system popularized by Republican Majority Leader Dick Armey.  The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a three-day marathon session from June 6-8 on all leading alternative tax systems.   The main plans for replacing the current income tax system include a flat tax, a national sales tax, a consumed-income" tax, or a value-added tax (VAT).  <p>
Hearings on the flat tax and its impact on the small business and entrepreneurial sector were held by the Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance of the House Small Business Committee.  Chairman, Linda Smith (R-WA), a freshman who operated a tax consulting business, is particularly interested in determining the effects of the flat tax on small business.<p>  
"We are placing them [small businesses] at the forefront of the debate on revamping the federal tax system to ensure their voice is heard," said Smith.   <p>
The Subcommittee heard from a diverse group of economists and business organizations, as well as Majority Leader Dick Armey and Senator Arlen Specter (R-Penn) who testified on their respective flat tax proposals.  The Armey Flat Tax plan includes the following elements (after being fully phased in over a three year period):<p>
<ul>
<li>all wages, salaries, and pensions would be taxed at a flat 17 percent rate (begins at 19 percent);
<li>capital gains, earnings from savings, and dividends would not be subject to taxation.
<li>a personal exemption of $13,000 would be permitted for a single person, $17,200 for a single head of household, and $26,200 for a married couple filing jointly, and $5,300 for each dependent.  Exemptions would be indexed for inflation.
<li>business owners would pay a 17 percent rate on the difference between revenues and  expenses, assuming of course that revenues exceed expenses.  The tax would be levied on gross revenue minus purchases of goods and services, capital equipment, structures, land and wages paid to employees.  Deductions would not be allowed for fringe benefits, interest, or payments to owners.<p></ul>
Concerns of members of the subcommittee ranged from transitional issues -- eg: how will small businesses be impacted as the federal government moves from the current tax system to the flat tax? -- to questions about what deductions small businesses may lose under the flat tax scenario.  Economists as well as business leaders agreed that transitional issues are important because business owners have made long-term business decisions based on the current U.S. tax code.<p>
In terms of the impact on business deductions, economist Alvin Rabushka (author of the notable book The Flat Tax) stated that all costs associated with operating a business are fully deductible as business expenses.  According to Rabushka, home offices, advertising costs, and business meals, for example, are qualified business expenses.<p>    
Raymond Keating, chief economist of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
outlined his criteria for members of Congress to consider upon designing a tax system:<p>
<ul>
<li>Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth
<li>No Taxation of Capital
<li>The Inflation Factor (its effects should be factored into a system's design)
<li>Clarity
<li>Simplicity
<li>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness
<li>Minimum Incentives For Tax Avoidance
<li>No Additional Boost to Government Spending<p>
</ul>
In his overall assessment of the flat tax before the subcommittee, Keating stated that the flat tax scores high as measured against these standards.  The main downside according to the SBSC economist was that the flat tax was still an income tax which historically has been "high-octane fuel for government spending." <p>
While most small businesses agree that the current tax code is a convoluted mess, the race is still on to convince them that elected officials can design a more fair, less-taxing system.  But as recent surveys show, the flat tax is becoming more popular with business owners and entrepreneurs.  In a recent nationwide survey of 500 small business owners sponsored by SBSC, 56 percent of respondents supported the Armey flat tax proposal.<p>
Powerful interest groups lay waiting in the wings, however, firmly convinced that they
will be severely impacted by the flat tax.  The housing industry, realtors, bankers, accountants and tax attorneys feel they have much to lose under a flat tax system.   Under the Armey flat tax plan, the home mortgage interest deduction would be abolished.  Specter's flat tax (a 20 percent rate) retains the home loan benefit up to $100,000.<p>
To some Washington observers, overhauling the nation's tax system will be politically
impossible.  To others, just being in a political environment where hearings are actually
occurring is a miracle in itself.  Still yet to come is the bottom-line analysis of how the various tax proposals impact the engines of economic growth -- the nation's small businesses.<p>

<hr>
<br>
May 1995 - The debate of the 1980's is back, and it is focused on a cut in the capital
gains tax and who benefits from it.  Opponents say it's a big tax cut for the wealthy and will drain the U.S. Treasury.   Supporters contend the cut will benefit everyone by increasing investment, savings, the availability of capital, and tax revenues for the government while decreasing the cost of capital for business investment.<p>
The Republican's Contract With America proposes a reduction in the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent by providing for a 50 percent exclusion on capital gains income, and indexing the rate for inflation.  For corporations, there would be an alternative tax rate of 25 percent on capital gains.  The capital gains tax cut in all likelihood will pass the U.S. House of Representatives, but is expected to meet stiff resistance in the Senate.<p>
Partisan sparks flew on the first day of  the Ways and Means Committee tax bill mark-up in the House of Representatives setting the stage for a series of heated and lively debates when the bill hits the floor for a vote.  Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO) warned that "the Republican tax cuts amount to a massive perk for the privileged, while hard-working middle-class families barely benefit at all."  <p>
Responding to Gephardt, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) said that the Minority Leader was conducting a "misinformation campaign."  The capital gains tax cut measure, included within a $188 billion tax cut proposal for families and businesses, passed the powerful tax writing committee by a 21-14 party-line vote.<p>
What do the experts say about the capital gains tax?  Is it really a tax cut for the rich? 
And, even if it is, does that mean that every one else loses?<p>
<center><b>Economic and U.S. Job Growth</b><p></center>
The U.S. is heavily dependent on its entrepreneurial and small business sector for new job creation.  Over 80 percent of the new jobs in 1993, according to Duns and Bradstreet, were created by small businesses.  But many business owners and entrepreneurs still face a major obstacle to start-up, growth and expansion -- the daunting task of raising capital.  The business advocacy groups in Washington, D.C. favor a capital gains tax cut because it will encourage investment in the small business and entreprenuerial sector. <p>
According to the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF) Center for Policy
Research, the favorable tax treatment of capital gains is critical to start-up businesses which tend to be riskier investments.  The ACCF Center, in a special report entitled Questions and Answers on Capital Gains, states that most start-up money comes from the family and friends of entrepreneurs.  Lower capital gains taxes encourages these potential investors to risk their savings due to a return in appreciated stock.<p>
High capital gains tax rates significantly cut into potential returns thereby diminishing
incentives to invest.  In the real world of risk-and-reward tradeoffs, the opportunity for high returns must be present in order to entice investment in high-risk ventures, even in new and existing businesses of families and friends.<p>
A examination of venture capital investment in the United States over the past decade has shown a deep decline.  Venture capital was on the rise up to 1986 as the U.S. capital gains tax rate declined; followed by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked from 20 percent to 28 percent in 1987 (see chart).  Supporters of reducing and eliminating capital gains tax rates claim that capital would be unlocked, and more capital access to budding and expanding businesses with lower rates.<p>
Critics of  lowering the capital gains tax rate say it will do little for the market,  and
doubts the cut will "free up" capital for investment.  In a paper entitled Another Tax Break for the Wealthy, Dean Baker of the Economic Policy Institute writes that lower tax rates create incentives to hide other income in tax shelters.  Rather than increasing investment in business, a reduction would only add to the tax shelter industry.<p>
<center><b>Capital Gains Tax Spectrum</b><p></center>
A review of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) individual income tax returns show that
capital gains tend to be spread across a wider income spectrum than many believe, or what is reported.  According to 1992 federal income tax returns, 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes $50,000 or less, including the capital gain.  Total incomes of $100,000 or less claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<p>

<h2>'Contract' Reforms Lift Business Burdens</h2>  
</center>                                 
<hr>
<br>
April 1995 - Many newly-elected members of the 104th Congress campaigned on a pro-business agenda.  These mostly Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives, many of whom are small business owners themselves, used the Contract With America as the centerpiece of their campaigns.  What's in store for the business community according to the new Republican majority?  A less-meddlesome, less-regulating, less-taxing federal government.<p>
Already the U.S. House has enacted many of the "Contract" reforms they promised. 
Quite remarkably, most of the legislation to date has easily sailed through the House with the solid support of pro-business Democrats.  But, the most contentious parts of the "Contract" remain, as the House turns to a comprehensive tax relief and spending cuts package.  U.S. Senate passage of many "Contract" provisions also remain in doubt, as Senate leaders say they have their own agenda and timetable for legislation. <p>
Special interests opposed to the "Contract," such as environmental groups, consumer
organizations and the trial lawyers to name a few, have largely focused their lobbying efforts and resources on the upcoming battle in the Senate.<p>
<center><b>Regulatory Relief</b></center><p>   
A comprehensive regulatory reform package,  and a year-long moratorium, or "time-out," on newly proposed regulations easily swept through the House.  Nearly 4,500 new regulations proposed by the Clinton Administration are subject to the moratorium.  The Senate's version of the legislation gives President Clinton the authority to exempt regulations he views as needed to prevent an "imminent" threat to the health and safety of the public.  The Clinton Administration opposes the moratorium. <p>
     Highlights of regulatory reform legislation enacted by the House include:
<ul>
<li>Cost-benefit analysis and risk-assessment standards to be applied to proposed regulations.
<li>The paperwork burden on businesses to be reduced by 10% annually.
<li>Stepped up protection and compensation for private property owners when government regulations reduce the value and use of property.
<li>The Regulatory Flexibility Act, a law already on the books to protect small businesses from excessive regulation, to be strengthened to give small businesses the right to take legal action against the government to enforce the law.
</ul><p>
At a press conference celebrating the passage of reform in the House, regulatory pointman, Majority Whip Tom Delay (R-TX), said the legislation is "the first step toward freedom for millions of individual Americans and hundreds of thousands of job-creating businesses and industries."  <p>
<center><b>Legal Reform</b></center><p>
It seems that if your business involves any risk (which inherently it does) it's not a matter  of when you'll get slapped with a lawsuit, but how much it will cost.  Business interests in Washington played a key role in passing the Common-Sense Legal Reform Act in the House.  The goal behind the legislation, say its supporters,  is to stem the tide of  frivolous law suits, and give business more freedom to do business and pursue innovation.<p>  
Major components of the legislation include:<p>
<ul>
<li>A "loser-pays" rule whereby the losing party in the law suit pays the attorney's fees of the winner.  The amount, however, is limited to the total cost of the loser's own legal fees.
<li>Product Liability:  joint liability for noneconomic damages are abolished under the Act, and a $250,000 cap on punitive damages. 
<li>Lawyer accountability strengthened and "junk-science" testimony disallowed.
<li>Greater protection for growth companies against class-action shareholder law suits.
<li>Written notice must be given to the defendant at least thirty days before a plaintiff can bring suit.  
</ul><p>
<center><b>Tax Relief? What's on the Line for Your Bottom-line</center></b><p>
Remaining "Contract" items of direct consequence to the business and entrepreneurial
sector include a comprehensive tax relief package, coupled with deep spending cuts.  It is shaping up to be the most contentious battle to date in the House.  What's on the line?  Tax cuts for business include:<p>

<center><b>Capital Gains Tax Cut</b></center><p> 
Supporters of the 50 percent cut in, and indexation of the capital gains tax say it will spur economic growth, reduce the cost (while increasing the amount) of capital for investment in small business, and bring in more tax revenues to the federal treasury.  For corporations, there would be an alternative tax rate of 25 percent on capital gains.  Detractors say its a tax cut for the rich, and will drain the treasury.  With class warfare heating up, and widespread support for reducing the deficit, a cut in the capital gains rate may squeak by the House, but looks dimmer every day for passage in the Senate.<p>

<center><b>Home-Office Deduction</b></center><p>  
The tax laws concerning home offices are contradictory and confusing according to many home-office users.  The "Contract" proposal clarifies the deduction for home-offices.  A business owner will qualify if the office is essential to the user's business, is used on an exclusive and regular basis and when tasks in the office cannot be performed elsewhere. <p>

<center><b>Business Expensing</b></center><p>  
The amount small businesses can deduct for equipment purchased in its first year would double to $35,000.  The proposal includes competitive depreciation rules for all businesses under the Neutral Cost Recovery System.  The top-tax writer in the House, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-CA), also determined that the alternative minimum tax should be repealed on a phased-in basis.<p>
<center><b>Estate Tax Exemption</b></center><p>  
The proposal calls for an increase in the exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 to help small businesses pass on a family-owned enterprise to the next generation.  Quite often, the heirs to the family business are forced to sell the business to pay estate taxes under current law. <p>   
<center><b>Paying for the Cuts</center></b><p>
While business likes what it sees on the tax relief and regulatory reform end of the deal,
Republican leaders are bracing for an onslaught of direct lobbying when the spending cuts program is unveiled.    Federal government subsidies to large corporations and industries, as well as the Small Business Administration and other government agencies, are on the chopping block to "pay for" the tax cuts package. <p>
With the public calling for fiscal accountability in government, and many business
owners irked that they have to balance their books to stay in business, lawmakers in  Washington, they contend, should be forced to do the same.  The questions remains as to whether the majority of members in the 104th Congress believe they can reduce the deficit, while providing Americans and businesses with much needed relief.<p>

</CENTER>
<blockquote>
I would like to thank Ray Keating and the Small Business Survival Committee, and commend them for the 
hard work they have put into this important booklet.  I unfortunately have been very involved with 
Superfund for several years now.  I am glad, however, that we have this opportunity to address the 
problems with the program and fix it the way it should be fixed.  
<P>
Soon after being elected in 1990, I learned that I had 14 National Priority List (NPL) sites in my district.  
After hearing dozens of real-life horror stories of what these sites were doing to small businesses and 
municipalities, I formed the NH Superfund Task Force.
<P>
We worked for about a year to study the problems and make some suggested solutions.  We came up with a 
series of recommendations which I turned into H.R. 4161, the "Comprehensive Superfund Improvement 
Act," and introduced it in the 103rd Congress.
<P>
While that bill addressed many different areas, the most important part addressed liability.  Specifically, the 
elimination of retroactive liability and the replacement of joint and several liability with a fair share 
allocation system.
<P>
This year I've introduced H.R. 2256.  This is significant legislation because it presents a road map for what 
I believe is the best way to make Superfund work in the fairest and quickest way possible.  My legislation 
will repeal Superfund's unfair, unjust, and un-American retroactive and joint and several liability system 
for actions that were legal at the time.  They will be replaced with a fair share liability system that will only 
hold people responsible for what they actually contributed to a Superfund site.
<P>
Despite the billions of taxpayer dollars that have been spent on Superfund, we now see that a mere 18 
percent of Superfund sites have been cleaned up.  This raises the obvious question of whether or not we are 
getting our money's worth?  These facts -- especially when combined with a GAO report released recently 
which says that only one-third of all Superfund sites pose an actual risk to human health -- make it obvious 
to me that we are not getting our money's worth.
<P>
So what is costing Americans so much money while causing these sites to sit idle for years with no clean 
up?  It is Superfund's misguided liability system.  We can make all the reforms and changes we want to the 
Superfund program, but if we do not fundamentally reform the liability system, we will be back here again 
having the same conversation in a few years.  Taxpayers are spending billions on lawyers while very few 
of these sites are getting cleaned up.
<P>
Recently the House Small Business Committee held a hearing on the impact of Superfund liability on small 
businesses.  What we heard were stories of small businessmen and women from all over the nation about 
how they have been brought to the brink of bankruptcy by this program -- all brought about by the current 
liability system.
<P>
We also learned that the Department of Justice spends over $30 million  per year on Superfund 
enforcement.  That's more than they spend on Clean Water, Clean Air, and RCRA enforcement combined!
<P>
In addition to this feeding frenzy for lawyers, the Superfund liability system has created an atmosphere in 
which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) acts like prosecutor, judge, and jury.  They 
assume you are guilty until you can prove yourself innocent, and threaten you with huge fines and criminal 
action if you do not do what they say.
<P>
Once you have been named as a "potentially responsible party" (PRP) by the EPA, your journey is just 
beginning.  You will have to withstand endless EPA inquiries, endure hours of tedious work looking for 
old records from decades ago which may no longer exist, and pay lawyers to represent you and help prove 
your innocence.  Even then you are faced with third-party suits or insurance litigation to recover some or 
all of your costs.  
<P>
EPA and the Department of Justice have taken a program designed to clean up the nation's most toxic sites 
and turned it into a program that feeds the legal system and creates an atmosphere of where they have 
complete and total control over the fate of thousands of small businesses.
<P>
There is such a thing as too much government control, as we all know too well.  Superfund's liability 
system -- in addition to all its other failures -- has led to an out-of-control federal bureaucracy at EPA and 
the Department of Justice at the expense of hard-working Americans.
<P>
Another gentleman who testified before the Small Business Committee told us about how he had been a 
PRP for 8 years, and spent over $10,000 defending himself against a false charge.  Then, moments before a 
Congressional hearing on Superfund reform earlier this year, he was told by EPA Administrator Browner 
that he was no longer a PRP at that site.
<P>
While he was happy to have been let off, the gentleman was livid at the fact that he had spent nearly a 
decade and thousands of dollars fighting, only to be told before a Congressional hearing that he was free -- 
just so Administrator Browner could use it for political points and say "see how cooperative we are?"  Why 
was this man put through the expense and years of personal terror by EPA?  Why are tens of thousands of 
others similarly persecuted by EPA?  It is the liability system -- that's why.
<P>
In summary, the retroactive liability system in current law costs us billions of dollars ... delays clean ups 
for over 10 years ... gives government entirely too much control ... and creates an atmosphere in which 
there is absolutely no effort made to cooperate and in which the constitutional right of "innocent until 
proven guilty" is thrown right out the window.
<P>
The people of the United States deserve nothing less than a full repeal -- they deserve a clean environment 
and they deserve to be assured that their hard-earned tax dollars are going to clean up these sites rather than 
pay for endless armies of lawyers.
<P>
I urge my colleagues to examine every possible method to repeal retroactive liability before they take the 
final vote on Superfund legislation.  Holding people responsible for things they did that were perfectly 
legal is un-American, unfair, unjust, and must be changed.  Superfund is the most flawed law on our books 
and it is unconscionable for us, as legislators, to ignore a process which has destroyed so many people and 
so many businesses.  I urge small businessmen and women around the nation to take action now -- we must 
do what's right.  Let's not use a band-aid for a problem that requires a tourniquet.  Write and call your 
Congressmen and Senators now, and tell them you want fundamental liability reform in any Superfund 
reform package.
<P>
Best wishes.

<H3><CENTER><a name="two">Message from the President</a></CENTER></H3>

After years of watching billions of taxpayers dollars wasted, and thousands of small businesses legally and 
economically terrorized, the United States Congress has finally recognized that it is time to overhaul the 
federal law named "Superfund."
<P>
Since its inception fifteen years ago, Superfund has principally served not as a means to cleaning up 
hazardous materials, but rather as a feeding trough for lawyers and bureaucrats alike.  These individuals 
seem to care little about the environment, being more concerned with enriching themselves at the expense 
of innocent parties and unsuspecting taxpayers.  Through this booklet, "Highly Toxic: The Superfund 
Assault on Common Sense, Business and Entrepreneurship," the Small Business Survival Committee 
(SBSC) reveals Superfund's misguided beginnings and how it has turned into a surreal nightmare for those 
caught in its web.
<P>
Regardless of "good" intentions, Superfund has cleaned up only a fraction of the so-called waste sites 
designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), despite the fact that the federal government 
and the private sector together have spent at least $90 billion on clean up costs.  With future expenditure 
estimates as high as $1.25 trillion, Superfund indeed should be closely scrutinized.
<P>
Practically every aspect of Superfund is a mess -- a prime candidate for the "dysfunctional-government 
poster program."  The EPA's criteria for selecting Superfund sites, its designation of "potentially 
responsible parties," and the allocation of clean up costs are all grossly misguided.
<P>
Over 17,000 pages of regulations have been issued in the Federal Register on Superfund.  Most 
disturbingly, the hand of Superfund extends retroactively -- unfairly dragging businesses, cities and other 
innocent parties into legal battles.  Estimates place up to half of the resources exhausted on clean up going 
to legal and administrative fees.  In particular, small businesses and entrepreneurs simply cannot absorb the 
large, inflated costs of clean up.  Nor can they afford to engage in legal squabbles that involve being 
targeted by the EPA as a "polluter."
<P>
Superfund certainly is more hazardous to small businesses, taxpayers and local governments than the waste 
materials it was supposed to clean up.  When the new Congress talks of reining in the unbridled regulatory 
monster, clearly Superfund must be at the top of the list.  "Highly Toxic" examines the history, costs and 
effects of Superfund in order to educate the public, media and lawmakers about a program careening out of 
control.  This booklet also offers common-sense reform measures to clean up a government program 
proven to be toxic for businesses and taxpayers alike.

<CENTER><H3><a name="three">Introduction</a></H3></CENTER>

Can you imagine the federal government getting involved in an issue for all the wrong reasons and 
eventually making matters worse rather than better?  Of course you can.  Indeed, many of us see this as the 
case with numerous federal government endeavors -- from various taxes, rules and regulations to welfare, 
education and health care.
<P>
In 1980, the federal government injected itself deeply into the process of cleaning up hazardous and not-so-
hazardous waste sites across the nation with the passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act -- better known as "Superfund."  Undertaken for the wrong reasons, 
Superfund unleashed the bloated bureaucracy and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on often 
unsuspecting individuals and businesses; turned essentially local or, at most, state problems into national 
woes;  set arbitrary and unattainable criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced many 
businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available for investment in certain industries; restrained job 
growth; and damaged U.S. international competitiveness.
<P>
Small businesses -- seeking out additional capital for growth or often just fighting to stay alive -- are 
particularly vulnerable to a Superfund gone awry.  Legal costs, expenditures for cleaning up sites to which 
they contributed little, groping through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) bureaucracy, and a 
thick fog obscuring future costs and risks, can stop a small business in its tracks and even kill it.
<P>
Perhaps the most glaring problem with Superfund, though, is its mechanism for assigning liability to 
perfectly innocent parties.  Under this perverse federal legislation, if you disposed of waste -- toxic or non-
toxic, large or insignificant amounts -- in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, you 
could still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal site if it later became a Superfund site.  
Notions of responsibility and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.
<P>
Despite massive amounts of both private and public expenditures, few of the waste sites targeted for clean 
up by the EPA under Superfund actually have been cleaned up.
<P>
Indeed, individuals from across the economic and political spectrums believe that Superfund has been an 
abysmal failure.  Differences arise, however, as to whether the program merely needs some fine tuning, a 
complete overhaul, or outright termination.
<P>
The following pages will provide an overview of Superfund's history, examine its impact on business,  
entrepreneurship and the economy, and offer much-needed reform measures.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="four">The Origin of Superfund</a></CENTER>
</H3>
As children, many of us read comic books that told tales of our favorite superheros.  Seemingly without 
failure, our hero gained super powers due to the fallout -- usually of the radiation variety --  from some 
industrial accident or government experiment gone awry.  The fictional hero would then go on to a long 
career of fighting crime, righting wrongs,  and battling various evil-doers.
<P>
In similar fashion, Superfund gained its powers due to the political fallout from a particular waste site.  
Unfortunately, in this case, fiction became part of reality.  Love Canal gave birth to Superfund.
<P>
Most of us have heard, at least casually, the story of how a private company's waste dump created an 
environmental catastrophe affecting families and children in Love Canal, New York -- leading to an 
evacuation.  Thankfully, in a recent article, CATO Institute economist Jerry Taylor reminded us of the true 
story behind Love Canal.1  
<P>
The company in question -- the Hooker Electrochemical Company -- "legally disposed of 21,800 tons of its 
wastes in the abandoned canal trenches of the area from 1942 to 1953."  The company chose this particular 
area due to the impermeable clay soil, which would protect groundwater, and its rural nature, limiting 
potential exposure.  However, the expanding suburbs of Niagara Falls started to encroach on the site, and 
the local school board sought the land for an elementary school.  Hooker initially refused to sell, but the 
board threatened to use its power of eminent domain.  Hooker fully informed the school board of all the 
risks -- including having them present at on-site tests.  Nonetheless, the board "bought" the land from 
Hooker for $1.2  
<P>
Taylor explains the subsequent damage wrought by the school board:
<P>
  "Hooker Electrochemical's careful attempts to contain the waste and warn of the site's dangers were 
immediately undone by the school board.  Thousands of cubic yards of the clay cap [laid by Hooker] were 
scraped away in the course of constructing the school and later during the landscaping of a housing 
development that was built on the site.  The board's attempted sale of the land in 1957 for residential 
purposes was vigorously opposed by Hooker."3  
<P>
Alas, Hooker pleaded to no avail.  The land was sold to developers, and the construction of city sewer lines 
breached the site.  Taylor observes: "What we have, then, is not a parable of rapacious, shortsighted 
capitalists putting profit above public health, but the story of a conscientious company whose best efforts 
were undone by shortsighted public officials who put immediate political return above the general 
welfare."4  
<P>
By largely riding public outcry over this misunderstood incident, the federal government passed the 
Superfund legislation in 1980.  As the reader will quickly see, Superfund is no super program.  Heroes 
cannot be found in this story, only villains and victims.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="five">The Superfund Prescription</a></CENTER></H3>

Superfund was built on the dubious assumption that the federal government should trump states and 
localities in terms of dealing with waste sites across the nation.  
<P>
Initially, Superfund was intended to force companies to clean up their hazardous wastes and to deal with 
"orphan" sites -- sites abandoned where responsible parties could not be found.  Congress originally 
authorized a trust fund of $1.6 billion for orphan-site clean ups -- thought more than adequate at the time.  
With the 1990 budget deal, the fund ballooned to more than $15 billion.5   The EPA -- with no objection 
from our federal elected officials -- greatly expanded the scope of Superfund.
<P>
In theory, the Superfund can be used to clean up a site on the National Priority List (NPL).  The EPA then 
tracks down "potentially responsible parties" (PRPs) and assigns responsibility and costs for waste site 
clean ups.  Increasingly, though, the EPA forces PRPs to undertake the clean up from the very start.  Non-
compliance without "sufficient cause" results in a fine of at least $25,000 per day.6   
<P>
In determining liability, the EPA utilizes highly questionable criteria:<ul>

<li> Superfund allows for strict liability -- regardless of intent or negligence.

<li> Superfund liability is retroactive, meaning that actions taken before the law was enacted still apply.  So 
even if firms were in full compliance of the law prior to 1980, Superfund still exposes them to liability.

<li> Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore, the EPA can require that one business 
pay for the clean up irrespective of the degree of its own contribution to the waste site and without 
consideration to the total number of contributors.  No concept of "fair share" exists under Superfund.  
Seeking relief, this unfortunate EPA selectee files contribution suits against other businesses connected to 
the waste site.  All parties tend to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.

<li> Indeed, current or past owners of a Superfund site who contributed absolutely nothing to the waste 
problem can be held liable.

<li> The burden of proof lies with the accused to prove their innocence rather than the EPA proving guilt 
under Superfund.</ul>
<P>
The EPA's main criteria for assigning liability for a Superfund site often seems to merely be "deep pockets" 
-- whoever is able to pay will pay for a site clean up.  Of course, this is not an ironclad rule.  After all, 
sometimes deep pockets cannot be found, in which case anyone will do -- including small businesses with 
the most distant relationship to the site.  And even if the EPA finds "deep pockets," these same "deep 
pockets" seek to recover their own costs by bringing contribution suits against these same small enterprises.
<P>
In addition, the type of waste disposed of at a site by a firm is far too often not factored into this liability 
scheme.  So a firm depositing fairly innocuous materials may still be held liable.  Indeed, the actual degree 
of risk for damaging exposure to hazardous wastes hardly plays into the determination process for a 
Superfund site at all.  James Bovard notes, "A study by the Congressional Office of Technology 
Assessment concluded that half of all Superfund cleanups 'address hypothetical risks rather than actual 
ones.'"7 
<P>
Also, the degree of cleanliness required by the EPA often falls far beyond the realm of common sense.  For 
example, waste sites need to be cleaned to "background conditions," far in excess of human safety 
requirements and beyond prevailing conditions prior to contamination; groundwater under a site must be 
made clean enough to drink (often technologically impossible); and dirt is required to be so clean that a 
person could eat (!) half a teaspoon every month for 76 years and not get cancer.8  
<P>
If you think such a system possesses enormous potential to develop into a costly, legal quagmire, you are 
absolutely correct.

<H3><CENTER><a name="six">Superfund's Toxic Effects -- 
Dismal Results at Staggering Costs</a></CENTER> </H3>

As is the case with so many federal government endeavors, Superfund has fallen far short of its original 
goals while generating a host of new ills.  And these ills are felt by individuals and enterprises caught in the 
Superfund web, taxpayers, entire industries, and the economy in general.  
<P>
The overall costs are weighty:
<ul><p>
<li> Of the 1,292 "worst" waste sites on the NPL, only 237 have been cleaned up -- about 18 percent -- 
according to Heritage Foundation analyst John Shanahan.9  One should note that this is a most optimistic 
accounting of cleaned up sites.  On February 14, 1994, for example, Business Week reported that out of 
1,270 sites on the Superfund list just 49 "have been completely cleaned up."

<li> Yet, the federal government has spent almost $10 billion on Superfund and forced private parties to kick 
in another $80 billion.10  The average NPL site takes 10 years to clean up at an average cost of $30 
million, according to economist James Bovard.11  However, on September 29, 1995, The Washington 
Times reported it generally takes 8 years for clean up to actually begin, and then another 12 to 15 years to 
clean up the site.

<li> On average, transaction costs account for 32 percent of total private-sector Superfund costs, with 
litigation making up 65 percent of this amount or 21 percent of total costs.12  As reported in a recent 
Investor's Business Daily article (September 29, 1995), U.S. Representatives Mike Oxley (R-OH) and 
Sherwood Boelhert (R-NY) claim that as much as one-third of Superfund money pays for legal fees alone.

<li> Once caught in the Superfund liability morass, it becomes much more difficult for a firm to attract 
capital, make investments, and therefore, grow and create jobs.  Superfund's strict, retroactive, and joint 
and several liabilities create considerable uncertainties for firms.  Such unknown costs chase away 
investors and make expansion plans quite dubious.
<P></ul>
Small businesses suffer most under these added costs and risks.  Without the Superfund cloud hanging over 
it, investing in, starting up, and expanding a small venture is already a risky undertaking.  Superfund 
liabilities only raise the hurdles faced by small business even higher.
<P>
A survey of small businesses conducted by the American Council for Capital Formation confirmed these 
facts.  In a January 1994 report, it was noted that 39.1 percent of small business respondents reduced or 
delayed investment in plant and equipment due to being named a PRP.  Almost half of respondents with 0-
19 employees canceled or postponed investment.
<P>
The blow to the economy and job creation from this reduced investment are manifest.
<ul><p>
<li> Superfund also creates disincentives for investment in industrialized urban areas.  The threat of enormous 
liability discourages firms from buying land in and renewing long-time or formerly industrialized areas.  
Instead, it's safer to build new facilities elsewhere.  So many U.S. cities already impose large burdens on 
the private sector -- including high taxes, heavy regulations, bloated government budgets, and more -- and 
Superfund adds to these costs.

<li> Incentives are skewed for local governments and communities as well.  With the federal government and 
private parties picking up the tab for a Superfund site clean up, localities possess every incentive to push 
for clean ups to go well beyond reasonable levels.  They are not restrained by cost concerns, as someone 
else foots the bill. Economist Robert Hahn has noted that local communities often seek "gold-plated" clean 
ups as they reap nearly all the benefits while the costs are swallowed by a large number of taxpayers and 
consumers.13  Only when localities are named as PRPs does one witness restraint.

<li> Finally, according to a study by the Center for the Study of American Business, "Superfund imposes 
much more stringent regulations on manufacturing and other firms doing business in the United States than 
these companies would be required to meet in other countries."14  Most notably, in nations like Canada, 
Mexico, Germany, Japan, Great Britain, and others, liability rarely reaches entities that legally disposed of 
their waste; instead, liability is linked to fault.15  
<p></ul>
Individual Superfund horror stories abound, and the most horrific tend to pertain to small businesses -- 
those least able to afford or survive a governmental assault of the Superfund magnitude.  For example:
<p><ul>
<li> A small camera and film-developing store reportedly was held liable for the massive clean-up costs of a 
Superfund site in Glenwood Landing, New York.16 

<li> Hundreds of businesses and nonprofit groups, including a hospital, several public schools, and a pizza 
parlor, have been forced to pay large costs for cleaning up the Ludlow Sanitary Landfill in New York.17  
Bob Novak, owner of the Jolly Butcher Shop, had to fork over $11,000, originally destined for store 
improvements, because the glue from cardboard boxes he shipped to Ludlow was deemed hazardous.18  

<li> Formal Ware Rental Services of Tulsa, Oklahoma was notified by the EPA that it would be held 
responsible for the clean up of a local Superfund site.  Why?  Apparently for nothing more than paying 
someone $14 in 1972 to haul trash to the site.19

<li> Robert M. Cox Jr. lost his business because the Superfund liability scheme forced him to pay for the 
neglect of others.  He had to sell his furniture coating business -- Gilbert Spruance Co. of Oreland, 
Pennsylvania -- due to excessive legal fees and liability costs.  His waste had been disposed of at 11 
different sites despite an agreement with a waste hauler for disposal in one landfill.20  

<li>Kaplan's Careful Cleaners of Camp Hill, Pennsylvania was held liable for waste deposited according to 
the "letter of the law" 10 years ago at a site now on the Superfund list.21  

<li> H. Petert Nerger, president of Marisol Inc. of Middlesex, New Jersey, reported recently that even though 
his solvent recycling operations have not generated any wastes since the 1984 land ban under the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act, and despite the fact that previously the state told him where to deposit his 
waste, "our existence is threatened by retroactive liability."22  

<li> Automobile dealers in the Fresno, California area have become victims of what can be termed "drive by 
liability."  EPA bureaucrats reportedly put a former truck driver behind the wheel of a car and asked him to 
select establishments where he picked up used oil in the past and how much.23  

<li> In 1987, Eugene Ardelt bought the Mesa Fiberglass Products Company and soon after became a PRP at 
the Lowery Landfill Superfund site in Denver.  It did not matter that Ardelt had never dumped toxic waste 
at the landfill, nor that the previous owner's dumping was perfectly legal.  Ardelt spent $25,000 in legal 
fees and eventually settled with the EPA for $2,000.24  

<li> A small chemical company in Massachusetts -- Nyacol Products Inc. -- is being held as a PRP at the 
Nyanza Chemical Waste Dump Superfund Site because it currently owns the property.  This despite the 
fact that the EPA acknowledges that Nyacol had nothing at all to do with the site's contamination.25 
</ul><p>
These few examples fail to even scratch the surface.  Stories of Superfund atrocities seem endless.  And 
one should remember that while the costs are high for individuals and the economy, the safety benefits 
derived by individuals and improvements to the environment remain in question.  No one wins under the 
Superfund scenario of high costs and few clean ups.
<p>

<H3><CENTER><a name="seven">Department of Justice Defends 
Superfund Injustice</a></CENTER>
</H3>
It is worth examining the arguments made by Superfund's supporters.  These were most recently 
encapsulated on October 19, 1995, when Assistant Attorney General Lois J. Schiffer from the 
Environmental and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice testified regarding 
Superfund before the House of Representatives Committee on Small Business.  In general, Ms. Schiffer 
found little fault with Superfund.  
<P>
Indeed, Schiffer declared: "We believe that the Superfund liability and enforcement scheme has been very 
effective in carrying out the 'polluter pays' principle. "  As with all supporters of Superfund, Schiffer 
throws around the term "polluter" in a reckless manner.  No consideration is given to the intent of 
individuals and the legality of their actions.  If a small business owner disposed of a small amount of waste 
in a completely legal and ethical manner, for example, he becomes a "polluter" when Superfund is invoked.
<P>
Later in her testimony, Ms. Schiffer paints a picture of a government agency working with the private 
sector in full cooperation: "During the 15 years of its existence, the enforcement program has evolved from 
a litigation focus into a program in which most responsible parties enter into settlements or voluntarily 
comply with administrative orders, rather than litigating with the government."  Of course, mention of 
harsh EPA fines and threats of holding particular parties responsible for the entire clean up of a waste site 
go unmentioned.
<P>
Schiffer also praised a 1986 change in Superfund legislation which according to the Assistant Attorney 
General "prevents responsible parties from delaying cleanups by seeking judicial review and stays of EPA's 
remedies or orders before the government seeks judicial enforcement."  Of course, if one is on the 
receiving end of such "remedies or orders" the story can be quite different.  In testimony also given on 
October 19, John B. DeVinck, a car dealer from Superior Wisconsin, offered a slightly different assessment 
of restrictions on PRPs:
<P>
"My dealership arranged to transport used oil to [the Arrowhead Refining Company site] during a single 
nine-month period in 1976 when my regular used oil company was on strike.  I did not send used oil to 
Arrowhead during any other period of time, and have witnesses and sworn affidavits attesting to that fact.  
Regrettably, EPA and the PRP group who sued me refused to accept my supporting evidence and the 
testimony of witnesses.  With no jury or other fact finding on the EPA's part and no documentary records 
or evidence, they calculated the maximum amount of oil each dealership generated and assumed it was sent 
to Arrowhead during its 1944-77 operating life, assessing liability based on that maximum amount."
<P>
It was decided that DeVinck sent 31,855 gallons over the period 1960 to 1976.  Based on his own samples 
from various years, DeVinck calculated that over the actual nine months he sent his used oil to Arrowhead, 
he was responsible for about 1,000 gallons.  He has been involved in the PRP process for over five years 
now.  His costs include more than $100,000 in attorney and consultant fees, liability finally set at $70,000 
(down from an original "guess-timate" of $460,000 and then $230,000), plus $8,000 in interest.
<P>
In closing his testimony, DeVinck noted: "In my case, the $78,000 of cleanup liability I was assessed is an 
absolute travesty of justice.  The problem was that I couldn't prove a negative.  It was impossible to prove 
that I didn't contribute the huge amounts of used oil alleged."
<P>
Assistant Attorney General Schiffer also praised the fact that the 1986 Superfund amendments directed the 
EPA to select more "permanent" clean up remedies.  Of course, in many instances, this increases the cost of 
clean ups.  Federal lawmakers and bureaucrats clearly should not be dictating how far a clean up must go; 
this should be left to localities and the states who have a better understanding of local communities.
<P>
Some Superfund proponents have argued that Superfund was needed to establish a liability structure for 
cleaning up waste sites.  In fact, in her testimony, Schiffer inadvertently shows that no such need existed: 
"Before 1980, there was liability for contamination caused by hazardous waste disposal under the common 
law of public nuisance" and even strict liability "for harm caused by ultrahazardous activities."  She 
asserted that Superfund "was needed to provide response authority and funding for cleaning up hazardous 
waste sites, and to make rules of liability consistent and clear on a national basis."  With common law 
precedence and state or local government action possible, however, the need for federal action did not, and 
does not, exist.
<P>
Ms. Schiffer justified each aspect of Superfund's strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability scheme, 
as noted below.  Any true defender of justice should be disturbed by these justifications.  A response is 
supplied to each major justification for Superfund's liability regime offered by the Assistant Attorney 
General: 
<P><ul>
<li> Schiffer went so far as to justify strict liability under Superfund because, "Litigating 'fault,' as in tort 
cases, is extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive."  
Response.  According to the Assistant Attorney General's testimony, under strict and joint and several 
liabilities, justice seems to be sacrificed for governmental expediency.  This would be bad enough, 
however, in reality under Superfund, justice is sacrificed for absolutely no expediency whatsoever.  Clean 
ups take more than 10 years on average to be completed, while litigation costs skyrocket. 

<li> Retroactive liability rests, to say the least, on quite precarious grounds based on Schiffer's justifications: 
<p><ol><li> "it is perfectly fair to ask the parties who make a mess to clean it up;" <li> "the companies who created 
problems caused by Superfund sites benefitted economically from the manufacturing and other activities 
that generated these hazardous wastes;" and <li>"at least some of the companies who disposed of hazardous 
wastes were well aware of the dangers the wastes posed long before the public was."  <p></ol>
Response.  Schiffer's arguments supporting retroactive liability ignore the facts that entities not responsible, 
in any significant meaning of the word, are paying for cleaning up messes across the nation.  If economic 
benefit is a justification for retroactivity, then the retroactive liability net has to be cast much wider to 
capture consumers, various levels of government and taxpayers, other related businesses, etc.  And  if a 
handful of companies may have been aware of dangers the public was not, that is certainly no justification 
for punishing all businesses involved.  
<P>
<li> Finally, Schiffer argues that "joint and several liability is a longstanding common law rule that has been 
applied by the courts in CERCLA cases brought by the government, at sites where there is more than one 
responsible party and the harm is divisible."  She also asserted that joint and several liability is an efficient 
course of action, and if repealed would increase litigation costs.<P>
Response.  As for joint and several liability, Schiffer cites a supporting case -- Summers v. Tice, 33 Cal. 2d 
80 (Sup. Ct. Cal. 1948).  However, she notes that the defendants in this case actually "acted wrongfully."  
To say that a small business disposing waste according to the letter of the law and in good conscience is in 
any way acting wrongfully is a clear perversion of the law.
<P></ul>
When these shaky arguments are the best that can be mustered in defense of Superfund, serious questions 
should arise in everyone's minds -- especially our federal elected officials.
<p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="eight">What To Do?</a></CENTER></H3>

As we have seen, Superfund's problems are numerous and substantial.  In this booklet's introduction, it was 
noted that disagreement exists as to whether Superfund was in need of merely some fine tuning, a complete 
overhaul, or outright termination.
<p>
The long and costly list of problems identified here safely rules out mere fine tuning.  Economics and 
common sense dictate termination of Superfund, but politics may require something short of that -- a 
complete overhaul.  The following reform measures are offered as a three-step process:<p><ol><li> short-term 
reforms, <li> a major overhaul of Superfund, and <li> Superfund's termination.</ol><p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="nine">1) Short-term Superfund Reform Measures</a></CENTER>
</H3>
In order to get the Superfund reform process moving, several steps can be taken immediately that create a 
somewhat saner environment.  These include repealing retroactive liability for all actions taken before 
1987 -- eliminating litigation at an estimated 80 percent of Superfund sites; from 1987 on, basing liability 
on the proportion of waste a party contributed to a site; using science-based risk assessment and cost-
benefit analysis to determine required clean up remedies; and capping the number of Superfund NPL sites 
to gain some control over potential costs.

<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="ten">2) Completely Overhauling Superfund</a></CENTER>
</H3>
The following reforms would go far in overhauling the Superfund program:<ul>

<li> Completely repeal strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes.  Fairness and common sense 
dictate that no one should be held liable for exercising good judgment and following the law, and certainly 
not for actions taken before a law was passed.

<li> Superfund should only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke the law, who were 
negligent, fraudulent, deceptive , etc.  This is the only true "polluter pays" scenario.  To reiterate, parties 
that simply sent waste to a site in an honest manner, in full compliance with the law, should have 
absolutely no liability whatsoever.  In essence, they are not polluters.  So even proportional liability 
reforms -- where liability is determined by the amount and type of waste an enterprise contributed to the 
site -- while improvements over the current system, still remain fundamentally unfair and must eventually 
give way.
</ul>
If the federal government insists on operating a Superfund program, based on the dubious belief that 
individual waste sites amount to a federal issue, then funding should be attained from true polluters, and 
where no real polluters can be found, unfortunately, through federal taxes.  However, in the end, more 
needs to be done than a complete overhaul of Superfund.  Federal taxpayers should not have to pay for 
local waste sites.
<p>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="eleven">3. The Case for Terminating Superfund</a></CENTER></H3>

In fact, a waste site clean up is not a federal issue, unless, of course,  operated by the federal government or 
undertaken due to a new federal law or mandate.  In these two instances, federal responsibility is clear.  
Otherwise, waste site clean ups should be left as local, or at most,  state issues.  Localities are in a better 
position to judge the costs and benefits of clean ups.  If completely unable to carry the costs of a necessary 
clean up, then state government should be turned to for assistance.    
<P>
In fact, state and local clean-up efforts have proved to be far more efficient, timely, and less costly.  Local 
individuals possess a better understanding of their community's circumstances and needs than do EPA 
bureaucrats.
<P>
Indeed, the proper order of responsibility -- again,  barring federal operation, mandates or laws --  should 
be:
<P><ol>
<li>Private parties guilty of breaking the law, negligence, fraud, etc.;
<li>Local government action;
<li>State government action.
</ol><p>
The case for terminating the federal Superfund program is strong, especially at a time when Congress is 
seeking to re-establish a proper relationship between federal, state, and local governments.  True federalism 
dictates that those issues that can be dealt with at the state or local level should be left at the state or local 
level.  Not that these particular governmental layers are necessarily any more efficient than the federal 
government, but state or local officials should possess some better understanding of a community's needs, 
including the area of a waste-site clean up.
<p>
In the end, Superfund should be discontinued and the several taxes supporting it terminated.  This is the 
most responsible step the federal government can take when it comes to waste sites across the nation.

<P>
Long held in high regard by the American public, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
managed to squander much of its goodwill in recent years.  The FDA -- wrapped in its own "red-tape 
reality" -- is now under scrutiny.  Democrats, Republicans, patient groups, as well as the industries micro-
managed by the agency, criticize the FDA for its inefficiency, bumbling bureaucracy, and cavalier attitude 
towards business and the American people.
<P>
Under Commissioner David Kessler's leadership, the FDA has become chief advocate for the "nanny 
state."  Centralized, government decision-making for medical consumers and practitioners is the rule of the 
day.  In 1992, Dr. Kessler declared: "If individual patients and doctors made medical decisions on their 
own behalf, then the rationale for the FDA would cease to exist."
<P>
The grand illusion that the government can effectively render personal decisions or highly technical 
determinations laid the foundation for the FDA's failures.  Indeed, the FDA's severe shortcomings, as 
outlined in the following pages, prove that the agency should cease to exist.
<P>
The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation continues to review each of the federal government 
agencies as to their impact on entrepreneurship and economic growth.  In terms of selecting an agency that 
drives high-paying jobs and growth industries overseas, the FDA tops the list.  As the FDA has made it 
more difficult to gain medical device and drug approvals, more and more companies flee for friendlier 
regulatory shores.  Lost investment opportunities, lost businesses, and lost jobs, make for a sad 
commentary on the FDA's lack of vision.
<P>
From entrepreneurial medical device firms to vitamin distributors and food companies, the FDA has made 
it known that it is at war with American business -- with consumer casualties mounting.  The new 
leadership in Congress is addressing the many tax and regulatory impediments to entrepreneurship.  Efforts 
are underway to reform and restrain the IRS, OSHA, EPA, and other agencies.  The FDA certainly should 
not be shielded from bold reforms.  In this booklet, SBS Foundation highlights not only the problems, but 
also offers common sense solutions to allow for America's great tradition of risk-taking and innovation to 
continue, while maintaining a check on public safety.

<P>
The U.S. federal government's alphabet soup of agencies -- including OSHA, EPA, IRS, FBI, ATF, and 
more -- seem to be coming under ever closer scrutiny in recent months.  These agencies are being 
examined in terms of their missions, tactics, strategies, budgets, and effects.
<P>
Included in this scrutinized soup bowl is the FDA, or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA 
has set the standard for a gridlocked, costly, and even deadly federal bureaucracy.  The agency has gained 
infamy for its ability to throw monkey wrenches into the machinations of some of the most dynamic 
industries of the late twentieth century, such as medical devices and pharmaceuticals.  Indeed, the FDA is 
slowing medical progress, hampering entrepreneurial enterprises, and destroying jobs due to regulatory 
obstacles and bureaucratic gridlock.
<P>
The agency operates under a system of perverse incentives.  First, it possesses a monopoly in terms of drug 
and medical device approvals.  Second, since the FDA suffers consequences when problems develop with 
an approved product, the agency has every incentive to prolong the approval process.    Of course, a 
lengthy and costly approval process generates its own costs in terms of lost businesses, jobs, and lives.  In 
addition, the FDA seems to be plagued by assumptions that afflict much of our society in the late twentieth 
century -- namely, that all risks can be ameliorated in life, and that only the massive costs and bloated 
bureaucracies of government can assure relative safety.
<P>
In the following pages, we shall briefly review the responsibilities of the FDA, the agency's tactics and 
strategies, its impact on America's entrepreneurs, the FDA's budget, and finally propose some much-
needed, market-based reforms.

The first major federal drug legislation was passed into law in 1906 -- the Pure Food and Drug Act.  It 
forbade false and misleading claims about drugs, holding manufacturers liable for adulterated and 
misbranded drugs.  The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 required that manufacturers notify the 
government before marketing a drug.  Companies had to test for safety, and if within 60 days the FDA did 
not disapprove based on those test results, the drug was marketable.  In 1962, new regulations shifted the 
FDA to a pre-market approval process.  In 1976, Congress formalized federal regulations regarding 
medical devices, and in 1990 codified FDA pre-market approval of all devices.
<P>
Today, the FDA carries a long list of responsibilities, summarized as: regulating drug, food, cosmetics, 
biological product, and medical device labeling; approving new drugs, biological products, and medical 
devices; setting drug, biological product and medical device manufacturing guidelines; and establishing 
safety and effectiveness standards for drugs, biological products, and medical devices.

vs. 
Entrepreneurs 
and Patients</a> </CENTER> </H3>
<P>
As is the case with most regulatory agencies, the FDA seemed like a good idea at first, but it has grown 
into a massive, misguided undertaking.  The FDA has placed enormous burdens on food, pharmaceutical, 
and medical device enterprises -- discouraging investment and risk taking in some of America's leading 
industries.  The FDA seems more intent on exporting American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, rather than 
encouraging the production of U.S.-made drugs and medical devices.
<P>
Examples of the havoc being wrought by the FDA abound:<ul>
<P>
<li>In the August/September 1995 issue of Reason magazine, Rick Henderson reported that "the FDA's 
Center for Devices and Radiological Health takes more than three times longer to approve a Class III or 
'substantial risk' medical device (such life-saving products as heart valves or CAT scanners) than do the 
agency's counterparts in Europe."  What is the impact of such delays?  "In the past 10 months, reports a 
survey published in June by the Health Industry Manufacturers Association, 50 percent of the more than 
500 device makers surveyed had moved some clinical trials of new medical devices overseas; 56 percent 
refused to test new devices on Medicare patients; and 75 percent planned to move their trials to Europe."
<P>
<li>Thomas G. Donlan noted industry trends driven by the FDA's regulatory maze in the July 3, 1995 issue 
of Barron's: "The failure of U.S. regulation can ... be seen in the scrambles that have roiled the industry to 
put research and manufacturing offshore, to make partnerships with foreign drug firms and to merge and 
merge and merge again in an attempt to create firms that are large enough to weather all the risks of 
regulation."
<P>
Of course, market-driven mergers in an industry are by no means worrisome.  However, substantial 
industry changes being driven by regulatory costs should cause regulators and their supposed overseers -- 
i.e., elected officials -- to re-evaluate their regulatory activities.
<P>
<li>Robert Higgs, in a report for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, noted the hurdles companies face even 
when making improvements in already existing products or in their manufacturing processes: "Changes in 
the product or the manufacturing process, no matter how small, might cause the product to be consigned to 
an indefinite stay in preapproval purgatory.  FDA failed to differentiate between new devices and 
manufacturing changes for existing devices.  Manufacturers therefore had a reduced incentive to make the 
minor improvements that, cumulating over time, could greatly improve the performance of their products 
and the efficiency of their manufacturing operations."
<P>
<li>Higgs also reported that FDA policies and conduct have boosted costs for medical device firms 
considerably -- perhaps adding $10 million to $20 million to a firm's budget, as well as several additional 
years before a new device gets to the market.  Such costs greatly reduce venture capital investment in new 
and expanding enterprises making medical devices.  One can only speculate as to the total number of 
potentially life-saving innovations and inventions that fail to reach consumers because regulatory costs 
reduce potential returns to such an extent that capital simply dries up.<P>
Higgs noted that from 1989 to 1991, U.S. medical technology firms invested roughly the same amount 
abroad annually -- $321 million-$333 million.  "Then in 1992, when FDA abruptly made its enforcement 
and approval policies more onerous, capital outflow jumped more than 200 percent to $993 million."
<P>
<li>One also has to wonder whether large firms feel the FDA's battering as severely as smaller and start-up 
enterprises.  Rick Henderson asserts in Reason that large, established pharmaceutical companies have 
benefited from the FDA's regulatory maze.  New, smaller firms lack the resources, expertise, and patience 
to surf the FDA's regulatory tidal wave.  Hence, entrepreneurs wipe out -- the system results in fewer 
competitors for established firms.
<P>
<li>A 1993 report from the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee 
acknowledged the woes tied to the FDA's approval process for medical devices: "The situation is 
intolerable.  The backlog for pending device applications exceeds 1,100. ... The FDA's enforcement 
practices have demoralized and perplexed much of the medical device industry."
<P>
<li>In testimony before the House Joint Economic Committee Hearing on Technical Innovations in Health 
Care on June 24, 1994, Robert C. DeHaven of the American Electronics Association declared that the 
FDA's "inordinately slow" regulatory process was threatening "the global competitiveness" of the medical 
device industry -- a $70 billion industry with more than 11,000 companies.
<P>
<li>A recent American Electronics Association survey reportedly found that 40 percent of medical device 
firms reduced their number of U.S. employees because of FDA delays, 29 percent boosted investment in 
foreign operations, and 22 percent moved U.S. jobs out of the country. 
<P>
<li>FDA approval times have mounted.  For example, in 1988, it took an average of 78 days for the FDA to 
approve a product change (i.e., a 510-K application); by 1992, approval time had grown to an average of 
126 days.  This number further ballooned to 173 to 213 days by 1994.   These applications are supposed 
to be approved within 90 days, according to FDA guidelines.  
<p>	
Approvals of new devices take anywhere from 437 to 840 days. New device approvals, however, are 
supposed to be completed within 180 days.
<P>
Meanwhile, the median approval time for generic drug applications stretched out from 12 months to 38 
months between 1986 and 1993.  Of course, these numbers exclude FDA requirements placed on firms 
that extend development time.
<P>
<li>The overall time it takes for a drug company to create, develop, and gain approval for a drug almost 
doubled from the 1960s to the 1990s, from an average of 8.1 years to 15 years.
<P>
<li>When compared with many other nations, a clear lag in drug approval in the United States exists.  For 
example, from 1985 through 1993, just 27 percent of the FDA's new drug approvals received their first 
marketing approval in the U.S.  Between 1982 and mid-1992, 82 percent of new biopharmaceutical drugs 
originated in the U.S., 14 percent in Europe, and 4 percent in Japan; 86 percent were first tested in the U.S. 
and 14 percent in Europe; yet, only 25 percent were first marketed in the U.S. and 75 percent in Europe.  
Of all drugs approved in the U.S., 12 percent had been available in foreign markets for 6-10 years, and 
another 9 percent were available for more than a decade.  In the area of psychotropic drugs (drugs 
treating mental ills), 17 percent were available in foreign markets for 6-10 years prior to U.S. availability, 
with another 17 percent for more than a decade.
<P>
These approval lags do not seem to necessarily translate into enhanced safety.  For example, Great Britain 
gets drugs to market quicker than the U.S., yet safety discontinuations as a percentage of total new drug 
introductions were similar in each country -- 4 percent in Great Britain and 3 percent in the U.S.
<P>
<li>A February 10, 1993 Wall Street Journal editorial ("Kessler's Devices") explained 1992's sharp increase 
in medical devise approval times this way: "The onset of these delays is no accident: they coincide with the 
aftermath of the Kessler-Congress jihad against breast implants.  With that searing event, word went out to 
FDA reviewers that all devices were to get new scrutiny.  John Dingell added to the fear by inviting some 
agency bureaucrats to visit his re-education camp on Capitol Hill.  Reviewers naturally began to ask more 
questions, demand more data and stonewall applications.  The resulting gridlock has been industrywide, 
affecting everything from catheters to imaging products for advanced surgery, tissue forceps, surgical 
staplers, lasers, and so on."
<P>
Of course, it was subsequently reported that several studies failed to show any link between silicone breast 
implants and various ailments that had been attributed to them by the FDA and a host of contingency-fee 
lawyers.
<P>
<li>The FDA continues to be embroiled in a controversy over the approval of Ambu International Inc.'s 
cardiopump, designed to help revive patients in cardiac arrest.  It has been approved and is on the market in 
many other countries including Canada, Great Britain, and France -- while ambulances in Austria are 
required to carry the pump.  
<P>
<li>In 1990, as The Wall Street Journal's Brent Bowers reported (May 18, 1993), the FDA notified the 
McCurdy Fish Co. in Lubec, Maine -- reportedly the lone U.S. company in the smoked-herring industry -- 
that it would have to significantly alter its process for producing smoked herring.  Since the turn of the 
century, the company had eviscerated the fish after the salting and smoking process; now the FDA 
demanded evisceration before salting and smoking.  Never mind that in the 20 years that John McCurdy 
ran the company -- producing three million pounds or 54 million filets of herring -- there was not one 
reported case of food poisoning.  McCurdy could not afford to buy the new equipment -- the business 
closed and Lubec, Maine lost 22 jobs.
<P>
<li>For almost the past decade, H. Earl Wright has been wrestling with the FDA over his Sensor Pad, 
designed to aid women with breast self-examination.  The pad has long been approved for sale in European 
and Asian nations.
<P>
<li>The Wall Street Journal reported on April 12, 1994 that one company -- International Rehabilitative 
Sciences Inc. -- already had FDA approval for its muscle stimulators, but since the company does business 
as RS Medical, it sought clearance a second time in 1990 in order to clarify ownership.  The FDA denied 
the application and rescinded its original approval.  Believing it was mistreated, the company decided to 
test the FDA's process by re-applying and having its consulting firm apply as well.  RS Medical was denied 
approval while the consulting firm received approval.  RS Medical took the FDA to court and won.
<P>
<li>The chief executive of the Minnesota-based Minntech Corp., Louis Cosentino, best summed up the effect 
of the FDA on entrepreneurs and the U.S. economy: "The attitude of the FDA is so antibusiness and so 
negative at this point that any prudent CEO has to be looking outside the U.S. as a safe haven."  Minntech 
laid off 50 Minnesota employees while expanding in Europe.
<P></ul>
Meanwhile, the so-called benefits for consumers from all these added delays and costs remain difficult to 
detect.  In fact, bureaucratic delays by the FDA apparently cost thousands of lives annually, as products 
and treatments are being denied to American consumers.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="five"><CENTER>Export Restrictions</CENTER></a>  </H3>
<P>
The FDA erects barriers to the export of U.S. medical products as well.  Even if a product has been 
approved for use in a foreign country, the FDA generally does not allow for exportation to that nation if the 
product has not received FDA approval.  Again, in the case of medical devices, a lengthy FDA approval 
process is needed in order to export.  
<P>
The CEO of a medical device company was denied permission to export by the FDA -- so he moved the 
company from the U.S. to Switzerland.  The CEO observed: "The FDA denied us permission to export. ... 
So we had to export our manufacturing plant." 
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="six"><CENTER>FDA Intrusions</CENTER></a></H3>
<P>
However, the FDA does not stop at mere incompetence and bureaucratic gridlock.  In the 1990s, under the 
guidance of FDA Commissioner David Kessler, the FDA's enforcement efforts have become increasingly 
aggressive and intrusive.
<P>
Reports abound of the FDA's confrontational methods under Dr. Kessler's reign.  For example:<ul>
<P>
<li>In the May 1995 issue of Reason magazine, analyst Alexander Volokh reported: "Since 1990, when 
David Kessler took over as FDA commissioner, enforcement has been one of the FDA's top priorities.  In 
his first two months, Kessler added 100 new criminal investigators to his enforcement staff, many of them 
formerly with the Secret Service and Drug Enforcement Administration.  Armed raids on alternative health 
clinics and dietary supplement dealers followed, as well as increased warning letters, product seizures, and 
criminal prosecutions in the drug and device industries."
<P>
<li>In the January 1995 issue of The American Spectator ("Double-Crossing to Safety"), James Bovard 
reported on the FDA's raid on Proctor & Gamble's "Citrus Hill Fresh Choice" orange juice.  The FDA 
disputed the use of the word "fresh" on the label, saying it was misleading.  Proctor & Gamble noted a 
survey showing that consumers knew that "Fresh Choice" did not mean fresh squeezed, and besides, "Made 
from Concentrate" was also on the label.  Bovard reported: "Kessler ... took sweeping action: He ordered 
U.S. marshalls to seize the juice -- 12,000 gallons, as it turned out -- and destroy it.  Federal law declares 
that a 'misbranded' or 'mislabeled' product is automatically unsafe, and provides FDA with the authority to 
confiscate the merchandise."
<P>
Of course, the orange juice was both safe and healthy.  Dr. Kessler's actions, however, sent a signal that it 
was "get tough" time at the FDA, no matter how ridiculous the agency might seem.  Power would win out 
over reason.
<P>
<li>Bovard noted another raid.  This time the FDA launched an assault on vitamins not orange juice: "On 
May 6, 1992, a platoon of sixteen FDA inspectors and local police in flak jackets carried out a no-knock 
raid, smashing in the door of the Tahoma Clinic in Kent, Washington.  They held the staff at gunpoint, 
ostensibly so that nobody could try to hide the vitamins.  The raiders seized more than $100,000 in 
products and office supplies -- including address books and diaries -- and spent 14 hours cleaning out the 
office; they even tore the phones out of the wall.  FDA agents were supposedly concerned about the clinic's 
use of injected B-vitamins, which have been widely used in Germany with no adverse health problems."
<P>
<li>Commissioner Kessler was appointed by President George Bush, but reportedly lobbied hard to keep his 
job under President Clinton.  Kessler worked to ingratiate himself with the president-to-be with a list of 
aggressive regulatory actions.  On December 8, 1992, during the White House transition, Kessler offered 
his view of the FDA in remarks before the Food and Drug Law Institute's 36th Annual Educational 
Conference.  His emphasis on re-regulation and more aggressive enforcement was clear, as noted by the 
following excerpts:
<P>
"We needed to send out a message that, ultimately, it was in no one's interest to deregulate a public health 
regulatory agency."
<P>
"We're paying more attention to our field these days.  We've become once again an FDA that vigorously 
enforces the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and not just an agency that approves products and 
educates consumers and the industry."
<P>
"Our enforcement people have fewer hoops to jump through, fewer boxes that must be checked off."
<P>
"We rely much less on voluntary agreements and much more on court-enforceable consent decrees."
<P>
"To complement the regular FDA field force we've created an Office of Criminal Investigations, not to be 
confused with the new Office of Investigations.  Thirty new special agents began intense training last week 
at a federal law enforcement training center in Georgia."
<P>
"In just over a year we've cleared the deck of uncompleted and abandoned regulatory proposals; we're 
getting new regulations out faster than ever before ..."
<P>
Commissioner Kessler, of course,  kept his job.
<P>
<li>This time writing in The Wall Street Journal (December 8, 1994), James Bovard observed another FDA 
tactic: "FDA employees are also sowing fear with a deluge of official Warning Letters (up more than 300% 
since Dr. Kessler took office).  Once the FDA issues a Warning Letter, it can seize a company's products or 
get a court injunction to paralyze its operations.  The FDA has refused to establish clear guidelines or rules 
for issuing its letters.  As a result, manufacturers can find themselves in a nightmare at the whim of a mid-
level FDA employee."
<P>
<li>In a letter to The American Spectator (April 1995), Dennis Plank, Editor-Publisher of the FDA Hotline, 
writes on how well federal regulatory agencies work together when it comes to regulatory crack downs: "A 
frightening current trend is how successful the FDA has become in pushing the buttons at other federal 
agencies to attack vitamin, supplement, and herbal manufacturers and suppliers.  We have reported on 
stepped-up enforcement actions by OSHA, FTC, Customs, Postal Service, and the DEA.  The Federal 
Trade Commission has now become the FDA's bully boy with no less than twenty cases pending against 
vitamin and natural product manufacturers."
<P>
<li>One of the FDA's most aggressive moves just occurred.  It did not involve a physical raid on a company's 
facilities.  Instead, it amounts to the beginnings of a power raid on an entire American industry.  According 
to published reports, on Wednesday, July 15, 1995, the FDA declared nicotine to be a drug, linking this 
conclusion to concern over tobacco products being sold to minors.  
<P>
Of course, it is currently illegal to sell tobacco products to minors.  In reality, the FDA's declaration of 
nicotine as a drug lays the ground work for extensive control over the manufacturing and distribution of 
tobacco products by the FDA.  
<P>
Most recognize that smoking is bad for your health, as are so many other undertakings.  Tobacco, like 
other things, is a legally grown, packaged, and sold product in the United States.  What happens now that 
the FDA is calling nicotine a drug?  Are tobacco farmers and convenience store owners to become outlaws, 
part of organized crime, or perhaps pharmacists?  Are the FDA's enforcement tactics, as described above, 
to be extended to tobacco farms and convenience stores?  What about smokers?  The effect of the FDA 
calling nicotine a drug goes well beyond concern over youth smoking -- it is an issue of extending the 
control of the nanny state.
<P>
Indeed, why stop at nicotine?  What about other habit forming substances?    For those of us who are 
overweight and enjoy drinking caffeine-laden beverages, will the FDA soon classify cheeseburgers, 
caffeine, and sugar as drugs -- how about hot dogs?
<P></ul>
As government agencies often do, the FDA has proven to be both hypocritical and incompetent.  Dr. 
Kessler and the FDA would better serve the public's health by improving the efficiency of their medical 
device and drug approval processes.  Unfortunately, Dr. Kessler's reign seems more about control.  It was 
reported in a recent article in Business Week (July 31, 1995) regarding Dr. Kessler, "Even close friends 
wonder if the bearded Long Island native might not do better to spend his time expediting approval for new 
drugs and medical devices, and fixing other FDA shortcomings."
<P>
The Washington Times reported on July 31, 1995 that former chief FDA investigator Jim Phillips sent a 
letter to the U.S. House Commerce panel on July 14 saying a half-dozen projects had been placed on hold 
due to the agency's obsession with investigating tobacco.  For example, Phillips is quoted as declaring the 
FDA's foreign inspection program as a "disaster waiting to happen."  He told the Times, "For the better part 
of the spring of 1994, Dr. Kessler spent virtually all of his time on cigarettes.  I can recall several instances 
in which I tried to contact Dr. Kessler on important matters and was told by his secretary that if my topic 
was anything other than cigarettes, the commissioner would have no time for me."
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="seven"><CENTER>FDA Budget  and Employees</a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
When confronted with such a checkered and costly performance record, many FDA defenders will say that 
the agency is simply in need of more resources.  However, FDA budget and employment levels tell quite a 
different story.
<P>
Figure 1, on the following page, shows the FDA's budget authority for select years since 1955 in inflation-
adjusted 1994 dollars.  Budget growth at the FDA indeed has been robust.  For example:
<P><ul>
<li>Just from 1989 to 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 52.6 percent -- or by an average annual 
real rate of more than 10.5 percent.
<P>
<li>Between 1970 and 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 221.1 percent.
<P>
<li>And between 1955 and 1994, the FDA's real budget authority rose by 2,978 percent.  Though the FDA's 
powers were enhanced considerably in the early 1960s, an average annual boost in real FDA budget dollars 
since 1955 of more than 76 percent is incredible.
<P>
 Figure 2 (page 16) illustrates the growth in employment at the FDA.  Again, a shortage of manpower does 
not seem to plague the agency.  For example:
<P>
<li>Between 1989 and 1994, FDA full-time employees grew by a substantial 25.3 percent.
<P>
<li>Between 1970 and 1994, FDA full-time employees increased by 115.7 percent.
<P>
<li>And between 1955 and 1994, full-time employees at the FDA increased by 933.4 percent.
<P></ul>
<hr>
<H3> <a name="eight"><CENTER>Incentives Problem</a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
Considering the great leaps in real budget authority and employment at the FDA, it would seem clear that 
the FDA does not lack for sufficient resources.  Instead, what the FDA lacks are proper incentives -- as is 
the case with most government undertakings.  Costs and performance in government -- unlike the private 
sector -- take a back seat to concerns over expanding power, budgets, and employment.  Without a profit 
motive, costs inevitably rise and performance declines.
<P>
In addition, the FDA possesses every incentive to prolong the drug and medical-device approval processes, 
since the agency monopolizes these activities and can face significant consequences when a problem 
develops in an approved product.  In contrast, the FDA loses virtually nothing when businesses and 
patients suffer because of agency delays.  Businesses and patients who die from FDA delays receive little 
attention.
<P>
In summary, taxpayers and consumers are spending more to get less from the FDA.  FDA delays, added 
costs, export restrictions, narrow-minded regulations, overly aggressive regulators, and mounting budgets 
are costing the United States in terms of lost businesses, jobs, and even lives.
<P>
Real reform means reduced costs and improved performance.  That translates into greater private-sector 
involvement in the safety of U.S. food, drugs, and medical devices.
<P>
<hr>
<H3><a name="nine"><CENTER>Market-Based Reforms</a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
The list of FDA shortcomings is quite lengthy.  Much to the chagrin of Commissioner Kessler, the FDA 
indeed should be "just an agency that approves products and educates consumers and the industry."  In the 
regulatory environment, anything more seems to breed hostility, often insurmountable costs, over-
zealousness, arrogance, big budgets, and massive intrusions on the part of regulators -- such as seizures of 
orange juice and armed raids on vitamin clinics.  
<P>
Entrepreneurs in the medical device, pharmaceutical, and food industries meet the most essential human 
needs -- sustenance and medical care.  The costs and risks of improving upon and/or creating new products 
in such areas remain substantial -- including the potential of enormous liability costs in a legal system gone 
awry.  Unfortunately, the FDA has managed to significantly add to these costs -- not only through delays 
and additional regulatory requirements, but through unpredictable, intrusive actions.    Entrepreneurs, 
however, are not the enemy; they are the driving force behind society's great leaps in technology, new 
products and services. 
<P>
The FDA's philosophy should not be one of making an example of a company in order to send a signal to 
other firms.  Instead, the agency should build a cooperative relationship with some of America's most 
dynamic and crucial industries.  Unfortunately, the FDA seems incapable of such a massive shift in attitude 
and culture.  Former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan was correct when he 
recently noted in The Washington Times (June 27, 1995) that the FDA may be beyond reform:
<P>
"Instead of making yet another effort to reform a system that seems incapable of reform, we should begin 
thinking about the design of a new system.  In my view, such a system would require considerable 
decentralization, perhaps along the lines of the European systems, where non-government institutions play 
a much greater role in the process of reviewing and approving new medical products."
<P>
One should be somewhat encouraged by the fact that the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives also 
acknowledges considerable problems with the FDA.  In fact, Speaker Newt Gingrich went so far as to refer 
to the FDA as a "Stalinistic" agency and the "leading job killer" in the nation.  Under the FDA's yoke, 
entrepreneurs and businesses possess every incentive to cease research and development, shift operations 
and jobs out of the country, or close down altogether.
<P>
Bold steps need to be taken:  
<P><ul>
<li>The FDA should be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education.  
According to economist James Bovard, writing in the December 8, 1994 Wall Street Journal: "Rep. 
Gingrich favors replacing the FDA with an agency staffed with medical entrepreneurs, with strict limits on 
their time in government."  While one has to wonder why entrepreneurs would be willing to staff a 
government agency, the sentiment is correct.  
<P>
The Speaker's idea raises another question: Can FDA regulators ever be qualified enough to register sound 
judgments regarding  dynamic enterprises in, for example, the biomedical industry?  Tapping medical 
entrepreneurs is a good idea, but perhaps better achieved by allowing private firms to undertake safety 
approvals. 
<P>
The private sector -- medical entrepreneurs certified by the government -- is more capable of establishing 
an efficient drug and medical device approval processes.  Conceivably, the approval process would be 
contracted out, or preferably, companies themselves could hire private-sector entities for approvals.  
Universities, hospitals, researchers, and other firms could be certified by the government as drug or 
medical device approval entities.
<P>
<li>Efficacy should be left to the marketplace.  The government has a role in helping to secure consumers 
against substantial risks they could not know about -- i.e., safety -- as well as fraud.  Determining the 
efficacy of products, though, should be left to doctors, hospitals, experts, consumer groups, individuals, et 
al.
<P>
<li>Manufacturers and approval enterprises should be subject to the incentives of a sound legal system.  
However, huge awards for "pain and suffering" and punitive damages, contingency-fee lawyers, a plague 
of frivolous lawsuits, and much more, work against that soundness.  Product liability costs can terminate 
the life of a business, or simply extinguish it before an entrepreneur gives it life.  In such an environment, 
capital flees to industries where costs and risks are much smaller.
<P>
Industry often is regulated in one of two ways -- either by direct government regulation or through the 
legal system, i.e., the threat of a lawsuit.  Unfortunately, businesses must incur the costs of both systems 
today.  In the pharmaceuticals and medical device industries, the burdens of both government regulations 
and product liability are massive.
<P>
While firms should be liable for negligence or for misleading approval bodies, "regulatory compliance" 
and "state of knowledge" defenses should be allowed for firms that met all regulatory and safety 
requirements.
<P>
<li>The FDA currently disallows manufacturers from distributing information regarding off-label uses of 
drugs, such as independent studies and journal articles.  This dangerous ban should be lifted.  Doctors and 
patients need a steady flow of information about possible treatments.  Government, in no way, should 
hinder the free flow of information.
<P>
<li>A federal agency's enforcement powers, as well as its processes and standards for determining what 
products fall under its jurisdiction, should be scrutinized and reviewed annually by Congress.  Each 
individual policy decision approved by the President should receive the same examination.  Bizarre orange 
juice and vitamin raids should not be allowed to happen, nor should our elected officials be able to say that 
they were unable to stop such actions.
<P>
<li>The U.S. should negotiate and enter into agreements with other nations to recognize each other's drug 
and medical device approvals.
<P>
<li>Lastly, incentives for investment in dynamic industries, like pharmaceuticals and medical devices, need 
to be enhanced.  The aforementioned reforms are based on this premise.  Also, though having nothing to do 
with the FDA, one of the most productive steps that could be taken along this path is the elimination of 
capital gains taxes.  We have already noted the risky nature of drug and medical-device ventures.  High 
risks must be accompanied by at least the opportunity for substantial rewards.  A zero percent capital gains 
tax rate would help provide such opportunities -- boosting entrepreneurship, competition, and growth.
<P></ul>
The FDA is taking a heavy toll on the U.S. economy in terms of lost entrepreneurship, investment, jobs, 
and international competitiveness.  In a world where both capital and labor can move with increasing ease 
and freedom, the U.S. regulatory regime operates within an increasingly competitive global environment.  
A government agency that delays the approvals of beneficial drugs and medical devices to the degree that 
the FDA does, ensures that U.S.-based firms function at a severe disadvantage.  Of course, not only does 
this mean less investment, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs, but it also means that U.S. consumers 
often are denied access to life-saving  devices and treatments.
<P>
Competition can do wonders.  The U.S. regulatory regime acts as a severe drag on our economy.  Congress 
must act to make the U.S. food and drug regulatory environment more competitive on the world stage, or 
continue to lose cutting-edge firms and high-paying jobs to other nations.

<H3><a name="ten"><CENTER>Still Tea Time at the FDA</a></CENTER></H3>
<P>
On February 23, 1993, The Wall Street Journal ran a story on its front page entitled "Perpetual Tea Time 
May Come to an End for Top U.S. Tea Taster," written by Bruce Ingersoll.  That's right, the federal 
government -- more specifically the FDA --employs tea tasters.
<P>
It seems that since the passage of the Tea Importation Act of 1897, federal taxpayers have paid for the U.S. 
Board of Tea Experts, with part of the board's tab picked up by the tea industry.  As a department of the 
FDA, the board's essential duty is to ensure that imported tea tastes alright.
<P>
Though certainly not a budget breaker, the FDA's tea tasters well represent the government's cavalier 
manner as to how it spends money.  The Journal reported that the Board of Tea Tasters costs about 
$200,000 annually, with its top tea taster making $60,000.  Upon entering office, President Clinton, like 
Presidents Nixon and Carter previously, was intent on terminating tea time at the FDA.
<P>
However, SBS Foundation called the FDA's Brooklyn, New York office -- home to the FDA's top tea taster 
-- in late July of this year.  The U.S. Board of Tea Experts still exists, answering the phone, "Tea room."  
<P>
Clearly, the FDA's tea room needs to go -- an example of government waste.  However, the Journal did 
report that many have praised Mr. Robert Dick -- the FDA's now 80-year-old tea taster -- as an 
"unbureaucratic bureaucrat."  A private-sector tea taster for Redco Foods Inc. reported, "In my experience, 
he evaluates tea the same day he receives it."  If lawmakers ever finally muster the courage to turn off the 
teapots at the FDA's tea room, maybe Mr. Dick could give some pointers to the FDA's drug and medical 
device departments on how to speed along approvals.

<a name="one"><CENTER><H3>Introduction</a></H3></CENTER>
During election campaigns, special interests attempt to push, pull, cajole, and maneuver candidates into supporting their narrow agendas.  Under such pressures and in the heat of a campaign, candidates can succumb to such narrow interests and lose sight of those policies and actions that serve all entrepreneurs and the economy best.
<p> 
 Unfortunately, small but vocal parts of the business community can be listed among these special interests.  They can be found supporting positions that may promote their own particular, short-term interests, but at the cost of business and the economy at large.
Therefore, the Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation has undertaken an effort to educate candidates, along with the media, businesses, entrepreneurs, and citizens, as to the policies that boost entrepreneurship, investment, and economic growth.  This booklet -- "Entrepreneurs and Elections '96: A Candidate's Handbook to Critical Small Business Issues" -- will be the very cornerstone of SBS Foundation's education efforts for the upcoming year.
<P>
After reading through this booklet, candidates will gain some insights as to how to think in economic terms.  Many candidates have little trouble thinking politically, but often are guilty of leaving sound economics out of their policy platforms.  However, economics cannot and should not be left out of any campaign effort.  When politicians do forget economics, the consequences can be severe, whether on the campaign trail or upon taking elected office.
<p>
In the end, candidates need to remember that sound economics makes for sound politics, and ultimately sound governing.  In the end, sound economics dictates removing government-imposed hurdles to entrepreneurship and small business success.<P>
<hr>
<a name="two"><H3><CENTER>The Impact of Small Business and Entrepreneurs on the Economy</a></CENTER></H3>
Why should candidates be concerned about small business and entrepreneurs?  It is an important question that must be answered here, at the outset; otherwise, the rest of this publication becomes irrelevant.  (See related box on pages 8-9.)<P>
The importance of small business and entrepreneurial activity in the economy is overwhelming.  Four fundamental reasons stand out:
First, entrepreneurs are the source of dynamism and growth in any economy.  They are the risk takers without which an economy would stagnate and eventually decline.  
<p>
Entrepreneurs keep the economy vibrant and growing.  As I noted recently in The Freeman: "The critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy is to see added value where others have failed to do so -- to enhance production and/or efficiency.  That is, to fulfill the essence of Say's Law -- that supply creates demand.  In turn, one can identify numerous types of entrepreneurship.  The Schumpeterian entrepreneur, named for economist Joseph Schumpeter and his notion of 'creative destruction,' offers innovations or inventions that can transform entire industries and economies.  Other entrepreneurs offer improvements in the way particular firms perform through, perhaps, different management or production structures; while still others simply see better ways of doing things and start their own businesses.  Additional entrepreneurs are at work in the investment community.  For example, an investment banker or corporate raider might see added value through a proposed corporate merger or takeover.  Then there are the venture capitalists willing to risk their own investment dollars supporting an idea, invention, innovation, or new business."2  
<p>
Second, hundreds of thousands of individuals start up their own businesses each year.  Individuals dip into the entrepreneurial waters for a variety of reasons.  Most prominent remains the American dream of owning and succeeding with one's own enterprise -- the self-made man or woman, if you will.  Financial independence, the satisfaction of bringing a new product or service to market, and improving upon what your competitors have done, all co-mingle to play a role in stirring the entrepreneurial spirit.<P>
In addition, the bureaucracies and often perverse incentive structures at many large companies, as well as corporate restructurings and downsizings, have led, or sometimes forced, individuals to become entrepreneurs -- to start up their own small businesses.  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 1994, some 500,000 Americans lost their jobs due to downsizing, for a total of 4.4 million in the past 15 years.
<p>
Lastly, proper public policy steps (explained in more detail throughout the remainder of this booklet) boost incentives for entrepreneurship and venture capital investment.<P>
Figure 1 traces new business incorporations from 1967 to 1994.  Incorporations had been on a fairly steady rise from 1967 through 1986 (with drops in 1970, 1974, and 1982), but steadily declined from 1987 through 1991.  The 1986 peak of 702,738 was only reached again in 1993, when incorporations hit 706,537, then rising to 741,657 in 1994.
<P>
Figure 2 shows annual percent changes in new business incorporations from 1968 to 1994.  Again, the 1987 to 1991 period is quite striking.
Figure 3 offers a broader picture of entrepreneurship.  It traces the establishment of new firms between 1983 and 1993.  Steady growth occurred from 1983 to 1987, with a meandering pattern since.  Figure 4 puts these numbers in percentage growth terms.<P>
Figure 5 offers another view of the growth in the number of U.S. businesses.  It shows the annual percentage increase in nonfarm business tax returns -- including corporations, partnerships, and proprietorships -- for 1981 to 1993.<P>
However, the true spirit of American individualism and entrepreneurship may be best captured by the "one man" business.  Between 1970 and 1991, the number of sole proprietorships filing tax returns leapt from 5.7 million to 15.2 million -- an increase of 167 percent.  The United States truly is the land of opportunity and entrepreneurship.<P>
The millions of entrepreneurs represented by these charts and numbers benefit consumers and the economy by introducing new products and services, more choices, enhanced competition, and greater efficiencies to the marketplace.  And they do all this at considerable economic peril.  The risks of starting up, investing in, and owning and operating a business run high.<P>
Third, small businesses create the bulk of new jobs.  As many large firms downsize in order to compete in the global economy, job creation falls to small business.  This has been the case for at least the past decade and a half, with the trend continuing today.<P>
According to Dun & Bradstreet's 1995 employment survey, firms with fewer than 100 employees will account for 66 percent of all new jobs created in 1995, with 50 percent of all employment gains coming in firms with fewer than 20 employees.  Firms with fewer than 500 employees will account for 84 percent of all new jobs created.<P>
Figure 6 shows the small business share of total private sector employment (1991 data latest available).  Fifty-three percent of all private-sector employees work in firms with less than 500 employees; 39 percent work in enterprises with less than 100 employees; and 20 percent in businesses of less than 20 employees.<P>
Finally, the best agenda for small business is the best agenda for the nation as a whole.  Since small business produces the bulk of new jobs; employs a majority of U.S. workers; includes in its ranks corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships; and remains a key source of dynamism and innovation in the economy; then what's good for small business and the entrepreneur is good for the nation.  The following pages spell out the true small business agenda.<P>
<hr>
<a name="three">
<H3><CENTER>A Pro-Entrepreneur Tax System</a></CENTER></H3>
There is no greater burden faced by entrepreneurs than taxation.  A recent Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) poll found that small business owners identify the IRS by far as the most burdensome federal government agency.  <P>
While taxes always play a critical part in every election, they promise to be particularly important in 1996.  A complete reform of our tax system is now under serious consideration in our nation's capital.  Tax overhaul promises to become a prominent aspect of every major political race in America -- including all House and Senate contests and especially the race for the White House.  Overhauling our current tax system and lowering the tax burden on businesses and individuals will boost economic growth and opportunity -- a positive message transcending all income levels.<P>
In an effort to help clarify the tax overhaul debate now upon us, SBS Foundation published a booklet in June 1995 entitled "The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans."  The major tax reform proposals were evaluated according to eight criteria of sound taxation, summarized as follows:<ul><P>
<li> Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth - the lower and more proportional, or flatter, the tax rate system the better.  
<li> No Taxation of Capital - taxing returns on investment and savings makes absolutely no economic sense.  
<li> Inflation Factor - the detrimental effects of inflation should be factored into any tax system's design. No additional incentive for the monetary authority to inflate should be provided by the tax system.  
<li> Clarity - the clearer the tax system the better.  The best tax system makes clear how much is owed, who is paying, and when the tax is being paid.  
<li> Simplicity - tax payments should be made as easy and as simple as possible for the taxpayer without any loss of clarity.  
<li> Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness - the fewer tax collectors and the more limited their powers the better.
<li> Minimize Incentives for Tax Avoidance - taxes should be low enough so as to not provide significant incentives for avoidance.  
<li> No Additional Boost to Government Spending - a tax system's design should not make it any easier for government to increase expenditures. </ul><p>
Based on these eight principles, a sound tax system -- one which allows entrepreneurs to flourish and the economy to grow -- can be established.  The following proposals for a pro-entrepreneur tax system are broken into two sections -- the first being necessary reforms under our current federal tax structure, while the second outlines ideas for completely overhauling the tax system. 
<P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="four">I. Immediate Reforms</a></CENTER></H3>
<ul><li><b> Capital Gains Taxes.</b>  At the time of this writing, Congress was moving to cut the capital gains tax by instituting a 50-percent exclusion from taxation for individuals -- lowering the top rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent -- as well as lowering the corporate rate to 28 percent.  If passed, these are positive steps that would help the U.S. economy regain ground lost in terms of stifled entrepreneurship after the capital gains tax was increased by 40 percent under the 1986 Tax Reform Act.  Figures 1 through 5 reflect the drop off in entrepreneurial activity after the 1986 capital gains tax hike.  However, while moving in the right direction, this capital gains tax cut remains inadequate.<P>
In order to boost incentives for investment and risk taking -- the engines of economic growth -- the capital gains tax should be eliminated.  Considering the high risks involved with starting up and expanding a business, eliminating the capital gains tax is perhaps the most pro-entrepreneur tax initiative a candidate or elected official can support.  By removing the considerable hurdle of capital gains taxation, high risks can be offset by at least the opportunity for significant returns.  Without such an opportunity, investment, entrepreneurship, economic growth, and job creation suffer.<P>
At minimum, a candidate should support indexation of capital gains for inflation.  Taxing illusory gains due to inflation is unfair and economically counter-productive.  Indeed, the real capital gains tax rate jumps considerably when inflation is factored into the equation.  In fact, in many instances, taxes can be paid on an inflation-adjusted capital loss.  Can there be any doubt as to the detrimental effects of a non-indexed capital gains tax?<P>
Of course, supporting capital gains tax reduction often opens candidates up to bankrupt, class-warfare criticisms.  The answers to such levies are simple and straightforward.<P><ul>
<li>Enhanced incentives for investment and entrepreneurship boost economic growth and job creation.
<li>Many of our international competitors tax capital gains far more lightly than does the United States.  For example, Germany, Hong Kong and the Netherlands do not tax long-term capital gains at all.  Even nations with higher nominal capital gains rates than the U.S. -- like Australia and the United Kingdom -- index gains for inflation, thereby effectively having lower real capital gains tax rates.
<li>Investors and entrepreneurs spend and invest funds far more efficiently than do government bureaucrats.
<li>The direct tax benefits of capital gains tax reduction are claimed by individuals across the income spectrum.  For example, the latest figures provided by Investor's Business Daily (November 20, 1995) show that in 1993, 84 percent of income earners claiming capital gains had total incomes of less than $100,000.  Incomes of less than $50,000 laid claim to 57 percent of all returns claiming capital gains.  <P></ul>
Critics counter that only 29.7 percent of capital gains income fell to earners with total incomes of less than $100,000, with the rest going to the "rich."  Putting aside the fact that the "rich" put their money to better use than government bureaucrats, one has to generally question this "rich" label.  After all, if one extracts capital gains from total income to gain a better understanding of the standard income levels of individuals, then over 52 percent of capital gains income were claimed by income earners with less than $100,000 in non-capital-gains income.<P>
The case for eliminating the capital gains tax stands tallest when one understands and argues that growth will be enhanced, incomes increased, and job creation boosted as a result.  Economic growth is a strong campaign message.<P>
<li> <STRONG>Estate Taxes.</STRONG>  At the time this booklet was being written, Congress agreed to raise the exemption under the estate tax from $600,000 to $750,000, and for certain "family-owned" businesses, the first $1 million in value would be exempt and a 40-percent tax exclusion applied to the $1 million to $2.5 million value range.  Once again, if agreed to by President Clinton, these initiatives are positive but insufficient.<P>
Unfortunately, 60 percent of family-owned businesses fail to survive to a second generation, with 90 percent never seeing a third.  The estate tax plays a significant role in the demise of family businesses.  In effect, the estate tax amounts to a hostile takeover of businesses and assets by the government -- with a top rate of 55 percent, plus another 5 percent for very large estates.  <P>
Of course, no economic reason can be found to justify estate and inheritance taxes.  The unfairness of individuals paying taxes their entire lives only to have have their assets raided by the government at death is manifest.  Such levies are based solely on class warfare impulses and government's incessant drive to root out more and more revenues.  Of course, in the meantime, the estate tax deprives businesses of precious capital and creates disincentives for investing in and expanding family businesses.
<P>
Estate taxes generate a mere one percent of government revenues with most of that wiped out by litigation and administrative costs.  This is a high price to pay for the destruction of thousands of businesses and jobs each year.<P>
Estate and inheritance taxes make absolutely no economic sense whatsoever, and should be eliminated. <P>
<li> <STRONG>The Bush and Clinton Tax Increases.</STRONG>  The tax increases of both the Bush and Clinton administrations diverted resources away from productive private-sector ventures and made working, saving, investing, and risk taking more costly.  Indeed, an April/May 1994 Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) survey of 500 small businesses found that a total of 69 percent of respondents declared that the Clinton tax hikes forced them to either raise prices, postpone expansion, terminate at least one employee, or some combination of these actions.  <P>
The Bush and Clinton tax increases should be rolled back.  Of particular importance is reducing income tax rates to their former levels -- for example, dropping the top individual rate back to 28 percent from its current level of 39.6 percent.<P>
<li> <STRONG>Constitutional Protections for Taxpayers. </STRONG> Constitutional protections are needed for the American taxpayer.  Ever increasing taxes destroy the spirit of entrepreneurship, weigh down the economy, and infringe upon liberty.  A "Taxpayer Protection Constitutional Amendment" would do the following: <P>
Ban retroactive tax increases.  President Clinton's 1993 tax increase was made retroactive to the beginning of that year -- before he even took office.  Individuals, entrepreneurs, and businesses need some semblance of stability when it comes to taxation for their own planning purposes.  In contrast, retroactive tax hikes create significant instability.  The unfairness and economically destructive nature of retroactive tax increases is clear.  <P>
Require a two-thirds super-majority vote in both houses of Congress in order to increase current taxes and fees, or to impose new ones.  As Chief Justice John Marshall warned: "The power to tax involves the power to destroy."  Perhaps no greater truth was ever uttered regarding the impact of taxation.  
The Constitution protects us from governmental abuses.  The Founding Fathers never envisioned government growing to the massive level it has today; nor the current burdensome levels of taxation.  Placing a super-majority vote requirement on Congress in order to raise taxes not only makes for sound economics, but fits neatly into the Constitution's purpose of limiting governmental powers.<P>
<li> <STRONG>Independent Contractors. </STRONG> The question of who is or is not classified by the IRS as an independent contractor has long concerned small businesses and the self-employed.  The IRS offers a 20-point criteria which is vague and complex.  <P>
Reclassifications by the IRS are standard and costly.  For example, according to SBS Foundation President Karen Kerrigan in a recent column in the American City Business Journals, "[T]he IRS has reclassified 439,000 independent workers since the mid 1980s, resulting in the collection of $678 million in taxes and fines."<P>
The IRS's criteria for determining who is an independent contractor must be clarified and simplified.  For example, recent legislation by Rep. Jon Christensen (R-Neb.) offered a fairly straightforward three-part test requiring that an independent contractor demonstrate independence, investment in his business, and a written agreement between parties. </ul><P>
<hr>
<H3><CENTER><a name="five">II. Tax Overhaul.</a></CENTER></H3>
As already noted, the complete overhaul of the U.S. tax system is now under serious consideration, and without a doubt, will play a significant part in the 1996 political debates.  In "The Great Tax Debate," the SBS Foundation scored and ranked the various tax overhaul plans.  <P>
According to our eight criteria for a sound tax system, the flat tax scored highest followed closely by a national retail sales tax, with a value-added tax (VAT), the consumed-income tax, and our current system trailing well behind.  Thankfully, the two systems ranked best in "The Great Tax Debate" -- the flat tax and a national retail sales tax -- currently are receiving extensive consideration and examination by tax experts, policy makers, and elected officials.<P>
Though the SBS Foundation has provided a complete review of the various tax overhaul proposals in "The Great Tax Debate," the importance of this issue for the 1996 elections dictates that we summarize here how the flat tax and national retail sales tax measure up to our eight criteria for sound taxation.<P>
<STRONG>THE FLAT TAX </STRONG><ul><P>
<li><STRONG> Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth.</STRONG>  Generally under consideration right now is a flat tax that actually is a two-rate tax system -- no tax on income up to a certain level and then a flat rate on all income earned above that level.  The rate most often cited by reformers is 17 percent.  A flat tax of 17 percent -- preferably less -- would greatly reduce tax-based disincentives for working and risk taking.
<li><STRONG> No Taxation of Capital.</STRONG>  The flat tax would not tax earnings from investment and saving at all -- no taxation of capital gains, dividends, or interest <p><br>

<h3>Karen Kerrigan</h3>
<hr width="35%" size="3">
</center>
<blockquote>Karen Kerrigan is president of the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a> (SBSC), a nationwide nonprofit, nonpartisan small business advocacy organization fighting against unchecked government regulation and taxation on America's small business and entrepreneurial sector.  SBSC also works on efforts to reduce the size and scope of government, while promoting policies and reforms which foster economic growth and opportunity.
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan also serves as president of the Small Business Survival Foundation, a research and education organization that studies the impact of government policy on entrepreneurship and economic growth.

     Every  small businessperson knows that a <i>Contract</i> is more than a promise.  It is an
agreement initiated by faith, but
enforced by law.  Each party can proceed  with confidence that the terms of the <i>Contract</i>
will be carried through, or the
negligent party will be forced to account for his or her actions.<p>

     That is why small businesses should be excited about the <i>Contract With America</i>.  Not
only does the <i>Contract</i>
represent a leap forward for small business interests, but it also represents a new thinking in
Washington.<p>

     The Republicans who signed the <i>Contract</i>  signed a business deal with the American
people.  In exchange for the
voters' support at the polls, we pledged to carry forth the terms of the <i>Contract</i>.  The
voters upheld their end of the bargain,
and now it is our turn.<p>

     In this pamphlet you will find an analysis of the positive impact the <i>Contract</i> will have
on small businesses.  By
the end of the first 100 days, the House of Representatives will have brought up and voted on
bills to lower taxes, reduce
regulation, reduce federal spending, provide real incentives for growth and reform the rules of
the House to provide
accountability.  Members of Congress will act in a more business-like way ourselves, and will
provide necessary relief for
the job-creating small businesses of our country.<p>



     And the <i>Contract</i> is only the beginning.  The new Republican Leadership in Congress
has pledged to reverse the big government trends of the last 40 years, and I am committed to the
goal.  As Chairman of the Small Business Survival Caucus, you can count on me to make sure
your voice as an entrepreneur is heard.<p>

     The first 100 days of the 104th Congress will indeed be busy on Capitol Hill.  The
Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives made a promise to the American people, if
elected to majority status.  They signed a "<i>Contract</i>" stating they would bring to the floor
of the House a series of ten bills representing a stark ideological alternative to the tax, regulate,
waste and spend Washington of the "old regime."<p>
      The Republicans got their majority wish, and now hundreds of thousands of small businesses
and entrepreneurs are curious about <i>The Contract With America</i> and how the specific
legislation will impact their livelihood.<p>
      The <i>Contract: A Small Business Guide to the First 100 Days of the New
Congress</i>, details the legislative initiatives within the <i>Contract</i>.  From tax cuts to
regulatory relief, the guide examines components of the <i>Contract</i>, specifically targeting
issues  of concern to small businesses. Because owners of smaller enterprises are
overwhelmingly concerned about fiscal  accountability in government, elements of the
<i>Contract</i> addressing those issues are also examined.<p>

     The last section of the guide to the <i>Contract</i> features each of the tens bills in the
<i>Contract With America</i>.  The Small Business Survival Committee strongly recommends
that you contact the Republican Conference at (202)-225-5107 if you have questions regarding
points in the <i>Contract</i> not addressed in this publication. The purpose of this publication is
not to diminish the importance of other <i>Contract</i>  points, but to highlight important policy
changes  that will directly impact your business and the economy.<p>

     Most delightfully, on the first day of the 104th Congress (January 4, 1995), the Republican
majority voted on and passed legislation forcing Congress to live under the same laws as every
other American and business.  Hopefully this measure will expedite action by the Congress to
roll back the burdensome regulations and laws that are impeding economic growth, and
unnecessarily costing small businesses billions in wasted time and money.  The Small Business
Survival Committee remains hopeful that the second 100 days of Congress will include a
"rollback process" to abolish illogical, outdated and excessive laws.<p>

     The <i>Contract</i>, by our analysis, is a good start at lifting government-imposed burdens
that are unnecessarily suffocating the backbone of the American economy -- small business.<p>

<b><a name="open">OPENING DAY OF THE 104TH CONGRESS:</a></b>
 A Check List<br><a href="#contents"><font size="-1">(contents)</a></font><p>
</center>
On January 4, 1995, the first day of the 104th Congress, the Republican majority will
immediately pass the following major reforms:*<p> 
(If you are following <i>The Contract With America</i> and want to keep your own "score
card" we have provided a box next to each initiative, to check off each item  as it is passed by
Congress.  <b>All eight items below  have been passed</b>.)<p>
<ul>
<li><i>First</i>, require all laws that apply to the rest of the country also apply equally to the
Congress;<br>
<li><i>Second</i>, select a major, independent auditing firm to conduct a comprehensive audit
of Congress for waste, fraud or abuse;<br> 
<li><i>Third</i>, cut the number of House committees, and cut committee staff by
one-third;<br>
<li><i>Fourth</i>, limit the terms of all committee chairs;<br>
<li><i>Fifth</i>, ban the casting of proxy votes in committee;<br>
<li><i>Sixth</i>, require committee meetings to be open to the public;<br>
<li><i>Seventh</i>, require a three-fifths majority to pass a tax increase;<br>
<li><i>Eighth</i>, guarantee an honest accounting of our Federal Budget by implementing
zero baseline budgeting.<p>
</ul>     <p>
 
<b>Congress Not To Be "Above the Law"</b>
<p>
     <b><i>First</b></i> -- Congress passes many laws that small businesses must abide by, while exempting
itself from these very same rules and regulations.  Beyond the issue of Congress placing itself
above the law, members of Congress do not personally experience the burdensome nature of such
unrealistic rules and regulations.  Making Congress live by the laws they pass may entirely
change the nature and number of laws it enacts.  Perhaps when Congress     begins running         
its offices and committees  under the same        rules as small         businesses, we  may detect a
movement to repeal those that are particularly burdensome.<p>
<blockquote><i>"Regulators found 15 would-be violations in the office.  Among these hazards were a 4-inch
tear in the carpet beneath my desk, and file cabinet drawers that could be opened two at a time,
creating a potential hazard not identified with clearly displayed warning signs.  If I were a
private-sector employer rather than a member of Congress, I would have been fined
$1,500.</i><br>
<b>--U.S. Representative John Boehner</b> (R-OH), commenting on the results of an OSHA inspection
he requested of his Capitol Hill office.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
<br>
 <b>Congress to be Audited for Efficiency,
and To Run Leaner</b><p>
     
<b><i>Second and Third</i></b> -- Congress has a sloppy reputation for running its own
institution.  Scandals, slush funds, and secret meetings seem to abound on Capitol Hill.  Items
two and three on Congress' first day list focus on cleaning up Congress, while streamlining its
bureaucracy.<p>

The financial workings within the Congress will be audited by an outside firm to determine if accounting                     procedures and other financial aspects of managing Congress meet the same rigorous standards employed by the private sector.<p> 
<blockquote>
<i>We're talking about a small army: 7800 people in the House and 4000 in the Senate, a total of
almost 12,000 federal employees.  The cost to taxpayers, with salaries, benefits, office space, et
cetera, runs to about <b>a billon and a half dollars a year</b>.</i><br>
<b>Martin Gross</b><br>
<i>The Government Racket, Washington Waste A to Z</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
     Doing their part to stop wasteful spending on  House operations, the committee staffs will be
cut by one-third with a real reduction in the number of committees and subcommittees. 
Committee jurisdictions will be realigned  to reduce duplication, while promoting efficiency.  
Like small businesses, Congress will have to do the same through reorganization, fewer staff,
and a more targeted agenda.<p> 
 
<b>Committees More Open and Accountable</b>
<p>
      <b><i>Fourth, Fifth and Sixth</i></b> -- Committee Chairmanship means POWER in Congress. 
The <i>Contract</i> calls for a vote to limit the number of terms a Member can serve as head of
a committee, limiting the possibility for corruption and non-accountability, while bringing  fresh
leadership to the position.<p>

     Within the committees and subcommittees themselves, the rules will be changed so Members
cannot cast ballots by proxy (ghost) voting.<p>

     The important work that takes place within the committee will be required to be open to the
public -- no more closed door meetings while Members of Congress secretly plot to raise our
taxes or their salaries.  All media will have equal access to meetings.  Committee and
subcommittee meetings may only be closed if approved by a majority of the total committee
membership, and only in cases involving national security, law enforcement information and
personal privacy. <p>
 
<b>Real Budgets and Protecting Taxpayers</b>
<P>

     <b><i>Seventh and Eighth</i></b> -- The 1993 tax increase passed by just one vote in the United
States House of Representatives and Senate -- a one vote margin gave the American people and
small businesses the biggest tax increase in history.  The <i>Contract</i> proposes that a
three-fifths "supermajority" be instituted to pass future tax increases.<p>

     When reauthorizing government programs, the government doesn't start with zero as its
baseline -- it  begins with last year's spending levels, pads them with add-ons, and adjusts those numbers for inflation.<p>
                               
<blockquote><i>Only in Washington can people engage in Orwellian Newspeak and get away with it.  A
spending increase is really a cut.And $82 billion more in tax revenue is not really an increase at
all.</i><br> <b>Jim Miller</b>, Former director of the Office of Management and Budget<br>
<i>Fix the U.S. Budget!</i>, <i>Urgings of an "Abominable No-Man"</i><p>
</blockquote>
     The <i>Contract</i> guarantees truth-in-budgeting. Increases will not ever be counted as
"cuts."  A spending cut will be a real cut.             <p>

<blockquote><i>A balanced budget/tax limitation amendment and a legislative line-item veto to restore fiscal
responsibility    to an out-of-control Congress, requiring them to live under the same budget
restraints as families and businesses</i>.    -- <b><i>Contract</i> With America</b><p>
</blockquote>

     Resoundingly, the message of the November 1994 elections was about limiting the size and
scope of the government's role in the lives of Americans and businesses.  Particularly, Americans
are concerned about  national leaders not addressing the serious issue of the national debt, and
the political establishment mentality  that believes government has unlimited power to go after
taxpayer dollars to fund wasteful programs.  <i>The Fiscal Responsibility Act</i> proposes real reforms
when it comes  to managing our nation's finances, and limits the tax and spending impulses of
big government supporters.                                   <p>

In a post-election poll commissioned by the Small Business Survival Committee, the number one response given by small business owners when asked what the most critical issue is for Congress and President Clinton, was "cut government spending."   Controlling spending is the primary means to rein in the power of meddling bureaucrats, and
bring fiscal sanity back to Washington.   <p>

<blockquote><i>"I place economy among the first and most important virtues, and public debt as the greatest
of dangers... If we can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the
pretense of caring for them, they will be happy."</i><br> <b>--Thomas Jefferson</b><p>
</blockquote>
<b>Ballanced Budget Amendment/Tax Limitation Amendment</b><p>
The majority of American families, individuals and small businesses balance their budgets --
often times struggling to make ends meet.  Small businesses --many operating on razor-thin
margins -- demand  that Congress be held similarly accountable, and spend hard-earned tax
dollars as if they were their own.<p>

     Unfortunately, the nation's $4.6 trillion debt and $14.4 trillion in unfunded liabilities is a true
testament to the failure of our national leaders in this regard.  And, while billions are wasted on
government programs which have  proven to be a failure (or simply fail to go away) taxpayer
"contributions" have gone up, up, and up.  The United States federal government has not
balanced its budget or ended the year in a surplus since 1969.<p>

     The U. S. Constitution has  been amended twenty-seven times, and the <i>Contract</i>
proposes it be amended again -- this time with a balanced budget amendment (BBA).
Specifically, the <i>Fiscal Responsibility Act</i> requires that total outlays for each fiscal year
not outstrip total receipts for the year.  The   BBA will go into effect in fiscal year 2002, or the
second fiscal year after it is ratified by the states, whichever is later.<p>

     The <i>Contract</i> BBA requires that the President propose, and the Congress deliver, a
yearly balanced-budget.  In the House and in the Senate three-fifths of the whole of each
chamber can vote to incur a deficit.  In cases of national security  and war, the balanced-budget
requirement  can be waived through the adoption of a  joint resolution by a majority of the
total membership of both the House and the Senate.  The President must also sign the
resolution.<p> 
      Tax increases must be approved by a three-fifths majority in each house -- more difficult to
achieve than a simple majority, to dig deeper into our pockets.<p>

     Most Americans know that the underlying problem with our country's messy fiscal affairs is
that Congress spends too much -- not that it taxes too little.  The balanced budget amendment,
joined with the tax-limitation provision, will indeed make our elected officials more accountable
to taxpayers.  The combined force of the two will ensure that Congress looks to spending cuts
first before raising the taxes of small business and all Americans.             <p>
     
<b>Line-Item Veto</b><p>
     Hidden within every appropriations bill is billions of dollars worth of pork barrel projects and
use-less government programs that only benefit narrow special interests.  Given the line-item
veto, the president would have authority  to strike these wasteful spending provisions in bills
passed by Congress.<p>

     The <i>Act</i> gives the president a permanent line-item veto to provide a check on the
extravagance of the Congress. Once the president strikes these items, the  cuts would  become
immediately effective, unless rejected by the Congress on an up-or-down vote. A rejection of the
cuts can be vetoed by the president, and a two-thirds vote by the Congress is needed to overturn
the veto. <p>

<B><a name="dream">THE AMERICAN DREAM RESTORATION ACT:</b><br></a>
<a href="#contents"><font size="-1">(contents)</a></font><p>      </center>  
<blockquote><i>A $500 per child tax credit, begin repeal of the marriage tax penalty, and creation of
American Dream Savings      Accounts to provide middle class tax relief.  -- <b><i>Contract</i>
With America</b></i>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <i>Contract</i> begins to chip away at the federal tax burden on families, while encouraging future savings by all individual.  <i>The American Dream Restoration Act</i> gives recognition to the fact that families and individuals know how to use their hard-earned dollars more productively than bureaucrats and politicians in Washington. <p> 
<blockquote><i>The average American family head will be forced to do 20 years' labor to pay taxes in his or
her lifetime</i><br>
<b>--James Bovard</b><br>
<i>Lost Rights</i><p>
</blockquote>
<b> $500 Per-Child Family Tax Credit</b><p>
More money in the hands of consumers and the productive economy is good for small
businesses and economic growth.  Some Washington "experts" dismiss the impact of tax relief
for families.  The real experts -- American families (many of whom own a small business) spend
more on taxes than food, shelter and clothing combined.<p>

Benefitting about 50 million families, the $500 per-child tax credit becomes effective in 1996. 
All families with incomes up to $200,000 are eligible.<p>

<b>Anti-Marriage Bias Reformed</b><p>

The 1993 tax package had the unfortunate impact of imposing higher taxes on married
couples than they would pay if single.  The Act begins to erase the bias toward married couples
by reforming the tax code. The proposal calls for up to $2 billion dollars in relief.<p>
     
<b>The American Dream Savings Account</b><p>

The U.S. tax code needs to encourage savings in America -- increased savings provides more
capital for investment in small businesses and the future of America.  The Act permits
individuals to contribute up to $2,000 into a special savings account.  An individual pays taxes
on the amount contributed, but not on amounts withdrawn, when utilized for:<p>
<ul>
<li>Post-secondary educational expenses for a spouse, child or the account holder.
<li>Medical costs, including the purchase of long term care insurance.
<li>Retirement income.
<li>A first-time home purchase.
 </ul><p>

<blockquote>
<i>Small business incentives, capital gains cut and indexation, neutral cost recovery, risk
assessment/cost-benefit analysis, strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act and unfunded
mandate reform to create jobs and raise worker wages</i>.    -- <b><i>Contract</i> With
America</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
     Ask American small business what most threatens their survival, and the likely response is
either taxes, or regulations, or both. The U.S. government,  whose job it is to protect and preserve America's free enterprise system, has become a foe of the private-sector.                                   
 <p> 
<blockquote>
<i>The dissatisfaction with Washington that small business feels can't be exaggerated.  A
nationwide poll by he Small Business Survival Committee found two-thirds of owners and
employees believe the government is a serious obstacle to their pursuit of the American
Dream.</i><br>
<i>--The Wall Street Journal</i>, December 2, 1994<p>
</blockquote>
    <i> The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act</i> addresses two main areas --  taxes and
regulations -- where the combined burden  of both is slowly strangling productive entrepreneurial
activity.<p>
<b>Small Business Incentives</b><p>
Small business, and the entrepreneurial spirit that drives America, continues to be a constant
in America's economy -- past, present and future.  As corporations continue to downsize, and
more men and women in their productive earning years are forced to "retire," many of these
experienced workers are starting a business.<p>

The number of home-based businesses has sky-rocketed. The technological revolution has
totally changed the way America does business.  Nearly 40 million Americans now work in their
homes.  Because small business and entrepreneurs are the backbone of the American economy,
the <i>Contract</i> calls for specifics to "prime the pump" for small business growth.<p>

<i>     The Act:</i>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Clarifies the deduction for home-offices: where the office is essential to the user's
business, taxpayers who use their office on an exclusive and regular basis, and perform tasks in
the office that cannot be fulfilled elsewhere, will qualify for the deduction.<p>
<li>Expensing:  Small businesses would be able to deduct the first $25,000 invested in
equipment and inventory. <p>
<li>The Estate Tax Exemption:  increased from $600,000 to $750,000 to help small
businesses pass on a family-owned enterprise to the next generation.        <p>
</ul>
<b>Capital Gains Tax Cut</b><p>
Venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends, or from professional investors,
remains a critical source of funding for entrepreneurial enterprises. <p>

     The <i>Contract</i> proposes a reduction in the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8
percent by  providing for a    50-percent exclusion on capital gains income, and indexing the rate for    
inflation.              <p>
<blockquote>
<i>Combined with indexation, reducing the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent could be the
most pro-growth step taken by the new Congress ... encouragement for private-sector investment
in small business needs to be enhanced.</i><br>
<b>--Ray Keating</b><br>
Economics Advisor, Small Business Survival Committee<br>
<i>Small Business Tax Watch 1995</i><p>
</blockquote>
     Opponents of the capital gains tax cut contend it is a tax break for the wealthy. Based on 1992
tax returns however, 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000
or less (including the gain.)<p>

     In order to undertake and/or expand a small business, one needs capital.  Without adequate
capital, new ideas and businesses either never  make it to the marketplace or they die a premature
death.  The capital gains tax cut would greatly strengthen incentives for investment and
entrepreneurship.<p>

<center>
<b>"GET GOVERNMENT OFF OUR BACKS" MAKING REGULATORS  ACCOUNTABLE<p></b>
</center>
     The impact of excessive government regulation on small businesses, individuals and the U.S.
economy is staggering. Respected           sources place        the yearly               regulatory          burden on the      
economy as high             as $400--$500 billion.           <p>

<blockquote>
<i>There are at least 3 million fewer jobs in the American economy today than would have
existed if the growth of regulation over the last twenty years had been slower and regulations
more efficiently designed.</i>                       <p>
<b>--William Laffer III</b>, Heritage Foundation<br>
<i>How Regulation is Destroying American Jobs,</i> February 1993<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Regulations <b>and</b> regulators are out of control.  In addition to the fact that there are
simply too many, regulators are not required to weigh the cost of proposed regulations. What is
usually measured is simply the utopian benefits.<p>

     The <i>Act</i> proposes a common-sense approach to the regulatory process including:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> Cost-Benefit Analysis</b>:      A stringent requirement that regulatory agencies provide the
true economic and compliance costs of proposed regulations.  How much more will consumers
pay, how many jobs will be impacted, will the proposed regulation retard or lower wages, and is
small business growth jeopardized?<br>
<li><b>Risk Assessment:</b>   Federal agencies would
be required to assess the risk to human health and safety of each newly proposed regulation.<br>
<li><b>Peer  Review</b>:  An independent peer review panel would be established in each of
the agencies to accredit the assessment.  The most credible and best available scientific data
would be required.<br>
<li><b>Regulatory Budget</b>:  The bill requires that federal agencies issue an annual
summary to the American people forecasting the compliance cost of all regulations on the private
sector.  The projected cost will be capped below its present level, forcing agencies to become
more cost-conscious of the national regulatory burden,  slowing the tidal wave of new
regulations. <br>
<li><b>Paperwork Reduction Act and Regulatory Flexibility Act Strengthened:</b>  The
federal government would be required to reduce the annual paperwork burden on Americans by 5
percent annually.  The "Reg. Flex Act"--  a law already on the books to protect small businesses
from burdensome regulations, would be subjected to judicial review, meaning  that small
businesses can sue the government to enforce the law.<br>
<li><b>Regulatory Impact Analysis:</b>  Federal agencies would be required to complete a
full evaluation and appraisal in the drafting phase of a major rule (affecting more than 100 people
or costing more than $1 million.)  In addition to determining whether the proposed rule concurs or perhaps clashes with current law, the analysis will include cost-effectiveness, persons impacted, implementation cost, and other specific criteria.  Real justification would accompany new regulations.<br>
<li><b>"Citizens' Bill of Rights:"</b>  The  power of federal regulators              has increased       
   steadily over            the years with          many                    businesses                          fearing an 
                     investigation                  and/or                   inspection by              a federal agency.     
     The bill would                     require that federal inspectors read businesses and individuals
their rights when faced with a complaint for an infraction.  Under the "Bill of Rights" an
individual can refuse a warrantless search, be present at the time of inspection  and, among other
rights, be reimbursed for excessive  damages.<p>

</blockquote>
<li><b>Private Property Rights:</b>  The Environmental Protection Agency, acting under such
laws as the Endangered Species Act has eroded our constitutionally protected  private
property rights.  The Act compensates property owners for the fair market value of their property
(up to 10 percent) for any reduction in the value of the property caused by federal government
law.<br> 
<li><b>Taxpayer Debt Buydown: </b>The Act creates a mechanism for taxpayers to designate
up to 10 percent of their tax
liability to help pay off the national debt.  The Congress would be required to cut spending by the
amount requested by taxpayers in the "debt buydown."<br>   
<li><b>Unfunded Mandates:</b>  How much more do you pay in state or local taxes due to
mandates imposed on local governments from Washington?  Unfunded mandates cause state and
local governments to raise taxes and strip away their ability to provide good, traditional local
services.  The <i>Act</i> requires that the federal government determine the costs of present
unfunded mandates, and begins to ease this burdenon states and localities by requiring a
reduction in those levels.<p>

<p>
While everyone is harmed by the abuse of our civil justice system (except, perhaps, the lawyers) 
small businesses are particularly hard hit.  A small business owner in any number of fields or
ventures can be put out of business overnight by becoming the target of even a questionable legal
claim.  Logic is thrown out the window in tort law.  It seems that if your business involves any
risk (which inherently it does) it's not a matter of when "it" will happen, but how much "it" will
cost.<p>

reason and balance must be restored."<br>
<b>Larry Burkett</b><br>
<i> What Ever Happened To The American Dream</i><p>
</blockquote>

Elements of the <i>Act</i> that will help stem the tide of the litigation explosion include:<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Loser-Pays Rule:</b>  To discourage the pursuit of weak law suits, the <i>Contract</i>
proposes that the losing party in the law suit pay the attorney's fees of the winner. The amount,
however  is limited to the total cost of the loser's own legal fees.  The rule only applies to cases
in federal courts, but the states are encouraged to adopt the same kind of rules.   The rule
promotes settlement as opposed to litigation by requiring that claimants notify the other party
prior to filing of the suit.  This step should open the doors of communication prior to going to
court, thus allowing more conflicts to be settled informally rather than through expensive,
lengthy litigation.<p>

<li><b>Product Liability Reform: </b> The <i>Contract</i> legislation creates a nationwide
uniform product liability law for punitive damages, joint and several liability, and fault-based
liability for product sellers.  Currently, business  must deal with 50 different state laws on top of
federal law.  The bill requires that "clear and convincing evidence" be established by claimants to
prove harm was caused by malicious conduct.  If harm is proved, punitive damages  are restricted
to three times the actual harm.<p>
     
Joint liability for noneconomic injuries is abolished under the Act.  Defendants are also only
liable for their own share of the wrong.  This aspect of the <i>Contract</i> addresses the
"deep-pockets" issue.   Businesses that only sell products will also be protected.  Product sellers
will be liable only for the wrong generated by their own negligence.  Sellers would be held liable
for product errors when manufacturers lack funds for the settlement or can't be brought to
court.<p>

<li><b>Prior Notice: </b> Written notice must be given to the defendant at least thirty days
before a plaintiff can bring suit.  The notice must include specifics of the suit and what the
plaintiff is seeking in damages.<p>

<li><b>Checklist for Congress: </b>The laws created by Congress often create years of
expensive litigation.  Legislation that is drafted in a vacuum, or when Congress fails to deal with
the all-important specifics,  often end up in the courts and usually the Supreme Court. 
Committees drafting legislation will be given a check list of items (e.g.: will the law be
retroactive and will the law apply to the government) to help minimize the possibility of court
action.<p>

<li><b>Strike Suits:</b> The proliferation of class-action shareholder law suits is hitting small
and medium-size growth companies very hard. In this type of suit  attorneys sue the company
because the stock purchases did not "live up to expectations."  These claims are particularly
hurtful to job creation and economic growth.  The Act clamps down on attorneys and stock
buyers who abuse the system by making a full-time racket out of shareholder class-action suits. 
In addition to other meaningful reforms, claimants must prove that they were intentionally
misinformed.<p>

<li><b>Honesty in Evidence and Lawyer Accountability:  </b>So-called experts are used daily
in the courts to justify often absurd claims.  In the federal courts the Act would disallow
testimony based on "junk-science,"  and would not allow experts to receive contingency fees (the
judge may, however, waive this in some cases.)  The Act will encourage the states to require that
attorneys justify contingency fees.  Laws that penalize attorneys for willfully adding to the cost
of litigations will  be strengthened.<p>

<b><a name="conclusion">CONCLUSION</a>:</b><br>
<a href="#contents"><font size="-1">(contents)</a></font><br>
<p>
</center>
 The new Congress, and the agenda devised in <i>The Contract With America</i>, will certainly
make 1995 the "Year of Small Business."  Indeed, policy and legislative decisions for this year
will have a renewed focus on those segments of society representing the  backbone, and the
foundation, of American society and the economy -- small business tops the list.<p>

Powerful special interests, however, will fight to keep this agenda from passing Congress. 
Opponents of limited government will try to persuade the American people that wholesale chaos
will erupt if sizeable spending cuts are enacted, or if the Congress begins to strip away some of
the burdensome regulation that is choking free enterprise.     The Small Business Survival
Committee encourages you to contact your United States Representative and Senators and ask
them to be bold, and pass the components of <i>The Contract With America</i> outlined in this
pamphlet.  You can reach them at:<p>

</center>  
<p>
     ...Thereafter, within the first 100 days of the 104th Congress, we shall bring to the House
Floor the following bills, each to be given full and open debate, each to be given a clear and fair
vote and each to be immediately available this day for public inspection and scrutiny.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Fiscal Responsibility Act: </b> A balanced budget/tax limitation amendment and a
legislative line-item veto to restore fiscal responsibility to an out-of-control Congress, requiring
them to live under the same budget constraints as families and businesses.<p>
<li><b>The Taking Back Our Streets Act:  </b>An anti-crime package including stronger
truth-in-sentencing, "good faith" exclusionary rule exemptions, effective death penalty
provisions, and cuts in social spending from this summer's "crime" bill to fund prison
construction and additional law enforcement to keep people secure in their neighborhoods and
kids safe in their schools.<p>
<li><b>The Personal Responsibility Act:</b> Discourage illegitimacy and teen pregnancy by
prohibiting welfare to minor mothers and denying increased AFDC for additional children while
on welfare, cut spending for welfare programs, and enact a tough two-years-and-out provision
with work requirements to promote individual responsibility.<p>
<li><b>The Family Reinforcement Act: </b>Child support enforcement, tax incentives for
adoption,  strengthening rights of parents in their children's education, stronger child
pornography laws, and an elderly dependent care tax credit to reinforce the central role of
families in American society.<p>
<li><b>The American Dream Restoration Act:</b>  A $500 per child tax credit, begin repeal of
the marriage tax penalty, and creation of American Dream Savings Accounts to provide middle
class tax relief.<p>
<li><b> The National Security Restoration Act:</b>  No U.S. troops under U.N. command and
restoration of the essential parts of our national security funding to strengthen our national
defense and maintain our credibility around the world.<p>
<li><b> The Senior Citizens Fairness Act:  </b>Raise the Social Security earnings limit which
currently forces seniors out of the work force, repeal the 1993 tax hikes on Social Security
benefits and provide tax incentives for private long-term care insurance to let Older Americans
keep more of what they have earned over the years.<p>
<li><b>The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act: </b> Small business incentives, capital
gains cut and indexation, neutral cost recovery, risk assessment/cost-benefit analysis,
strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act and unfunded mandate reform to create jobs and
raise worker wages.<p>
<li><b>The Common Sense Legal Reform Act: </b> "Loser pays" laws, reasonable limits on
punitive damages and reform of product liability laws to stem the endless tide of litigation.<p>
<li><b>The Citizen Legislature Act: </b> A first-ever vote on term limits to replace career
politicians with citizen legislators.<p>
</ul>
     Further, we will instruct the House Budget Committee to report to the floor and we will work
to enact additional budget savings, beyond the budget cuts specifically included in the legislation
described above, to ensure that the Federal budget deficit will be less than it would have been
without the enactment of these bills.<p>

<center><h3><I>Small Business</I> Budget Watch</h3> 
<i>November 1995</i> 
<P>
<I><B>Talking Points on H.R. 2472 (Davis-Bacon Expansion)</B></I>
<hr size="3" width="45%"></center>
<UL>
<LI>H.R. 2472 expands the coverage of Davis-Bacon off-site. This
bill applies inflated Davis-Bacon wage rates to <I>&quot;laborers
and mechanics employed by the contractor or subcontractor to work
directly upon the site of the work, including work at fabrication
plants, batch plants, tool yards, rock pits, or similar facilities

... that are not located on the project site, but the principal
purpose is to provide construction materials for the project;
and laborers and mechanics employed by a contractor or subcontractor

... to transport debris, materials, supplies, and equipment to
or from the site of the work...&quot;</I> 
<P>Obviously, this will
dramatically increase the cost of federal construction as other
industries are drawn into the Davis-Bacon wage trap. This bill
also would apply Davis-Bacon to all federally-assisted construction
(presently, Davis-Bacon applies only to contracts entered into
by the federal government or through related acts). Small firms
which materially support and transport material to/from federal
projects and those who perform work on federally assisted projects
would be severely burdened by the expansion of this harmful law.
<P>
<LI>While this bill would raise the Davis-Bacon threshold to $100,000,
it fails to produce any real cost savings. Although roughly two-thirds
of the total number of federal contracts will be eliminated from
Davis-Bacon requirements, less than 4% of the dollar volume of
federal contracts will be eliminated, resulting in minuscule savings
for the taxpayer. The renovation and repair threshold, which would
apply to <I>&quot;repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or alteration,
including painting and decorating, of public buildings or public
works of the United States...&quot;</I> is set at $25,000 -- this
creates a bifurcated threshold, which will increase legal and
administrative burdens.
<P><LI>This bill would allow any &quot;laborer, mechanic, or organization&quot;
to petition the Secretary of Labor in order to determine the applicability
of Davis-Bacon. This provision would increase the likelihood of
legal squabbles. Many small firms cannot absorb such litigation
costs.
<P><LI>This &quot;reform&quot; does not even significantly reduce
the Davis-Bacon paperwork requirements imposed on contractors.
</UL>

<P>
This bill is not reform, it's a ploy to increase the applicability
of the Davis-Bacon Act. Actually, Davis-Bacon is not reformable
-- it has no place in American government. This law, which has
cost taxpayers billions of dollars and denied opportunity to small
firms and minority workers, can prove useful only if eliminated.
Reports of fraud indicate that as long as Davis-Bacon exists,
it will continue to impose unjust, wasteful costs on taxpayers.
Time is running out on the Davis-Bacon Act, as Congress and the
public are beginning to realize it is beyond repair.

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Independent Contractors</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h2>Independent Contractors</h2><hr width="45%" size="4"><P>
</center>
On June 30, 1995, Representative Jon Christensen (R-NE) introduced
H.R. 1972, the &quot;Independent Contractor Tax Simplification
Act of 1995.&quot;  This piece of legislation seeks to establish
clear criteria for defining the tax status for the self-employed
as independent contractor.  Currently, the IRS subjects numerous
individuals who work autonomously to an infamous 20-factor test.
<P>
 This test challenges the tax status of many of those who choose
to work independently.  Additionally, the ambiguous, subjective
20-factor test may reclassify independent contractors as employees,
causing back-taxes and penalties for the business contracting
with the individual.
<P>
Rep. Christensen's bill would clearly state who is not an employee,
and it allows independent contractors to avoid the 20-factor test.
<P>
 Currently H.R. 1972 is in the House Ways and Means Committee.
<P>
Despite large support from the small business community and many
legislators, this bill requires a continuous effort to ensure
passage.  For more information, see Karen Kerrigan's article &quot;IRS
should revise contract-worker tests.&quot;
<P>
Send a letter to the following Senators and Congressman expressing your support of the Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act:<p>

<a href="/sbsc/l-ic-gephardt.html">Minority Leader Richard Gephardt</a><br>
<a href="/sbsc/l-ic-daschle.html">Minority Leader Tom Daschle</a><br>

Dear Representative:

I encourage you to act in favor of the self-employed and 
small business owners by embracing reform of the status of 
independent contractors. I urge you to support and 
co-sponsor H.R. 1972, the "Independent Contractor Tax 
Simplification Act," introduced by Congressman Jon 
Cristensen (R-NE). 

H.R. 1972 simplifies the tax relationship between the 
business and the independent contractor by defining who is 
not an employee. 

This bill outlines clear, distinct criteria for those 
seeking to perform services as an independent contractor. 
As you are probably aware, independent contractors and small
business owners are presently forced to comply with the 
infamous 20-factor test - an ambiguous tool of the IRS which
lures independent contractors into a spiral of unnecessary 
legalese and expense. 

Many entrepreneurs and small business owners do not have the
time or resources to fight the 20-factor test, some of these 
job producers are forced to close their doors. One recent 
estimate that the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent 
contractors and collected $678 million in fines and back 
taxes over the past several years. 

Clearly there is an institutional bias for the IRS to 
reclassify independent contractors as employees. It would 
be intolerable if Congress failed to pursue reform of the 
20-factor test. 

Small businesses and entrepreneurs, the largest job creators
of our economy, should not be forced to comply with an 
unending string of arbitrary and outdated IRS rules. The 
20-factor test is a prime example of bad tax policy. I 
strongly support Congressman Christensen's bill and I ask 
you to do the same. 

Sincerely,

<blockquote>
When small business owners, entrepreneurs and concerned taxpayers take part in the lobbying process, our efforts to reform America's fiscal policies are enhanced.  And yet, many people say that writing letters to Congress to express your concern is a waste of time -- this belief is dead wrong.
<P>
Members of Congress spend most of their time trying to gauge their constituents concerns.  For this reason, congressional offices record the number of constituent responses (letters, faxes, email, mail) to pending and current issues.  Furthermore, congressional staff read and respond to correspondence.  SBSC encourages you to take the time to contact Members of Congress.  
<P>
In order to expedite the process of voicing your concerns, we have posted letters to send to your Congressman and issue descriptions of a few "hot" small business issues.  (We will update the 'hot' issues regularly.)  We suggest that if you decide to send a letter, send it on business letterhead (letterhead grants the issue more attention).  If you have any questions pertaining to contacting members of Congress, or if you would like to see other types of letters posted, please contact SBSC's Christian Cali at 1-800-233-7526 or 202-785-0238.
<p>

Should you decide to send your Congressman or Senator a letter, 
the proper address for Members of Congress is as follows:
<P>
The Honorable -----------------
<br>United States House of Representatives
<br>Washington, DC  20515
<P>
OR
<P>
The Honorable ------------------
<br>United States Senate
<br>Washington, DC  20510
<P>
(Or call your Representative or Senator at 202-224-3121 to voice your opinion or to obtain the fax numbers of your elected officials.) 
<P>

<P>
U.S. Senator _____________
<P>
United States Senate
<P>
Washington, DC 20510<BR>

<P>
Dear Senator ____________:<BR>

<P>
As a small business owner heavily burdened by taxes, I am writing
to urge your support of Senator John Kyl's efforts to eliminate
the federal estate, gift and generation&#173;skipping taxes. 
His &quot;Family Heritage Preservation Act&quot; is long overdue.
 Death taxes must be abolished, nothing less will suffice.<BR>

<P>
I work hard for my family and my employees.  Along the way, I
seem to pay almost every tax imaginable, including income, payroll,
sales and property taxes, not to mention a wide range of fees.
 Naturally, these taxes make it very difficult for me to build
up savings and make additional investment in my business.<BR>

<P>
On top of all this, the government imposes various death taxes.
 It is incomprehensible to me that after paying taxes all my life
&#173;&#173; both personal and business &#173;&#173; the government
could take up to 55% of my buinsess and personal assets.  <BR>

<P>
Please tell me what kind of an incentive I have to continue investing
in and expanding my business?  Indeed, as I get older, why should
I continue in business at all?<BR>

<P>
It is my hope that the business I built will continue on after
I'm gone, hopefully under the guidance of one of my children or
grandchildren.  The federal government's death taxes make this
dream less likely.  It is my understanding that 60% of businesses
fail to make it to a second generation, and 90% don't survive
to a third.  No doubt taxes are a major cause for this dismal
survival rate.  <BR>

<P>
In addition, for all the trouble caused, federal death taxes apparently
count for only 1 percent of federal revenues.  It seems to me
that the government would be far better off getting rid of these
taxes, and thereby encouraging more investment.<BR>

<P>
Again, I urge you to support the &quot;Family Heritage Preservation
Act.&quot;  I don't think it is fair to pay taxes all your life,
and then have the government ask for even more at death.  I believe
that the inherent unfairness of the tax is something reasonable
members of both parties can agree on.  I urge you to repeal this
punitive job-killing tax.<BR>

<P>
Sincerely,<BR><P>

<htmL><HEAD><title>SBSC Issues:  Davis-Bacon Repeal</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2>Davis-Bacon Repeal</h2><p><hr size="4" width="45%"></center>
<P>SBSC has fought hard for the repeal of the notorious Davis-Bacon Act.  This Act was enacted six decades ago in an effort to reduce the influx of black southern workers into northern federal construction projects.  The Act grants the federal government power to determine an area's "prevailing wage."  This anti-market provision has resulted in driving the costs of construction up, thereby increasing costs to taxpayers, while simultaneously creating a large paperwork burden.  Davis-Bacon has prevented small construction firms, who cannot afford to pay the inflated prevailing wages, from competing for federal construction projects.  Davis-Bacon has also prevented many contractors from hiring minority and unskilled workers, who are denied employment opportunity due to hiring preferences resulting from Davis-Bacon.
<P>
Davis-Bacon repeal was recently taken out of the Republican budget bill, and some members of Congress wish to strengthen Davis-Bacon (which they mistakingly call "reform") by applying it to off-site construction. The Department of Labor recently imposed Davis-Bacon wage and paperwork requirements on those who build ships for the federal government.  Obviously, it is important that we step up the fight for Davis-Bacon repeal.  
<P><i>See Karen Kerrigan's testimony "<a href="/sbsc/ct2-15-5.html">Repeal of the Davis Bacon Act</a>", or Raymond Keating's "<a href="/sbsc/reg1-5.html">Repeal the Davis Bacon Act</a>" for more information.</i>

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Immigration Reform</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3> Immigration Reform Act of 1995, S. 1394
<P>
Immigration in the National Interest Act, H.R. 2202</h3><hr width="45%" size="4"><P>
</center>
In the name of immigration reform, the House immigration subcommittee
recently passed H.R. 2202 sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith
(R. TX).  Contrary to the smaller-government principles espoused
by the Republican Congress, H.R. 2202 and similar Senate proposals
(S.269 and S. 1394), increase federal government spending, expand
governmental control over businesses, and will ultimately weaken
the United States' economy.  
<P>
The latest statistical report from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) noted a drop in United States legal immigration
for the fiscal year 1994.  Ironically, our nation's legislators
and presidential hopefuls believe that illegal immigration and
legal immigration are pressing national problems requiring immediate
and drastic measures.  
<P>
The Senate immigration subcommittee will soon begin markup of
Senator Alan Simpson's (R. WY) legal immigration proposal, S.
1394.  Unfortunately, Senator Simpson's legal immigration legislation
intensifies the restrictive measures of H.R. 2202.
<P>
Senator Simpson seeks a 25% tax on businesses that hire foreign
workers.  Under S. 1394, companies hiring foreign help would have
to pay a tax equal to one-quarter of the employee's annual compensation
including wages and benefits.  In addition, employers would be
forced to pay that employee 105% of the prevailing wage (an expansion
of the job-killing Davis-Bacon Act).
<P>
  Moreover, H.R. 2202 and S. 269 (a similar Senate <I>illegal
</I>immigration proposal authored by Senator Simpson) mandate
another costly regulation on businesses -- employment verification
system.  Analysts estimate that this latest government-imposed
absurdity, will costs U.S. businesses approximately $4.4 billion
dollars.  And analysts predict the system will do nothing to halt
illegal immigration.
<P>
Furthermore, economists predict U.S. businesses will feel the
force of the mandate at least three times: first, when taxes are
raised to pay for the creation of the database; second, when employers
are required to purchase the machinery to operate the verification
system; and third, when employers are denied eligible employees
because of flawed data. 
<P>
The Clinton Administration and sponsors of the immigration reform
measures are expanding big government to unimaginable levels.
<P>
 Unfortunately, the majority of persons who will get caught in
the system will be American citizens, whose right to work should
never be hindered, and the employer, whose right to employ should
never be relinquished to a government entity.
<P>
For more information on the telephone verification system, see
Karen Kerrigan's Small Business Briefing article Worker Database
Could Cost Businesses Billions.
<P>

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Minimum Wage</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h2>Minimum Wage</h2><hr width="45%" size="4">
<p></center>
Congress is once again considering a minimum wage hike.  The Senate recently approved a procedural motion that will bring a minimum wage increase vote within the next several months. The minimum wage, which is politically popular, is most harmful to small businesses.  Most employers pay above the minimum wage, and many determine wages according to the minimum wage.  Thus an increase in the minimum wage will have a ripple effect on the wages paid by businesses - many small firms simply cannot absorb such a budget impact.

<center><h2>News Release<P>
Small Business Advocate Supports Return to Citizen Congress</h2>
<i>November 16, 1995</i>		</center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) 785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> - The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a 40,000 member small business advocacy organization,
announced support for an effort to historically change Congress.
 SBSC president Karen Kerrigan voiced support for the Citizen
Congress Act and its sponsors - Representatives Mark Sanford and
Wayne Allard and Senator Bill Frist.
<P>
&quot;The American people are tired of business as usual in Washington,
D.C.  The failure to enact congressional term limits adds to the
importance of implementing a bold initiative such as the Citizen
Congress Act, which we hope will change the face of Washington,&quot;
remarked Kerrigan.
<P>
If enacted, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act will
help restore the faith of the American people in their elected
officials.  For too long, voters have been made promises while
important measures such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment
have not materialized.  By eliminating perks and wasteful practices
from within, Congress can begin to reverse the empty rhetoric
of the past several years.
<P>
According to SBSC, Abolishment of the federal pension system,
banning franked mass mailings, no automatic pay increases, and
limited military aircraft travel are significant reforms which
reduce government spending.  At a time when the country's fiscal
condition is instable, there is little reason not to tighten Congress'
belt.
<P>
Because federal lawmakers have failed to implement the wishes
of the public in regards to term limits, the Citizen Congress
Act will remind Members of their responsibility to the public.
 Voters, particularly small business owners, want the Congress
to be more accountable in every regard.
<P>
&quot;The Citizen Congress Act symbolizes a time-honored American
virtue - self-sacrifice.  We encourage all Members of Congress
to support this important initiative,&quot; Kerrigan added.
<P>

Dear Representative 

After years of empty rhetoric, I am glad to see true reform 
brewing in Congress.  I look forward to the day when 
Congress reforms itself via the Citizen Congress Act.

If passed, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act 
will help restore my faith in elected officials.  For too 
long, we have been made promises while important measures 
such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment have 
not materialized.

By eliminating perks and wasteful practices from within, 
Congress can begin to reverse the hollow promises of the 
past several years. Abolishment of the federal pension 
system, elimination of franked mass mailings, non-automatic
pay increases, and reduced military aircraft travel are 
significant reforms which also reduce government spending. 
At a time when the country's budget is in poor fiscal 
condition, there is little reason not to tighten the belt 
of Congress.

I was disappointed to see term limits measures fail, yet 
I believe that the Citizen Congress Act is a step in the 
right direction in regards to congressional reform.  I 
understand that Members of Congress work hard and are 
very busy, but I also believe Congress needs to truly 
reidentify with the voters of this country.  I ask that 
you pledge support for this measure, and I look forward
to your reply.

<title>Repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act</title>
</head>

<h3>Repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act</h3>
Testimony of Karen Kerrigan, President<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<p>

Before the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections <br>
Committee on 
Economic and Educational Opportunities <br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
February 15, 1995
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. My name is Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) a 40,000-member nonprofit, nonpartisan small business, grassroots advocacy organization SBSC is also a member of the Coalition to Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, a diverse coalition of national business associations, state and local governments and citizens groups who share the belief that the Davis-Bacon Act is long overdue for repeal.<p>

SBSC, as well as the Coalition to Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act thank you, Chairman Ballenger, and the Committee for your leadership in holding hearings on this most important issue. For years, hard-working small business owners and lower-income Americans searching for opportunities to jump on the economic ladder have been denied that access in the construction industry due to government-sponsored special interest protectionism. The Davis-Bacon Act fosters the most egregious of distortions, and we appreciate being a part of this forum today to discuss how to alleviate the economic and fiscal damage promoted by the Act, while giving more Americans -- especially within our inner-cities -- a greater chance to take that initial step on the economic ladder.<p>

Imagine for a moment, the following question on a national voter referendum, especially during the past campaign cycle:<p>

Should the United States Congress and President Clinton repeal a regulatory act that denies opportunity to lower-income workers; panders to special interests; claims racist origins; increases cost to taxpayers and the economy; and hurts small business?<p>

The answer, of course, would be a resounding "yes." The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 does all of the above, and therefore should be repealed.<p>

Passing the Davis-Bacon Act was wrong in 1931 , and keeping it as law is wrong today. New York Representative Robert L. Bacon and Pennsylvania Senator James J. Davis introduced the bill, and President Herbert Hoover signed it -- limiting the benefits of competition, while pandering to organized labor and racism.<p>

By now, most politicians cannot claim ignorance of the racist origins of the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act. The law was introduced and passed to block wage
 competition from black construction workers following an Alabama contractor's successful bid on a federal construction project on New York's Long Island in 1927. The southern contractor employed black construction workers and successfully underbid the local union contractor.<p>

Congressional supporters of the legislation at the time eagerly supported the Act's racial leanings. A through the <i>Congressional Record</i> of 1931 makes this clear. For example, Rep. Clayton Allgood spoke of "cheap colored labor" that is in "competition with white labor throughout the country." Another DavisBacon supporter Rep. John J. Cochran of Missouri said: "I have received numerous cornplaints in recent months about southern contractors employing lowpaid colored mechanics getting work and bringing the employees from the south." Similar references were made by other lawmakers as well.<p>

Just as was the case in 1931, low income earners, especially inner-city minorities, continue to be hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act. Less-skilled, generally non-union workers are denied economic opportunity, as Davis-Bacon inflates wages beyond the point where it makes economic sense for contractors to employ such individuals. In particular, small businesses in inner-cities which are willing to provide critical experience to less-skilled workers are denied that opportunity due to government wage rates that do not reflect economic reality.<p>

The Davis-Bacon Act mandates that a "prevailing wage," usually the union rate, be paid on all federally-funded construction projects. Governmentdetermined "prevailing wages" often well exceed the actual prevailing wages in an area. Many small contractors cannot afford to pay these government-imposed higher wage rates, and are thus shut out of federally-funded 
construction projects.<p>

In an effort that even central planners in the former Soviet Union might have shied away from, the Department of Labor makes tens of thousands of wage determinations annually to guide Davis-Bacon contracts. The "prevailing wage" determination relies heavily on union collective bargaining agreements within a locality. Surveys are rarely conducted, and a "locality" can often mean an enormous geographic region. University of Chicago economist Yale Brozen found the "prevailing wage" for the Appalachian region of Western Pennsylvania set at the same level as Pittsburgh, a city known for its high concentration of union workers.<p>

 Inflated wage rates and rigid job classifications, along with complex and voluminous paperwork requirements demand that firms become less-efficient in order to compete
 for Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

The paperwork requirements associated with Davis-Bacon take a particularly heavy toll on small contractors. In 1934, the Copeland Act was passed, requiring employers on Davis-Bacon contracts to submit payroll records to the Department of Labor or the contracting agency on a <u>weeklv</u> basis. These weekly certified payroll reports alone cost employers on Davis-Bacon contracts in excess of $100 million per year. The Copeland Act requirement forces many contractors to hire additional clerical employees, invest in additional equipment, and/or alter their payroll schedules. The result: higher costs that discourage or exclude small contractors from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

As these higher costs exclude many small businesses from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts, costs to taxpayers are pushed even higher due to limited competition.<p>

Minority and women-owned businesses, which predominate among small construction firms, are especially hurt. This is seen most clearly in the innercities, where a large proportion of federal construction dollars is concentrated. In addition, large non-local construction firms that specialize in Davis-Bacon projects undercut small local contractors. Minority and independent contractors cannot compete, due to the inherent inefficiencies and regulatory burdens associated with Davis-Bacon.<p>

Part of the original intent of Davis-Bacon was to protect local workers from contractors outside the region. But the actual effect is often to protect outside union labor from competition from local, but non-union, workers. On Davis-Bacon projects you will often find out-of-town union journeymen performing work that could easily be done by local non-union workers.<p>

With small and minority contractors shut out from bidding on federal construction projects, minorities in the inner-cities are shut out from job opportunities as well. If contractors are forced to pay one "prevailing wage" they will always chose the already skilled worker, restricting availability for job opportunities. Often, many unemployed individuals are prevented from working on projects in their own neighborhood.<p>

 Wages are best determined in a competitive marketplace, not according to the unrealistic estimates from government bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. The market allows wages and costs to adjust according to a host of criteria, including competition, skill levels and productivity, demand, supply, capital investment, et al. The Davis-Bacon Act's wage criteria distort the marketplace, artificially favoring large businesses over small, entrepreneurial firms; and higher-skilled and higher-paid workers over less-experienced, lower-skilled workers, regardless of job criteria.<p>

Lack of competition, increased paperwork, and inflated wages mean higher costs for taxpayers and the economy. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 1994, if Davis-Bacon were repealed federal taxpayers would conservatively save $3.1 billion over the following five years. Allowing the use of helpers, or semi-skilled workers would save an additional $500 million a year, bringing total savings from repeal to nearly $6 billion over five years. The Davis-Bacon Act inflates the cost of federal construction by an average of 5 percent to 15 percent. And, the GAO and CBO estimates do not include the costs of foregone competition -- raising the total cost of Davis-Bacon even higher.<p>

Local officials have estimated that Davis-Bacon increased the cost of various community development projects by 20 percent to 50 percent. Also, an Oregon State University study estimated cost inflation on federally-funded construction contracts in rural areas of 26 percent to 38 percent due to the Davis-Bacon Act.<p>

From a fiscal accountability perspective, as well as a moral one, there remains no sound reason to hold onto this legislative relic from the past. At a time when American taxpayers are demanding less and more efficient government, nothing more fully symbolizes a wasteful, meddling Washington than the Davis-Bacon Act. Symbolically and substantively, Davis-Bacon represents the distorted outcome of special interest protectionism. And, most pathetically, its original intent of preventing those who wish to jump on the economic ladder continues to this day.<p>

From a small business perspective, Davis-Bacon makes it impossible for union-free, efficient contractors to bid on federally-funded construction projects. We urge all members of Congress to further unleash the entrepreneurial spirit in every corner of America by repealing the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act.<p>

Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today.<p>

<h2>Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act</h2>
<h3>by Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
"By imposing high wages and restrictive work practices on nearly any federally funded construction project, the Davis-Bacon Act costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in excess construction fees every year -- and freezes tens of thousands of unskilled workers out of jobs."<p>
 
--Eugene H. Methvin, "<i>A Scandalous Law That's Costing Taxpayers Millions</i>," Reader's Digest,  December 1994
<p>
"Davis-Bacon increases costs to such an extent on federally-funded construction contracts that most small businesses are effectively precluded from bidding -- limiting competition and further raising costs for taxpayers."<p>
  --Karen Kerrigan, President, SBSC<p>
<hr>
<p>
Should the United States Congress and President Clinton repeal a regulatory act that denies opportunity to lower-income workers; panders to special interests; claims some racist origins; increases costs to taxpayers and the economy; and hurts small business?  Of course, the answer should be a resounding "yes."  The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 does all of the above, and therefore, should be repealed.<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act requires that contractors on federally-funded construction contracts in excess of $2,000 pay workers what is termed "prevailing wage" in the region.  Supporters claim that Davis-Bacon was passed to ensure that local labor standards prevailed and local wages were not driven lower.  Most others tell another story.<p>
 
<h3>Pandering to Organized Labor and Racism</h3>

In a December 1994 Reader's Digest article, Eugene H. Methvin writes that Davis-Bacon was a "cruel relic of the Jim Crow era."  He points out that Davis-Bacon "was born in the Great	Depression year of 1931, after an Alabama contractor had submitted the low bid to build a veterans hospital on New York's Long Island and hired black laborers who had been largely shut out of the higher-wage construction unions."  New York Representative Robert L. Bacon and Pennsylvania Senator James J. Davis introduced the bill to block lower wages, and President Herbert Hoover signed it -- limiting the benefits of competition, while pandering to organized labor and racism.<p>
Just as was the case in the 1930s, low-income earners, limiting competition especially inner-city minorities, continue to be hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Less-skilled, generally non-union workers are denied economic opportunity as Davis-Bacon inflates wages beyond the point where it makes economic sense for contractors to employ such inndividuals.<p>

<h3>Damaging Small Business</h3>

Small businesses are particularly hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Government-determined "prevailing wages" often well exceed the actual prevailing wages in an area.  In an effort that even central planners in the former Soviet Union might have shied away from, the Department of Labor makes tens of thousands of wage determinations annually to guide Davis-Bacon contracts.  Of course, these estimates tend to be arbitrary, dated, and/or rely solely on union rates.  Many small businesses cannot afford to pay these government-imposed higher wage rates.  In particular, small businesses in inner-cities, who are willing to provide critical experience to less-skilled workers, are denied that opportunity due to government wage rates that do not reflect economic reality.<p>

In addition, the paperwork requirements associated with Davis-Bacon take a particularly heavy toll on small contractors.  In 1934, the Copeland Act was passed requiring employers on Davis-Bacon contracts to submit payroll records to the Department of Labor or contracting agency on a weekly basis.  This requirement forces many small contractors to higher additional clerical employees, invest in additional equipment, and/or alter their payroll schedules.  The result: higher costs that discourage small contractors from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

As these higher costs exclude many small businesses from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts, costs to taxpayers are pushed even higher due to limited competition.<p>


<h3>Costs to Taxpayers and the Economy</h3>

This lack of competition, increased paperwork, and inflated wages, of course, translate into higher costs for taxpayers and the economy.  Various estimates of the increase in total construction costs due to the Davis-Bacon Act have been made, including:<a href="#foot1">1</a><p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 1993, if Davis-Bacon were repealed and Copeland Act requirements lifted, federal taxpayers would have saved $3 billion over the following five years.                                                         
<li>The Department of Defense estimated in the mid-1980s that Davis-Bacon induced an added cost premium of 5 percent.
<li>In 1979, the General Accounting Office (GAO) estimated an average cost inflation of 3 percent to 10 percent tied to Davis-Bacon.
<li>Some local officials have estimated that Davis-Bacon increased the cost of various community development projects by 20 percent to 50 percent.  Also, an Oregon State University study estimated cost inflation on federally-funded construction contracts in rural areas of 26 percent to 38 percent due to the Davis-Bacon Act.
<li>The GAO and CBO estimates do not include the costs of foregone competition -- raising the total cost of Davis-Bacon even higher.
</ul>

In addition, part of the Davis-Bacon rationale was to protect local workers from contractors outside the region.  Yet, as noted in a 1986 study by Armand J. Thieblot for the Wharton School, local contractors have gained a larger share of private contracts than they do Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

Also, the Davis-Bacon Act spawned numerous state-level imitators -- placing similar requirements on state and local government contracts.  Just as does the federal Davis-Bacon Act, these state acts raise costs for taxpayers, deny economic opportunity to many less-skilled workers, and damage small business.<p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Wages are best determined in a competitive marketplace, not according to the unrealistic estimates from Department of Labor bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.  The market allows wages and costs to adjust according to a host of criteria, including competition, skill levels and productivity, demand, supply, capital investment, et al.  The Davis-Bacon Act's wage criteria distorts the marketplace -- artificially favoring large businesses over small, entrepreneurial firms; and higher-skilled and paid workers over less-experienced, lower-skilled workers independent of job criteria.  Costs rise; the entrepreneur suffers; unemployment increases; and taxpayers foot the bill.<p>

The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) supports the straightforward remedy proposed by U.S. Representative Tom Delay (R-Tx.) to the many problems created by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Rep. Delay's bill simply reads: "Davis-Bacon of March 3, 1931 (known as the Davis-Bacon Act) is repealed."<p>

Raymond J. Keating serves as economics advisor to the Small Business Survival Committee, and is the co-author of D.C. By The Numbers: A State of Failure (University Press of America, 1995)<p>

Dear Congressman:


As a small business owner and taxpayer, I strongly encourage
you to support efforts to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act.  This
outdated, discriminatory act has cost hard working taxpayers
billions, and inhibited the opportunities of small
construction firms and unskilled (mostly minority) workers.

Davis-Bacon is an example of what's wrong with Washington.
This anti-market law has no place in our government, yet
lawmakers elected for change have been unable to repeal it.
I am shocked to hear that some Members of Congress actually
want to "reform" Davis-Bacon by expanding it.

When the Republicans pulled Davis-Bacon out of the budget
reconciliation bill they sent a signal to voters.  Such
activity told the public the majority party wasn't willing
to aggressively support bold regulatory and fiscal reform.
The confidence I had in Congress since the '94 election is
being eroded by the failures of this Congress to enact bold
reforms.  This failure only benefits special interests at
the expense of all taxpayers and our system of free
enterprise.

As a member of the Small Business Survival Committee, I
understand the implications of keeping a law like Davis-
Bacon on the books.  Time should have run out for Davis-
Bacon, and Members of Congress should repeal this harmful
law.

Sincerely,

Dear Senator: 

I urge you to terminate Senator Alan Simpson's (R. WY) legal 
immigration proposal, S. 1394, at the Senate subcommittee 
level. 

The Senate immigration subcommittee will soon begin markup 
of S. 1394. Unfortunately, Senator Simpson's legal 
immigration legislation intensifies the restrictive measures
of Representative Lamar Smith's (R. TX) immigration 
proposal, H.R. 2202. 

Senator Simpson seeks a 25% tax on businesses that hire 
foreign workers. Under S. 1394, companies hiring foreign 
help would have to pay a tax equal to one-quarter of 
the employee's annual compensation including wages and 
benefits. In addition, employers would be forced to pay 
that employee 105% of the prevailing wage (an expansion of 
the job-killing Davis-Bacon Act). 

Additionally, the new limits on skilled immigration coupled 
with the arbitrary experience requirements will 
significantly lower the number of skilled workers admitted 
to the U.S. annually. Moreover, elimination of the unskilled
immigration visas, prevents families from uniting. Unskilled
immigrants do not displace American workers. The measures of
S. 1394 (and similary House proposals) will do more to 
displace American workers than any perceived move by 
employers to bypass American labor for foreign workers. 

Contrary to the less government principles espoused in 1994,
S. 1394 and similar House proposals, increase government 
spending, expand governmental control over businesses and 
will ultimately weaken the U.S. economy. I strongly oppose 
S. 1394, and I ask you to do the same.

<title>President Clinton's Proposal To Increase the Minimum Wage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h3>President Clinton's Proposal To Increase the Minimum Wage</h3>
Testimony of Grant Maloy<br>
 Owner Gabriella Growers Oviedo, Florida<p>
Before Joint Economic Committee<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
February 22, 1995<p>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. My name is Grant Maloy, owner and operator of Gabriella Growers, a wholesale foliage nursery located near Orlando, Florida. I grow houseplants which are sold throughout the country. I thank the Joint Economic Committee for the opportunity to appear before you today. I think it is vitally important that the United States Congress hear from small business owners and entrepreneurs such as myself, about the impact of proposed government policies on small business. Business owners, like me, are the ones who have to deal with the aftermath of our lawmaker's actions, and I appreciate the Committee giving the small business voice, a voice in this process.<p>

I started my own small business -- it began as a 2,700 square foot greenhouse and today totals 19,000 square feet. One thing that I did not learn in college, was that if you decide to take the plunge into entrepreneurship, the government -will be a roadblock at each stage. The first hurdle starts at the county level, with the last at the federal level. As a small business owner, you face zoning, license, code enforcement, sign restrictions, and fire inspectors from local government. As you move to the state level, worker's compensation, business inspectors, more regulations, fees and taxes. Then, at the federal level there are social security taxes, unemployment taxes, income taxes, OSHA and the list goes on and on.<p>

If it were not for family to help and guide me through the tax and regulatory mazes and hurdles that exist, I probably would have never tried to start a business. And, if I did start one without their help and assistance, there is a good possibility I would have failed. Not because of marketing, sales, or employee problems -- but due to government-imposed barriers.<p>

My business defines what the "small" in small business means. My annual sales totaled $60,000 last year. I began my business from scratch, working parttime at it in 1987, and full-time in 1990. I believe that I represent many ofthe struggling, start-up businesses throughout America.<p>

I oppose an increase in the minimum wage, because it creates just another roadblock for new or expanding small businesses. The market place works, and the academics and bureaucrats in government should stop imposing some artificial wage rate on business, especially when it has been proven that wage tinkering creates additional job loss and hurts those it purportedly is supposed to help.<p>
<h3> <i>The Market Place Works</i></h3>
In my industry, many low-skilled workers are hired. The entry level positions currently pay an average of $5.24 an hour. Competition is strong in the greenhouse industry with wholesale prices remaining nearly the same for over a decade. Yet, wages have increased because of pressure both within the industry and from other industries, as well as the need to keep quality employees.<p>

Employees should be paid based on their productivity and worth, not on some theoretic number selected by politicians for political reasons. I remember two years ago when even President Clinton said that increasing the minimum wage is "the wrong way to raise the incomes of low-wage earnings." Now because of political pressure from organized labor, and new attempts to inflict class warfare into his political strategy, the President has flip-flopped on another key issue of his 1992 campaign.<p>

The laws of economics are as strong as the laws of physics. If you try to bend the rules, you will end up with distortions, and often a disaster. If an employee is not going to produce $4.25 or $5.15 per hour, a business can't afford to pay them that. Persons trying to get their start, and jump onto the economic ladder suffer because they will be unemployed and unskilled. If you take a look at the enormous unemployment rate amongst teenagers and inner-city residents, you will see how the setting of arbitrary wage-rates bears this claim out.<p>

Unfortunately, the real losers of a minimum wage hike will be the individuals whose skills do not allow them to compete successfully for the entry level job.<p>

<h3><i>Hypocrisy of Government Policies</i></h3>

Another reason I am opposed to the minimum wage is due to the fact that it is a hypocritical policy. The government expects a business owner to pay a minimum wage, when the business owner themselves may not make minimum wage.<p>

When I started my business, I was making about $2.00 per hour. I am not complaining because I was sacrificing to pay off a business loan and I was investing in my future. I enjoyed, and still do, the challenge of creating a business and future for myself.<p>

In essence, the minimum wage is just another unfunded mandate from Washington. The President or Congress sets the policy, and then passes the buck. In this case, hard-working small business owner are left to handle the problem.<p>

<h3><i>Government Micro-management</i></h3>

How is it possible that one central government can know what millions of businesses can afford to pay? Economic decisions and business productivity varies from region to region, city to city, etc. It is ludicrous for the government to think it knows what is best for everyone. If this system did work, Congress should raise the minimum wage to $50 per hour, and poverty, presumably,
 would be solved.<p>

Already, government taxes and regulations at all levels cost my business plenty. If I want to expand my business, which I intend to do, and need the help to do it -- I will find less expensive ways to get the work done since I may not be able to afford a new employee at the new wage rate. Increasingly the government is setting up more hurdles to create jobs in this country. On the one hand small businesses have been lamented by the Administration for not doing enough (paying enough, providing health care, etc.) for our employees. At the same time, they are discouraging us, because of proposed policies like the minimum wage hike, to actually employ people.<p>

<h3><i>The Real Problem and Real Solutions</i></h3>

The government's goal should be to protect free enterprise and entrepreneurship. Rather than punish business and success, the government should ask..."How do we increase economic prosperity for all businesses and all workers?"<p>

Prosperity will only increase if Congress removes government-imposed hurdles that are strangling small business and entrepreneurship. If you really want to help small business owners like me the answers are simple: cut taxes, reduce regulations and praise entrepreneurship. Don't bash business.
 Finally, the government can encourage strong families. When I think backto what helped me the most on the road to entrepreneurship, it was not the government or school. It was the experience I received working for my dad's small business, and the encouragement and support
 that my parents gave me.<p>

I do not need more government-imposed rules or regulations on my small business. The government's role should be to protect, preserve and enhance small business. The proposed minimum wage hike flies in the face of these three principles, as well as the message that all Americans are sending government -that it spends, taxes, regulates and meddles too much.<p>

I urge the U.S. Congress to let the minimum wage proposal just remain that -- a proposal. The minimum wage's days have long been numbered, and breathing life into this misguided proposal would not only be bad for small businesses like Gabriella Growers, but bad for the current and future workers of America as well.<p>

Once again I thank the Committee and look forward to answering any questions you may have.<p>

Dear Senator:

It would be a big mistake to vote for an increase in the 
minimum wage.  A minimum wage hike will hurt the economy 
and cost jobs.

Economists have found that minimum wage increases cost jobs.
Hiking the minimum wage will keep many young people, 
especially minorities and unskilled workers, out of job 
opportunities.  The drive to raise the minimum wage is 
largely politically-motivated and driven.  But many people 
fail to see the destructiveness of minimum wage increases. 
As a small business owner, I know how difficult it is to 
absorb the costs of unfunded mandates like the minimum wage.

The minimum wage is a starting wage, it's a good way for the 
entry-level employees to gain employment experience.  
Studies show that 63% of minimum wage workers earn higher 
wages within a year.  Small businesses are able to determine 
wage scales much better than Congressmen or bureaucrats.

With the implementation of welfare reform, there will be 
many low skilled people looking for jobs -- it will be much 
harder for these Americans to find employment if Congress 
raises the minimum wage.

Now is definitely not the time to raise the minimum wage.  
Leave wage increases for minimum wage workers to the 
employers, not politicians.

Sincerely,

For Immediate Release:
<p>
October 23, 
1996<p>
<B><center> Small Business Group Asks Who Actually 
Possesses the Home Field Advantage in Health
Insurance?
</B></center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Washington, D.C. &#173;&#173; The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a small business advocacy group with more than 40,000
members across the nation, questioned the validity of Blue Cross
and Blue Shield's assertions in Michigan and across the country
that they operate under a clear disadvantage compared with other
insurance firms.<BR>

<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan declared: &quot;Blue Cross and Blue
Shield is excluded from the one of the biggest hurdles to success
that any for&#173;profit enterprise faces: taxes.&quot;  <BR>

<P>
SBSC noted that according to reports from the Michigan State Treasurer's
Office, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) possessed
an $83 million tax advantage in 1995 by not having to pay state
property and single business taxes.<BR>

<P>
BCBSM has turned up the volume on its &quot;level playing field&quot;
offensive as groups opposed to the extreme pre&#173;existing condition
language in H.B. 5572, the Patient Bill of Rights, have cried
foul.  Specifically, the provision would require that no group
health insurance plan can ever exclude for a pre&#173;existing
condition, not even if no prior coverage existed.  According to
SBSC, this will drive up costs, push insurers out of the state,
and government would step in further.<BR>

<P>
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating added: &quot;As baseball's
New York Yankees have shown thus far by losing two home games
and winning one on its opponents turf in the World Series, it's
often quite difficult to detect who, if anyone, clearly benefits
from the home field advantage.  The same can be said of the health
insurance field.  Clearly, Blue Cross and Blue Shield gains from
its tax status."

<I><B>According to Congressional Ratings of Small Business

<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Pundits in the media continue to speculate
about Democrats regaining control of the Congress.  The Small
Business Survival Committee (SBSC) also toyed with the idea to
determine how small business issues would fare under the specter
of what could be ultra-liberal leadership in Congress if the House
and Senate change hands this November.<BR>

<P>
&quot;We're toast,&quot; said SBSC President Karen Kerrigan. 
&quot;I shudder when I think about the possibility of certain
ranking committee chairman taking control of the key tax writing
and regulatory committees.  The 105th Congress would be an unabashed
adversary of business and taxpayer interests,&quot; she said.
<BR>

<P>
According to <I>SBSC's Ratings of the 104th Congress</I>, the
leadership and ranking members slated for committee chairmanship
if the Democrats take control in the House are classified in the
hostile category.  The average score of these possible chairmen
and the party's leadership is an abysmal 2.3% out of 100%.  A
list of those members and their respective SBSC rating are as
follows:<BR>

<P>
The average rating of current committee chairmen in the House
is 86.4%.  In the Senate, where long-time foes of small business
like Senator Ted Kennedy would chair the Labor and Human Resource
Committee if Democrats took control, the current SBSC average
is 80%.<BR>
<P>
According to SBSC, the ratings of committee chairmen are very
important because individuals in these powerful positions determine
the legislative agenda of the committee.  They can advance proposals
that either hurt or help small businesses and entrepreneurs.<BR>
<P>
&quot;If Democrats take control they will owe, big time, the special
interests groups that spent hundreds of millions of dollars to
buy back the majority,&quot; said Kerrigan.  These groups -- big
labor, radical environmentalists, and other members of the more
spending/ big government coalition -- would expect the Democrats
to implement their far left agenda.  That agenda, consisting of
higher taxes, government-run health care and a massive expansion
of the regulatory state, would disproportionately fall on small
businesses according to SBSC.<BR>

<CENTER><B>COMMEMORATING ANNIVERSARY OF CLINTON TAX ADMISSION
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C. </B>--  President Clinton returned to Houston,
Texas, today approaching the one year anniversary of his repentant
statement about the 1993 tax hike:<BR>
<P>
<B>&quot;Probably there are people in this room, still mad at
me at that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much.
 It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too
much too.&quot; -- Bill Clinton, at a Houston fund-raiser, October
17, 1995.<BR>
</B>
<P>
Bill Clinton first claimed he was a tax cutter.  Then he launched
the single largest tax increase in American history, $265 billion.
 He said he would cut taxes on the middle-class.  Instead, he
hit middle-class small business owners with a punishing tax increase.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Bill Clinton is a proven tax-cut dodger,&quot; said Karen
Kerrigan, President, Small Business Survival Committee, a Washington,
D.C.-based small business advocacy organization.  &quot;In 1992,
he convinced American taxpayers that he's a tax cutter.  He told
them that he is their friend and with him at the helm of government
economic relief would be arriving in the form of a tax cut.  After
he got in office, he felt our pain by delivering a body blow to
the American taxpayer in the form of a $265 billion tax increase.
 The largest tax increase in history and one that bludgeoned small
businesses!&quot;<BR>
<P>
Bill Clinton now wants us to believe that he won't raise taxes
in a second term.  He told CBS's <I>60</I> <I>Minutes</I>, &quot;I'm
willing to pledge right now that I, I have no intention of raising
taxes.&quot;  (8/18/96)<BR>
<P>
In 1992 Bill Clinton's intention was to cut taxes.  Now his intention
is not to raise them.  Bill Clinton reminded us all that &quot;Fool
me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.&quot;  (10/28/92).
 Bill Clinton is a tax and spend liberal.  In his second term
he will raise taxes.  If the American taxpayer liked Clinton's
&quot;middle-class tax relief,&quot; they'll love his &quot;targeted
tax cuts.&quot;  Certainly small businesses won't be fooled by
more election-year promises by a proven tax hiker.
<P>
   
<P>
Back in Houston, President Clinton needs to be reminded that once
he was right.  &quot;I raised [taxes] too much...&quot;<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER>Small Business Says Thank You to 104th<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
today joined a coalition of taxpayer, consumer and senior organizations
to express their thanks to the 104th Congress.  SBSC is specifically
gratified for initiatives undertaken and passed to help entrepreneurs
and small businesses.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Looking back at the last two years, the 104th Congress passed
historical measures to help small business and promote entrepreneurship,&quot;
said SBSC President Karen Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
The &quot;Salute to the 104th Congress&quot; event was held on
Capitol Hill today to thank Members both individually and collectively
for their bold steps to help protect entrepreneurs and encourage
small business start-ups.  SBSC joined Americans for Tax Reform,
Citizens Against Government Waste, Seniors Coalition, Chamber
of Commerce and other groups in sponsoring the event.  House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and other members of the House leadership were on
hand to address those attending the recognition ceremonies.<BR>
<P>
SBSC praised Republican-led reforms which were signed by the President.
 They also thanked Congress for passing a comprehensive small
business agenda yet vetoed by Clinton.  Among the reforms passed
by the House and either vetoed or opposed by the President:  capital
gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, comprehensive regulatory
relief, legal reform, the TEAM Act and property rights protection.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;While we are pleased that President Clinton signed several
of the initiatives targeted to help small businesses, unfortunately
he vetoed or stood in the way of other reform priorities recommended
by his own White House Conference on Small Business,&quot; added
Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
SBSC applauded the Congress for its passage of health insurance
reforms to help small business including the phasing-in of deductibility
to 80 percent, and passing Medical Savings Accounts.  In addition,
regulators are now more accountable to small businesses because
Congress put teeth into Regulatory Flexibility.  Regulators must
also publish their rules and regulations in &quot;Plain English&quot;
and Congress can now conduct a final review of regulations and
vote to reject them.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Most importantly, the 104th Congress began to chip away
at the old status quo through its cuts in wasteful government
spending to balance the budget.  The two words that were dropped
from President Clinton's vocabulary after the '92 elections were
'Balanced Budget' until the 104th Congress came to town,&quot;
remarked Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
In conclusion, SBSC has given the 104th Congress high marks for
its bold agenda.  &quot;No big tax increases like 1993, no attempts
for a government take-over of the health care system and making
small businesses pay for it like 1994 -- the 104th Congress initiated
mostly positive steps to encourage job creation and small business
growth and start-ups,&quot; Kerrigan concluded.<BR>
<P>

<CENTER><B>Clinton Land Grab Called Shameful By Small Business
Group<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC) President Karen Kerrigan made the following statement in
response to President Clinton's election-year land grab of southern
Utah:<BR>
<P>
&quot;President Clinton is getting a little too generous
during this election season.  On the campaign trail he has been
promising cradle-to-grave programs while doling out pork in key
electoral battleground states.<BR>
<P>
But his generosity has gone a little too far this
week.  Knowing that Utah will not fall into the Democratic column,
he has conveniently sacrificed the property rights of voters in
the state to placate environmental groups that need a return on
investment for their election-year financial support.<BR>
<P>
By executive fiat, the President has blatantly circumvented
the Congress to create a national monument without regard to the
job impact such a move would have on Utah's residents.  President
Clinton has consulted only with environmentalists on the land-grab,
and has even ignored and usurped his own Interior Department.
<BR>
<P>
It is clear that if President Clinton is bold enough
to make such moves leading up to the November elections, a second
term in office would mean a severe erosion of already-endangered
private property rights.<BR>
<P>
Utah residents, lawmakers and businesses are capable
of environmental stewardship.  They do not need President Clinton
-- or his cash supporters in the environmental movement -- to
tell them how to run their state.&quot;<BR>
<P>
President Clinton used his powers under the Antiquities
Act of 1906 to proclaim that 1.8 million acres of Utah will be
given protected status as a national monument.

<P>
September 17, 1996<BR>
<P>
 Small Business Advocate Applauds Senate Labor &amp; Human Resource
Committee<BR>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Today, the Senate Labor and Human Resource
Committee is holding an oversight hearing of the National Labor
Relations Board.  In response to the hearing, Small Business Survival
Committee president, Karen Kerrigan, made the following statement:
<BR>
<P>
&quot;The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) calls on the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to cease its open agenda
of union activism, and to work toward balanced enforcement of
the labor laws.  Rather than acting as an objective and independent
agency, the NLRB has assumed the appearance of a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the AFL-CIO.<BR>
<P>
Since 1994, Clinton appointees to the National Labor Relations
Board have waged an unprecedented assault on small businesses.
 Most notoriously, the Board's proposed &quot;single location
bargaining unit rule&quot; would limit the rights of employers
while promoting unionization of small businesses.<BR>
<P>
Less well known but equally hostile to small business owners,
is the enforcement policy of the General Counsel.  The illicit
union tactics known as salting and corporate campaigns have been
tolerated and tacitly promoted by this Board.  Unions have been
able to wear down small businesses through the filing of frivolous
charges with the NLRB.  The agency has been quick to adopt novel
union theories of labor law violations, yet slow to dismiss even
the most baseless of charges against employers.  The result has
been exorbitant legal expenses, increased labor-management hostility,
and declining respect for this independent agency.<BR>
<P>
The public recognizes the importance of small business to the
economy, and to the lives of millions of working Americans.  The
public has the right to know of this government-endorsed program
of labor union promotion.  SBSC hails today's hearing of the Senate
Labor &amp; Human Resources Committee as the first step toward
ending the NLRB's assault on small business and its workers.&quot;

<b><CENTER>Small Businesses Harboring Chemical Weapons?</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>American Businesses To Be Subjected to Foreign Inspections
Under Proposed Chemical Weapons Convention<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) has
goals worth supporting, but in the end it will harm U.S. national
security while subjecting private industry -- many of which are
small businesses -- to onerous new regulatory burdens, on-site
inspections by a new foreign entity with the real potential for
international industrial espionage, according to a small business
watchdog group.  The U.S. Senate has scheduled a CWC ratification
vote on September 14.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Our assessment of the CWC is one of great apprehension and
concern for U.S. businesses.  We urge the U.S. Senate to take
a careful look at the treaty in terms of what American business
will be subjected to, and how our competitiveness is threatened
by new reporting requirements and on-site visits by Hague-based
foreign inspectors,&quot; commented Karen Kerrigan, President
of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC).<BR>
<P>
Nations that sign the CWC will agree to abide by the treaty whose
goals are to end the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
 Unfortunately, rogue nations like Iraq, Libya, Syria and North
Korea are not planning to sign the treaty.  Moreover, defense
and foreign policy experts view the CWC as non-enforceable and
non-verifiable.<BR>
<P>
As then-Director of the Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey
stated before the Foreign Relations Committee in June of 1994:
  &quot;The chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence
perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in
our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a  small scale.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
In order to comply with CWC provisions, new regulatory burdens
would be placed on already over-regulated U.S. businesses.  In
particular:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>U.S. private industry would be subjected to foreign inspections
at the direction of  Technical Secretariat overseeing the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) located in the
Hague, Netherlands.
<LI>Businesses must prove to the U.S. government and international
inspectors that they are not producing or stockpiling chemical
weapons.  Chemical companies plus other businesses that use certain
chemicals in manufacturing processes must fill out new forms for
each chemical covered by the treaty.  Firms in food processing,
pharmaceutical, paint, petroleum, biotech, electronics, textiles,
rubber, brewing and distilling industries would be impacted as
well.
<LI>The. U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that it will take
anywhere from 2.5 - 9 hours to fill out the paperwork for each
chemical depending upon its classification.
<LI>Congress's Office of Technology Assessment estimated that
inspections will cost U.S. firms anywhere from $10,000 to $500,000
per visit.
<LI>Distinct possibilities exist that rights of due process could
be violated in relation to warrantless searches and personnel
being compelled to answer questions, and provide information and
access.
<LI>With the advent of foreign inspections, proprietary information
could be compromised hurting U.S. competitiveness.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
&quot;By all accounts the treaty is flawed, and we strongly urge
the U.S. Senate to take a sober look at the CWC.  We believe an
honest assessment of the treaty will reveal that the costs to
U.S. businesses, the loss of our economic freedom and compromising
constitutionally protected American rights do not justify ratification
-- especially with the prevalent belief that the treaty will harm
U.S. national security,&quot; said Kerrigan.<BR>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> &#173;&#173; The Small Business Survival Foundation
(SBS Foundation) &#173;&#173; a nonpartisan research and education
organization focusing on public policy issues relating to small
business and entrepreneurship &#173;&#173; has called on candidates
to focus closely on the issues in this year's campaign.  To help
this process along, the Foundation re&#173;released its comprehensive
guide to issues impacting entrepreneurs and the economy &#173;&#173;
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96: A 
Candidate's Handbook to Critical Small Business Issues.&quot;
<P>
SBS Foundation President Karen Kerrigan declared: &quot;Entrepreneurs,
business 
owners, and their employees are looking for a substantive, issues&#173;based
campaign in 1996.  
<P>
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot; will help candidates
at both the federal and state levels, 
as well as the media and citizens in general, to sort through
the real issues affecting small 
business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.&quot;<BR>
<P>
SBS Foundation Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating, author of &quot;Entrepreneurs
and Elections '96,&quot; echoed these comments by noting, &quot;As
the campaign season moves 
into high gear, the tendency increases for rhetoric to overwhelm
substance.  Our 
&quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot; booklet attempts to
keep attention and offer guidance on 
substantive issues.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Each chapter in &quot;Entrepreneurs and Elections '96&quot;deals
with important public 
policies and how they impact entrepreneurs and the economy &#173;&#173;
tax policy, government 
spending, regulations, monetary policy, trade, immigration, health
care, government 
reform, as well as key issues at the state and city levels.  The
booklet also examines the role 
of small business and entrepreneurship in today's economy and
over the next century.    
<P>
Keating concluded: &quot;Our economy has been growing at a slow&#173;to&#173;mediocre
pace 
since the late 1980s and we need to be debating policy options
that will place the economy 
on a high&#173;growth track.  Of course, real economic growth
and job creation are generated 
through investment and entrepreneurship.  &quot;Entrepreneurs
and Elections '96&quot; offers an 
entrepreneur&#173;friendly agenda.&quot;

the Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
Raymond J. Keating, chief economist for the Small
Business Survival Foundation 
and author of the report, noted: &quot;The Small
Business Survival Index provides a measure of 
government&#173;related costs affecting the decisions
of investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses &#173;
&#173; the engines of economic growth and job creation.&quot;<p>
 The study combines nine major costs 
(whether rates, ratios, or indexes) levied on small
businesses and entrepreneurs into one 
comparative index number:<BR>

<P>
<B>Top
Personal Income Tax Rate</B>.  State personal income tax rates
impact economic 
decision&#173;making related to working, saving,
investing, and risk taking. 
<P>
<B>Top
Individual Capital Gains Tax Rate</B>.  State capital gains taxes
are direct levies on 
investment and entrepreneurship &#173;&#173; the
sources of growth in the economy.  
<P>
<B>Top
Corporate Income Tax Rate.</B>  State corporate income tax rates
affect a broad range of 
business decisions &#173;&#173; most clearly decisions
relating to investment and location.
<P>
<b>Property
Taxes (per $100 of personal income).</B>
State and local property taxes impact 
decisions as to where businesses and entrepreneurs
choose to locate, as well as decisions 
relating to investments in facilities.
<P>
<B>Sales
Taxes (per $100 of personal income)</B>.  State and local sales
taxes impact the
economic decisions of individuals and families, as
well as various retail businesses.
<P>
<B>Death
Taxes</B>.  Estate taxes amount to nothing more than a government
hostile takeover of 
a business at the time of the owner's death and impact
investment and location decisions.
<P>
<B>Top
Unemployment Tax Rate Paid by Employers on Taxable Wages</B>.
 The unemployment
tax rate on taxable wages affects labor&#173;versus&#173;capital
as well as location decisions.
<P>
<B>Workers'
Compensation Costs (cost index)</B>.  High workers' compensation
rates also 
impact labor&#173;versus&#173;capital and location
decisions.
<P>
<B>Total
Crime Rate</B>.  Just like taxes, a high crime rate acts as a
disincentive to entrepreneurs, 
who naturally seek out environments where life and
property are protected.  <BR>

<P>
Keating acknowledged that other obstacles are placed
in the path of entrepreneurs 
and businesses at the state and local levels, particularly
regulations.  Unfortunately, no 
reliable, comparative measure for state and/or local
regulatory costs is currently available.  
<P>
<B>Under the Small Business Survival Index, the lower
the index number, the lighter the </B>
<B>governmental burdens, and the better the environment
is for risk taking. 
</B>

<P>
Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business Survival
Foundation, noted: 
&quot;According to our Index, South Dakota, Wyoming,
Nevada, and Washington rate best for 
entrepreneurs because they don't tax personal income,
capital gains, or corporate income.  
Texas, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Alaska, and Florida
rank very high as well.  
<P>
Unfortunately, places like Minnesota, New Mexico,
Maine, Montana, Vermont, New York 
State, Iowa, Hawaii, California, and Rhode Island
treat job&#173;creating entrepreneurs and 
small business owners rather shabbily.&quot;  <BR>

<P>
Keating added: &quot;The District of Columbia ranks
as most hostile to entrepreneurship 
when compared to the 50 states.  However, if you
add New York City into the mix, it 
offers the worst environment for entrepreneurship
&#173;&#173; by far.  For entrepreneurs, the Big 
Apple is rotten.&quot;  <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
-- a nationwide, nonpartisan small business advocacy organization
-- today released a statement regarding the observance of Small
Business Week.  SBSC President Karen Kerrigan prepared the following
statement:<BR>
<P>
&quot;Every year small businesses and entrepreneurs become more
vital to the growth and dynamism of the U.S. economy.  Small businesses
and entrepreneurs are the risk-takers and chief job producers
of America, and without their activity our economy would stagnate
and ultimately deteriorate.  National Small Business Week commemorates
the sacrifices made by entrepreneurs, and gives politicians the
opportunity to talk about the sacrifices they've made for small
business.<BR>
<P>
The United States truly is the land of opportunity and entrepreneurship.
 Between 1970 and 1991, the number of sole proprietorships increased
from 5.7 million to 15.2 million -- an increase of 167%.  It is
interesting to note that as over 500,000 Americans lost their
jobs due to downsizing in 1994 (according to the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics), new business incorporations skyrocketed to
a record 750,000 in the same year.  Not surprisingly, more Americans
are taking advantage of technological advances and economic trends
to start their own business.  They have no interest in &quot;corporate
responsibility,&quot; but rather creating their own long-term
economic security.<BR>
<P>
It is essential that elected officials recognize the strong economic
forces that will dominate the 21st Century workforce -- trends
that Senator Connie Mack's Joint Economic Committee fittingly
describe as a workforce controlled by diversity, mobility and
entrepreneurship.  Though these trends have been identified by
the 104th Congress -- with scores of proposals offered to take
advantage of our exciting economic future -- the agenda of growth
and entrepreneurship has been vehemently rejected by President
Clinton.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton has been given sufficient opportunity to support
the entrepreneur's agenda, but through the use of his veto pen
and through countless policies passed and presented by his Administration
-- he has decided to support and advance a European model that
mistakenly places the government at the center of the economy.
<BR>
<P>
President Clinton likes to claim that he's tough on crime and
criminals.  What is more evident, however, is that he has gotten
even tougher on innocent small business owners.  In fact, &quot;Three
Strikes You're Out&quot; -- the trendy slogan for various tough-on-crime
proposals --  is now an appropriate label for President Clinton's
small business record.<BR>
<P>
What are those strikes against the Administration?  STRIKE #1:
 The 1993 Clinton tax hike.  Touted as a soak-the-rich scheme,
small businesses took a bath on  the 'I feel your pain' increase.
 According to the IRS, 70% of those impacted by the hike were
small businesses.  A 1994 Small Business Survival Committee survey
of small businesses revealed that 69% of respondents took some
action in response to the Clinton tax hike.  STRIKE #2:  The Clinton
Health Care Plan.  Adorned with its proposed employer mandates
as the primary mechanism to achieve 'universal coverage,' the
plan would have been devastating to our nation's small businesses.
 Mrs. Clinton claimed that she could not be held responsible for
&quot;every undercapitalized entrepreneur in America,&quot; and
no one asked her to be.  Small businesses want to succeed or fail
on their own, but without the government as a &quot;silent partner&quot;
forcing them into collapse.  STRIKE #3:  The minimum wage hike.
 President Clinton used to be against the wage hike as a &quot;New
Democrat,&quot; but that was before the labor unions took over
his election-year agenda.  The Clinton wage hike is another silly
ploy to appease his boisterous left-wing at the expense of small
business owners.<BR>
<P>
Of course, President Clinton has also vetoed many of the important
reforms recommended by his own White House Conference on Small
Business (WHCSB).  The President has opposed practical and moderate
reforms at OSHA and EPA; securing property rights; reforming outdated
labor laws and <U>repealing</U> Davis-Bacon; giving small business
Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) in health care reform, to name
a few items.  The WHCSB recommended, but the President promptly
<U>vetoed: </U> an increase in small business expensing; capital
gains tax reduction; estate tax reform; tax equity in health care
reform; pension reform; and tort reform -- all important to small
business growth and survival.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton will make every attempt this week to talk about
how friendly he has been to small businesses, and they will be
rightly incensed by his crass election-year rhetoric.  Moving
bureaucrats around agencies like pawns on a chessboard does not
help the entrepreneur's bottom-line.  &quot;Reinventing Government&quot;'
schemes have not lifted the paperwork and regulatory burden on
small businesses.  Conversely, increasing taxes and regulations
only serve to hurt entrepreneurship and economic growth.<BR>
<P>
President Clinton's track record on small business speaks louder
than his words.  Indeed he has embraced an economic model placing
government at the center of the economy.  The opening exists,
therefore, for a certain White House challenger to expose the
President's bias against small businesses and offer an agenda
that properly places the entrepreneur at the economy's center
--  producing a dynamic and exciting economy offering opportunity
for those who seek the path of entrepreneurship.  A Presidential
candidate who advocates this agenda would truly make National
Small Business Week, a week to celebrate.&quot;<BR>

<b>Washington, D.C.</b> - Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President
Karen Kerrigan today released the following statement after the
United States House of Representatives increased the starting
wage: <BR>
<P>
&quot;Small businesses are the job creating engines of the United
States - making up nearly two-thirds of American businesses. 
Mandating the wage hike would effectively throw a monkey wrench
in that engine. The wage hike amounts to an unfunded mandate.
 As such, it should not make its way out of Washington.  And without
a doubt, small businesses will shoulder most of the cost of mandate.
To offset the cost of the wage hike, small business owners will
either be forced to reduce current employee hours, forgo hiring
additional workers, or raise the prices of goods and services.
 All of these consequences -- viewed by us as anti-worker -- 
will not put more money in the pockets of minimum wage workers.
The wage hike gives President Clinton a chance to again say 'I
feel your pain' during this election year.  But every time the
President 'feels our pain,' his compassion is followed by another
blow to small businesses and entrepreneurs.  For the small business
sector, this false compassion has meant increased taxes and costs,
courtesy of Bill Clinton.&quot;  <BR>

Small Business Group Applauds 
General Tax Principle & Policies Offered By Kemp Commission
</h2>
<i>January 17, 1996		</i></center>

<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) 785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Washington, DC</b> -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) voiced its support 
today for the general guiding principles and policies for tax reform outlined by the<A href ="/taxcom"> National 
Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform,</a> or the Kemp Commission.  SBSC is a 
40,000-member small business organization advocating a free-market, pro-entrepreneur policy 
agenda.
<p>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan observed: "Overhauling our nation's tax code stands as a 
top issue for the small business community.  The Kemp Commission has outlined what we 
believe are the basics of a flat tax that will serve to significantly boost the nation's economy."
<p>
SBSC saw particular merit in several of the Commission's suggestions: to impose just a 
single, low tax rate on income; to end double taxation of businesses and their owners; to permit 
expensing of investment outlays; to exclude the returns on saving from taxation; to require a 
two-thirds majority vote in Congress to raise the tax rate; and most importantly, to abolish the 
capital gains tax.  While the Commission recognized that estate and gift taxes make "little sense," 
SBSC would have liked a much clearer declaration for the elimination of all "death" taxes that 
prove particularly burdensome for family-owned businesses.
<p>
Raymond J. Keating -- chief economist for the SBSC and author of a booklet entitled 
"The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans" (published by SBS Foundation) 
-- was enthused by the fact that the Commission's principles and policies lined up closely to 
those outlined in "The Great Tax Debate."  A side-by-side comparison is provided below.
<p>
Keating declared: "We're very pleased to see that the Commission recognizes the critical 
role that entrepreneurship plays in the economy -- as the engine of growth and job creation -- and 
the enormous obstacle our current tax code is to investment and risk taking."
<p>
"The Kemp Commission's report is not long on details, however.  Now comes the heavy 
lifting of making detailed, principled tax overhaul a reality," concluded Kerrigan.
<p>
<P>
<P>
<h4>Kemp Commission</h4>

<ul><i>Six Points of Principle:</i>
<p>
<li>Economic growth through incentives to 
work save and invest.
<br>
<li>Fairness to all taxpayers.
<br>
  <li>Simplicity so that anyone can figure it out.
<br>
<li>Neutrality that lets people and not 
government make choices.
<br>
<li>Visibility to let people know the cost of 
government.
<br>
<li>Stability so people can plan for the future.</ul>
<p>
<UL><i>Six Points of Policy:</i>
<p>
<li>A single tax rate.
<br>
<li>A generous personal exemption to remove 
the burden on those least able to pay.
<br>
<li>Lower tax rates for American families.
<br>
<li>Ending biases against work, saving, and 
investment.
<br>
<li>Making the new tax system hard to 
change.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>The Great Tax Debate</h4>
<p>
<ul><i>Eight Principles of Sound Taxation:</i>
<P>
<li>Low Flat Tax to Promote Economic 
Growth -- the lower and more proportional, 
or flatter, the tax rate system the better.

<br>
<li>No Taxation of Capital -- taxing returns on 
investment and savings makes absolutely no 
economic sense.

<br>
<li>Inflation Factor -- the detrimental effects 
of inflation should be factored into any tax 
system's design.

<br>
<li>Clarity -- the clearer the tax system the 
better.  Taxes should be as obvious as 
possible.

<br>
<li>Simplicity -- tax payments should be made 
as easy and as simple as possible without 
any loss of clarity.

<br>
<li>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness  -- 
the fewer tax collectors and the more limited 
their powers the better.

<br>
<li>Minimize Incentives for Tax Avoidance  -- 
taxes should be low enough so as to not 
provide significant incentives for tax 
avoidance.

<br>
<li>No Additional Boost to Government 
Spending -- a tax system's design should not 
make it any easier for government to 
increase expenditures.
</ul>

<P>

<b>Washington, D.C.--</b>  The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
 a 40,000 member small business advocacy group that promotes a
freemarket, proentrepreneur agenda  declared their disgust today
with President Clinton's efforts to further derail current budget
negotiations, and hurt small businesses and lowskilled and young
workers as well, by proposing a minimum wage increase in his latest
budget proposal.
<P>
The President's proposal would raise the current $4.25 rate to
$4.70 on July 1, 1996 and to $5.15 on July 1, 1997.
<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan observed:  &quot;The minimum wage
is not a budget issue and should not be included in budget proposals
and negotiations.  More important, however, is the fact that the
President is offering, once again, a proposal that will hurt small
businesses by raising their costs.  The President seems intent
on not only delaying the completion of the federal government
budget, but on damaging the budgetary well-being of many small
enterprises.&quot;
<P>
Kerrigan added, &quot;It is obvious that the President added the
minimum wage hike -- a critical objective of labor unions -- into
the budget plan.  It represents his big payoff to big labor. 
He desperately needs their reelection support next year.&quot;
<P>
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating added:  &quot;Increasing
the minimum wage makes no sense from an economics standpoint as
well.  Indeed, no selfrespecting economist would argue that a
minimum wage hike helps lowskilled, lowincome, young workers.
 In fact, study after study shows that these individuals are hurt
most by a minimum wage increase as their unemployment levels climb.&quot;
<P>
Keating continued, &quot;Work experience is crucial so that individuals
can gain marketable skills, learn the disciplines of the marketplace,
and advance in life.  Increasing the minimum wage denies these
experiences as young and lowskilled worker s are priced out of
the labor market. As government artificially boosts wages with
a minimum wage hike, employers seek out alternatives to hiring
young, lowskilled individuals.  The likelihood of falling prey
to the welfare state then naturally increases.
<P>
While a minimum wage increase might sound compassionate, in reality
it is another cruel blow by government leveled at the disadvantaged.&quot;
<P>
&quot;No one will gain from President Clinton's proposed increase
in the minimum wage,&quot; concludes Keating.  &quot;The budget
process will slow; small business costs will rise; and young and
lowskilled workers will suffer.&quot;

Small Business Group Documents Superfund as Highly Toxic For Entrepreneurs and Business</h2>

<blockquote>
<b>Washington, D.C.--</b>  The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
 a 40,000member small business advocacy group that promotes a
freemarket, proentrepreneur agenda  released a report today highly
critical of the federal government Superfund program.  &quot;Highly
Toxic: The Superfund Assault on Common Sense, Business and Entrepreneurship&quot;
was written by SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating. 
<P>
U.S. Representative Bill Zeliff (RNH), a leader in Superfund reform
efforts and Chairman of the Small Business Survival Caucus, wrote
the foreword to the report.
<P>
&quot;Highly Toxic&quot; documents some of the history, the massive
costs and egregious inefficiencies of the Superfund program, which
was designed to help clean up hazardous waste sites across the
country.  Instead, according to the report, a mere 18 percent
of the worst waste sites have been cleaned up at a combined government/privatesector
cost of approximately $90 billion.
<P>
Keating declares: &quot;Superfund unleashed the bloated bureaucracy
and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on often unsuspecting
individual and businesses; turned essentially local or, at most,
state problems into national woes; set arbitrary and unattainable
criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced
many businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available
for investment in certain industries; restrained job growth; and
damaged U.S. international competitiveness.&quot;  &quot;Highly
Toxic&quot; fully explains and offers examples of each of these
Superfund consequences.
<P>
&quot;Superfund is riddled with problems,&quot; Keating notes,
&quot;but worst of all is its liability scheme.  Under Superfund's
strict, retroactive, and joint and  several liability, if a business
disposed of waste  toxic or nontoxic, large or insignificant amounts
 in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, it
can still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal
site if it later became a Superfund site.  Notions of responsibility
and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Highly Toxic&quot; suggests phasing in a threestep reform
process for Superfund: 
<P>
1) repeal retroactive liability for all actions taken before 1987
 eliminating litigation at an estimated 80 percent of Superfund
sites, use sciencebased risk assessment and costbenefit analysis
to determine required clean up remedies, and cap the number of
Superfund sites to gain some control over costs; 
<P>
2) in the name of fairness and common sense, repeal the strict,
retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes altogether,
and only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke
the law, who were negligent, fraudulent, deceptive, etc.; and

<P>
3) eventually put an end to Superfund  waste sites are local or,
at most, state issues, not federal.
<P>
Keating concludes:  &quot;At the very least, Superfund must be
completely overhauled. 
<P>
As things currently stand, no one wins under the Superfund scenario
of high costs and few clean ups.&quot;

<center><h3>News Release<P>
Reconciliation Bill's Capital Gains Tax Cuts Are Essential
to Entrepreneurship and Small Business Growth, Says Small Business
Advocacy Group</h3>
<i>November 16, 1995</i>		</center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) 785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> -- The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a 40,000-member small business advocacy organization,
today praised the capital gains tax cutting measures recently
announced by the House and Senate budget conferees.
<P>
The tax package will cut capital gains taxes on individuals and
corporations $35.7 billion. This cut would be retroactive to January
1, 1995. Additionally, individuals and corporations would have
reduced capital gains tax rates for investment in qualified small
business stock. Although the package fails to index capital gains
taxes to inflation immediately, SBSC President Karen Kerrigan
stated that the country's weak to moderate growth would receive
a firm boost from the capital gains tax cutting measures.
<P>
&quot;Taxes on capital gains are perhaps the most regressive for
small businesses and entrepreneurs. High capital gains taxes prevent
many entrepreneurs from overcoming their number one obstacle to
start-up and growth -- access to capital,&quot; said Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan, however, added &quot;In no way should Congress fail
to realize the importance of indexing capital gains for inflation.
The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment
-- restraining small business growth and job creation -- we hope
indexation is addressed before 2001.&quot;
<P>
According to SBSC, after factoring for inflation, a nominal profit
on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor
still pays taxes on the nominal gains. These <I>real rates</I>
of capital gains taxation are severe impediments to keeping America's
economy vibrant and growing.
<P>
Kerrigan added that opponents who try to attempt to classify the
issue as one of rich vs. poor do not have a firm grasp of economics
and are ignoring the facts of who benefits from capital gains
reduction. According to 1992 IRS tax returns, 83% of those claiming
capital gains had total incomes of less than $100,000 -- 53% claiming
capital gains had total incomes of less than $50,000.
<P>
Most importantly, a capital gains tax reduction will strongly
benefit America's budding entrepreneurs and small businesses.
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond Keating adds, &quot;an inability
to stand by a cut in capital gains taxes would be a most damaging
blow to entrepreneurship, investment, and the economy.&quot;

Real World Investment Pros Scoff <br>
at Treasury Secretary Rubin's "Train Wreck" Scenario</h2>
<i>November 3, 1995</i>		</center>
<P>
<B>Contact: Renee Stikes<br>
(202) -785-0238</b>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- Several leading investment experts, members of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) -- a 40,000 member nonprofit, nonpartisan advocacy organization -- predict that a failure to pass tax cuts and a balanced budget will do much more harm to financial markets than failing to pay interest and/or principle on U.S. Treasury securities.  In response to Treasury Secretary Rubin's debt limit "crisis," and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta's remarks that Republicans will cause an earthquake in the financial markets due to the possibility of delay in raising the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling, SBSC experts comment:
<P>
"In our opinion, the financial markets are up strong since last November because they are correctly anticipating less government and lower taxes...If the markets were concerned, particularly the bond market, interest rates would have moved up long before now...Long term, the financial markets care much more about tax policy (by a wide margin) than any other single issue...Lower taxes means lower interest rates, stronger economic growth, and higher stock prices...Now, if Congress fails to pass a significant tax cut, then we would be worried."
<i>Mark J. Deschaine, Investment Counselors Incorporated, St. Louis, Missouri</i>
<BR><P>
"During meetings with clients in Boston last week, several portfolio managers, each investing literally billions of dollars of other people's money, all told me the same thing regarding the budget/tax debate in Washington.  They said they would be incredibly bearish if there is any hint of a "sellout" on real deficit reduction to get a deal and would be much more worried about the future of the markets, stocks and bonds, if that happens than if any so-called train wreck scenario unfolds on a short term basis."
<BR><i>James H. Slagter, The Research Network, Wayne, New Jersey</i>
<P>
"The world's financial markets have made clear their strong disapproval of congressional spending through a clear inverse correlation between Congressional spending (or proposing to spend) and the value of the dollar -- a proxy for the U.S. credit rating.  With each new spending bill, such as the crime bill or the failed Balanced Budget Amendment, the dollar tanks...If Congress truly wants to prevent a "train wreck" they had better pursue this balanced budget proposal -- full steam ahead."
<BR><I>James C. Kennedy, Kennedy Capital Management, Inc., St. Louis, Missouri</i>
<P>
"Worries over a significant backlash in financial markets due to a so-called budget 'train wreck' are grossly overblown.  If some kind of temporary default on federal government securities actually occurred -- though quite doubtful -- the impact on the bond market would likely be small and shortlived.  Indeed, a real threat to U.S. financial markets looms if capital gains tax reduction, including indexation for inflation, were to somehow fall by the wayside.  Since the Republican congressional victories in November 1994, equity markets have been robust, especially small-cap, high-tech stocks.  Markets have been counting on a significant capital gains tax cut; if this fails to materialize then we should be worried."

<i>FDA Examined From An Entrepreneurial and Economic Growth Perspective: <br>

<b>For Immediate Release:  September 22, 1995<br>

<hr>
                            <P>
Washington, D.C. </b>-- In a newly released booklet, the Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation substantiates the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) crushing impact on entrepreneurship and economic growth, driving high-paying jobs and growth industries overseas.
                                     <P>
SBS Foundation -- a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and education organization examining issues crucial to the entrepreneurial sector of  the economy -- has published a booklet entitled FDA Hazards:  How FDA Red Tape Impacts Entrepreneurs and the U.S. Economy.
                                               <P>
SBS Foundation Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating, author of "FDA Hazards," offers numerous examples of where and how the FDA has gone awry.  From orange juice raids to export hurdles to shutting down the last smoked-herring company in the United States, the FDA has moved beyond a traditional role of reasonable safety regulation and education to a harsh, confrontational stance with U.S. entrepreneurs and businesses.
                                                            <P>
And while FDA enforcement tactics have become more aggressive and intrusive, its ability to meet deadlines in terms of medical device and drug approvals deteriorates.  Keating notes that the average FDA approval times in these critical areas fail to even come close to what is required.  As approval times become more lengthy and costly to U.S. firms, FDA's inflation-adjusted budget increased by almost 53 percent between 1989 and 1994, and the number of full-time FDA employees increased by more than 25 percent.
                                                                       <P>
"FDA Hazards" examines the record of the FDA in terms of its ability to move medical devices and drugs through its approval process in a timely manner;  its strategies and tactics when dealing with entrepreneurs and businesses;  its budget and number of employees;  the incentives under which FDA employees operate;  and more.
                                                                                <P>
Several market-based reforms are suggested in "FDA Hazards":
                                                                                         <ul>
<li>The FDA should be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education.  The private sector should be tapped for medical device and drug approvals.
                                                                                              <P>
<li>The government has a role in helping to secure consumers against substantial risks they could not know about -- i.e., safety -- as well as fraud.  Determining the efficacy of products, though, should be left to doctors, hospitals, experts, consumer groups, et al.
                                                                                    <P>
<li>The marketplace needs to rest upon sound legal and regulatory systems.  Unfortunately, both systems have gone awry, and some of our most dynamic industries -- medical devices and pharmaceuticals -- suffer accordingly.  Legal reform is needed.
                                                                          <P>
<li>The FDA ban against manufacturers distributing information regarding off-label uses of drugs such as independent journal articles and studies, should be lifted.
                                                                  <P>
<li>A federal agency's enforcement powers, as well as it processes and standards for determining what products fall under its jurisdiction, should be scrutinized and reviewed annually by Congress.
                                                       <P>
<li>The U.S. should negotiate and enter into agreements with other nations to recognize each other's drug and medical device approvals.
              </ul>   <p>
In addition to a total restructuring of the FDA, Keating also advocates the elimination of capital gains taxes, which will help attract capital to such high-risk industries as medical devices and pharmaceutical.
                                    <P>
Keating summarizes the FDA's woes as follows:  "A government agency that delays the approvals of beneficial drugs and medical devices to the degree that the FDA does, ensures that U.S.-based firms function at a severe disadvantage.  Of course, not only does this mean less investment, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs, but it also means that U.S. consumers often are denied access to life-saving devices and treatments."
                                                                                                                 <P>
<I>Copies of "FDA Hazards" can be obtained by calling the SBS Foundation at (202)-785-0238.</I>

<h2> DO MEGA CORPORATIONS LIKE WESTINGHOUSE AND DISNEY
                    NEED CORPORATE WELFARE?</h2>
</center>
<p>

<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> Who is more in need of financial help -- the American taxpayer or Mickey Mouse?  The two high-profile buyouts of ABC and CBS this week paint a clear example of how ludicrous it is for Congress to be giving billion dollar handouts to the networks.
<p>
Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee last week announced that SBSC has created the Campaign for Broadcast Competition (CBC).  The Campaign opposes legislation now before the House which gives wealthy broadcasters - at no cost - public airwaves valued at $100 billion.
<p>
Kerrigan said, "Corporations like Disney and Westinghouse are paying top dollar for networks, while the networks are looking for a handout from Uncle Sam.  They plead that only government gifts will save them from technical advances.  But, the facts are clear."
<p>
"On August 1st, Westinghouse Electric Company agreed to buy CBS for $5.4 billion.  In 1994 alone, CBS's total revenue amounted to $3.7 billion, and their profit was $426 million. Westinghouse showed a revenue of $8.8 billion with a profit of $619 million."
<p>
"On July 31, 1995 Disney announced its intent to purchase CapCities/ABC for $19 billion.  CapCities reported a profit in 1994 of $638 million, while Disney reported a profit of $1.1 billion."
<p>
"With profits like these, why is Congress giving the networks six new digital channels? As the television industry consolidates, does it really make sense for the U.S. government to enrich these companies further?"
<p>
Kerrigan and the CBC advocate auctioning the air waves, as the FCC did recently for wireless communications.  "Auctioning off the airwaves would foster competition, generate billion in revenues to reduce the deficit, and end an insidious form of corporate welfare," continued Kerrigan.

<center><h3>Testimony of Taalib-Din Abdul Uqdah<br>
Co-Owner<br>
Cornrows & Co.<p></h3>
<h4>An Opposition To An Increase In<br>
The Minimum Wage</h4> 
<hr>
<p>
</center>
<blockquote>
Madam Chairperson, members of the committee, my name
is Taalib-Din Abdul Uqdah.  I am the co-owner of Cornrows &amp;
Co., a hair-braiding salon located in Washington, D.C..  I thank
the Small Business Committee for the opportunity to appear before
you today.  Given the direct impact of the proposed unfunded mandate
on small business operations, I think it is vitally important
that the United States Congress hear from small business owners.
 I appreciate the Committee giving small businesses, like mine,
a voice in this process.  <BR>
<P>
I started my business, Cornrows &amp; Co., in June
1980 with $500, a 4-year lease on a building owned by someone
else, and three employees.  Today, I employ 12 full-time people,
including my wife and myself, two part-time people and I have
consistently grossed approximately $500,000 annually.  My most
crowning achievement is that I now own a 4,000 square foot building,-
and it is valued at over $400,000.<BR>
<P>
I have been self-employed for 22 years.  Over the
last 16 years, I have discovered that one of the biggest obstacles
to small business growth is government interference and micro-management.
 I have spent nearly 12 years fighting state government's for
the right to operate my business in the United States, free of
nonsensical bureaucratic regulations.  And now this: an unfunded
mandate.<BR>
<P>
For this and a host of other reasons to follow, I
oppose an increase in the starting wage.  The proposals by President
Clinton and members of Congress to increase the starting wage
creates another hurdle for small business growth.  It  represents
another death nail in the coffin of the United States' free enterprise
system and makes a mockery of the notion that we can produce,
manufacture, and exchange goods and services free of government
regulation and interference.  Because of federal legislation,
the free market system no longer exists.  As a champion of that
system, I oppose a <U>mandated</U> starting wage.  And I most
definitely oppose an <U>increase</U> in the starting wage.<BR>
<P>
The government should protect free enterprise, not
hinder it.  Has this Congress or the Clinton Administration given
any thought to the consequences of their &quot;feel good&quot;
legislation on the small businesses that create America's job
opportunities?  <BR>
<P>
By forcing me to pay a mandated minimum wage, <U>with
no consideration given to my business operations, market conditions
or feasibility studies</U>, not only does the federal government
imply its distrust of me as a businessperson, but also, the government
risk the employment of low-skilled people - the purported beneficiaries
of the proposed wage hike.<BR>
<P>
For the people of the District of Columbia, the impact
of a mandated wage hike will have implications well beyond the
political grandstanding of those interested in creating &quot;feel-good,
election year&quot; legislation.<BR>
<P>
  First, minimum-wage workers know that the more
they earn, the more federal, state, county and/or local government's
will claim for taxes.  The impact of the wage hike on the take-home
pay of minimum wage earners will be negligible.  <BR>
<P>
Second, while the impact of the wage hike on the
take-home pay would be negligible for minimum wage earners, the
impact of the mandate on employers would be substantial.  As payroll
dollars increase, so does employers' cost for worker's compensation,
Social Security, Medicare, and both federal and local unemployment
compensation. <BR>
<P>
Third, under existing law, businesses operating in
the District of Columbia must pay minimum wage employees $1 above
the federal rate.  Currently in D.C., unskilled employees' wages
start at $5.25 an hour.  If Congress mandates President Clinton's
proposal to raise the starting wage by $0.90, I would be forced
to pay an untrained, unskilled worker $6.15 per hour.  <BR>
<P>
How can I afford to bring in an unskilled worker,
when for the duration of the training period, he or she generates
no revenue?  What if this employee leaves during the training
period?  What about my losses?  Where is my incentive to hire
an unskilled employee who requires extensive and intensive training,
generates no revenue, and costs me a minimum of $50 per day? 
<BR>
<P>
The District of Columbia's current starting wage
-- at a rate higher than the federal mandate -- already forces
me and other employers to close the door on applicants unqualified
to do the job at $5.25 an hour.  Are these applicants more qualified
at $6.15 an hour?<BR>
<P>
An increase in the starting wage will not benefit
low-skilled workers. To counter the starting wage increase, small
businesses, like mine, will not hire low-skilled workers.  Some
employers may even reduce current employee hours or raise prices.
 All of these effects risk the livelihood of the low-skilled worker,
again, the &quot;ghostly&quot; beneficiary of a wage increase.
<BR>
<P>
I cannot afford to hire unskilled applicants at the
minimum wage.  The cost of their employment would be too great
a burden for my business.  It is more cost effective for me to
hire a skilled worker.   Pay the skilled worker one and one-half
times more than the unskilled worker, and watch as the skilled
employee generates at least three times the revenue that an unskilled
employee could.  <BR>
<P>
A federally mandated starting wage does not work.
 Bureaucrats should stop imposing artificial wage rates on businesses.
 The unemployment effect that results from an increase will be
concentrated on the most disadvantaged of the work force -- unskilled,
at-risk youths.  <BR>
<P>
Further, the mandated starting wage implies that
the marketplace does not work.  This simply is not true.<BR>
<P>
In every industry, there is a need to keep quality
employees. And quality employees are paid based on their productivity
and worth, not on an arbitrary number selected by politicians.
 <BR>
<P>
<U>I started all of my employees at the minimum wage.</U>
 After a training period in which they increased their skills,
I increased their salary.  Now all of my employees <U>earn</U>
well above the minimum wage.<BR>
<P>
Know this: <U>I</U> increase my employees' salary,
not because the government commands me to, but because my employees
<U>earn</U> their salary increases.  I and other employers do
not need the government to micro-manage our businesses.<BR>

<P>
Small businesses, like mine, generate jobs.  Yet,
ever-increasing tax rates and regulatory burdens already destroys
incentives for small business creation in  cities.  Increasing
the minimum wage undoubtedly increases the tax and regulatory
costs of business operations.  As any economist knows, increasing
the regulatory and tax burden of small businesses will make economic
growth for the District or any municipality nonexistent. <BR>
<P>
Where is the &quot;feel good&quot; measure for business?
Where are the incentives and initiatives that induce me to hire
more workers, open more establishments, invest in the District's
economy?  What is being done to make the wage hike more palatable
for the small business owner already besieged by taxes and regulations?
<BR>
<P>
The wage hike proposal did not start the United States
down the road to economic ruin; no, that started when Congress
decided it had to regulate businesses in this country. <BR>
<P>
I was led to believe by the Clinton Administration
and members of Congress that the era of big government was over.
 I do not see an end to big government. </FONT>
<P>
We need a system that supports a free market economy
and increases business growth, opportunity and employment for
all Americans.  I urge the U.S. Congress to oppose an increase
in the minimum wage.  <BR>
<P>
Again, I thank the Committee and I look forward to
answering any questions you may have.</FONT>

<h3>"Superfund and Small Business"</h3> 
<b>Testimony by<br>
 Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<P>

before the <br>
Committee on Small Business
<P>U.S. House of 
Representatives</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>


Mrs. Chairwoman and Members of the Committee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss Superfund's impact on small businesses and ideas for reform.  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.<P>	Since its creation in 1980, Superfund has unleashed the bloated bureaucracy and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on unsuspecting businesses across the nation; turned essentially local or, at most, state problems into national woes;  set arbitrary and unattainable criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced many businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available for investment in certain industries; restrained job growth; and damaged U.S. international competitiveness.  Quite a record for one piece of legislation, but there is still more.<P>	

Small businesses -- whether seeking out additional capital for growth or just fighting to stay alive -- are particularly vulnerable to the woes of Superfund.  Legal costs, expenditures for cleaning up sites to which they contributed little, groping through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) bureaucracy, and a thick governmental fog obscuring future costs and risks, can stop a small business in its tracks and even kill it.<P>	

At the core of Superfund's problems is its mechanism for assigning liability to perfectly innocent parties.  If a business disposed of waste -- toxic or non-toxic, large or insignificant amounts -- in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, it can still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal site if it later became a Superfund site.  Notions of responsibility and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.<P>	

Indeed, in assigning liability under Superfund, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) utilizes highly questionable criteria:<P>
<ul>
<LI> Superfund allows for strict liability, i.e., regardless of intent or negligence.<P>

<LI> Superfund liability is retroactive, meaning that actions taken before the law was enacted still apply.  So even if firms were in full compliance of the law, Superfund still exposes them to liability.<P>

<LI> Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore, the EPA can require that one business pay for the entire clean up irrespective of the degree of its own contribution to the waste site and without consideration to the total number of contributors.  No concept of "fair share" exists under Superfund.  Seeking relief, this unfortunate EPA selectee files contribution suits against other businesses connected to the waste site.  All parties tend to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.  Legal costs balloon.<P>

<LI> Current or past owners of a Superfund site who contributed absolutely nothing to the waste problem can be held liable.<P>

<LI> The burden of proof lies with the accused to prove their innocence rather than the EPA proving guilt under Superfund.<P>	

The EPA's main criteria for assigning liability for a Superfund site often seems to merely be "deep pockets" -- whoever is able to pay will pay for a site clean up.  Of course, this is not an ironclad rule.  After all, sometimes deep pockets cannot be found, in which case anyone will do -- including small businesses with but the most distant relationship to the site.  And even if the EPA finds "deep pockets," these same "deep pockets" seek to recover their own costs by bringing contribution suits against these same small enterprises. </ul>
<P>As one might expect, this system has developed into a costly, legal quagmire.  Individual Superfund horror stories abound -- seemingly too numerous to count.  These are well documented, and I certainly can supply the Committee with many, but for now I would like to touch upon some of the overall, weighty costs of Superfund.  For example:<P>
<ul>
<LI> Of the 1,292 "worst" waste sites on the Superfund National Priority List (NPL), only 237 have been cleaned up -- about 18 percent -- according to Heritage Foundation analyst John Shanahan.  One should note that this is a more optimistic accounting of cleaned up sites.  On February 14, 1994, for example, Business Week reported that out of 1,270 sites on the Superfund list just 49 "have been completely cleaned up."<P>

<LI> Yet, the federal government has spent almost $10 billion on Superfund and forced private parties to kick in another $80 billion.  The average NPL site takes 10 years to clean up at an average cost of $30 million.  <P>

<LI> On average, transaction costs account for 32 
percent of total private-sector Superfund costs, with litigation making up 65 percent of this amount or 21 percent of total costs.<P>

<LI> Once caught in the Superfund liability morass, it becomes much more difficult for a firm to attract capital, make investments, and therefore, grow and create jobs.  Superfund's strict, retroactive, and joint and several liabilities create considerable uncertainties for firms.  Such unknown costs chase away investors and make expansion plans quite dubious.<P>

Small businesses suffer most under these added costs and 
risks.  Without the Superfund cloud hanging over it, investing in, starting up, and expanding a small venture is already a risky undertaking.  Superfund liabilities only raise the hurdles faced by small business even further.<P>

<LI> Superfund also creates disincentives for investment in long industrialized urban areas.  The threat of enormous liability discourages firms from buying land in and renewing formerly industrialized areas.  Instead, it's safer to build new facilities elsewhere.  So many U.S. cities already impose large burdens on the private sector -- including high taxes, heavy regulations, bloated government budgets, and more -- and Superfund adds to these costs.  Under such circumstances, it is no wonder that the entrepreneur is becoming an endangered species in many U.S. cities.<P>

<LI> Finally, according to a Center for the Study of American Business  Superfund study, "Superfund imposes much more stringent regulations on manufacturing and other firms doing business in the United States than these companies would be required to meet in other countries."  Interestingly, in nations like Canada, Mexico, Germany, Japan, Great Britain, and others, liability rarely reaches entities that legally disposed of their waste; instead, liability is linked to fault.<P>
</ul>
What should be done?  Understanding the 
constraints of the political process, the Small Business Survival Committee supports a three-step reform plan.<P>

As a first step, we support many measures currently under consideration in Congress, including repealing retroactive liability for all actions taken before 1987, as suggested by U.S. Representative Bill Zeliff (R-NH) in his proposed Superfund reform bill -- thereby eliminating costly litigation at about 80 percent of Superfund sites; from 1987 forward, basing liability on the proportion of waste a party contributed to the site; using science-based risk assessment to determine clean up remedies; capping the Superfund NPL of sites so that the Superfund program can be phased out; and no imposition of any new taxes.<P>	

As a second step, the Small Business Survival Committee supports the complete repeal of the strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes.  To achieve real fairness, even proportional liability must give way.   Superfund should only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke the law, who were negligent, fraudulent, deceptive , etc.  This is the only true "polluter pays" scenario.  Small businesses, or any sized business, that simply sent waste to a site in an honest manner, in full compliance with the law, should have absolutely no liability whatsoever.  In essence, they are not polluters.  <P>	Step three, or the final goal of Superfund reform, should be to terminate Superfund.  In fact, a waste site clean up is not a federal issue, unless, of course,  operated by the federal government or undertaken due to a new federal law or mandate.  In these two instances, federal responsibility is clear.  Otherwise, waste site clean ups should be left as local, or at most,  state issues.  Localities are in a better position to judge the costs and benefits of clean ups.  If completely unable to carry the costs of a necessary clean up, then state government should be turned to for assistance.    <P>	

State and local clean-up efforts have proved to be far more efficient, timely, and less costly.  Local individuals possess a far better understanding of their community's circumstances and needs than do EPA bureaucrats.<P>	

Once again, I thank you for inviting me here today to address the Superfund issue, and I would be glad to answer any questions you may have.

<title>   Testimony of Karen Kerrigan on Spectrum Allocation
</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">



<center><h3>Testimony of Karen Kerrigan<BR>
President<BR>
Small Business Survival Committee</h3>

<h4>Before
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation<BR>
United States Senate<BR>
September 12, 1995
<P>
On Spectrum Allocation</h4></center>
<hr>



Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee,
<P>
I am here today representing the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) -- a 40,000 
member nonpartisan, nonprofit advocacy organization which fights against the growing burden 
of taxes and regulations on America's small businesses and entrepreneurs -- SBSC supports free 
markets over government industrial policy.  SBSC also spearheads the Campaign for Broadcast 
Competition, a coalition of advocacy organizations opposing the proposed giveaway of the 
spectrum to the nation's broadcasters.   
<P>
I am especially pleased to be here today.  It is not often that one has the opportunity to 
publicly oppose what many have said will be the most expensive case of corporate welfare in the 
history of our Nation.
<P>
I am speaking, of course, about the proposed giveaway of the nation's airwaves to the 
broadcasting industry.  This is the expensive residue of a failed industrial policy, and it can, and 
should be reversed.
<P>
The story starts innocently enough with an "America first" technology program.  It turned 
into an unprecedented government giveaway of taxpayer-owned airwaves.  And, absent 
Congressional action, it will conclude by rewarding an industry which has time and again turned 
its back on its public service obligations.
<P>
As you know, Mr. Chairman, the Federal Communications Commission seven years ago 
pursued a plan to make High Definition Television (HDTV) the broadcasting standard for the 
United States.  As part of that plan, the FCC proposed giving the broadcasters new spectrum to 
allow them to move from analog television to HDTV.  Once HDTV was in place, the theory was, 
the analog spectrum would be returned to the government.<P>
<P>
As is often the case with bureaucrats playing venture capitalists, the market outsmarted 
and surpassed the government's chosen industrial "winner."  In this case, digital technology far 
outstripped the ability of bureaucrats to see into the future, rendering all of this planning for 
HDTV, for all intensive purposes, obsolete.
<P>
With the new digital technology each new digital TV channel can be used for one HDTV 
signal.  Or, it can be split into 6 very high quality digital TV signals.  (In other words  the 
spectrum gift combined with new digital technology now transforms CBS into 6 CBS's; ABC 
into 6 ABC's and so on).
<P>
This free new spectrum need not be used just for television; it will unlock an unlimited 
number of new lucrative businesses for the broadcasters.  The spectrum could be used to provide 
72 digital radio channels, computer data delivery, wireless telephone service, pay TV -- or any 
combination of each of them -- as well as other profitable uses.
<P>
In the face of the new technology, the broadcasters profess a continued commitment to
HDTV and the use of the new Advanced Television (ATV) channels for HDTV. 
<P>                                                                                                    
...Or maybe not.  This year the broadcasters have insisted on receiving the "flexibility" to 
use the spectrum as they see fit.   Broadcasters are actively exploring the opportunities for 
potential new services -- as they should be.  The questions today are:  why are the broadcasters 
the chosen few for the privilege of "spectrum flexibility," and why should they get it for free!
<P>
Now, as the broadcasters freely admit, HDTV is a technological and economic dinosaur.  
They don't want to be shackled to it, nor should they.  There is no market for it, and other digital 
technologies would use the airwaves far more efficiently.
<P>
The broadcasters correctly realize that new digital technology will transform communications as we know it.  And what they want is the valuable distribution pipeline -- the 
spectrum -- with no strings attached.  They clearly do not want it for the purpose for which it was 
intended -- providing HDTV.  They may want it to provide digital television.  But, no one really 
knows, since the technology is changing almost daily.
<P>
But while the broadcasters don't want to be held to the HDTV implementation, they still 
want the additional spectrum -- free of charge.  Why?  Because it is valuable.  If this spectrum 
were auctioned as the PCS spectrum was last year, it could raise between $10 billion and $100 
billion.
<P>
Even in Washington, that's a lot of money.  These market value estimates are not just 
random numbers picked out of  a hat.  Even the FCC conservatively estimates that the spectrum 
is worth between $11 billion and $70 billion.1  <P>In response to questions from the Senate, the FCC has attempted to calculate the potential value of the spectrum.  Within the past few weeks, ITT and Dow Jones paid a whopping $207 million to buy WNYC, New York City's local public UHF station.  The station has few hard assets, no programming appeal -- its new owners are going to switch to commercial programming, with a limited viewership . . . In short, the 26 companies who bid for WNYC wanted to pay big bucks for one thing, its spectrum.
<P>
Based solely on the $207 million paid for WNYC, the FCC valued the spectrum 
potentially at $37 billion.
<P>
"Even" at $37 billion, the figure is more than double the amount this committee needs to 
raise to reach its target in the massive effort to balance the federal budget.  And, the FCC says 
this a conservative estimate.  Some experts estimate that the market value of the digitized spectrum in the not too distant future will reach nearly a half-trillion dollars.
<P>
And the FCC doesn't disagree.2   In a May 5th letter, the FCC said that private market valuation of the spectrum in the future might approach $500 billion.<P>Why this special gift of largesse to the broadcasters?  The proposed giveaway not only flys in the face of efforts to balance the budget but also bucks a profound message that voters sent to Washington last November -- no more coddling of special interests at the expense of other Americans.<P>The giveaway to the broadcasters can't be a reward for the great job they've done serving 
the public good --  as they claim, and as required by their current licenses.  As everyone who has 
a TV knows, and as numerous Congressional hearings this year have shown, the broadcasters 
have done a good job at packing the airwaves with programming that the majority of American 
households find troubling and offensive.
<P>
One media reviewer said that the broadcasters' motto for the upcoming fall lineup must 
be:  "To hell with kids.  Many of the wholesome sitcoms that once ruled the 8:00-9:00 pm hour 
have gone to the graveyard, replaced by racier fair. . ."3<P>The news coverage is no better.  The president of NBC's News Division, Andrew Lack, admitted that "too often we now choose, without a moment's hesitation, to report the story that makes you fell repulsion over the story that makes you think -- which in television means usually boring."  Mr. Lack went on to ask his peers:  "And why do we keep pushing it?  Are we all just whores in search of another share point or a better November book?"4 <P>While the broadcasters hide behind their "unique public service" responsibilities as an argument to shield them from a prospective auction of the valuable spectrum; the public, media critiques and now industry insiders question their competency in this regard.<P>Of course, competition in the form of cable, direct broadcast satellite, on-line computer services and more has given consumers added viewing choices.  Broadcasters have not gone the wayside because of this competition.  Their bottom-lines and profits continue to increase.
<P>
The broadcasters plead that to pay for spectrum will kill "free" TV.  But the recent 
purchase prices and bids for the networks prove that investment money is available for those who 
want to have the privilege of providing "free" TV.  Walt Disney, which paid $19.3 billion for 
ABC/Cap Cities obviously sees investment pay-offs.  Westinghouse which offered $5.4 billion 
for CBS appears to view the business as profitable as well.
<P>
In the past year alone, the networks combined revenues were $21.42 billion.  Their 
combined profits were $2.82 billion.   Clearly, broadcasting is more profitable than ever.
<P>
Robert Wright, [president] of NBC, recently told the National Press Club that "right now 
broadcast television -- and NBC -- are both having banner years.  And even more important, the 
fundamentals of the industry are looking strong as well."  Congratulations Mr. Wright.  Keep up 
the good work.  Apparently advertising-supported TV is doing fine, and will continue to profit 
handsomely -- without a big government handout.
<P>
The FCC agrees with Mr. Wright:  over-the-air broadcasting is and will continue to 
thrive.5     In a September letter, the FCC pointed to the ABC, CBS and WNYC deals, and concluded that:  "free over-the-air television is such a lucrative business, there is no reason to believe that either analog or digital broadcasters will cease providing this service."<P>Finally, advertising-supported broadcasting will only go away if its viewership goes 
away.  If the audience is there, advertisers will continue to subsidize what the broadcasters 
modestly call "free" TV by paying for the right to reach viewers.
<P>
The broadcasters also claim that "they" shouldn't be singled our for auctions, and that the 
Commerce Committee should auction the government spectrum first.
<P>
However, as Faye Anderson one of my close colleagues has recently stated, comparing 
the broadcast spectrum to government spectrum is like comparing "pork loin to pig's feet."
<P>
According to Dale Hatfield, a noted spectrum expert and Reagan Administration 
technology official, this is the cleanest spectrum available.  It is beachfront property.  Mr. 
Chairman, to paraphrase Willie Sutton, if you are going to raise money through auctions, you 
must go where the value is.
<P>
More importantly, the broadcasters are not the only users who have been asked to pay for 
the public airwaves.  As the Committee well knows, Congress in 1993 mandated that the FCC  
auction all licenses for new spectrum.  For example, the FCC already has sold only a part of the 
PCS spectrum for $8 billion.  That's $8 billion that went to the US Treasury.
<P>
If they want to play, let's have them pay.  If it is good enough for PCS, it is good enough 
for all the new businesses the broadcasters hope to pursue.
<P>
Now, the broadcasters have two other arguments.  First, they argue that such a large 
auction of spectrum will depress values and thus won't raise much money.  Then, they argue that 
broadcasters couldn't possibly afford the spectrum, and thus couldn't provide digital television.  
Our question is, which one is it?
<P>
Either way, the public wins.  We tend to believe that there will be buyers for this 
spectrum.  The FCC agrees.  With all the possible benefits of digital broadcasting, the FCC 
expects that numerous companies, <u>including the broadcasters</U>, will compete for and likely win many digital licenses.6   In other words, somewhere between here and the auction block, the broadcasters will figure out ways to participate in the bidding process.
<P>
This, of course, begs the question:  is the government and the U.S. taxpayer responsible 
for guaranteeing NBC's long-term success, or any other broadcaster's?  I don't think so.
<P>
One last question:  under the current broadcaster proposal, the broadcasters will retain 
their analog signal for anywhere between 10 and 15 years, when digital TV becomes the 
standard.  What happens after 15 years and digital TV has only penetrated 80 percent of the 
market or 90 percent or even 95 percent?  Is Congress going to turn off the analog signal just like 
that?  Even if millions upon millions of their constituents are still watching analog televisions?  
In short, the broadcasters will continue to own their analog licenses for the foreseeable future and 
beyond, even while they get to exploit the myriad new digital technologies.  This is unfair no 
matter how you slice it.
<P>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Commerce Committee, I realize that the broadcasters 
have been an extremely powerful lobby in Washington.  Given the upsurge in interest we have 
seen on this issue, I think that their political dominance, as with this deal, is largely a thing of the 
past.
<P>
What you have today is an opportunity  -- perhaps the last opportunity in the foreseeable 
future -- to encourage the development of an innovative, competitive, profitable broadcasting 
future, instead of tying the future to the history of the past fifty years.
<P>
You have the opportunity to raise tens of billions of dollars and in so doing demonstrate a 
careful stewardship of one of our nation's most valuable assets.
<P>
And you have the chance to encourage competition while destroying the most egregious 
of set-asides.
<P>
In his June speech, Mr. Wright spoke of the need to encourage change and competition in the communications marketplace.
<P>
Technological change is already upon us:  new digital technologies will soon allow the 
new spectrum to be used to transmit multiple digital TV signals; additional subscription services 
-- like HBO; newspapers; local news and data; computer/video games. . .the options are nearly 
endless.
<P>
The problem is that the broadcasters now ask that Congress give them a free ride in this 
technological carnival.  Mr. Wright recently estimated that this market generates $100 billion in 
annual revenues.7  And NBC and CBS and ABC and FOX and all the other broadcasters want in. . . the easy, cheap way.<P>Of course, they're already all already part way there.  NBC alone: owns two 24-hour cable 
networks, has interests in 19 other cable networks, has multiple international broadcasting 
properties; and has entered the new computer-media market with NBC Desktop Video, NBC 
Digital Publishing and NBC Data Network.

<P>
Clearly, the broadcasters are financially capable and market savvy enough to identify and exploit new markets.  They don't need the government's help.  They already control a majority of 
the TV market.  We don't need to give them a head start in the race to win the digital 
marketplace.
<P>
I look forward to discussing this issue with you and answering any questions you have.
<P>
Thank you.           <P>

<h3>Dismantling the U.S. Department of Commerce</h3> 
<b>Testimony by<br>
 Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<P>

before the <br>
Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and Technology
<br>Government Reform and Oversight Committee
<P>U.S. House of 
Representatives</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the "Department of Commerce Dismantling Act."  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.

<P>	Let me start off by putting your minds at ease.  In no way does the survival of America's small businesses depend upon the continuing existence of the U.S. Department of Commerce, despite what some Commerce Department supporters may tell you.  For example, in a Small Business Survival Committee survey earlier this year, we found that 65 percent of small business owners saw the government as an opponent, while only 34 percent perceived government as a partner.  While the Commerce Department may help a few, select businesses, the other businesses and taxpayers who foot the bill see it as just another federal government department costing them money.  In contrast, the dismantling of the Commerce Department could have a very significant, positive impact on the entrepreneurial sector of our economy.	<P>
Rather than perpetuating failed industrial policy in the form of the Commerce Department, the most productive steps Congress can take to help the entrepreneur would be to downsize government, cut taxes, deregulate industry, and lower trade barriers -- essentially, get government out of the way.  The Small Business Survival Committee believes that the seemingly relentless trek toward a $2-trillion federal government must be stopped and reversed.  Eliminating the Commerce Department is an important early step in this process for three main reasons:
<ul>
<li> First, as described in the attached Small Business Survival Committee report, which I ask be placed into the record, the Commerce Department is a $3.6 billion department filled with programs and endeavors that either would be better left to the private sector (such as economic development and technology investment), or should be moved to other federal departments (like the Patent and Trademark Office to the Justice Department).
<P>
<li> Second, the Commerce Department stands as an example of the grand delusion of government's powers and abilities.  Supporters of the Commerce Department, most prominently Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, claim that the department serves taxpayers and the economy well by increasing U.S. exports, seeding new technologies, and boosting economic growth.  Secretary Brown even asserted at the White House Conference on Small Business on June 13, 1995 that the Commerce Department leveraged a "$250 million export promotion budget into $25 billion in overseas sales."  He also stated that an end to the Department's Manufacturing Extension Program would leave "America's 380,000 small manufacturers, with nearly twelve million employees, without accessible and supportive local extension programs providing up-to-date strategies and technologies."  
<P>
Such declarations are, to say the least, most difficult to believe.  Indeed, if America's small manufacturers relied on a government program for "up-to-date strategies and technologies" and exporters depended on Commerce bureaucrats to sell their wares, our economy today would be a third-world basketcase.  Again, Secretary Brown and other Commerce Department proponents fall prey to the grand delusion of industrial policy.  
<P>
In reality, government does not possess the proper knowledge and incentives to be picking industry winners and losers; nor should taxpayer dollars be placed at risk in such futile endeavors.  As for expanding U.S. exports, the federal government's role should be limited to lowering trade barriers.  And in terms of boosting economic growth, the economy would be far better served, as I've already said,  if taxes were cut -- boosting incentives to work, invest, and take risks -- and the Commerce Department terminated.  In the end, individuals buying, selling, creating, and investing in the marketplace always work better than government bureaucrats pushing paper and spending taxpayer dollars.
<P>
<li> Third, if you are going to cut spending across the federal budget, as the Small Business Survival Committee urges Congress to do, then it makes sense to start with the easy cuts.  
<P>The Commerce Department is an easy cut.  If you can't make the easy cuts, then what happens when you get to the more politically difficult, though still very much economically sound, spending reductions?  
</ul><P>
The Commerce Department does not serve the taxpayers well and should be eliminated.  It is the Small Business Survival Committee's position that this be done in a timely fashion.  We support the idea of the Commerce Programs Resolution Agency (CPRA) being given a set time period in which to dismantle the department and then terminate its own operations.  

<P>
While not offering specifics in terms of budgets and resources for CPRA, we assume it will be a lean entity operating on a portion of the savings from the immediate cuts in Commerce Department programs.  The Small Business Survival Committee does offer a few principles that should govern the Commerce Department termination process:
<ul>
<li> The goals and mission of the CPRA should be clear cut from the beginning.  The final resting place for each program and agency within the Commerce Department should be already determined (i.e., either termination, privatization, or transfer to another agency) prior to the CPRA team being established.
<P>
<li> Congress should be strict with its time limitation on the CPRA, and leave no door ajar for extensions.  Indeed, we urge you to more closely examine whether three years are actually necessary to carry out this process.  It seems rather lengthy.   After all it does not take a business that was sunk by high taxes and onerous regulations that long to close its doors.
<P>
<li> To ensure that the CPRA remains a temporary entity that does not turn into a permanent bureaucracy, the Small Business Survival Committee suggests that its duties be contracted out to a private firm specializing in organizational overhauls and business downsizings.  The firm's performance would be reviewed regularly while under contract.  Indeed, Congress should offer incentives to speed up the process of closing the doors of the Commerce Department in order to save taxpayer dollars.
<P>
<li> The CPRA should be viewed neither as an extension of the Commerce Department or as a new agency.  Instead, it should be viewed as a temporary transition team to shut down the Commerce Department.  In fact, Congress probably should not call it an "agency" at all -- avoiding any sense of permanency.
</ul>
<P>
In closing, I would just urge you to be bold.  The vast majority of America's entrepreneurs and taxpayers see a clear need for reducing government's role in the economy.  Eliminating the Commerce Department should be the beginning of downsizing the federal government.	Thank you again for inviting me here today, and I would be glad to answer any of your questions.

<h3>Reforming OSHA</h3> 
<b>Testimony by<br>
 Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<P>

before the <br>
Subcommittee on Workforce Protections<br>Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities<P>U.S. House of 
Representatives</b></center>
<hr>
<P>	


Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, and OSHA  reform in general.  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.<P>	

How could anyone find fault with a government agency named the "Occupational Safety and Health Administration"?  However, in fact, there is much to find fault with at OSHA.  OSHA has become a burdensome regulatory body which seems to be more concerned with paper pushing and imposing fines rather than with assisting businesses in establishing safer working environments. This is the view justifiably held by many business owners and operators, including most of the Small Business Survival Committee's 40,000 members.  Indeed, a recent nationwide survey of 500 small businesses sponsored by SBSC revealed that OSHA ranked with the IRS and the EPA as the most burdensome federal agencies.<P>	

Contrary to the view of OSHA's most enthusiastic proponents, the private sector possesses every incentive to maintain a safe and healthy working environment for employees.  Indeed, beyond a commonly held concern for one's employees, the financial incentives for safety are substantial.  I.e., safety pays.  "Safety" costs for U.S. business in 1992 were estimated in excess of $200 billion, far outweighing the $72 million in OSHA citations.<P>	

Workplaces that are not safe have always been and remain the exception rather than the rule.  OSHA acts under the opposite assumption, thereby imposing significant and unnecessary costs on business and the economy.  Such costs translate into less entrepreneurship, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs.  It is time that OSHA's regulations and activities reflect the fact that most businesses do indeed maintain "safe and healthful working conditions."<P>	The evidence that OSHA has gone far astray from an educational, advisory and cooperative relationship with business is substantial.  Indeed, OSHA's concern for real safety seems lost in a bureaucratic and regulatory haze of paperwork, citation quotas, and remarkably inane regulations.  I have outlined some of these developments, along with other related facts about OSHA regulations and expenditures, in the accompanying paper entitled "Warning: OSHA Can Be Hazardous to the Nation's Economic Health."  I ask that this short analysis be submitted into the record.<P>	

There are three points from this analysis I would like to mention here.  First, OSHA manages to combine two of the worst aspects of government regulatory bodies.  It creates an incredible paperwork burden on U.S. business.  In 1994, seven of the top ten most frequent OSHA citations were related to paperwork.  OSHA has perfected the government "make work" scheme -- generate a blizzard of paperwork regulations and then fine businesses for not complying.<P>	

Second, a prevailing problem with government regulation and inspections of any industry or workplace is that most, if not all, regulators are not experts in particular industries.  If they were experts, one would expect that they would hold productive, private sector jobs.  They are government bureaucrats.  Bureaucrats know paperwork.  Hence, the most cited violations by OSHA are paperwork related.  <P>	

Third, the gross budget authority for OSHA was over $298 million in 1994.  Tax dollars spent on federal enforcement and state programs (administering and enforcing state standards) account for 70 percent of OSHA's budget.  As with many of OSHA's other activities, I think this reflects an attitude of confrontation towards rather than cooperation with business.<P>	Even after one notes the many OSHA horror stories, regulations, paperwork burdens, and costs, some still claim that OSHA's benefits outweigh its many costs.  For example, in a May 16, 1995 speech, President Clinton linked OSHA with reduced workplace deaths.  He stated: "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been at work in this cause since it was created with bipartisan support in 1970.  Since that time, workplace deaths have been cut in half."<P>

Of course, workplace deaths were on the decline long before OSHA was created.  Fewer workplace deaths reflect many changes in our economy -- greater automation, shift in employment from manufacturing to services, leaps in technology, enhanced knowledge, et al.  There exists no clear and substantial evidence that OSHA has played any significant role in preventing workplace injuries or death.<P>	

In light of these facts, SBSC supports Representative Cass Ballenger's "Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995."  It offers many real, positive OSHA reforms.  In particular, I'd like to note the following:<P>
<ul>
<LI> A Voluntary Compliance Program (VCP) allowing any employer to utilize an approved private-sector safety and health consultant for safety and health reviews.  Participants in the VCP would be exempt from random OSHA inspections for up to one year.  	Such a reform will help to alleviate the problem of lack of expertise among OSHA inspectors.  By essentially contracting out these inspections to the private sector, private firms, including perhaps insurance companies, will have clear incentives to become industry experts, more so than government bureaucrats today.<P>

<LI> An opportunity for an employer to correct alleged safety and health violations before a citation is issued, unless a fatality or serious injury occurred.  With so many OSHA rules and regulations, allowing employers to correct alleged violations before being fined is a fair, much-needed reform.  This reform also should reduce OSHA's own paperwork burden.<P>

<LI> Eliminates penalties for posting and paperwork violations, except where a direct threat of injury or an intent to deceive OSHA exist.  This will considerably rollback OSHA's ability to impose frivolous penalties on employers, saving millions of dollars annually.<P>

<LI> Formally codifies the small business OSHA exemption 
from routine safety inspections, and expands it to firms with  50 or fewer employees that have below average injury rates.<P><LI> Requires the application of cost benefit, risk assessment, and regulatory impact analyses to OSHA regulations.  <P>

<LI> Reserves at least 50 percent of the OSHA budget for consultation, training, education, and compliance assistance programs.  This would be a good first step toward making OSHA a more cooperative federal agency.<P>

<LI> Seeks to apply stricter, non-arbitrary criteria in 
order for OSHA to levy fines in excess of $7,000.<P>

<LI> Requires that employees first go to employers to 
redress workplace problems before approaching OSHA.  Such a measure should greatly reduce frivolous and harassing complaints by employees who are disgruntled or in the midst of a labor dispute.<P>

<LI> Consolidates the Mine Safety and Health Administration with OSHA, and eliminates the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.  SBSC is a strong supporter of all efforts to eliminate waste and duplication in government, and to reduce government expenditures.<P>	These OSHA reforms and others included in Representative Ballenger's bill amount to much more than rhetoric about "reinventing" government.  They are real reforms that make for a somewhat saner regulatory regime, and will positively impact U.S. businesses and the economy.
<P>	</ul>
A new regulatory framework is needed in the United States.  One that no longer incorrectly assumes that business owners are merely callous exploiters of labor, but recognizes them as the risk takers, job creators, innovators, and producers they actually are.  If the U.S. economy is to compete and succeed in the twenty-first century, government's heavy hand of over-regulation must be lifted.  Reforming OSHA is a good start which has SBSC's full support.<P>

I thank the Committee, once again, for inviting me here today.  I will be glad to answer any questions you might have, and I offer SBSC's assistance in your efforts to provide for a saner regulatory environment in the United States.<P>

Before the <br>

June 6, 1995<p>
</center>                                
<hr>
<p>

     Good morning Chairman Archer and members of the committee.  My name is Ray Tyler, 
owner of Tyler Business Services located in Washington, D.C.  I am also a member of the Small 
Business Survival Committee, a nationwide, nonprofit, nonpartisan small business advocacy 
organization that fights against the growing burden of taxes and regulations on our nation's
small businesses and entrepreneurs.  Tyler Business Services is a full-service printing shop which
has been operating in the nation's capital for 35 years.<p>

     First, let me thank you Chairman Archer for inviting me to speak before the Ways and 
Means Committee today.  Secondly, I congratulate you for holding these hearings to address
the important issue of overhauling our nation's tax system.  Your leadership in this area is critical to 
not only today's small businesses and entrepreneurs, but also to the well-being of future small 
business owners  who indeed will need this committee's help to increase their chance of
success and survival.<p>

     I say this Chairman Archer, because I have been a small business owner for over 35 years 
and have seen the increased tax and regulatory burden placed on my own business.  The only 
way that I have been able to keep the doors of my business open has been through the paid 
assistance of professionals who specialize in the tax compliance area -- namely a 
Certified Public Accountant (CPA), a full-time bookkeeper, an attorney and bankers.<p>

     Last year my CPA cost the business over $9,000.  At least 10 percent of my 
staff bookkeeper's salary  -- about $4,500 -- is dedicated to dealing with lawyers, bankers and 
IRS issues.  The company pension fund, which I used to manage myself as well as pay 
someone $1,000 to do actuarial work ten years ago, cost me $26,000 last year because of
changes in the way the IRS administers the tax fund.  My billing department also incurs hefty tax code 
compliance costs.  And, of course, my time must be factored into these overall costs as well 
which take away from my productive time actually running the business.    Let me again add that 
these are just compliance costs -- not the actual taxes! <p>

     Today's small businessperson almost always has to pay professionals to navigate 
them through the complicated tax compliance maze.  And, this is a never-ending changing 
maze I might add.  According to the Tax Foundation, over the past forty years (since the
passage of the Internal Revenue Act of 1954 which put the income tax at the center of the federal tax 
system) thirty-one notable tax changes have taken place -- on average, a major change to the 
federal tax code every 1.3 years.  Not surprisingly, the increase of  the size and complexity of
the tax code has caused an increase in my tax compliance costs. <p>
  
     The uncertainty and instability of the tax system, the number of taxes that I must pay, 
combined with my total tax bill, and compliance costs is enough to drive anyone out of business. <p>

I'm not quite sure how a person starting his or her own business can quite make it these days.  
Fortunately my business has grown, and with it have been able to factor in the cost of taxes and 
tax compliance into my overall business costs.  I am almost sure that many business failures
are the direct result of our nation's excessive and burdensome tax system.  The current system
creates disincentives to save, invest and pursue risk-taking, entrepreneurial activity. <p>

     Many, many times in my business I try to do the right thing for my employees by creating 
incentives for them to stay with the business, and while they are with us be more productive 
employees.  When I first created a pension plan for the business (as mentioned above) I used
to manage it, but because of the complexity of the tax laws I had to turn it over to the bankers and 
the lawyers.  Now I just sign the reams of paperwork from the bank, and pay a lot to do simply 
that. <p>
                                
     At the end of each month if the business turns a profit, I also give bonuses to my 
employees.  The government even makes this difficult because I have to "renegotiate" salaries
to comply with misguided regulations.<p>

     The bottom-line to the costly and burdensome tax system is that my employees are hurt 
through lower wages, and my customers are hurt through higher prices.  And my business is
only one example of how the government is depressing our nation's standard of living and hurting 
economic growth and job creation.  <p>

     I, like many other small business owners, agree that something must be done to make our 
tax system less-costly, less-burdensome and more efficient.  That is why Chairman Archer you, 
and other leaders in the Congress who are advocating far-reaching proposals to overhaul the
tax system have certainly won the hearts of many small business owners.  And, although you may 
have won our hearts, lawmakers have not yet won our minds.  Because many small business 
owners believe that the federal government is incapable of making a tax system fair and less-
burdensome.  This is only an honest assessment of how many small business owners feel.  <p>

     However, I remain confident that perhaps this will occur in my lifetime.  By the way, I 
am 75 years-old and would appreciate it if you put these tax overhaul efforts on the
fast-track.<p>

     While at this point in time I do not advocate one tax system over another, I agree with 
some basic principles which have been well presented by the Small Business Survival 
Foundation.  Two leading proposals which "score" high against these principles are a flat tax
and a consumption tax -- or the national sales tax.  The basics of a sound tax system developed by
the Small Business Survival Foundation, and based on Adam Smith's maxims of a taxation in 1776, 
include:<p>
<ul>

<li>          Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth
<li>          No Taxation of Capital
<li>          Inflation Factor
<li>          Clarity
<li>          Simplicity
<li>          Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness
<li>          Minimum Incentives for Tax Avoidance
<li>          No Additional Boost to Government Spending

</ul>
     I'd like to leave with you Chairman Archer, and I am sure that the Small Business 
Survival Foundation would make this available to all members of the committee, a copy of a 
Preliminary Report prepared by  the organization's chief economist called "The Great Tax 
Debate:  Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans."  This report details each of the above 
principles in greater detail, and how leading proposals score against the basics of a sound tax 
system. <p>

     Once again Chairman Archer I thank you for inviting me to be a part of these important 
hearings today.  While typical Washington observers will say that overhauling the nation's tax 
system is an impossible task that will never happen, I am just thrilled that we have entered a 
political environment where this debate is actually occurring.<p>

     Most hard-working taxpayers agree that something must be done to make the U.S. tax 
code more fair, less-costly and less-burdensome.  For our nation's small business owners, the 
current tax code is a mess and totally out-of-control.  I am so pleased that you are taking a lead
to help reward our nation's risk-takers and job creators which will lead to greater economic 
opportunity and security for all Americans.  I would be more than happy to answer any
questions you or committee members may have.   <p>

<h3>The Flat Tax and Small Business</h3>
Testimony by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist<br>
The Small Business Survival Committee<p>
Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance <br>
Committee on Small Business<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
May 18, 1995<p>
</center>
<hr>
<p>

Madam Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the flat income tax and its impact on the small business, entrepreneurial sector of our economy.  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small-business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.<p>

As you well know, entrepreneurs drive the economy.  By creating and investing in new businesses, ideas, and innovations, the entrepreneur ensures capitalism's constant renewal and growth.  While government can assist this process by protecting life and limb and guaranteeing property rights, government unfortunately more often than not creates obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic growth.  Perhaps the most formidable of the many governmental obstacles thrown in the path of entrepreneurs during this century has been the U.S. federal income tax code.<p>

	As constituted today,  the federal income tax system amounts to a convoluted mess.  It is complicated, inefficient, intrusive, and serves as an impediment to entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation.<p>

	To that end, it should come as no surprise that the great debate on overhauling our nation's tax system is welcomed with open arms by our nation's small business owners.  In fact, according to a recent survey by the Small Business Survival Committee and the Luntz Research Companies, the flat tax is resonating very favorably with the small business, entrepreneurial sector.  When given the specifics of Representative Dick Armey's flat tax plan, 56 percent of respondents from a nationwide survey of 500 small businesses supported the flat tax while 36 percent opposed it.  The intensity of the support is interesting as 25 percent "strongly support" the flat tax while 31 percent "somewhat support" it.  In terms of opposition to the flat tax, 15 percent of small business respondents "somewhat oppose," and 21 percent "strongly oppose" it.<p>  

	While the Small Business Survival Committee does not base its policy positions on surveys and polls, I provide you with these numbers to give the Committee a sense of the support for a flat tax in the business community.  We also found interesting trends in our survey based on business size and geographic location.  The larger the business, the greater was the intensity of support.  In terms of geographic location, businesses in the Mid-Atlantic, Southern, and Western states were more favorable to a flat tax, while respondents in New England, the Mid-West, rust-belt, and Pacific Coast states registered a greater intensity of opposition.  Please note, however, that across all categories of business size and location, support was strong for a flat tax.<p>

	Let me add again that we outlined the flat tax proposal for each participant -- specifically mentioning which tax write-offs they would lose, and what would not be taxed 
under the Armey plan.<p>

	In the accompanying Small Business Survival Foundation study (each of you should have a copy), I outlined some basic criteria for a sound tax system.  These are: <p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth</b> -- the lower and more proportional, or flatter, the tax rate system the better.  A flat tax is a fair system, as individuals and businesses pay taxes in proportion to the income they earn.  And more importantly, a low, flat tax rate creates far fewer disincentives for working, investing, and risk taking than does a system of steeply progressive tax rates.<p>

<li><b>No Taxation of Capital </b> -- taxing returns on investment and savings makes absolutely no economic sense. Taxes on savings, dividends and capital gains amount to double taxation and are essentially levies on economic growth.<p>

<li><b>Inflation Factor</b> -- the detrimental effects of inflation should be factored into any tax system's design.<p>

<li><b>Clarity</b> -- the clearer the tax system the better.  It should be apparent how much is owed, who is paying, and when the tax is being paid.<p>

<li><b>Simplicity</b> -- tax payments should be made as easy and as simple as possible for the taxpayer without any loss of clarity.  <p>

<li><b>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness</b> -- the fewer tax collectors and the more limited their powers the better.<p>

<li><b>Minimize Incentives for Tax Avoidance</b> -- taxes should be low enough and easy enough to comply with so as to not provide significant incentives for avoidance.<p>

<li><b>No Additional Boost to Government Spending</b> -- a tax system's design should not make it any easier for government to increase expenditures.<p>
</ul>
<p>
Our current income tax system scores miserably according to these criteria:<p>
<ul>
<li>Current tax rates are high and progressive -- punishing work, success and the economy.<p>

<li>Capital is taxed, including interest from savings, dividends, and capital gains.  As you know the top capital gains tax rate for individuals stands at 28 percent, and for corporations at 35 percent.<p>

<li>In terms of the inflation factor, the current system is split.  On the positive side, tax rates are indexed so that merely inflationary increases in income no longer push taxpayers into higher tax brackets.  On the negative side, capital gains are not indexed for inflation.  Under such a regime, the <i>real </i>tax rate on capital gains is much higher than the stated rate of 28 percent.  In fact, investors can wind up paying taxes on real capital losses under the current system.  Since one of the major difficulties facing most small businesses is raising capital, high, real capital gains tax rates are particularly detrimental.<p>

<li>Withholding and corporate taxation make the current system quite murky as to who is paying taxes, when, and how much?<p>

<li>As for simplicity, in the accompanying paper I outline just a handful of our current system's many costs and complexities.  Suffice it to say here that I have never met <i>anyone </i>claiming that our current income tax system was simple.<p>

<li>Few, if anyone, also claim that our system allows for a small tax collection bureaucracy or limited government intrusiveness into the private financial affairs of citizens.<p>

<li>The combination of high tax rates and tax law complexities create significant incentives for tax avoidance and evasion.<p>

<li>Finally, the income tax, especially one with high, progressive tax rates, has always acted as high-octane fuel for government spending.<p>
</ul>
<p>
	To the contrary, a low-rate, flat income tax scores very high according to our criteria for a sound tax system.<p>
<ul>
<li>As currently debated, a flat tax system would impose a rate of about 17 percent on all income above a certain level allowed for exemptions.  A 17 percent top tax rate would be the lowest this nation has witnessed since before World War I.  The rewards for working, risk taking, and succeeding would be greatly enhanced.<p>

<li>Capital would not be taxed.  Interest on savings, dividends, and capital gains would not be taxed -- eliminating current double taxation and providing a huge boost to economic growth.  Obviously, incentives for saving, investment, and entrepreneurship would skyrocket, and trillions of dollars would be freed up and made available for investment in new and expanding businesses.<p>

<li>Under a flat-tax-rate scenario with no taxation of capital gains, government possesses few, if any, tax-related reasons to inflate.<p>

<li>If a flat tax eliminates withholding, as Representative Dick Armey's plan would, the true cost of government will become increasingly clear to the average citizen.  Though, by continuing to tax business income, the system would still lack complete clarity, as corporate taxes would be at least partially hidden in the form of lower profits or higher prices.<p>

<li>A low, flat income tax would be vastly simpler than our current system.  Tax compliance costs would plummet.  Resources would be shifted away from tax-related make-work to productive ventures.<p>

<li>As for bureaucracy, the IRS could be greatly downsized as tax complexities evaporate and both individuals and businesses file returns on small index cards.  The potential dangers of government intrusiveness, however, still exist with such an income tax.  The IRS would continue to poke its nose around in the private financial affairs of citizens, but probably to a lessor extent than today.<p>

<li>The combination of a low tax rate and the elimination of deductions and credits, greatly limits incentives for tax avoidance or evasion.<p>

<li>The flat tax would serve as a great improvement over the current system in terms of its impact on government spending.  How so? First, Congress should not only be looking to shift to a flatter tax rate system, but should be looking to provide overall, much-needed tax reduction.  This would assist in limiting spending increases, lowering government's share of GDP, and boosting economic growth.  Second, by ending withholding, the true cost of government will become clearer to taxpayers as they actually sit down and write out a check to the federal government for their tax bill on a monthly or quarterly basis.  Demands for government to economize should drastically increase under such a reform.  Of course, the downside remains that income taxes have always fueled the growth of government, whether at the national, state or local levels -- and the flat tax is still an income tax.<p>
</ul>

Overall, a low-rate, flat income tax would serve as a boon to entrepreneurs, small business, and the economy.  In the short run, there will be a few adjustment pains for some businesses that grew out of various artificial incentives in our current, complex tax code.  But such woes would soon fade away, to be dwarfed by vastly improved incentives for investment and entrepreneurship.  In terms of expanding the pool of available capital, lowering and flattening income tax rates, and tax simplification, make no mistake about it, small business will thrive under such reforms.<p>  

	I would simply add that the lower you can push tax rates the better.  In fact, a flat tax rate of just 10 percent has a nice ring to it.<p>

	Thank you Madam Chairman and Members of the Committee.  On behalf of our small business members nationwide, we appreciate your efforts to study the important issue of tax overhaul.  Both through private conversations with small business owners and surveys, we find that government taxation -- especially federal taxes -- remains the number one concern of business owners.  The Small Business Survival Committee looks forward to working with you and the Committee as you continue to study and hold hearings on the various tax overhaul proposals.  I look forward to answering any questions you may have about my testimony.<p>

<h3>Capital Gains Taxes and the Investment Impact on Small Business</h3>

Richard W. Rahn, Ph.D.<br>
Member of the Board<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<p>
                              
Before the <br>
 Committee on Small Business<br>
 United States House of Representatives<br>
 February 22, 1995<p>
</center>
<hr>
<p>

     
     Chairman Meyers, members of the Committee, I thank the Small Business
Committee for inviting me to testify before you today on the future of small business in
America, and how the new Congress and the Administration  can begin to further unleash
investment and entrepreneurship in America to sustain long term economic growth and
opportunity.<p>

     I am Richard Rahn, and I am a board member of the Small Business Survival
Committee (SBSC), a 40,000-member nonpartisan, nonprofit, small business advocacy
organization.  I formally served as Vice President and Chief Economist for the United
States Chamber of Commerce, and currently serve as President of Novecon.<p>

     If there is anything in America that represents attainment of the American Dream,
it is owning your own business.  Unfortunately, most small business owners and
entrepreneurs cite their most daunting day-to-day obstacles of running their business as
government-imposed -- namely, taxes and regulations.  The government has become the
main deterrent to small business prosperity and entrepreneurial activity, and I am
encouraged that the 104th Congress is taking proactive steps to lift burdensome policies
and requirements which are stifling economic growth and productivity.<p>

         If enacted, a capital gains tax cut will help to relieve a formidable obstacle faced
by American business -- especially small business.   While I fully support the elimination
of the capital gains tax, the reduction and indexation as proposed in the Contract With
America would result in lower capital costs, increased capital formation, new and higher-paying
jobs, and increased investment in start-up enterprises, as well as business
expansions.<p>
  
     The United States is heavily dependent on its entrepreneurial and small business
sector for its job creating capabilities and technological and innovative breakthroughs. 
The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and entrepreneurship, punishing and
discouraging these activities.  It is clear that the U.S. tax policies toward savings and
investment must be revised if we are to retain our country's leading economic role, as
well as retain the necessary status and clout to manage and provide leadership on all
world affair issues.<p>
                                
                                
       <h3>Small Business Investment and Capital Gains Taxes<br>
            Impediment of an Entrepreneurial Economy</h3>

      Too often, risk-takers and entrepreneurs with their promising ideas face a
daunting obstacle in launching a new business -- raising capital.  Business owners with
profitable, growing companies can also hit a brick wall when seeking funding sources to
expand their operations.  The U.S. tax code in its treatment of capital gains, is a major
barrier for such small business owners or emerging entrepreneurs. <p>

     The nation's economic future depends on the success of the entrepreneurial sector. 
Small business is our nation's job-creating machine.  Investment in small business is
critical to our nation.   While SBSC fully supports eliminating the capital gains tax, the
Contract With America proposal which, combined with indexation, reduces the top
capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent, could be the most pro-growth step taken by the new
Congress.      <p>

     Unfortunately, investment spending in the United States has largely continued on a
downward path over the past 30 to 40 years.  According to a 1994 study by  the American
Council for Capital Formation Center for Policy Research, net annual business investment
in the U.S. has in recent years fallen to only half the level of the 1960s and 1970s.  Net
private domestic investment, according to the same study, averaged 7.4 percent of GDP
from 1960 to 1980.  Since 1991 it has averaged only 3.0 percent.<p>

     Lower investment spending in the U.S. renders less risk-taking and innovation,
diminished productivity, fewer job-creating opportunities and, overall, weakened
economic growth. <p>


     There is no more important economic task than investing both sweat and capital in
new ideas, innovations, and enterprises.  Yet the risky nature of such ventures scares off
bank lending officers.  Therefore, venture capital, whether raised from one's family and
friends or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding for
entrepreneurial enterprises.  Such investors must determine if they will receive a fair
return on their investment.<p>

     The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and entrepreneurship. 
Investment and entrepreneurship are the lifeblood of a vibrant economy and remain the
engines of economic growth and job creation.  The current, non-indexed federal tax rate
of 28 percent on capital gains remains a formidable obstacle to economic expansion,
especially considering the risky nature of investing, and starting and operating a business.<p>

     The potential benefits of reducing and indexing the capital gains tax are clear, and
they will largely benefit small business.  According to the American Council for Capital
Formation, venture capital investment was on the rise as the U.S. capital gains tax rate
declined up to 1986; followed by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked 40 percent in
1987, from 20 percent to 28 percent.  Since the 1986 Tax Reform Act raised the capital
gains tax rate by 40 percent, venture capital investment has nose-dived, and federal
capital gains tax revenues have consistently run well below government expectations.  (In
fact,  according to CATO Institute economist Steve Moore, 1991 revenue realizations
equaled $108 billion versus a late-1980's Congressional Budget Office prediction of $269
billion and a Joint Economic Committee prediction of $285 billion.)<p>

     Higher capital gains rates discourage  savings and investment, raising the cost of
available capital.   The effect of higher capital costs means lower levels of investment in
plant and equipment, technology and labor.  As a result, it costs more to produce goods
and services, resulting in higher consumer prices.  Already economies of scale make it
more difficult for small businesses to compete with larger competitors.  The higher cost
of capital, and its resulting inefficiencies, impacts small businesses much more harshly.<p>

     Low capital gains taxes will help lower the cost of capital.  Researchers have
found that a cut in the capital gains tax rate to a range of 15 to 20 percent would reduce
the cost of capital by 4 to 8 percent.   <p>

   <h3>  Indexation of Capital</h3>

     The nominal rate of federal taxation is 28 percent.  However, when inflation is
factored into the capital gains equation the real capital gains tax rate rises substantially. 
The willingness to invest is substantially hindered by taxing capital gains, which are
"specter" earnings spurred by inflation.  <p>

     The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment and
entrepreneurship, restraining small-business growth and job creation.  In fact, some
individuals can wind up paying taxes on real capital losses.  That is, after factoring
inflation into the equation, a nominal profit on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss,
yet the investor still pays taxes on the nominal gains.  Or put more simply, individuals
still pay a substantial capital gains tax even though, after inflation, they receive less from
their sale than they originally paid.  From a "fairness" perspective this is unfair and makes
no economic sense. <p>

     A 28 percent capital gains tax rate acts as a considerable disincentive to
investment, while real rates to even paying taxes on a real capital loss, amount to
economic suicide.  Indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains
determination -- equalizing state and real capital gains tax rates.  The lower real rate
would reduce uncertainty, and generate investment, economic growth, and job creation.
     <p>

<h3>     A Capital Gains Tax Cut and the Fairness Issue </h3>

      Opponents who dismiss lowering and/or eliminating capital gains tax rates are
employing class warfare tactics which are based on false assumptions, and make no
economic sense.   Opponents of cutting capital gains taxes contend that this will result in
a cash windfall to the nation's richest while the poor will continue to suffer.  Not only
does reducing/eliminating the capital gains tax make economic sense, but capital gains
tend to be spread across a wider income spectrum than many believe (or want to believe.)<p>

     Based on 1992 federal income tax returns, 56 percent of returns claiming capital
gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, including the capital gain.  Fully, 83 percent
of returns with capital gains were from total incomes of less than $100,000.<p>

     The precept behind the opposition to a cut in the capital gains tax, is a false belief
in the static nature of our economy and a "black and white" view of the world -- if one
individual wins, then someone else has to lose.   A cut in the capital gains tax will benefit
all investors, and all income classes alike -- rich, middle-class, and lower middle-class --
because it would improve the economy's performance and growth potential.<p>

       Hard-working individuals and entrepreneurs who save and invest their money
wisely are unfairly being punished for that activity.  When high capital gains taxes punish
investors of all income classes by gorging the value of their investments, or watering
them down through the taxation of inflated gains, the response is to consume more now
and  to save and invest less.  Government-imposed barriers to saving and investing hurts
the economy and everyone in it.  The siphoning of productive resources into the
unproductive and wasteful stream of government spending, is what can really be termed
as unfair.<p>

     Governor Lawrence  B. Lindsey, of the Federal Reserve, wrapped up the class
warfare and fairness issue quite directly in a March 20, 1990 Op-Ed in the Washington
Post entitled "Envy is No Basis for Tax Policy":<p>

     The political manipulation of envy is one reason why America has seen its
competitive position in the world economy gradually erode during much of the postwar
period.  There may have been a time when America could afford to waste its resources in
the name of envy, but that is a luxury we can no longer afford. ...The losers from the
pursuit of envy are not only today's wealthy but everyone who benefits from a strong
American economy, both today and in the future.<p>

     If the proponents of higher capital gains taxes were really interested in fairness
they would insist that all losses be deductible in the way that all gains are taxed.  It is
hypocrisy to argue that we need high capital gains taxes for fairness, and then to argue for
limitations on losses.<p>

<h3>     Targeted Capital Gains Tax Cuts</h3>

      Small business, and entrepreneurial activity in general, will benefit from an
across-the-board cut in the capital gains tax.  Targeting a capital gains tax cut to certain
industries assumes that politicians and bureaucrats in Washington can better pick winners
and losers in the marketplace rather than the competitive economy can.  Neither specific
industries, nor smaller versus larger industries, should be "targeted" for the cut.<p>

     In addition to the misguided assumption that the government can and should 
choose what industries should be given favorable tax treatment, the government is further
complicating an already mystifying and convoluted U.S. tax system.  American taxpayers
and most businesses are asking for a less-costly, less-complicated tax system -- not one
that exacerbates its current complexity.<p>

     If a "targeted" approach is enacted, capital may indeed begin to flow to certain
industries, but high capital gains taxes would continue to "lock-in" investors and keep
capital from flowing to its most productive uses.  Increasing the mobility of capital is
important to free investors to pursue all their investment opportunities, not those hand-picked by
the government.  Investment decisions should be based on their merit, not on
U.S. tax policy.<p>

     Targeting a capital gains cut also presents the problem of further politicizing the
U.S. tax code.  Industries from across America will be lobbying Congress for their own
favorable capital gains tax rate to attract investment.  <p>

     The capital gains tax cut in the Contract With America is precisely the type of cut
that the U.S. Congress should enact.     <p>

<h3>     The "Cost-Effectiveness" of the Capital Gains Tax Cut</h3>

     The Committee asked me to comment on the cost-effectiveness of the capital gains
tax cut.  This question assumes that there will be a major "cost" to the federal government
in terms of tax revenues if a capital gains tax cut is enacted -- nothing can be further from
reality.  The question should be, what is the cost to the federal government (in terms of
revenue foregone), and the economy when high capital gains taxes become U.S. tax
policy?<p>

      There is no question that changes in tax rates affect how hard and long people
work and how much they save and invest.  The official revenue-estimating arms of the
government in part ignore how tax policy changes human behavior in making these
calculations.  Indeed, at the heart of the debate in Washington right now is whether
revenue estimators should employ static versus dynamic scoring to determine how much
the Contract's tax cuts will "cost."  This argument is important because static scoring has
created a bias in favor of tax increases and against tax cuts.<p>

     All we need to do is to look at the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and their
track record in revenue estimating to show that indeed, when capital gains tax rates
increased, the CBO failed in its attempt to accurately estimate government revenues. 
When the capital gains tax rate was raised from 20 to 28 percent in 1986, the CBO
forecast that taxable capital gains would rise to $225 billion by 1989.  The actual figure
was $150 billion -- a miscalculation of about 50 percent or $75 billion.<p>

     Between 1988 and 1991, taxable capital gains fell below the 1985 level in every
single year.  By 1991 they were just half of what they were in 1985 (after adjusting for
inflation) and lower than in any year since 1978.  Incredibly, as late as 1988 the CBO was
claiming that its computer simulations showed a "net revenue increase from the 1986
ACT."<p>

     In January of 1990, the CBO again miscalculated its capital gains revenue.  They
estimated that the government would realize $269 billion for 1991.  They missed the
mark by about 150 percent, as the capital gains realization was $108 billion.<p>

     Experience demonstrates that lower capital gains taxes have a beneficial impact on
federal revenues.  If we look at recent t history, the evidence is indisputable.  During the
period of 1978 to 1985 the marginal federal tax rate on capital gains was cut from almost
50 percent to 20 percent.  Total individual capital gains tax receipts increased from $9.1
billion to $26.5 billion.  Capital gains realization swelled to $326 billion in 1986, and
have trended downward ever since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 increased rates.<p>

     In addition to the fact that the federal treasury will gain from a capital gains tax
cut, as noted earlier in my testimony, the entire economy will gain as well.  Freeing
capital to go to its most productive uses, and making capital available to new and growing
businesses far outweighs any so-called "cost" to the federal government.  Not only is
cutting the capital gains tax the most cost-effective jobs program the government can
enact, it will help the United States rapidly regain its competitive edge in the global
economy.  <p>

    <h3> How U.S. Capital Gains Tax Rates Compete Internationally</h3>

     Higher capital gains tax rates undermine our nation's competitiveness while
challenging our status as world economic leader.  The current non-indexed capital gains
tax rate is not competitive internationally.  <p>

     Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong the Netherlands all have a zero rate on long-term
capital gains.  Canada, France, Italy and Sweden have lower capital gains than the U.S.,
with Japan's rate equalling 1 percent of sales price or 20 percent of net capital gain.  Even
the two nation's with higher nominal rates than the United States  --  Australia and the
United Kingdom -- allow for capital gains to be indexed for inflation.  Hence, the U.S.
real capital gains tax rate often will exceed the rate in Australia and the U.K., depending
on U.S. inflation.<p>

     Given the critical and risky nature of investment and entrepreneurship, and the
importance of maintaining a competitive environment in a global economy, capital gains
should be excluded altogether.  A zero capital gains tax rate would ensure that
entrepreneurial risk taking, so crucial to economic growth, would not be impeded by the
U.S. federal tax code.  The fact is the capital gains tax is a double or triple tax because
the income has been taxed at least once before, and in the case of corporate stock, twice
before.  The steps taken in the Contract With America to reduce and index the capital
gains tax rate is a good start.<p>

     
<h3>     Urban and Inner-City Renewal</h3>

     Renewing our inner-cities requires a comprehensive policy approach to resolve the
decay and dysfunction so prevalent in these areas.  In addition to reforming federal tax
and welfare policies that impact inner-city residents, states and cities must also take a
very hard look at their current tax policies, regulatory structures, as well as spending
priorities and inefficiencies to determine how such polices impact job flight and an anti-business
climate.<p>

     However, a capital gains tax cut will indeed free up capital to new and emerging
businesses, many of which do start up in our nation's inner-cities.  As with many new
businesses, fledgling start-ups will be helped by greater access to capital.  Capital is
scarce for most small businesses and entrepreneurs and, as mentioned, a cut in the capital
gains tax will benefit all income classes in all areas.<p>

    <h3> Wages and Interest vs. Capital Gains</h3>

      Opponents of cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes often argue that no reason
exists for differing tax treatments between capital gains and, for example, wage or interest
income.<p>

     In fact, there is a distinct difference between wage or even interest income and
capital gains -- risk.  Capital gains come from growth and appreciation of investments,
which tend to carry greater risks than those associated with earning wages or even
interest.  In particular, investments in small, entrepreneurial ventures carry significant
risk.  As already noted, high-risk ventures must at least present the opportunity for
rewards.<p>

     Another unfairness of the capital gains tax is that the government fully taxes, but severely
limits losses.  This discourages investors from engaging in high risk investments which are often
the most productive.
     
     <h3>Conclusion on Capital Gains Taxes</h3>

     Small business is the engine of economic growth and job creation.  In order to
undertake and/or expand a small business, one needs capital.  Without adequate capital,
new ideas and businesses either never make it to the marketplace or they die a premature
death.  With such deaths go products, services and jobs.  By taking the first step in the
Contract With America, and indexing and reducing the capital gains tax rate, Congress
and the Administration would greatly strengthen incentives for investment and
entrepreneurship -- boosting economic growth and activity.       <p>

     History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy.  In fact,
during the 1980's, while tax rates declined, upper-income individuals paid a greater share
of total income taxes, as the benefits of tax shelters declined and the rewards for working,
saving and investment rose.  In this environment, from 1980 to 1989, 18 million jobs
were created.<p>

     The 1986 Tax Reform Act made positive strides by reducing personal and
corporate tax rates, but went awry by trying to "pay" for these reductions with an increase
in the capital gains tax rate.  Indeed, the economy paid a price for this capital gains tax
hike in the form of reduced venture capital investment.<p>

     The time has come to unleash entrepreneurial capitalism by first reducing and
indexing, and then eliminating the capital gains tax.<p>

     Once again I thank the Committee, and look forward to answering any questions you may
have.<p>

<h3>Savings and Investment Provisions in the Contract With America</h3>
Karen Kerrigan<br>
President<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<p>

Before the <br>
Committee on Ways and Means<br>
United States House of Representatives<br>
January 24, 1995
</center>
</p>
<hr>
<p>     
     Chairman Archer, I would like to thank the Ways and Means Committee for inviting the
Small Business Survival Committee to testify before you today on the future of small business in
America, and how the new Congress and the Administration  can begin to further unleash
investment and entrepreneurship in America to sustain long term economic growth and
opportunity.<p>

     The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) is a 40,000-member nonpartisan,
nonprofit advocacy organization fighting against the growing burden of taxation and regulation
on American small business and individuals. Members of SBSC represent a diversity of small
businesses and enterprises across America.  From home-based businesses, to traditional "mom
and pop" businesses, to small manufacturers, to 1995 entrepreneurs and others -- SBSC's
membership is as diverse as the small business sector itself.<p>

     <i>If there is anything in America that represents attainment of the American Dream, it
is owning your own business</i>.  Unfortunately, most small business owners and entrepreneurs
cite their most daunting day-to-day obstacles of running their business as government-imposed --
namely, taxes and regulations.  We hear little about traditional business-related hurdles regarding
sales, marketing, motivating employees, or topics that also require tremendous time and
resources from the owner.  Government has become the main obstacle to small business
prosperity, and not surprisingly more and more Americans do not view their government as
protector of our great free enterprise system.<p>

         Beyond the twin burdens of taxes and regulations which are slowly strangling
productive entrepreneurial activity, the United States non-indexed capital gains tax creates
another impediment for entrepreneurs wishing to start-up or expand an enterprise.  The federal
government needs to encourage, not punish, private-sector investment. <p>

<h3>Eliminating Capital Gains Taxes:
Lifeblood for an Entrepreneurial Economy</h3>

      Most entrepreneurs seeking to start up or expand an enterprise will tell you of a major
obstacle -- raising capital.  Encouragement for private-sector investment in small business needs
to be enhanced.  While SBSC fully supports eliminating the capital gains tax, the Contract With
America proposal which, combined with indexation, reduces the top capital gains tax rate to
19.8 percent, could be the most pro-growth step taken by the new Congress.      <p>

     There is no more important economic task than investing both sweat and capital in new
ideas, innovations, and enterprises.  Yet the risky nature of such ventures scares off bank lending
officers.  Therefore, venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends or from
professional investors, remains a critical source of funding for entrepreneurial enterprises.<p>

     The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and entrepreneurship.  Investment and
entrepreneurship are the lifeblood of a vibrant economy and remain the engines of economic
growth and job creation.  The current, non-indexed federal tax rate of 28 percent on capital gains
remains a formidable obstacle to economic expansion, especially considering the risky nature of
investing, and starting and operating a business.<p>

     The potential benefits of reducing and indexing the capital gains tax are clear.  Venture
capital investment was on the rise as the U.S. capital gains tax rate declined up to 1986; followed
by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked 40 percent in 1987, from 20 percent to 28 percent. 
Since the 1986 Tax Reform Act raised the capital gains tax rate by 40 percent, venture capital
investment has nose-dived, and federal capital gains tax revenues have consistently run well
below government expectations.  In fact,  according to CATO economist Steve Moore, 1991
revenue realizations (most recent available) equaled $108 billion versus a late-1980's
Congressional Budget Office prediction of $269 billion and a Joint Economic Committee
prediction of $285 billion.<p>

<h3>How the U.S. Stacks Up Internationally </h3>

 In the new global economy, it is imperative that the United States be competitive with other nation's on the capital gains front -- the U.S.needs to be a haven and magnet for capital.  The current non-indexed capital gains tax rate is not
competitive internationally.  Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong the Netherlands all have a zero rate
on long-term capital gains.  Canada, France, Italy and Sweden have lower capital gains than the
U.S., with Japan's rate equalling 1 percent of sales price or 20 percent of net capital gain.  Even
the two nation's with higher nominal rates than the United States  --  Australia and the United
Kingdom -- allow for capital gains to be indexed for inflation.  Hence, the U.S. real capital gains
tax rate often will exceed the rate in Australia and the U.K., depending on U.S. inflation.       
<p>

    <i> Given the critical and risky nature of investment and entrepreneurship, and the
importance of maintaining a competitive environment in a global economy, capital gains should
be excluded altogether.  A zero capital gains tax rate would ensure that entrepreneurial risk
taking, so crucial to economic growth, would not be impeded by the U.S. federal tax code.  The
steps taken in the Contract With America to reduce and index the capital gains tax rate is a good
start.</i><p>

   <h3>  Indexation</h3>

The nominal rate of federal taxation is 28 percent.  However, when
inflation is factored into the capital gains equation the <i>real</i> capital gains tax rate rises
substantially.<p>

     The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment and
entrepreneurship, restraining small-business growth and job creation.  In fact, some individuals
can wind up paying taxes on real capital losses.  That is, after factoring inflation into the
equation, a nominal profit on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor still
pays taxes on the nominal gains.  Real rates of capital gains taxation represent severe
impediments to keeping America's economy vibrant and growing.<p>

     Figure 1 below offers an example of how inflation can impact capital gains tax rates. 
Listed below are the real capital gains tax rates from 1977 through 1993 on three-year
investments yielding a total nominal return of 30 percent.  (It is assumed that the investment is
closed out at the end of the stated year, for example, the 1985 real capital gains tax rate to an
investment made at the beginning of 1983 and sold at the end of 1985.)<p>

     A 28 percent capital gains tax rate acts as a considerable disincentive to investment,
while real rates ranging from 40 percent to 494 percent to even paying taxes on a real capital
loss, amount to economic suicide.  Indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital
gains determination -- equalizing state and real capital gains tax rates.  The lower real rate would
reduce uncertainty, and generate investment, economic growth, and job creation.
     <p>

<h3>     Who Benefits?</h3>

  Opponents who engage in class warfare rhetoric to dismiss lowering and
eliminating capital gains tax rates are employing tactics which the American public, quite 
frankly, is sick of hearing.  "Soak-the-rich" schemes and "fair-share" arguments will continue to
backfire on those who feel they can defeat the issue on these divisive grounds.  Not only does
reducing/eliminating the capital gains tax make sense, but capital gains tend to be spread across a
wider income spectrum than many believe.  Based on 1992 federal income tax returns, 56
percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, including the
capital gain.  Fully, 83 percent of returns with capital gains were from total incomes of less than
$100,000.<p>

     <h3>Wages and Interest vs. Capital Gains </h3>

In addition to false assumptions about the identification of capital gains just with the wealthy, opponents of cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes often argue that no reason exists for differing tax treatments between capital gains
and, for example, wage or interest income.<p>

     In fact, there is a distinct difference between wage or even interest income and capital
gains -- risk.  Capital gains come from growth and appreciation of investments, which tend to
carry greater risks than those associated with earning wages or even interest.  In particular,
investments in small, entrepreneurial ventures carry significant risk.  As already noted, high-risk
ventures must at least present the opportunity for rewards.<p>

     <h3>Conclusion on Capital Gains</h3>

 Small business is the engine of economic growth and
job creation.  In order to undertake and/or expand a small business, one needs capital.  Without
adequate capital, new ideas and businesses either never make it to the marketplace or they die a
premature death.  With such deaths go products, services and jobs.  By taking the first step in the
Contract With America, and indexing and reducing the capital gains tax rate, Congress and the
Administration would greatly strengthen incentives for investment and entrepreneurship --
boosting economic growth and activity.       <p>

     History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy.  In fact,
during the 1980's, while tax rates declined, upper-income individuals paid a greater share of total
income taxes, as the benefits of tax shelters declined and the rewards for working, saving and
investment rose.  In this environment, from 1980 to 1989, 18 million jobs were created.<p>

     The 1986 Tax Reform Act made positive strides by reducing personal and corporate tax
rates, but went awry by trying to "pay" for these reductions with an increase in the capital gains
tax rate.  Indeed, the economy paid a price for this capital gains tax hike in the form of reduced
venture capital investment.<p>

     The time has come to unleash entrepreneurial capitalism by first reducing and indexing,
and then eliminating the capital gains tax.<p>

 <h3>   Entrepreneurial Incentives in the Contract With America</h3>

      As noted extensively in addressing the importance of reducing, eliminating and indexing
the capital gains tax, individuals respond to tax and savings incentives having a profound impact
on robust and sustained economic growth.  Policy makers need also to look a the changing
nature of the economy.  Home-based businesses, for example, are booming.  Clarifying the
deduction for home-offices recognizes our changing work force while reducing questions
regarding who qualifies and who does not.<p>

     Increasing the estate tax exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 helps small businesses
pass on a family-owned enterprise to the next generation -- the U.S. tax code should not penalize
families for wanting to keep a business in the family.<p>

     The small business expensing provision in the Contract encourages investment by
allowing small businesses to deduct the first $25,000 in equipment and inventory.  All of the
above are good steps to help "prime the pump" for small business growth.<p>

     The U.S. tax code needs to encourage savings in America -- increased savings provides
more capital for investment in small businesses and the future of America.  The American Dream
Savings Account provision in the Contract  permits individuals to contribute up to $2,000 into a
special savings account.  Promoting savings in America will strengthen our country's economic
base and encourage savings.<p>

     Small business, and the entrepreneurial spirit that drives America, continues to be a
constant in our economy -- past, present and future.  The U.S. government, whose job it is to
protect and preserve America's free enterprise system, has unfortunately become a foe of the
private sector.  Reforming the tax system so businesses and individuals make decisions on
economic merit rather than tax law is an essential component of free enterprise.<p>

     The Small Business Survival Committee salutes the 104th Congress and the Ways and
Means Committee for its leadership in not only determining how the government can further
encourage savings and investment, but also for beginning to look at America's tax system in its
entirety and how the government can efficiently and fairly collect taxes from its citizens without
eroding individual freedom, or America's free enterprise system.<p>

<h3>
Time to Overhaul Labor Laws and the NLRB<BR>
</h3>
<P>
<b>
by Raymond J. Keating
<br>
Chief Economist
<br>
Small Business Survival Committee
</b>
<hr>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
Since its creation in the midst of the Great Depression and the
New Deal, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has been a
source of great controversy.  Depending upon which political party
controlled the White House, therefore controlling the appointment
of the NLRB's five board members, accusations would fly regarding
the NLRB leaning too far in favor of either the rights of workers
or management.  <BR>
<P>
Unfortunately, the controversy created by the NLRB perpetuates
the outmoded notion that business managers/employers and their
employees must always be in conflict.  Under its current modus
operandi, the NLRB hurts both workers and businesses &#173;&#173;
and therefore, the economy in general.<BR>
<P>
The Unfair Labor Practices Controversy.  The NLRB was established
under the National Labor Relations Act (the Wagner Act) of 1935.
 The Board is empowered to conduct and certify elections to determine
if employees desire to be represented by a union, and to prevent
unfair labor practices by both employers and unions or their agents.
 <BR>
<P>
While the Wagner Act and other pieces of federal labor legislation
over the years are usually portrayed as benefitting employees,
in a very real sense, such legislation takes away the individual's
right to contract.  In congressional testimony on February 7,
1996, Richard L. Trumka, Secretary&#173;Treasurer of the AFL&#173;CIO,
asked: &quot;Are we still committed to the right of working men
and women to associate freely?&quot;  Unfortunately, the answer
to this question is &quot;no,&quot; and has been &quot;no&quot;
for decades.  Labor laws &#173;&#173; supported by Mr. Trumka
and his union &#173;&#173; require individuals to join unions
and/or pay union dues, who otherwise would not choose to do so.
 The interests of labor's leaders win out over the interests of
non&#173;union workers and individuals who have no interest in
joining a union.<BR>
<P>
More prominent controversies arise related to the NLRB function
of preventing unfair labor practices.  As James Bovard puts it
in his book Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty:
&quot;In reality, an 'unfair labor practice' is whatever displeases
a majority of the five political appointees to the National Labor
Relations Board.&quot;  Not surprisingly, a body carrying the
title the &quot;National Labor Relations Board&quot; carries an
inherent bias in favor of labor unions.  A cursory examination
of NLRB decisions reveals just such a bias:<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> Earlier this year, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed an NLRB decision which created, according to the Court,
the &quot;imprimatur of industrial anarchy.&quot;  In the Earle
Industries case, the NLRB sanctioned an employer who had disciplined
an employee for escorting a trespasser, activist Jesse Jackson,
through the plant during a union organizing campaign.  The Court
ruled that the employee's interest in unionizing could not override
the employer's interest in protecting its property.1  <BR>
<P>
<li> Again in Lost Rights, James Bovard notes stark differences
in how the NLRB treats employer and union actions: &quot;NLRB
officials have a very expansive concept of coercion when it comes
to management behavior; companies have been found guilty of 'unfair
labor practices' for merely criticizing unions or for offering
raises to their workers before the workers vote on whether to
join a union. ...  Yet the NLRB ruled in July 1993 that a Teamsters
union local affiliate's filing of a $20 million class&#173;action
lawsuit against an employer just before an election was not objectionable
conduct or an unfair labor practice.&quot;  In addition, Bovard
outlines various cases of union violence and the lack of response
by the NLRB.  Bovard concludes:<BR>
</ul>
<P>
&quot;Picketing routinely degenerates into a simple economic blockade
&#173;&#173; an effort to cutoff entrances and exits of the picketed
site.  Thus, it is surprising that the NLRB finds excuses or pretexts
to discount the reality of picket&#173;line violence.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Indeed in certain ways, the NLRB has become a means for perpetuating
union violence and threats.  For example, as reported in SBS Foundation's
Labor Watch (Issue 8), the NLRB apparently forgot the violence
associated with the 1985 strike against the Chicago Tribune stirred
by the hiring of replacement workers.  The strike came to a close
in 1986, and by May 1989, the process of reinstating striking
workers was well under way.  The Pressman's union has since been
seeking the names and addresses of replacement workers still employed
at the Tribune.  The NLRB ordered the Tribune to hand over the
information.  Fortunately, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit ensured employee protections and refused to enforce the
NLRB order.  Violence against replacement workers during the strike
included tire slashing, death threats, as well as the stabbing
of a delivery driver.<BR>
<P>
The Clinton NLRB.  President Clinton's NLRB has exhibited overt
favoritism toward the labor union agenda.  Indeed, the NLRB now
has crossed the line from a largely judicial body into the realm
of public&#173;policy advocacy and politics.<BR>
<P>
For example, NLRB Chairman William B. Gould IV has publicly declared
his support for banning the employer's right to hire striker replacements.
 Gould also has denounced the TEAM Act, which would allow employers
and employees to form committees to work together on workplace
issues &#173;&#173; a simple act of teamwork and cooperation that
the NLRB deems in many cases as illegal under the Wagner Act.
<BR>
<P>
Also, the NLRB has proposed implementing a single&#173;site rule,
which carries huge potential benefits for labor unions.  The rule
presumes that a single facility of an employer is the appropriate
bargaining unit under most circumstances.  This makes union organizing
efforts far easier for smaller entities such as restaurant franchises.
 <BR>
<P>
Other recent pro&#173;union NLRB decisions include:
<P>
<ul>
<li> In Manganaro, the NLRB legalized anti&#173;dual shop clauses
which could allow unions to shut down non&#173;union subsidiaries
or impose union membership on non&#173;union workers without a
secret vote.<BR>
<P>
<li> In California Saw, the NLRB virtually neutered employee
Beck rights by letting the unions themselves to decide what are
and are not union political expenses.<BR>
<P>
<li> In Elliott Turbomachinery, the Board gutted property and
ownership rights by ignoring contract language granting an employer
exclusive discretion in relocating its facilities.<BR>
<P>
<li> In Shepard Convention Services, the Board ruled against
its own regulations and ordered a mail ballot election, and then
certified a union even though it was endorsed by only 9 percent
of eligible voters.  This decision was reversed upon appeal, however.
</ul>
<BR>
<P>
In addition, President Clinton made clear the political nature
of the NLRB.  Late last year, the President formally nominated
Senate staffer Sarah M. Fox (Sen. Ted Kennedy's chief labor counsel
on the Labor and Human Resources Committee) to the Board.  Ms.
Fox's pro&#173;union credentials are quite formidable.  She has
been a union lawyer and a key strategist for pro&#173;labor union
legislation.  Knowing this appointment was in grave danger, the
President added Ms. Fox to the Board through a recess appointment
in January.<BR>
<P>
The President reportedly now seeks two Republican appointees to
bring the Board to full complement.  Though, the strong union
ties of the three current Democrat members are no way in doubt.
<BR>
<P>
Reform Measures.  Labor law and the NLRB are in desperate need
of reform in order to protect the rights of individual workers
and business owners.  Ideally, the federal government should extract
itself from involvement in labor issues altogether.  However,
chances of repealing federal labor laws and leaving matters to
the states are currently quite remote, to say the least.  Therefore,
the following principles should lie at the center of labor reform
efforts:<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> No individual's right to contract should be subjugated
to other individuals' desires for union representation.  A National
Right to Work law stating that no one should be required to join
a union, nor be forced to pay dues to a union, needs to be passed.
<BR>
<P>
<li> Severe consequences should result from union violence.
 Some argue that the pro&#173;union labor laws of the early half
of this century were implemented in response to employer violence
against union organizers.  In the second half of the twentieth
century, union violence against non&#173;union workers and employers
calls for clear and severe penalties against unions and their
members who participate in and promote violence.  Clearly, the
NLRB should not establish acceptable levels of violence permitted
on picket lines before action is taken (as the Board currently
does).  No degree of violence is acceptable.  The law should be
unequivocal, including decertification of unions involved and
jail time.<BR>
<P>
<li> The NLRB has been reluctant to put an end to union &quot;salting&quot;
campaigns, whereby union organizers apply for jobs at non&#173;union
sites with the intent of either bringing discrimination charges
against the employer to the NLRB, disrupting the workplace, or
running up employer costs.  Such individuals do not seek legitimate
employment, but instead seek to organize and inflict economic
damage.  Clear laws against salting are needed.  <BR>
</ul>
<P>
Put an End to Activist Regulators.  The NLRB is an example of
judicial activism taken to the extreme.  Politically appointed
&quot;judges&quot; have a documented history of making decisions
based on their own views of the world, rather than according to
laws.  The NLRB also exemplifies the general problem with Congress
and the White House delegating powers to regulators and rule&#173;making
bodies.  Indeed, the time has come for our elected officials to
take direct responsibility for the federal regulatory apparatus,
including the NLRB.  The powers of regulators should be clear
and limited, and all rules, regulations, and fines approved by
Congress and the President.<BR>
<P>
In the end, as for the NLRB, its blatantly political and activist
decisions call into question its very existence.  If the federal
government is to remain intertwined in labor issues, then oversight
of elections and initial prevention of unfair labor practices
are reasonable duties that can be carried out with some degree
of objectivity.  However, Congress should give serious consideration
to allowing disputes arising from this process to go directly
to federal courts and eliminating the NLRB's judicial role altogether.

<h3>Costs of Another FDA War:Economic Fallout from Reduced Advertising and Promotional Expenditures</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>
Under the generalship of Commissioner David Kessler, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declared war on a host of businesses and industries.  Recent FDA battles include raids on vitamin clinics and orange juice producers, a pseudo-science attack on silicone breast implants, and a bureaucratic assault on the nation's health and economic vitality through long delays in drug and medical device approvals.1  By outflanking its original mission, now the FDA adds an attack on the tobacco industry to this seemingly ever-growing list.  A question remains: Is this a "just" regulatory war?<p>Considering that tobacco products always have been legally produced and sold in this country and that individual freedom and choice is rightfully cherished in a land of liberty, clearly makes this new FDA regulatory war just as unjust as the battles listed above.  Simply because a handful of elected officials and federal government bureaucrats do not like certain products does not give them the right to rage a regulatory jihad in response.<p>In addition, any just war theory calls for no direct attacks on or injuries or fatalities to non-combatants.  Hence, during wartime, attacks on civilian targets usually generate moral outrage.  In regulatory wars, noncombatants of the economic type always suffer.  The FDA's move against tobacco will have a real and significant impact on noncombatants -- lending even greater weight to the charge of the FDA waging an unjust regulatory war.  Numerous among these noncombatants will be a host of small businesses, including convenience and grocery stores, advertising companies, a variety of manufacturers, print shops -- the list goes on and on.  <p>FDA's Proposed Tobacco Regulations.  According to the Federal Register, the FDA proposed tobacco regulations include prohibiting cigarette vending machines, free samples, mail-order sales, and self-service displays; limiting advertising and labeling "which children and adolescents are exposed to" to black-and-white, text-only formats; no advertis
ing within 1,000 feet of a school or playground; banning the sale or distribution of branded non-tobacco items such as hats and t-shirts; and restrict sponsorship of events to the corporate name only, not the tobacco product brand name.  Also, the proposed regulations would federalize 18 years as the legal age for purchasing tobacco products and require that manufacturers fund anti-smoking educational campaigns.  <p>Specifically, the FDA's stated goal is to cut youth smoking by half within seven years, and if not achieved, then taking unspecified, additional steps.  Of course, the impact of these measures would reach well beyond any youth market and raises worrisome questions about the FDA's long-term goals relating to the tobacco industry.  After all, an August 1995 report by the FDA declared "that nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products is a drug, and that these products are drug delivery devices within the meaning of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."  If true, the criminalization of tobacco products production and distribution must be a real possibility.  One has to wonder: Is the FDA seeking prohibition with all its commensurate woes?<p>For the short term, though, this FDA effort is essentially based on the highly questionable notion that advertising has a significant impact on youth decisions to smoke -- much more so than the more likely influences of peer pressure and family life.  The FDA also assumes that the federal government should, and can, direct the personal tastes and habits of Americans.  As in other cases where the nanny state runs amok, real and significant economic costs are incurred.<p>
<b>FDA Faulty Estimates</b>  According to an economic analysis performed for the Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation by the American Economics Group, Inc.2,  the FDA's projections of potential job losses due to these regulatory proposals are grossly underestimated.  The FDA asserts that approximately 1,000 jobs annually would be lost in the tobacco warehouse, manufacturer, grower, and wholesaler sectors for about 10 years.  While a ten-year total of 10,000 jobs lost is nothing to gloss over, the American Economics Group report notes that this amounts falls far short of the actual numbers: "Incredibly, the FDA does not include a job loss estimate for the sectors that would be most vulnerable to its regulations -- the advertising, manufacturing and retail industries."<p>Substantive Cost Estimates.  The American Economics Group study for SBS Foundation examined the sales, employment, and wage impact of promotional and advertising expenditures by tobacco firms and found the following:<p>
<ul>
<li> Based on 1993 numbers, direct spending on advertising and promotion by tobacco companies employs an estimated 78,836 workers in the United States, and by the time you factor in the additional activity generated by these individuals, "the cycle of buying, all begun by tobacco advertising and promotion, continues until ... 209,112 persons are employed as a result."<p><li> Direct advertising and promotion purchases by tobacco firms amounted to more than $6.1 billion in 1993, with total generated purchases topping $17.9 billion.  Direct wages and salaries amounted to more than $1.9 billion, and "subsequent activity" generated more than $3.2 billion for a total of over $5.2 billion in wages and salaries in 1993.<p>
<li> Direct advertising and 
promotion expenditures by tobacco firms fall into 11 major industry categories -- food products and tobacco, apparel, printing and publishing, rubber and leather products, instruments and related products, miscellaneous manufacturing industries, transportation, wholesale trade, retail trade, business services, and miscellaneous services.  Subsequent derived expenditures impact 37 different industry groups.<p>
<li> The proposed FDA tobacco 
regulations place much of these advertising and promotional expenditures at risk, and therefore, the businesses -- many small, entrepreneurial firms -- tied into such activity as well.  <p>
<li> In terms of lost jobs, the report concludes that about 45,000 full and part time direct jobs and at least 65,000 derived jobs could be lost over a three to five year period.  This job loss estimate is 11 times the FDA's estimate.  And it should be remembered that these American Economics Group estimates only count jobs related to a decline in advertising and promotional expenditures by tobacco firms due to the proposed regulations, and not additional job losses due to any kind of decline in the purchase of tobacco products.  <p>
</ul><b>Excess Regulation Hurts the Economy</b><p>
  If a federal government agency is going to declare war on any industry with increased oversight and regulation, then a full accounting of the potential damage should be undertaken.  Increased federal regulation is not a costless endeavor.  Regulations have the same impact as taxes -- raising the costs of investing, risk taking, and generally "doing business."  These costs translate into less investing and entrepreneurship, lower profitability, increased chances of business failure (especially for smaller firms operating on a razor's edge), and less employment.  Therefore, federal agencies like the FDA have a responsibility to realistically examine the costs and benefits of their regulatory initiatives.
  <p>Unfortunately, when 
undertaking a regulatory jihad, FDA officials fail to even concern themselves with proper jurisdiction -- tobacco regulation has never fallen within the FDA's regulatory domain -- never mind real costs.  Orange juice producers, vitamin clinics, medical device firms, drug companies, and now tobacco-related businesses -- more and more industries are being sucked into the FDA's unjust regulatory wars.

<h3>Costs of Another FDA War:Attack on Vending Machines, An Attack on Jobs and Small Business</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

In the <a href="/sbsc/rw-fdaw1.html">first installment</a> in this three-part series, it was noted that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) proposed tobacco regulations could cost the economy -- at minimum -- an estimated 110,000 jobs over a three to five year period.1  This far outpaces the FDA's own estimate of 10,000 jobs over ten years.  The FDA failed to account for the full cost of its proposed legislation.
<P>One industry hit particularly hard by the proposed regulations is vending services.  Under the proposed FDA tobacco regulations, the sale of cigarettes through vending machines would be completely banned.  
<P>In a recent Wall Street Journal article ("If Cigarette Industry Coughs, Remote Areas Expect to Catch Cold," October 26, 1995), Mark Stomel, the owner of a vending machine company, noted who would be hurt by such a ban: "The man that fills the vending machines, the mechanic that fixes them, the people who do the maintenance of the vehicles. ... It spreads like wildfire."  He also reported that 25 percent of Stomel Vending Co.'s sales would be wiped out.
<P>The National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA) reports that cigarettes and tobacco sales represent 7.1 percent of sales by automatic merchandise machine operators, and a ban on these sales would mean thousands of lost jobs.
<P>The FDA claims that it has undertaken this regulatory assault on tobacco in order to cut youth smoking in half in seven years.  The FDA assumes that an end to cigarette distribution through vending machines will greatly assist this effort.  However, NAMA's numbers tell a different story.  <P>
<ul>
<LI> Cigarette purchasing habits of individuals ages 13 through 17:<P>				Convenience stores		43%				Gas stations			29%				Grocery stores			11%				Vending machines		  9%				Drug stores			  6%<P>

<LI> Location of vending 
machines:<P>		Locales rarely frequented by minors		77.5%			Bars, cocktail lounges		31%			Industrial plants		27%			Offices				12%			Hotels/Motels			  4%			Universities/Colleges		  3.5%		
Other Locales					22.5%			Restaurants			13%			Terminals, Rec - Bowling Centers, misc.	  9.5%			   <P>These numbers raise serious questions regarding the FDA's efforts.  Meanwhile, such a highly questionable undertaking presents real risks to an industry completely dominated by small businesses.  Vending Times reports that 26 percent of vending service providers are one-person (or family-only) establishments; 15 percent have only one part-time employee; another 28 percent claim 1-3 full-time employees; and 10 percent have 3.5-5 full-time employees.  In total, an incredible 90 percent of all vending firms employ less than 20 employees.  The survival of many of these firms is placed in jeopardy due to the proposed ban of cigarette sales through vending machines by the FDA.  </ul>
<P>While the FDA should not be involved in tobacco regulation at all, the aforementioned numbers addressing the purchasing habits of young smokers and the location of vending machines, show that little, if anything, would be gained on the youth smoking front by banning vending machines and throwing small businesses into turmoil.  The job of stopping youth smoking -- a goal worth supporting -- falls to parents, not federal government bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.  Governmental social engineering always fails -- and at great cost to the taxpayer, business, and the economy.<P><hr><P><center><b>End Notes</b></center><P>

<h3>FDA Facts: Exporting Entrepreneurship</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has become the model of a plodding, costly, and even deadly government bureaucracy.  The agency remains infamous for its ability to throw monkey wrenches into the machinations of some of the most dynamic industries of the late twentieth century, such as medical devices and pharmaceuticals.  Indeed, the FDA is slowing medical progress, hampering entrepreneurial enterprises, and destroying jobs due to regulatory obstacles and bureaucratic gridlock.	The FDA seems more intent on exporting American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, rather than encouraging the production of U.S.-made drugs and medical devices.	
<p>
FDA Responsibilities.  The FDA carries a long list of responsibilities, summarized as: regulating drug, food, cosmetics, biological product, and medical device labeling; approving new drugs, biological products, and medical devices; setting drug, biological product and medical device manufacturing guidelines; and establishing safety and effectiveness standards for drugs, biological products, and medical devices.	
<p>
To implement this ambitious agenda, the FDA staff totaled 9,217 in 1994, up from 1,678 in 1960 -- an increase of 449 percent.1  In 1994, the FDA's gross budget authority equaled $935.7 million.2	
<p>
<b>FDA vs. Entrepreneurs</b>
<p>
  As is the case with most regulatory agencies, the FDA seemed like a good idea at first, but it has grown into a massive, misguided undertaking.  The FDA has placed enormous burdens on the food, pharmaceutical, and medical device industries -- discouraging investment and risk taking in some of America's leading industries.	Examples of the havoc being wrought by the FDA abound:<p>
<ul>
<li> In the August/September 1995 issue of Reason magazine, Rick Henderson reported that "the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health takes more than three times longer to approve a Class III or 'substantial risk' medical device (such life-saving products as heart valves or CAT scanners) than do the agency's counterparts in Europe."  The impact of such delays?  "In the past 10 months, reports a survey published in June by the Health Industry Manufacturers Association, 50 percent of the more than 500 device makers surveyed had moved some clinical trials of new medical devices overseas; 56 percent refused to test new devices on Medicare patients; and 75 percent planned to move their trials to Europe."	
<p>
Henderson also noted, "The average time it takes a drug company to develop and gain approval of a new drug has almost doubled over the past 30 years -- from 8.1 years in the 1960s to 14.5 years today.  And, reports the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ... more than 60 percent of new drugs and biologics (genetically engineered pharmaceuticals) approved here in the 1990s were first approved in another country."<p>

<li> Thomas G. Donlan noted industry trends driven by the FDA's regulatory maze in the July 3, 1995 issue of Barron's: "The failure of U.S. regulation can ... be seen in the scrambles that have roiled the industry to put research and manufacturing offshore, to make partnerships with foreign drug firms and to merge and merge and merge again in an attempt to create firms that are large enough to weather all the risks of regulation."	Of course, market-driven mergers in an industry are by no means worrisome.  However, substantial industry changes being driven by regulatory costs should cause regulators and their supposed overseers -- i.e., elected officials -- to re-evaluate their regulatory activities.<p>

<li> Robert Higgs, in a report for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, noted the hurdles companies face even when making improvements in already existing products or in their manufacturing processes: "Changes in the product or the manufacturing process, no matter how small, might cause the product to be consigned to an indefinite stay in preapproval purgatory.  FDA failed to differentiate between new devices and manufacturing changes for existing devices.  Manufacturers therefore had a reduced incentive to make the minor improvements that, cumulating over time, could greatly improve the performance of their products and the efficiency of their manufacturing operations."<p>

<li> Higgs also reported that FDA policies and conduct have boosted costs for medical device firms considerably -- perhaps adding $10 million to $20 million to a firm's budget, as well as several additional years before a new device gets to the market.  Such costs greatly reduce venture capital investment in new and expanding enterprises making medical devices.  One can only speculate as to the total number of potentially life-saving innovations and inventions that fail to reach consumers because regulatory costs reduce potential returns to such an extent that capital simply dries up.	In addition, Higgs noted that from 1989 to 1991, U.S. medical technology firms invested roughly the same amount abroad annually -- $321 million-$333 million.  "Then in 1992, when FDA abruptly made its enforcement and approval policies more onerous, capital outflow jumped more than 200 percent to $993 million."<p>

<li> One also has to wonder whether large firms feel the FDA's battering as severely as smaller and start-up enterprises.  Rick Henderson asserts in Reason that large, established pharmaceutical companies have benefited from the FDA's regulatory maze.  New, smaller firms lack the resources, expertise, and patience to surf the FDA's regulatory tidal wave.  Hence, entrepreneurs wipe out -- the system results in fewer competitors for established firms.<p>

<li> A 1993 report from the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee acknowledged the woes tied to the FDA's approval process for medical devices: "The situation is intolerable.  The backlog for pending device applications exceeds 1,100. ... The FDA's enforcement practices have demoralized and perplexed much of the medical device industry."3  <p>

<li> In testimony before the House Joint Economic Committee Hearing on Technical Innovations in Health Care on June 24, 1994, Robert C. DeHaven of the American Electronics Association declared that the FDA's "inordinately slow" regulatory process was threatening "the global competitiveness" of the medical device industry -- a $70 billion industry with more than 11,000 companies.<p>

<li> A recent American Electronics Association survey reportedly found that 40 percent of medical device firms reduced their number of U.S. employees because of FDA delays, 29 percent boosted investment in foreign operations, and 22 percent moved U.S. jobs out of the country.4  <p>

<li> FDA approval times have mounted.  For example, in 1988, it took an average of 78 days for the FDA to approve a product change (i.e., a 510-K application); by 1992, approval time had grown to an average of 126 days.5  This number further ballooned to 173 to 213 days by 1994.6   These applications are supposed to be approved within 90 days, according to FDA guidelines.  		Approvals of new devices take anywhere from 437 to 840 days.7  New device approvals, however, are supposed to be completed within 180 days.	Meanwhile, the median approval time for generic drug applications stretched out from 12 months to 38 months between 1986 and 1993.8  Of course, all of these numbers exclude FDA requirements placed on firms that extend development time.<p>

<li> The chief executive of the Minnesota-based Minntech Corp., Louis Cosentino, best summed up the effect of the FDA on entrepreneurs and the U.S. economy: "The attitude of the FDA is so antibusiness and so negative at this point that any prudent CEO has to be looking outside the U.S. as a safe haven."  Minntech laid off 50 Minnesota employees while expanding in Europe.9  <p>	

Meanwhile, the so-called benefits for consumers from all these added delays and costs remain difficult to detect.  In fact, bureaucratic delays by the FDA apparently cost tens of thousands of lives annually, as products and treatments are being denied to American consumers.	Export Restrictions.  Adding insult to injury, the FDA erects barriers to the export of U.S. medical products as well.  Even if a product has been approved for use in a foreign country, the FDA generally does not allow for exportation to that nation if the product has not received FDA approval.  Again, in the case of medical devices, a lengthy FDA approval process is needed in order to export.10  	

The CEO of a medical device company was denied permission to export by the FDA -- so he moved the company from the U.S. to Switzerland.  The CEO observed: "The FDA denied us permission to export. ... So we had to export our manufacturing plant."11  	
</ul>
<P>
<b>Entrepreneurs in the Regulatory Process?</b>
<P>
  One can at least be somewhat encouraged by the fact that the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives recognizes the many woes of the FDA.  In fact, Speaker Newt Gingrich went so far as to refer to the FDA as a "Stalinistic" agency and the "leading job killer" in the nation.12  Under the FDA's yoke, entrepreneurs and businesses possess every incentive to cease research and development, shift operations and jobs out of the country, or close down operations altogether.	
<p>
Congress needs to take bold steps.  Reports about FDA incompetence, abrasiveness, gridlock, intrusions, and costs are so numerous that they lead one to believe that more than mere reform is required.  Former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan pointed in the right direction when he wrote in the June 27, 1995 Washington Times: "Instead of making yet another effort to reform a system that seems incapable of reform, we should begin thinking about the design of a new system.  In my view, such a system would require considerable decentralization, perhaps along the lines of the European systems, where non-government institutions play a much greater role in the process of reviewing and approving new medical products."	
<p>
According to economist James Bovard writing in the December 8, 1994 
Wall Street Journal: "Rep. Gingrich favors replacing the FDA with an agency staffed with medical entrepreneurs, with strict limits on their time in government."  While one has to wonder why entrepreneurs would be willing to staff a government agency, the sentiment is correct.  In addition, this addresses a nagging question regarding the FDA: Can regulators ever be qualified enough to register sound judgments regarding such dynamic industries as biomedical companies?  Tapping medical entrepreneurs is a good idea, but would be better achieved by allowing private firms to undertake FDA safety approvals.  Meanwhile, efficacy should be left to the marketplace.	
<p>
>b>Global Competition</b>
<P>
  The FDA is taking a heavy toll on the U.S. economy in terms of lost entrepreneurship, investment, jobs, and international competitiveness.  In a world where both capital and labor can move with increasing ease and freedom, the U.S. regulatory regime is operating within an increasingly competitive global environment.  An agency that delays the approvals of beneficial drugs and medical devices to the degree that the FDA does ensures that U.S.-based firms operate at a severe disadvantage.  Of course, not only does this mean less investment, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs, but it also means that U.S. consumers often are denied access to life-saving  devices and treatments.  	
<p>
Competition can do wonders.  The U.S. regulatory regime acts as a severe drag on our economy.  Congress must act to make the U.S. food and drug regulatory environment more competitive on the world stage, or continue to lose cutting-edge firms and high-paying jobs to other nations.

<h3>FDA Facts: Strong-Arming American Business</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee<p></b></center><hr>
<p>		
In the previous Small Business Reg Watch 1995, "FDA Facts: Exporting Entrepreneurship," the Small Business Survival Committee examined many of the costs and delays that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) imposes on firms in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries.  As a result, enterprises have either cut back on research and development, moved operations out of the country, or simply closed their doors.	However, the FDA does not stop at mere incompetence and bureaucratic gridlock.  In the 1990s, under the guidance of FDA Commissioner David Kessler, the FDA's enforcement efforts have become increasingly aggressive and intrusive.  One might say that the FDA has been strong-arming U.S. businesses.	FDA Intrusions.  Reports abound of the FDA's move to more aggressive and confrontational methods under Dr. Kessler's reign.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> In the May 1995 issue of Reason magazine, analyst Alexander Volokh reported: "Since 1990, when David Kessler took over as FDA commissioner, enforcement has been one of the FDA's top priorities.  In his first two months, Kessler added 100 new criminal investigators to his enforcement staff, many of them formerly with the Secret Service and Drug Enforcement Administration.  Armed raids on alternative health clinics and dietary supplement dealers followed, as well as increased warning letters, product seizures, and criminal prosecutions in the drug and device industries."<p>

<li> In the January 1995 issue of The American Spectator ("Double-Crossing to Safety"), James Bovard reported on the FDA's raid on Proctor & Gamble's "Citrus Hill Fresh Choice" orange juice.  The FDA disputed the use of the word "fresh" on the label, saying it was misleading.  Proctor & Gamble noted a survey showing that consumers knew that "Fresh Choice" did not mean fresh squeezed, and besides, "Made from Concentrate" was also on the label.  Bovard reports: "Kessler ... took sweeping action: He ordered U.S. marshalls to seize the juice -- 12,000 gallons, as it turned out -- and destroy it.  Federal law declares that a 'misbranded' or 'mislabeled' product is automatically unsafe, and provides FDA with the authority to confiscate the merchandise."<p>	

Naturally, the orange juice was perfectly safe, not to mention healthy.  Dr. Kessler action was meant to send a message to American businesses that the FDA was calling the shots.<p>

<li> Bovard noted another, similar raid.  This time it wasn't orange juice, but vitamins the FDA was after: "On May 6, 1992, a platoon of sixteen FDA inspectors and local police in flak jackets carried out a no-knock raid, smashing in the door of the Tahoma Clinic in Kent, Washington.  They held the staff at gunpoint, ostensibly so that nobody could try to hide the vitamins.  The raiders seized more than $100,000 in products and office supplies -- including address books and diaries -- and spent 14 hours cleaning out the office; they even tore the phones out of the wall.  FDA agents were supposedly concerned about the clinic's use of injected B-vitamins, which have been widely used in Germany with no adverse health problems."<p>

<li> Commissioner Kessler was appointed by President George Bush.  Refusing to resign from his post under a directive given to all presidential appointees during a normal transition to a new administration, Kessler worked hard to ingratiate himself with the president-to-be with a list of aggressive regulatory actions.  On December 8, 1992, during the White House transition, Kessler offered his view of the FDA in remarks before the Food and Drug Law Institute's 36th Annual Educational Conference.  His emphasis on re-regulation and more aggressive enforcement was clear, as noted by the following excerpts:<p>"We needed to send out a message that, ultimately, it was in no one's interest to deregulate a public health regulatory agency."<p>"We're paying more attention to our field these days.  We've become once again an FDA that vigorously enforces the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and not just an agency that approves products and educates consumers and the industry."<P>"Our enforcement people have fewer hoops to jump through, fewer boxes that must be checked off."<p>"We rely much less on voluntary agreements and much more on court-enforceable consent decrees."<p>"To complement the regular FDA field force we've created an Office of Criminal Investigations, not to be confused with the new Office of Investigations.  Thirty new special agents began intense training last week at a federal law enforcement training 	center in Georgia."<p>"In just over a year we've cleared the deck of uncompleted and abandoned regulatory proposals; we're getting new regulations out faster than ever before ..."<p>	Commissioner Kessler, of course,  kept his job.<p>

<li> This time writing in The Wall Street Journal (December 8, 1994), James Bovard observed another FDA tactic: "FDA employees are also sowing fear with a deluge of official Warning Letters (up more than 300% since Dr. Kessler took office).  Once the FDA issues a Warning Letter, it can seize a company's products or get a court injunction to paralyze its operations.  The FDA has refused to establish clear guidelines or rules for issuing its letters.  As a result, manufacturers can find themselves in a nightmare at the whim of a mid-level FDA employee."<p>

<li> In a letter to The American Spectator (April 1995), Dennis Plank, Editor-Publisher of the FDA Hotline, writes on how well federal regulatory agencies work together when it comes to regulatory crack downs: "A frightening current trend is how successful the FDA has become in pushing the buttons at other federal agencies to attack vitamin, supplement, and herbal manufacturers and suppliers.  We have reported on stepped-up enforcement actions by OSHA, FTC, Customs, Postal Service, and the DEA.  The Federal Trade Commission has now become the FDA's bully boy with no less than twenty cases pending against vitamin and natural product manufacturers."<p>

<li> One of the FDA's most aggressive moves just occurred.  It did not involve a physical raid on a company's facilities.  Instead, it amounts to the beginnings of a power raid on an entire American industry.  According to published reports, on Wednesday, July 12, 1995, the FDA declared nicotine to be a drug, linking this conclusion to concern over tobacco products being sold to minors.  	

<p>Of course, it is currently illegal to sell tobacco products to minors.  In reality, the FDA's declaration of nicotine as a drug lays the ground work for extensive control over the manufacturing and distribution of tobacco products by the FDA.  	Most recognize that smoking is bad for your health, as are so many other undertakings.  Tobacco, like other things, is a legally grown, packaged, and sold product in the United States.  What happens now that the FDA is calling nicotine a drug?  Are tobacco farmers and convenience store owners to become outlaws, part of organized crime, or perhaps pharmacists?  Are the FDA's enforcement tactics, as described above, to be extended to tobacco farms and convenience stores?  What about smokers?  The effect of the FDA calling nicotine a drug goes well beyond concern over youth smoking -- it is an issue of extending the control of the nanny state.	

<p>Indeed, why stop at nicotine?  What about other habit forming substances?  I'm overweight and enjoy drinking caffeine-laden beverages.  Will the FDA soon classify cheeseburgers, caffeine, and sugar as drugs -- how about hot dogs?<p>	

As government agencies often do, the FDA has proven to be both hypocritical and incompetent.  If Dr. Kessler and the FDA truly cared about the public's health, they would improve the efficiency of their medical device and drug approval processes.  Unfortunately, Dr. Kessler's reign seems more about control.<p>	
</ul><P>

<b>A Return to Safety Approvals and Education</b>
<P>
  The list of FDA abuses continues.  The time has come to rein in what has become largely a personal crusade. Much to the chagrin of FDA Commissioner Kessler, the FDA indeed should be "just an agency that approves products and educates consumers and the industry."  In the regulatory environment, anything more seems to breed hostility, often insurmountable costs, over-zealousness, arrogance, and massive intrusions on the part of regulators -- such as seizures of orange juice and armed raids on vitamin clinics.  The FDA's philosophy should not be one of making an example of a company in order to send a signal to other firms.  Instead, it should be one of cooperation with some of America's most dynamic and crucial industries.  	

<p>In light of potential litigation costs, lost profits, and the possibility of going out of business, firms in the medical device, food, and drug industries possess every incentive to produce safe products.  As usual, the market offers its own system of checks and balances.	

<p>Entrepreneurs in the medical device, pharmaceutical, and food industries are meeting the most essential human needs -- food and medical care.  The costs and risks of improving upon and/or creating new products in such areas remain substantial.  Unfortunately, the FDA has managed to significantly add to these costs -- not only through delays and additional regulatory requirements, but through unpredictable, intrusive actions, as touched upon in this paper.    Entrepreneurs are not the enemy; they are the driving force behind society's great leaps in technology, new products and services -- not the FDA.  	

<p>Former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan was correct when he recently observed in The Washington Times (June 27, 1995) that the FDA "seems incapable of reform."  The FDA needs to be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education, with  a food, medical device, and pharmaceutical safety approval process largely contracted out to private-sector firms.<hr>

<h3>FDA Facts: Spending More to Get Less</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

Delays in  medical device and drug approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have become infamous.  As noted in the <a href="rw-fda1.html">first installment</a> in this short series, for example, new device approvals now take anywhere from 437 days to 840 days, and approvals for mere changes in existing products take an average of 173 days to 213 days.  These periods compare with the required approval times of 180 days and 90 days, respectively.  Median time for approving new drugs tops three years -- 38 months in 1993 vs. 12 months in 1986 -- with the average time stretching out even farther.  Meanwhile, the total time to develop and gain FDA approval of a new drug has risen from an average of 8.1 years in the 1960s to 14.5 years today.	When confronted with such a dismal and costly performance record, FDA defenders will say that the agency is in need of more resources.  A quick look at FDA budget and employment levels tells quite a different story.	FDA Budget.  Figure 1 provides a glimpse at the FDA's budget authority for select years since 1955 in inflation-adjusted 1994 dollars.  To say the least, budget growth at the FDA has been robust.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> Just from 1989 to 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 
52.6 percent -- or by an average annual real rate of more than 10.5 percent.
<P>
<li> Between 1970 and 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 221.1 percent.
<P>
<li> And between 1955 and 1994, the FDA's real budget authority rose by 2,978 percent.  Though the FDA's powers were enhanced considerably in the early 1960s, an average annual boost in real FDA budget dollars since 1955 of more than 76 percent cannot be justified.<p>

Figure 2 illustrates the growth in employment at the FDA.  Again, a shortage of manpower does not seem to plague the agency.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> Between 1989 and 1994, FDA full-time employees grew by a substantial 25.3 percent.
<P>
<li> Between 1970 and 1994, FDA full-time employees increased by 115.7 percent.
<P>
<li> And between 1955 and 1994, full-time employees at the FDA increased by 933.4 percent.	
</ul><P>

<b>Incentives Problem</b>
<P>
 Considering the great leaps in real budget authority and employment at the FDA, it would seem quite a stretch of the imagination to believe that the FDA lacks sufficient resources.  Instead, what the FDA lacks are proper incentives -- as is the case with most government undertakings.  Costs and performance in government -- unlike the private sector -- take a back seat to concerns over expanding power, budgets, and employment.   Also, given the fact that the FDA suffers when an approved product fails, but garners little attention for the woes brought on by its own delays, the agency's incentives to prolong its approval process remain clear.   Taxpayers and consumers are spending more to get less from the FDA.  FDA delays, added costs, export restrictions, narrow-minded regulations, bigger budgets, and overly aggressive regulators are costing the United States in terms of lost businesses, jobs, and even lives.  Real reform means reduced costs and improved performance.  Such an outcome can only materialize if private-sector involvement in the safety of U.S. food, drugs, and medical devices is enhanced.<p><hr><P>

CALL TO ACTION: California's Proposition 65<p>
</b>
November 18, 1996<p>
Issue No. 23<BR>
<hr>
<P>
California's Proposition 65- State Initiatives with National Implications
<br>
</center>
<P>
An unresolved matter between federal OSHA and the
state of California is causing compliance uncertainity for a number
of chemical, paint and coating industries and is <U>certain to
impact any and all businesses that manufacture or distribute products
in California</U>. 
<P>
In 1986, California passed the Safe Drinking Water
and Toxic Enforcement Act (Proposition 65).  Prop 65  prohibits
businesses from knowingly and intentionally exposing individuals
to chemicals that cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without
posting clear and reasonable warnings.  Enforceable  by the California
Attorney General and private citizens groups, Prop 65 subjects
violators to a civil penalty of up to $2,500 a day.  
<P>
Under OSH Act, state specific standards must be federally
approved if they are to be applied to products used or distributed
in interstate commerce. OSH Act also requires that the state standards
not unduly burden interstate commerce.
<P>
The amendment- 
filed in January 1992-
to the California State OSH Plan to implement Prop 65 is pending
at the federal OSH Administration.  Yet, in spite of the fact
that OSHA has not acted on the California amendment, California
has allowed private citizen groups to file Prop 65 enforcement
actions.
<P>
Prop 65 places the burden of proving compliance on
the business. And now businesses that believed they were in compliance
with the federal and state requirements have become the victims
of citizen groups
lawsuits.  Suits have been filed against manufacturers of nail
polish, lead crystal, batteries, faucets, and spray paint.  
<P>
It's important to note that none of these lawsuits have been brought
by, or on the behalf of, industry employees. Because of litigation
costs, several of these suits were settled when companies either
agreed to abstain from selling their products in California, or
reformulate their product, or eliminate the Prop 65 listed substance
from the manufacturing process.
<P>
The large number of products and substances which
might require a Prop 65 warning substantially impacts manufacturers
and distributors of any products containing listed substances
sold in California.
<P>
In April 1995, a group of chemical manufacturers
filed a complaint with OSHA about California state administration
of the amendment.  Just recently (September 1996), the Department
of Labor just recently issued a request for comment on the California
State Standard on Hazard Communication incorporating Prop. 65.

<P>
Many issues including labeling requirements of products,
updating material safety data sheets, violiating the OSH Act and
fighting off "bounty
hunters"
need to be resolved.   <BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Standard 62R<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Standard 62, adopted in 38 states and many local
building codes, sets ventilation requirements for office buildings,
commerical and institutional facilities, and residences.  
<P>
The revised version - Standard 62R - released by
the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning
Engineers (ASHRAE) is likely to impair the market for many products
manufactured by small companies and  increase operation and maintenance
costs.  
<P>
Standard 62R is likely to:
<P><ul>
<li>force products to be redesigned to satisfy new requirements
of indoor air quality.
<P>
<li>impose substantial paperwork burdens related to maintenance
of warehouses and offices.
<P>
<li>require small businesses to install  automatic heating,
ventilating and air conditioning controls.
<P>
<li>impair the market for manufactured products (carpet,
paint, upholstery.
<P>
<li>require emissions from manufactured products to satisfy
health-based standards.
<P>
<li>require small businesses to install and maintain
5 separate building ventiliation systems.
<P></ul>
<B>ASHRAE released the revised standard for public
comment; comments are due December 12, 1996.</b>

"With high taxes and a burdensome tax system impeding the
growth and survival of small businesses, taxes will be a priority
for each and every small business person who votes on November
5," said Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President
Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan made her remarks on Capitol Hill  at a press conference
supporting the <I><B>Taxpayer Protection Pledge</B></I> -- an
effort sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), a 60,000 member
national taxpayer organization.
<P>
"In 1992 Bill Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut, instead
middle-class small business owners got hit with the biggest tax
increase in history.  President Clinton made a campaign promise
to cut taxes, instead he raised them.  The <I><B>Pledge</B></I>
separates the true friend of the taxpayer from the big tax-and-spenders,"
said Kerrigan.
<P>
There are 2 versions of the <I>Taxpayer Protection Pledge</I>:
state and federal.  Signers of the state pledge promise to oppose
and vote against <U>any and all</U> efforts to increase taxes
while federal pledge signers promise to oppose increases in marginal
income tax rates and reductions or elimination of deductions and
credit.
<P>
 To date, GOP Presidential candidate Bob Dole, Libertarian Presidential
candidate Harry Browne, 210 U.S. House of Representatives, 35
U.S. Senators, and over 700 candidates or incumbents for state
legislators have signed the pledge.  
<P>
To find out if your congressional candidate has signed the pledge,
contact SBSC at 800-223-7526 or visit the ATR home page at <B>www.atr.org</B>.

<P>
First, a quick thank you for those of you who weighed in to help
us defeat the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), and the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA).  As you know, both would have placed
new regulatory burdens on business.<BR>
<P>
<B>CWC</B> -- In the end, the Senate did not have enough votes
to pass the CWC so supporters decided to pull it from consideration
for ratification.  What this means is that our CWC victory is
temporary.  The bad news is that the CWC will probably rear its
ugly head next year.<BR>
<P>
<B>ENDA</B> -- The same can be said for ENDA.  While ENDA was
defeated in the Senate by only one vote, the legislation will
continue to come before the Congress as long as Ted Kennedy remains
a member of the United States Senate.  Stay tuned and prepared.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Immigration </B>-- Legislation to curb illegal immigration
will be voted on soon.  We remain strongly opposed to the voluntary
employee verification program due to the burden it will place
on employers and employees alike.  The &quot;voluntary&quot; system
will most definitely become mandatory in the future.  SBSC believes
that the new system is flawed in that it will be riddled with
errors thus delaying the hiring process.  Please call SBSC to
receive more information so you can contact your member of Congress
with your concerns.

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>SBSC applauded the Congress for its passage
of health insurance reforms to help small business including the
phasing-in of deductibility to 80%, and passing Medical Savings
Accounts.  In addition, regulators are now more accountable to
small businesses because Congress put teeth into Regulatory Flexibility.
 Regulators must also publish their rules and regulations in &quot;Plain

CALL TO ACTION: Chemical Weapons Treaty Nears Scheduled Vote
</b>
<P>
 September  6, 1996<p>
 Issue No. 20<BR>
<hr>
<P>
 The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)<BR>
</center>
<P>
The United States' Senate has scheduled a  ratification vote of
the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) before September 14, 1996.
 
<P>
Ratification of the CWC - a treaty to supposedly end the production
and stockpiling of chemical weapons - would risk the United States'
national security,  expose U.S. private industry to international
industrial espionage, and cost U.S. private firms billions in
regulatory costs associated with treaty compliance.
<P>
The treaty risks United States' national security because rogue
nations like Iraq, Syria, Libya, and North Korea have not signed
the treaty and thus are not bound by the CWC's provisions.  For
other countries such as Russia and China who are signatories,
their ratification of CWC is uncertain.
<P>
Secondly, treaty compliance would be difficult to ascertain. 
Former Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey, stated before
the Foreign Relations Committee in June 1994 that &quot;The chemical
weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective
that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability
to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale.&quot;  
<P>
<U>The CWC is a nonverifiable, nonenforceable treaty.</U>  The
United States would set a dangerous precedence ratifying the CWC
given that the treaty's provisions would strip the United States
of its ability to protect itself,  while allowing nations  hostile
to U.S. forces the ability to continue their production of chemical
weapons unabated.  
<P>
 In order to detect the production of chemical weapons, the treaty
institutes <U>a time-consuming verification program that is applicable
to a wide range of U.S. companies, that use certain chemicals
in the manufacturing process including - pharmaceutical companies,
textile mills,  paint manufacturers, food processing companies,
breweries, and distilleries.  </U>  The verification system  assigns
regulated chemicals  to &quot;schedules&quot; based upon what
is believed to be their relative usefulness for chemical weapons
production.  Each schedule has reporting requirements which include
copious amount of paperworks for each chemical and inspection
liabilities for the producing and consuming firms.  The U.S. Department
of Commerce estimates that filling out the paperwork will take
anywhere from 2.5 - 9 hours for <B>each</B> chemical depending
on its schedule classification.  
<P>
Instead of committing precious hours to operating a profitable
firm, business owners - many of whom are small business owners
- would be required to spend countless hours filling out paperwork
to prove that a chemical regulated by the treaty is used for their
legitimate business purposes.   
<P>
The CWC would be the first treaty in U.S. history to subject U.S.
industry to international authority.  
<P>
There would be 2 kinds of inspection: routine and challenge. 
Routine inspections would be directed at sites producing chemicals
that are perceived to present the greatest risk of diversion to
weapons use.  A firm could be subject to up to 20 routine inspections
per year.    Challenge inspections would be conducted when requested
and can take place within a 12 hour notification period.  There
is no limit on the number of challenge inspections a firm can
be subjected to.  
<P>
Inspectors would be permitted to interview site personnel, inspect
records, photograph on-site apparatus, take samples, record equipment
readings and use instruments to monitor processes.  <U>The company
 would be expected to comply completely with the inspectors' demands.
 The company is  also responsible for bearing the full cost of
the inspection - including  meals and lodging of the inspectors,
as part of the &quot;cost of doing business&quot; in chemicals.
 The Defense Department estimates that U.S. private industry would
pay anywhere from $10,000 to $500,000 for &quot;hosting&quot;
each inspection.  </U>
<P>
The figures given are just an estimate, but the cost to business
could be substantial given the costs associated with the loss
of confidential, proprietary information.  Furthermore, distinct
possibilities exist that due process rights could be violated
in relation to warrantless searches and personnel being compelled
to answer questions, and provide information and access.  
<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan asserted, &quot;By all accounts,
the treaty is flawed, and we strongly urge the U.S. Senate to
take a sober look at the CWC.  We believe an honest assessment
of the treaty will reveal that the costs to U.S. businesses, the
loss of our economic freedom, and the compromising of rights protected
by the United States Constitution do not justify ratification
- especially since the treaty will threaten United States' national
security.&quot; 
<P>
<B>Please call or write your Senators immediately and urge them
to oppose ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  </B>A
sample letter follows:  <BR>
<P>
<I>Dear Senator:<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I urge you to oppose ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention
(CWC) when it is considered by the Senate in September.</I>
<P>
<I>Chemical weapons can be inexpensively and secretly manufactured
and no treaty is going to change that fact.</I>
<P>
<I>What this treaty will do is make it significantly harder for
thousands of Americans to operate their businesses.  Small businesses
- unable to afford the thousands of dollars involved in new paperwork
- will be especially hard hit by the CWC's regulatory and administrative
requirements. The loss of trade secrets will add countless loses
to business operations.  Our economy will suffer irreparable harm.</I>
<P>
<I>Please vote to spare American businesses this unjustifiable
burden by defeating the Chemical Weapons Convention</I>.

1994 saw a record number of entrepreneurs and successful small
business people elected to Congress.  
<P>
 With 32 of 86 Congressional freshman former (or current) small
business owners heralding the economic advantages of small business
growth, the 104th Congress shifted from an anti-business to a
pro-entrepreneur agenda.   See Congress Becoming More Friendly
to Small Business.
<P>
Small-business Congress members have helped lawmakers focus on
fiscal and tax policies that aid small businesses in creating
new job opportunities for Americans.   
<P>
According to a 1995 March U.S. News &amp; World Report, there
are now 191 representatives who used to work in business-related
occupations, compared with 170 who worked in law.  
<P>
 This week <I>Small Business Hill Alert </I>highlights a speech
by small business woman, Sue Wittig, a candidate for New York's
 26th congressional district.   Ms. Wittig's speech typifies SBSC's

<CENTER><B>Time to Overhaul the NLRB <BR>

<P>
The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation released a new <I><B>Small
Business Reg Watch</B></I>  documenting the bias of the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and its interpretation of labor law.
 The report also outlines reform measures to move  labor law and
the NLRB into the 21st century.
<P>
According to the study entitled &quot;Time to Overhaul Labor Law
and the NLRB,&quot; the NLRB has taken judicial activism to the
extreme - blatant political NLRB decisions have been consistently
reversed by the courts who hear such cases.  In addition, current
NLRB Chairman William Gould has publicly stated his support or
opposition to various pieces of legislation before Congress -
an act that is unprecedented for what is supposed to be an impartial
arbritor of labor law.

<CENTER><B>Congress Becoming More Friendly to Small Business<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The 104th Congress has improved markedly over the previous Congress
in terms of its votes on legislation to help small business and
enhance entrepreneurship. 
<P>
 &quot;Especially during its first term, the 104th Congress was
enthusiastically pro-entrepreneur.  Tax and regulatory relief
legislation, combined with proposals to cut the size and scope
of government all comprise the small business agenda,&quot; said
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan continued, &quot;The change in Congress marked a tremendous
shift in the direction of the small business agenda on Capitol
Hill.  Rather than small business being on the defensive, we were
able to consistently support legislation being considered on the
floor of both Houses.&quot;
<P>
 However, while Congress passed an unprecedented level of legislation
supported by small businesses and entrepreneurs, these measures
were largely vetoed by President Clinton.
<P>
&quot;Unfortunately, the bulk of legislation aimed towards the
growth and survival of small business was rejected by the President,&quot;
Kerrigan noted.
<P>
At the time of the release of SBSC's <I>Ratings of the 104th Congress</I>,
Congress was preparing to send the minimum wage hike amendment
to the President's desk for approval. 
<P>
The ratings were completed prior to the wage hike vote.  Its consideration
would have proven damaging for many members ratings.
<P>

<B> The Dole Economic Plan and the Entrepreneur</b>
<p>
August 19, 1996<p>
Issue No. 18<BR>
<hr>
<P>
<B> The Dole Economic Plan and the Entrepreneur<BR>
</B>
</center>
<P>
With the announcement of the Dole economic plan, tax cuts are
back on the front burner of the nation's public policy debate.
 And though one can find all sorts of opinions on whether this
is a good or bad thing, from the perspective of small business,
entrepreneurship, and economic growth, the major proposals put
forth in the Dole plan make for sound economic policy.<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> <U>Cutting the capital gains tax.</U>  The Dole plan calls
for a 50 percent cut in the top capital gains tax rate on individuals
from 28 percent to 14 percent.  <BR>
</ul>
<P>
Barring a complete tax overhaul, there is no tax cut that will
do more to spur entrepreneurship, investment,economic growth,
and job creation than a sharp reduction in the capital gains tax
rate.  The great hurdle to starting up and/or expanding a business
remains access to capital.  Investing and entrepreneurship are
high&#173;risk endeavors.  High risks require the opportunity
for substantial returns.  Slash the capital gains tax in half
and you enhance the potential returns from risk&#173;taking.<BR>
<P>
A 50 percent reduction in the capital gains tax rate would provide
a major boost to small business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.
<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> <U>Across&#173;the&#173;board cut in personal income taxes.</U>
 A 15 percent across&#173;the&#173;board cut in personal income
tax rates works favorably for small business and the economy in
three key ways:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
1) Boosts incentives for individuals to work, save, invest, and
take risks.  Again, this is a straightforward relative price argument
&#173;&#173;as the old saying goes, the less you tax something,
the more of it you get.<BR>
<P>
2) Resources are shifted from the unproductive sphere of government
to the productive private sector.  Or another way to put it, individuals
operating in the private marketplace spend and invest their money
far more efficiently and wisely than do government bureaucrats.
<BR>
<P>
3) Since about 79 percent of all business tax returns are either
sole proprietorships or partnerships (the other 21 percent being
corporations), then an across&#173;the&#173;board personal income
tax cut directly impacts the bottom line of millions of U.S. businesses.
 Lower taxes mean more funds available for capital investment,
additional employees, et al. <BR>
</ul>
<P>
<li> <U>Additional measures.</U>  The Dole plan calls for other
tax cuts and reforms impacting small businesses and entrepreneurs,
including: <BR>
<ul>
<P>
&#173;<I>Unrestricted tax&#173;free medical savings accounts (MSAs)
and 100 percent deductibility for health insurance for the self&#173;employed.</I>
 MSAs inject choice and accountability into the health&#173;care
system, and 100 percent deductibility places all businesses on
an equal plain in terms of the tax treatment of health care expenses.
<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Estate tax reductions</I>.  The estate tax amount to
nothing more than a government hostile takeover of family businesses.
 All cuts in the estate tax are welcome, hopefully on the path
to complete repeal of the estate tax.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Repeal of the 1993 tax increase on Social Security beneficiaries.</I>
 Again, this will boost incentives to work and keep resources
in the private sector.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Expanded IRAs and institution of spousal IRAs</I>.  Such
measures will boost incentives to save and expand loanable funds
available to business.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Regulatory reform.</I>  Requiring peer&#173;reviewed,
science&#173;based risk assessment and cost benefit analysis for
new regulations, regulatory review of all new regulations every
four years, and a task force to review and recommend sunsetting
ineffective and costly regulations, all point toward gaining some
much&#173;needed control over a federal regulatory apparatus strangling
businesses, investment, and entrepreneurship.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Legal reform.</I>  Measures such as limiting punitive
damages in most cases, abolishing joint and several liability
for non&#173;economic damages in civil cases, and curbing contingency
fee abuses, all amount to a good start at alleviating many of
the burdensome costs of our legal system that damage or destroy
countless businesses and the jobs they create.<BR>
</ul>
</ul>
<P>
U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs need tax cuts, regulatory relief,
and legal reform.  The cost of government is massive, inhibiting
new business formation, economic growth, and job creation.  Once
fully implemented, the proposals in the Dole economic plan would:
<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> Increase incentives for working, saving, investing, and
entrepreneurship.<BR>
<P>
<li> Boost rates of economic growth and job creation.<BR>
<P>
<li> Help both equity and bond markets, as incentives for investment
are enhanced and faster economic growth eases inflation threats
(assuming sound monetary policy).  After all, inflation results
from too much money chasing too few goods &#173;&#173;faster growth
means more goods and services.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
<B>The bottom line is: Tax cuts help small businesses and entrepreneurs.
<BR>

<h3>An Action Alert to Advance the Small Business Agenda on Capitol Hill</h3><p>
<i>July  29, 1996 <p>
Issue No. 17</i><p></center><p>
<i><center> Call to Action : Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),  Institute for Justice Study Participation</i></center>

<hr>
 <center><h2>Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)</center></h2><p>

<u><b>On or before, September 14</u></b>, the Senate will consider ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), a treaty that is supposed to ban the stockpiling and production of chemical weapons.   <p>
Grave  concerns about  the treaty's effectiveness, and its cost  to  national security and business have been raised by defense and policy experts.  <p>
<b>One of the biggest concerns regarding ratification of the CWC is the threat to national security.</b>  Few countries possessing chemical weapons are likely to cease buildup of their chemical weapons program because of the treaty.  In fact, six of fourteen countries suspected by the U.S. of possessing chemical weapons have not signed the treaty.  <p>
Rogue nations like Libya, North Korea, Iraq, and Syria continue production of chemical weapons unabated while China and Russia  - countries with the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world - provide inconsistent and contradictory data on their chemical weapons program.  <p>
CWC poses a threat to national security because noncompliance can not be easily detected.  Since the CWC allows ample time for inspected facilities to conceal their activities,  noncompliance  would be impossible to detect.   Former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), James Woolsey, testified that the CIA lacks high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale.  Noncompliance is therefore unverifiable.  <p>
Signing and ratifying a treaty which is unverifiable sets a dangerous precedent for future arms control agreements and threatens the United States national security.  <p>
<u><b>Another major concern regarding CWC ratification is the direct and indirect cost to U.S. industry.</u></b>   Under the treaty, U.S. private industry would be subject to foreign inspection, thus exposing American businesses to the real threat of international industrial espionage.  Long-held trade secrets and other proprietary information could be compromised in a matter of seconds.  International inspectors  located in the Hague, Netherlands would be responsible for carrying out inspections of U.S. companies.<p>
In addition, American firms - such as distilleries,  breweries, and insecticide, pharmaceutical, ceramic, nylon, paint, textile, soap, detergent, and electronic manufacturers  -  which produce or use a scheduled chemical  would be required to fill out additional paperwork under a new four-tiered process.  (The additional regulatory burden is estimated to take administrators 9 hours for every Schedule 1 chemical, 7.2 hours for every Schedule 2 chemical, 5.3 hours for each Organic Chemical and 2.5 hours for every Schedule 3 chemicals.) <p>
It is estimated that roughly 8,000 businesses currently do not have compliance mechanisms in place.  These businesses and smaller businesses will be hardest hit by the increased regulatory burdens treaty ratification will bring.  (Past studies have shown that the per employee cost of federal regulations is 50% higher for firms with fewer than 500 employees.)  Right now it is estimated that the cost of hosting an inspection is $10,000.  If the inspection is challenged, the cost could be $200,000 - $500,000.   
The CWC is riddled with problems that should concern all Americans.  It will be voted on by mid-September.  Please call or write your United States Senators immediately and tell them not to ratify the CWC in its current form. A sample letter follows:<p>

<i>The Honorable ______<br>
United States Senate<br>
Washington, D.C.  20510<p>

Dear Senator _______:<p>

I am writing to express my serious concerns with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The CWC, in its current form, will seriously damage United States national security and impose a massive, new regulatory burden upon thousands of U.S. businesses.<p>
The CWC will do nothing to reduce the chemical weapon arsenals of terrorist countries and other nations hostile to the United States.  In fact several countries of most concern to the United States have not signed or ratified the treaty.  <p>
I am also concerned with the treaty because it  is unverifiable. Former Central Intelligence Agency Director, James Woolsey, testified that noncompliance of the treaty will be virtually impossible to detect.  
And finally, ratification of the treaty will create another bureaucracy costing U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars and imposing costly regulatory burdens on thousands of U.S. companies.<p>
I urge you to preserve our national security and protect U.S. businesses by voting against ratification of the CWC.<p>

For more information on the CWC, please call SBSC at 800-223-7526.<p>

 The Institute for Justice, a nationally acclaimed public interest law firm, is currently analyzing six cities across the U.S. for  government-created barriers to entrepreneurial opportunities.  The study focuses on the following areas: transportation; hairbraiding and cosmetology; newsstands; daycare; recycling and street vending (pushcarts, foot peddlers, truck peddlers).   Institute for Justice staff will be in Baltimore,  Detroit, Charlotte, Boston, San Diego, and San Antonio looking for small business owners  who would like to  participate.  If you would like to take part in the study, please contact Nina Shokraii, Director of Outreach at the Institute for Justice.  Ms. Shokraii's number is 202-955-1300.

<b>Davis Bacon Update<p></b>

Recently, the Coalition to Repeal Davis-
Bacon met privately with Oklahoma 
Department of Labor Commissioner, Brenda 
Renau.  At issue were cases of fraud and 
abuse that she and her team of investigators 
have discovered.  Because of the U.S. 
Department of Labor's unwillingness to 
cooperate in reform, it is likely that more 
cases of abuse are entrenched throughout the 
U.S.  The Congressional Budget Office 
estimates that $7.3 billion in government 
funds could be save in just five years 
without the act which establishes "prevailing 
wages"that employers must pay, usually at 
much higher-than-market prices.  Call 
Representative William F. Clinger, Jr., chair 
     of the House Oversight Committee at     
202-225-5074 to voice your concern.<p>

<b>Starting Wage Hike<p></b>

As you now, both the House and Senate 
recently voted to mandate an increase in the 
starting wage by $.90.  The Senate measure 
is strikingly similar to its House counterpart 
but includes a number of tax breaks for 
small businesses, among them: an increase 
in the spending limit of small businesses 
under Section 179 from $17,500 to $25,000; 
a simplified pension plan for small business 
employers; and deductible contributions to 
individual retirement accounts by non-
working spouses.  Since the bill is not in its 
final stage however, Sen Kennedy and 
others anti-business congressmen are still 
threats.  An amendment offered by Sen. 
Kennedy that would have shortened the 
duration of the subminimum wage ($4.25) 
from 90 days to 30 days failed.  Call your 
Senator or Representative to express your 
strong desire that the small business tax 
credits stay in the bill despite any last 
minute deals by Sen. Kennedy and the like.  
We must remain vigilant if we are to prevail. <p>

<b><a href="http://politicsusa.com/cvc">CAFE Standards</a></b><p>

The CAFE standards will prove to be a hot topic 
on the Hill later this summer.  If President 
Clinton has his way and the standards are 
increased, small business owners could see a 
dramatic increase in the cost of doing business.  
Please write or call President Clinton to express 
your support for the current CAFE standards.  
The following is a sample letter to serve you as 
a guide.<p>

Sample Letter to the White House<br>
Small Business Owner<p>
Sample #1<p>

President William J. Clinton<br>
The White House<br>
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW<br>
Washington, D.C.  20500<p>

Dear President Clinton:<p>

In the last election, voters sent a message to 
Washington:  "Cut excessive Government 
regulation."  As a small business owner, I can 
tell you how important that is.<p>

Several recent news articles blamed the owners 
of light trucks for recent gas price increases.  
They also suggested the answer was increased 
governmental regulation of motor vehicle fuel 
economy.  I disagree.<p>

Higher gas mileage standards would hurt small 
business owners in two ways.  First, the price of 
the larger pickups and vans like we use would 
probably go up to encourage sales of smaller 
vehicles.  Or the manufacturers would have to 
reduce the size and weight of those vehicles-- 
which means I'd have to buy an even bigger, 
more expensive vehicle than I need to support 
my business.<p>

President Clinton, don't let that happen.  We 
need less regulation, not more.  Say that you 
will leave vehicle fuel economy standards right 
where they are.<p>

Sincerely,<p>
<p><br>

<CENTER><B> Reconciliation of Immigration Bills by Mid-June <BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
 All businesses <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> including
small businesses <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> face additional
regulations through the proposed adoption of the employment verification
measure.  It passed in both the House and Senate versions of the
immigration proposals. San Diego employers currently using a toll-free
verification system similar to House measure report that the system
can take up to &quot;three calls, several minutes, and sometimes
several days to verify a Social Security number...&quot;  At this
point, the verification system will be voluntary, but SBSC believes
it will eventually become mandatory.
<P>
SBSC's position:  The verification system does not recognize the
administrative and regulatory burdens associated with operating
a business.  Illegal immigrants who show remarkable deftness at
skirting U.S. laws will continue to do so even under the system.
 Hence, the law-abiding employer using the proposed system (and
American citizens) will be the only persons &quot;caught&quot;
by this intrusive system.
<P>
       <B> Time still exists to make your voices heard</B>.  Call
your Representatives and Senators, tell them to say no to additional
regulations  -- &quot;voluntary&quot; or not.<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Starting Wage Proposal in the Senate <BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Senate will soon offer their version of the starting wage
bill.  It is expected to closely parallel the House proposal and
increase the starting wage by $0.90 by 1997.  The following provisions
have been added: (1) tipped employees would have the federal cash
wage frozen at $2.13 per hour, instead of 50 percent of the current
federal starting wage and (2) new hires would be paid an &quot;opportunity
wage&quot; during their first 90 calendar days of employment.
 
<P>
It is probable that Senator Kennedy will offer an amendment to
strip these provisions - thereby attempting to force a straight
starting wage bill with the $0.90 increase.  
<P>
<B>Small business owners still have time to weigh-in with the
Senators.   </B>Let them know that you oppose any increase in
the starting wage, but if an increase is unavoidable, then include
the small-business provisions passed by the House.  <U>Most importantly,
tell your Senators not to support any amendment that strips the
tip credit or the opportunity wage language.<BR>

<B>The Budget That Won't Go Away, Tax System Overhaul Gets Another Boost</B></center>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Backed Into a Corner?</b>
<P>
If the budget negotiations were to be decided by who has 
compromised more, the Republicans would be victorious.  
The GOP Congress has compromised $68.5 billion more 
than President Clinton since the beginning of budget talks, 
as the chart below outlines.  (Budget figures are the most 
recent offers of 1/9/96 in billions of dollars.)
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<PRE>
	GOP Compromise		Clinton Compromise

Medicare	+ $58		- $27

Medicaid	+ $48		- $22

Welfare		+$3.5		- $3

EITC		+ $12		- $3

Tax Cuts	- $51		+ $20

Discretionary	+ $60		- $89
---------------------------------------------------<P>
$232.5 toward the Pres.		$164 toward Congress
</pre>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Republicans have compromised more than the  
President in every disputed area with the exception of 
discretionary spending.  The President's latest tax cut 
proposal, which does not provide for a cut in capital gains 
taxes, shows that he has moved less than half than the GOP 
in the area of tax reduction.
<P>
Recent reports suggest that a capital gains tax cut is likely to 
be included in a budget deal.  The Clinton Administration 
may formally propose a 7.5% cut in the cap gains rate for 
individuals with a 17.5% cut for Americans in the lowest tax 
bracket.  Separately, Congressional Democrats have 
continued to rail against a cap gains tax cut, and Vice 
President Gore reportedly has said that opposition to cuts in 
cap gains taxes was "a theological issue" for Democrats.
<P>
Language within the first continuing resolution (CR) to fund 
parts of the government allowed for "protecting our 
priorities" -- which may well mean increased spending 
levels for those politically sensitive areas the President does 
not want to cut.  That vague language has come back to 
haunt the GOP and other proponents of meaningful spending 
and tax reduction.  And, it appears that the compromises by 
the GOP have gone unnoticed.  Republican leaders have 
suspended the budget negotiations, denying them airtime to 
advance their position on the negotiations.  Pres. Clinton 
will use the State of the Union address on January 23 to try 
to bolster his.  Republicans may attempt to move forward by 
enlisting the help of conservative and moderate Democrats, 
though some GOP leaders (including Newt Gingrich) doubt 
that a budget agreement can be reached this year.
<P>
<b>Kemp Commission Points the Way to Tax Reform</b>
<P>
Citing the current tax code's "oppressiveness," "complexity," 
and "intrusiveness," the National Commission on Economic 
Growth and Tax Reform - chaired by former Congressman 
and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp - recommended scrapping 
the entire code.  The Commission advocated a new 
beginning for the American tax code, and laid out a set of 
principles to advance strong economic growth, small 
business expansion, and job creation.  House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-
KS) voiced support for the findings of the Commission.
<P>
Despite a lack of specificity in its final report, the 
Commission has established a strong, meaningful start for 
tax reform.  The Commission called for a flat, fair tax rate 
that embraces simplicity and stability.  The 
recommendations pointed toward abolishment of capital 
gains taxes, full deductibility of the federal payroll tax, an 
end to double taxation, a two-thirds majority to raise the flat 
rate, and expensing of investment outlays.
<P>
The crux of the Commission's report is that the tax code 
should be submissive to the public, particularly small 
business owners.  An unruly IRS is no longer tolerable.  
There is little doubt that the findings of the Commission 
fulfill promises of tax system overhaul, and SBSC supports 
the general guiding principles of the Commission.  As noted 
in an SBSC press statement, however, the report: "is not 
long on details.  Now comes the heavy lifting of making 
detailed, principled tax overhaul a reality."
<P>
Although the Commission recommended including a 
generous personal exemption in tax reform proposals, critics 
attacked the report's embracing of a fair flat tax rate as a 
giveaway to the rich (surprise, surprise).
<p>
The Commission's report is expected to have an  impact on 
current tax reform proposals in Congress.  One leading 
Republican, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer 
(R-TX), was critical of the Kemp Commission's findings.  
Archer supports a tax based solely on consumption and felt 
the report said nothing new.

<B>Budget Politics, the Numbers Game, and Minimum Wage Follies</B>
<P>
<U><B>&quot;Serious&quot; Budget Talks to Get Underway</B></U>
</center>
<P><hr>
<P>
<I>The New York Times</I> has reported that budget officials expect
to strike a deal by Friday (December 22).  The budget negotiations
began late November, and since that time little progress has been
made in deciding our country's fiscal fate for the next seven
years.  Unfortunately, it has been &quot;politics-as-usual&quot;
at the negotiation table, particularly for the Clinton Administration.
 As the federal debt approaches a massive $5 trillion dollars
with annual deficits of $192 billion (and as anemic economic growth
continues), you would think circumstances would dictate substantive
spending cuts.  Instead, secretive budget negotiations have us
asking whether Santa will bring us a seven-year balanced budget
with pro-growth tax cuts.  Bah Humbug.
<P>
<B>CBO: How Many Billions Can We Spare?</B>
<P>
Recently, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its revised
economic projections - the result of a compromise between President
Clinton and Republican Congressional leaders.  The latest CBO
numbers paint a more positive forecast for the U.S. economy, and
the CBO projects that under the Republican plan, an additional
$135 billion in revenues will be available by 2002.  Washington
insiders rejoiced at this news.  The Administration budget negotiating
team felt that the additional $135 billion would bring Congressional
Republicans closer to the President's spending demands.  Economic
forecasts have failed to live up to expectations in the past.
 While CBO numbers are the most accurate, SBSC was disappointed
that the &quot;expected&quot; additional revenues will be sacrificed
on the negotiating table instead of applied to spending cuts --
which means tax cuts will more than likely be sacrificed as well.
<P>
The more Republicans negotiate behind closed doors with the Clinton
Administration, the more we are likely to see the President's
type of &quot;investments&quot; emerge- a code word for more spending.
 The gross federal debt is over 70% of the Gross Domestic Product
($4.96 trillion).
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Invest in the Future By Cutting Spending
Now and Giving America $245 Billion in Tax Cuts.</B>
<P>
<B>The Minimum Wage Hike Returns</B>
<P>
President Clinton included a minimum wage hike in his recently
proposed budget.  The President proposes to raise the minimum
wage to $5.15 (a 21% increase) by July 1, 1997, with an interim
increase to $4.70 in July, 1996.  President Clinton's proposal
is driven by  politics  rather than economics.  As one of his
officials said earlier this year: &quot;There are few of us who
actually think it is good economic policy, but more than a few
think it might be good politics.&quot;
<P>
An increase to the minimum wage is definitely not 'good economic
policy.'  Numerous studies and sources, including the General
Accounting Office  and Brookings Institution, have concluded that
a 10% increase in the minimum wage results in a 1%-2% decline
in overall entry-level employment.  <I>President Clinton's proposal
is  projected to cost 400,000 jobs.</I>
<P>
Only 4.7% of the workforce earns the minimum wage.  Minimum wage
workers are four times more likely to be young, single, and inexperienced
when compared to other hourly employees.  Economists estimate
that only about 11% of minimum wage increases go to individuals
at or below the level of poverty.
<P>
The President's proposal should be treated for what it is - an
unfunded mandate for America's small business owners.  Considering
63% of minimum wage workers get a raise within twelve months (with
an average wage increase of 20%), wage rates would be better left
to small business owners - rather than the President.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: No More Unfunded Mandates Like Minimum
Wage Hikes- Cut Regulations and Taxes For the Best Pay Increase.</B>

<B>Public Voices Support for Seven-Year, Tax-Cutting Balanced
Budget &amp; The Case for Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs)</B>
<P>
<B>Poll Indicates Voter Support for a Seven-Year Balanced Budget
with Tax Relief</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
After hearing some of the provisions of the Republicans' seven-year
balanced budget, 57% of those polled said that they had a very
positive/somewhat positive impression of the plan, according to
a poll commissioned by The Coalition for America's Future and
Coalition for a Balanced Budget: 7,200 voters were surveyed between
Nov. 29-Dec. 2.  86% said that the Congress and President Clinton
should deal with the federal budget issue this year: 47% percent
of those surveyed support a balanced budget with spending cuts
<i>and tax relief</i> compared to 39% who support a balanced budget
without tax relief.
<P>
<B>Financial Officers, Greenspan Point to the Need for a Balanced
Budget</B>
<P>
A poll of chief financial officers by the Financial Executives
Institute (FEI) found strong support for a balanced federal budget.
 FEI stated that a balanced federal budget this year will prevent
increased interest rates, falling stock prices, reduced sales,
and higher unemployment.  77% of the financial chiefs said the
economy would take a downturn if there is a failure to reach a
budget agreement this year.
<P>
Similarly, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Capitol
Hill that the recent fall in interest rates, which lowers mortgage
rates and boosts housing and automobile sales, was caused by the
market's anticipation of an agreement between the president and
Congress to balance the budget over a determined period of time.
<P>
<B>ACTION ITEM: Continue to Contact your Member of Congress in
Support of a Seven-Year Balanced Budget with Tax Cuts.</B>
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts - Good for Small Business and Health
Care</B>
<P>
Tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs), which have been praised
by the many businesses that have adopted them as the health care
vehicle for employees, are included in the GOP's Balanced Budget
Act.  MSAs end burdensome paperwork requirements for consumers,
doctors and insurance companies.  And MSAs are portable - each
MSA plan belongs to the employee.  The market dynamics of MSAs
inject cost-consciousness into the health care system.  Thus,
MSAs directly benefit small businesses constantly faced with spiraling
health care costs.
<P>
The congressional budget plan allows MSA tax-free savings of up
to $2,000 for an individual and $4,000 for a family.  The accumulated
interest is not taxed under the Balanced Budget Act.  There is
a 10 percent penalty for non-medical withdrawals to MSAs.  (Please
call SBSC for more information on MSAs and how they work.)
<P>
<I>Concord Management, a real estate management firm which employs
nine people, uses MSAs as a health plan.  One Concord employee,
Richard Norton, suffers from asthma.  After obtaining his MSA,
Norton shopped around for the cheapest asthma medication.  Consequently,
he now pays one-fourth the amount of the medication provided by
his employer under Blue Cross and Blue Shield coverage.  At the
end of the year, Norton received a check for $750 -- the unspent
balance in his $1,500 MSA.</I>
<P>
The GOP budget plan includes medical savings accounts.  The president's
plan, offered on Wednesday, does not.
<P>
<B>ACTION ITEM: Write or Call (202-456-1111) President Clinton
to Include MSAs in the Budget Package. (fax: 202-456-2461, e-mail:

<P>
<B>The Congress' Balanced Budget Act Addresses the Security of
Family-Owned Businesses and Spiraling Growth of Entitlement Programs</B><P>
<B>Why We Must Cut Estate Taxes</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
One of the biggest obstacles to the generational transfer of family-owned
businesses is the estate or inheritance tax.  Approximately 60
percent of family-owned businesses fail to make it to the second
generation, and 90 percent do not make it to the third generation.
 Are estate taxes the cause?  They are a major contributor.  Nine
out of ten successors to a family-owned business cited trouble
paying estate taxes according to a 1993 survey.  Family-owned
businesses generate about 60 percent of our GDP, and during the
1980s they were essential to the increase of more than 20 million
private sector jobs.
<P>
The Republican budget would &quot;phase-up&quot; the estate tax
exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 each year from 1996-2001.
 The Budget Act would begin factoring in inflation after 2000,
and provide for a total amount of exclusion per decedent for qualified
family-owned business interests equal to $1.75 million.  Although
the modifications stop short of a repeal of the estate tax, SBSC
was pleased to have seen the Congress take steps to turn back
the harmful effects of the inheritance tax.
<P>
It is ludicrous that government claims under the estate tax up
to 55 percent (or any percent) of an individual's assets upon
death, considering that individual had established a business,
worked hard, and paid taxes over a lifetime.  What is even more
ludicrous is the fact that this act of class envy is a big money
loser for the government!  In 1994, estate and gift taxes accounted
for a mere 1.2% of total federal receipts ($15.2 billion).  At
least 75% of that revenue is eaten up by compliance and litigation
costs of the IRS and Treasury.
<P>
A cut in the estate tax, besides being morally correct, is good
for the economy.  A 1993 study estimated that without an estate
tax by the year 2000, the GDP would be $79.2 billion higher, 228,000
more jobs would be created, and $630 billion more in savings and
capital would accumulate.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Don't Give in to Class Warfare Rhetoric!
 Stand by the pro-job, pro-growth Estate Tax Cuts</B>
<P>
Capitol Hill Switchboard 202-225-3121
<P>
<B>&quot;Cutting&quot; Medicare and Medicaid</B>
<P>
Unless the President and Congress tame Medicare and Medicaid spending,
the two programs will eventually consume all federal revenues
and/or collapse.  If left on present course, entitlements and
interest on the debt will devour all federal revenues by 2012.
 Medicare and Medicaid are the fastest growing entitlement programs.
<P>
The Republican plan proposes to cut the <i>growth</i> of Medicare
and Medicaid, not the actual programs.  Yet this fact has been
deafened by shear political demagoguery.  The plan would hold
the growth of Medicaid to 5.2% and the growth of Medicare to 7.2%.
 The programs would still experience a major funding increase
between now and 2002.  Medicare outlays would increase from $158
billion to $244 billion.  The chart below illustrates the growth
differences between the Republican plan and the status quo. (CBO
estimates)<HR>

<P>
If left untouched, payroll taxes would have to be hiked to 4.23%
(from 2.9%) in order to preserve Medicare over the next 25 years.
 Cuts in the growth of these two entitlement programs are necessary
if we intend to restore America's fiscal security.  Politics should
not get in the way of reforming these programs.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Medicare and Medicaid Spending are out
of Control - Americans Know the Difference between a Real Cut
and a Cut in the Growth - Keep Cutting!</B>

<B>Economic Growth Through Tax Cuts and a Balanced Budget are
Truly at Stake</B></center>
<P><hr>
As President Clinton and Republican congressional leaders reconcile
their budget differences, it is important to reiterate your support
to your Senators and U.S. Representatives for a seven-year balanced
budget using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) numbers.  While
the president signed an agreement saying he supports a seven-year
balanced plan, already he is backing down from his word.
<P>
<B>ISSUE #1 - A Balanced Budget</B>
<P>
A balanced budget with tax cuts means we will keep more of what
we earn and spend it the way we see fit, rather than government
bureaucrats and politicians.  Will  a balanced budget translate
to a stronger U.S. economy where everyone wins?  Numerous economic
studies say yes.
<UL>
<LI>According to the Joint Economic Committee, a balanced budget
will lead to the creation of 6.1 million more jobs in 10 years,
and will boost real per-capita income 16.1%.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A balanced budget means lower interest rates on home mortgages,
car loans, and student loans.  This, coupled with the tax credit,
could mean a &quot;balanced-budget bonus&quot; of up to $2800
a year for a family of four.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to a Heritage Foundation simulation, moving to a
balanced budget between 1996 and 2002 will result in the additional
construction of 104,000 homes and additional sales of 600,000
automobiles over the next seven years. <B>The simulation showed
an additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income through
2002.</B>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
It is obvious that a balanced budget within the next seven years
will have tremendous economic benefits for our economy and American
families.  But it is important that the president stick to the
seven-year agreement and use what he said were the most truthful
figures - CBO numbers.
<P>
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Pass a 7 Year Balanced Budget Using CBO Numbers

<B>ISSUE #2 - Capital Gains Tax Cuts</B>
<P>
Despite class warfare rhetoric from congressional Democrats and
President Clinton, capital gains tax cuts will benefit all Americans,
not just the rich.  According to SBSC Chief Economist Ray Keating,
the Republican proposal for a 50% exclusion on capital gains income
is the most &quot;pro-growth&quot; step Congress can take this
year.  Firms will pay a top rate of 28%.
<UL>
<LI>A recent study by DRI/McGraw-Hill found that a top capital
gains tax rate of 25% coupled with indexation of cap-gains taxes
for inflation and retroactivity of the cuts to Jan. 1, 1995 would
reduce the cost of capital by 12% and increase the GDP by 1.7%
from 1996-2005.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to the Joint Economic Committee, 83.7% of the returns
claiming capital gains came from families with incomes less than
$100,000.  The remaining 16.3% of claims were from families with
incomes over $100,000.  The largest segment of the population
claiming cap-gains (56.9%) have incomes below $50,000 -- the so-called
&quot;rich.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to Economist and SBSC Board Member Richard Rahn,
&quot;The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and
entrepreneurship...the lifeblood of a vibrant economy...the current,
non-indexed federal tax rate of 28 percent on cap-gains remains
a formidable obstacle to economic expansion...and small business
growth.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<P>
President Clinton says he wants a capital gains  tax cut as long
as &quot;it creates jobs and promotes economic growth.&quot; 
The Republican proposal meets that criteria.
<P>
Please make your voice heard and support capital gains tax reduction.
<P>
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: A Broad-Based Cut in Capital Gains Taxes Benefits All Americans, Not Just the So-Called &quot;Rich.&quot;

<i>November 1995</i>
<P>
<B>The Reconciliation Bill -- What Does it Mean for Small Business
Owners?</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
The House and Senate are finishing work on an enormous budget
package which includes many provisions helpful to small business
owners.  Though the budget plan doest not reduce spending and
taxes as much as SBSC had hoped, we believe the plan is a significant
and necessary step toward fiscal security.  This seven-year balanced
budget proposal faces an imminent veto upon reaching the President's
desk.  Despite strong support for the package within both chambers
of Congress, many lawmakers are feeling the heat from the special
interests.  <B>We encourage all interested small business owners
to contact their elected officials, including President Clinton,
and voice their support for a seven-year balanced budget.</B>
 Some of the pro-small business elements of the package are outlined
below.  Your representative or Senator may be reached at 202-225-3121.
<P>
<B>Capital Gains Tax Cuts -</B> The budget bill would cut taxes
on capital gains (profits from the sale of stock, property or
other assets) $35.7 billion.
<P>
The proposed maximum capital gains tax rate is 19.8% for individuals
and 28% for corporations.  The proposal would make these cuts
retroactive to January 1, 1995.
<P>
The indexation of capital gains to inflation will take effect
in 2001.  Both individuals and corporations would have reduced
capital gains tax rates for investment in qualified small business
stock.
<P>
SBSC feels these measures are a step in the right direction as
we fight for elimination of the highly regressive tax on capital
gains.
<P>
<B>Expensing</B> - The expensing amount would be raised for small
businesses.  The amount, currently $17,500, would be increased
gradually to $25,000 by 2002.
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts</B> - Medical savings accounts (MSAs)
are included in the congressional plan.  Under the plan, individuals
would be allowed to make tax-deductible contributions to an MSA.
 Earnings would be tax free and distributions would also be tax-free.
 Maximum tax-favored contributions for individuals would be $2000,
for families the maximum would be $4000.
<P>
<B>Family Tax Relief</B> - The plan grants a $500 tax credit for
children under age 18 ($125 in 1995) for families earning less
than $110,000, reduces the marriage penalty, and allows for breaks
for those who adopt children or provide custodial care for the
elderly.
<P>
<B>Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)</B> - The plan would
expand eligibility for traditional deductible IRAs, while also
creating a new IRA in which contributions would be taxable but
earnings would be tax-free.  Also, the plan allows for penalty-free
withdrawals from deductible IRAs.
<P>
<B>Estate and Gift Taxes</B> - An estate tax relief proposal was
included in the package.  The unified credit would be phased up
to $750,000 and a portion of small business assets would be excluded
from the estate tax.
<P>
<B>Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction</B> - The bill would
raise the health insurance deduction of America's self-employed
to 50% by 2002.
<P>
While not perfect, the congressional package of tax cuts and debt
reduction is a fine way to approach fiscal security for America's
future generations.  The Small Business Survival Committee encourages
its members to congratulate Congress on a job well done and to
urge their representatives to stand by the proposal's tax-cutting,
spending reduction measures.

Over the past two years, the Small Business Survival Committee

that a more effective influence in Washington is needed to reverse
laws that hurt free enterprise.  Feeling isolated and disenfranchised
from Washington, state and local business organizations have long
known that inside-the-beltway antics will do little to stop the
growing intrusiveness of government.<BR>

The Small Business Survival (SBS) Coalition utilizes the grassroots
strengths of state and local organizations to mobilize its business
membership and leaders. <BR>
<P>
 If hundreds of business organizations nationwide speak with one
voice when key legislation or policy is being proposed, debated
or considered, powerful special interest forces who support the
status quo of big government can be overcome.  If the status quo

<h2>
Carolan &amp; Keating &#173;&#173 - December 16, 1996<BR>
Stunning Account of the Great Villain<BR>
<P></h2>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3></center>
<p>
<br><blockquote>

Have you ever wondered what Nelson Rockefeller did before he wrecked
New York's economy?  Well, author Cary Reich provides all of the
answers in his new book The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller: Worlds
to Conquer 1908&#173;1958.
<P>
This biography of the former New York governor and vice president
of the United States deservedly rated as a National Book Award
finalist.  Indeed, The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller is crisply
written and well researched.  
<P>
While a massive tome at almost 800 pages, it is just the first
of a two&#173;part work.  In fact, before cracking the book open,
we were a bit leery with the idea of dedicating so much paper
to someone like Rockefeller &#173;&#173; our least favorite governor
of New York (with Mario Cuomo naturally running a very close next&#173;to&#173;last).
 However, now we cannot wait until the second volume lands in
book stores next year.
<P>
This book covers Rockefeller's life up to the point when he handily
won the 1958 New York gubernatorial contest.  So we must wait
for part two to read about how Rockefeller &#173;&#173; through
a massive expansion of state government, myriad borrowing shenanigans,
and destructive tax increases &#173;&#173; set New York firmly
on the track to economic oblivion.  In the meantime, one requires
a host of valuable insights about Rockefeller's pre&#173;Albany
days.  
<P>
The reader gains a portrait of an individual with boundless energy,
enthusiasm and wealth.  Far too often, though, Rockefeller's enthusiasms
clouded his judgment.  Perhaps this proved most obvious while
serving in the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  
<P>
FDR tapped Rockefeller's expertise on Latin America, with Rockefeller
eventually serving as an assistant secretary of state.  During
these years, Rockefeller became completely obsessed with establishing
close ties and a united front among all the nations of the Americas
&#173;&#173; not terribly controversial on the face of it, except
for the fact that Rockefeller was more than willing to overlook
Argentina's pro&#173;Nazi regime.  Rockefeller almost appeared
as an appeaser when it came to Argentina.  As the war came to
an end, Rockefeller and the U.S. administration received much
deserved criticism for their less&#173;than&#173;tough stance
toward Argentina.
<P>
Another controversial enthusiasm of Rockefeller's was given birth
while serving under FDR.  He discovered the off&#173;budget government
corporation, and modified it so that these entities were accountable
to no one but himself and FDR, who simply received an annual report.
 
<P>
Years later, after he became governor of New York, Rockefeller
set up dozens of off&#173;budget public corporations, or authorities,
in order to avoid state constitutional limits on borrowing, namely,
voter approval of long&#173;term state debt.  Reich reveals that
as a student at Dartmouth, Rockefeller was interested in the pyramids.
 The government corporation allowed him to finance grand government
building projects &#173;&#173; as useless and almost as massive
as the pyramids.
<P>
Still, even though he enthusiastically sold foreign aid as a cure
for what ailed Latin America, prior to his reign as New York's
governor, Rockefeller's enthusiasms for big government remained
at least somewhat camouflaged.  Indeed, when necessary Rockefeller
could offer arguments and speeches on capitalism so moving that
they probably brought a tear to the eye of Milton Friedman.  However,
practically all of Rockefeller's actions while serving in government
showed him to be a hard&#173;left New Dealer at heart.  Rockefeller
may have spoken glowingly of the marketplace on occasion, but
he believed in the power of government action.  
<P>
Rockefeller was a disciple of his fellow New Yorker FDR.  As Reich
puts it: &quot;Roosevelt was a mentor, an adviser, and a role
model.&quot;  One might be able to forgive FDR for his big&#173;government
escapades, having been knocked silly by the Great Depression.
 Rockefeller had no such excuse years later in New York.
<P>
New York conservatives proved prescient.  As Reich notes, conservative
Republicans always eyed Rockefeller leerily, and as it turned
out for good reason.  But for all the damage wrought by Rockefeller,
the rise of conservatism in the 1960s owed much to him.  While
Ronald Reagan would provide conservatives with something to be
for, Rockefeller gave them something to be against.  
<P>
Reich notes this fact: &quot;Indeed, it would be fair to say that
conservatism would not have advanced so relentlessly had it not
been for Nelson Rockefeller.  In Bill Rusher's words, 'Every movement
needs a villain.  For the GOP right, Nelson Rockefeller was it.'
...  Hatred of Nelson Rockefeller, for the right, became a uniquely
binding force.  The final mordant irony of Rockefeller's life
in politics is this: while he never achieved the Age of Rockefeller,
he may well have brought about the Age of Reagan.&quot;  
<P>
Conservative hatred of Rockefeller lives on, but it is a healthy,
well&#173;warranted hatred.  Get labeled a Rockefeller Republican
and your chances for advancement in today's GOP (outside of New
York, that is) are probably quite slim.  C&amp;K heartily recommend
The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller as a last minute Christmas present.
 It pays to know thy enemy.

<h2>
Carolan & Keating - December 9, 1996<br>
Poor Over&#173;Worked and Under&#173;Paid State Legislators<BR>
<p>
</h2>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3></center>
<P>
<br><blockquote>

Many of us apparently don't realize how grueling the job of a
New York state legislator really can be.  In recent weeks, some
legislators are telling anyone who will listen how &quot;stressful&quot;
and &quot;hectic&quot; their jobs are.  They pat themselves on
the back, and declare that they all &quot;work hard.&quot;  And
because they slave so arduously, these public servants plan to
give themselves a pay raise.
<P>
How reassuring.  We must have been deluded to think legislators
are lavishly compensated, while their efforts are wasteful and
incompetent.  
<P>
For example, it costs a little more than $1 million per office
to run the state senate and more than $500,000 per office for
the assembly.  These not insubstantial amounts pay for large staffs,
cars, public relations apparatuses, multiple offices, et al. 
Indeed, the New York state legislature employs more than 4,000
bureaucrats.  It must be very time consuming for legislators to
manipulate all these resources so that taxpayers fail to detect
the utter waste involved.  
<P>
And then, of course, there's all that pandering to whiners and
special interests.  Assemblyman Tony Seminerio of Queens reportedly
said he deserves a pay raise because he puts &quot;a lot of time
in&quot; and has &quot;a lot of responsibility.&quot;  Seminerio
was recently quoted: &quot;It's a quarter after five and I'm still
here.  I'm waiting for a constituent, who will probably be here
at 20 to six.  Tonight I have two meetings to go to.&quot;  How
does tired Tony do it?  After all, none of the rest of us have
ever worked all the way to 6:00 pm, and then had work commitments
later in the evening, right?  In addition, most of those evening
&quot;meetings&quot; for elected officials involve cocktails,
appetizers, dinner, and meeting people who will fill their campaign
coffers.  It must be brutal.  
<P>
One has to wonder why tired Tony and other complainers in the
state legislature don't flee the extreme pressures and low pay
of elected office and get a cushy private sector job.  Why come
back election after election, if things are so tough?  Instead,
they could do something real easy, like start a business; produce
a service or product people actually want; wrestle with onerous
state taxes, regulations and bureaucrats; and only work 18 hours
a day for six or seven days a week.  
<P>
Interestingly, some state legislators actually do have their own
businesses &#173;&#173; that is, if you can call being a law partner
having a business.  Wow, Superman stand aside!
<P>
These poor gals and guys in the legislature have not gotten a
raise since 1989.  Golly, how can they keep up with the rising
cost of living?  We suppose the fact that the job of state legislator
is a part&#173;time position is to be ignored.  Also, that New
York state legislators are the second highest paid in the nation,
only recently surpassed by California, must be set aside.  Additional
lulus (i.e., stipends) for most legislators, worth anywhere from
$6,500 up to $30,000 annually, awarded for doing their jobs and
staying in line politically, cannot be considered.  Expense reimbursements
for being in Albany, worth just under $100 per day on average,
must be pooh&#173;poohed as well.  
<P>
In addition, we should turn a deaf ear to an increase in state
legislator's base bay from $32,960 in 1984 to $57,500 today &#173;&#173;
when adjusted for inflation, a better than 15 percent increase.
 Add in the aforementioned lulus, and the average part&#173;time
state legislator garners about $70,000 per year.
<P>
Lastly, we assume that no link between pay and productivity should
be made at all.  Little lapses in job performance should be overlooked,
like chronically late budgets; high taxes; bloated, inefficient
and wasteful government; over&#173;regulation; state debt gimmicks,
led by off&#173;budget public authorities, designed to skirt the
State Constitution; and a government patronage mill.
<P>
If we ignore all these many factors, then New York state legislators
deserve a pay raise.  However, if we cannot overlook such lapses
&#173;&#173; for both ethical and economic reasons &#173;&#173;
then New York legislators deserve a massive pay cut.
<P>
Perhaps the time has come for serious reforms that will make the
New York state legislature a citizens' body, rather than a body
of lifetime politicians.  The framers of the State Constitution
had such a notion in mind when they required that a legislature
could not vote a pay raise for itself.  A pay raise can only take
effect for the next legislature.  Today, however, the next legislature
is largely the same as the current and previous legislatures.
<P>
Two reforms are needed.  First, require that all pay raises in
the state of New York, whether for state or any local elected
officials, pass muster with the voters before being implemented.
 Second, institute term limits in New York.  Eight years for both
legislators and the governor &#173;&#173; and why not local officials
as well &#173;&#173;  should be sufficient.
<P>
Not only would New York gain a true citizens' legislature, but
poor Tony Seminerio and his over&#173;worked legislative colleagues
would be released from their current back&#173;breaking duties.
 It's the least we can do for these suffering souls.

<h2>
Carolan & Keating - December 2, 1996<br>
The Recycling Grinch<BR>
<P>
</h2>
<h3>
 by Matthew Carolan &amp; Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3></center>
<P><br><blockquote>

     By all objective standards, recycling is more expensive and
more wasteful of natural resources than sending solid waste to
a landfill.  A fact to remember this holiday season as you wash,
sort, and cart back to the supermarket those extra bottles and
cans to recover your nickels.
<P>
     Don't get us wrong.  We support recycling bottles and cans,
when it makes economic sense and is done voluntarily by private
businesses.  But forced, government recycling is an inefficient,
costly response to manufactured landfill scares.  
<P>
     Despite their haphazard appearance, modern landfills are
quite advanced.  Because of numerous government safety regulations,
landfills must be lined and covered with special protective layers
to prevent seepage of toxins into the air and water supply.  They
must also monitor and remove any gasses that can accumulate inside
the landfill.
<P>
     Ignorance of these and other landfill features abound, as
does the belief that there is a &quot;shortage&quot; of landfill
space.  Currently, space devoted to landfilling American waste
amounts to a volume one hundred yards deep by two&#173;thirds
of a mile square per year.  By the year 3000, according to Clark
Wiseman of Gonzaga University, given packaging innovation and
other factors, all the garbage of the United States will be able
to fit in a landfill 100 yards deep and 35 miles square, or less
than half that if it were compacted.
<P>
     So why are politicians closing landfills, and even using
wasteful bond acts and long term debt to do so?  Why are they
paying more to boost recycling, and ship trash out of state? 
<P>
     It is because in any policy debate over politically incorrect
things like landfills, where greater efficiency and lower prices
are diffused throughout society, such gains are often defeated
by a smaller group, who persuade the political class to protect
their own perceived special interests.  One example is the NIMBY&#173;types
(not in my backyard), and another the environmental lobbyists,
whose global aesthetic appeals undercut the importance of a strong
economy in providing a clean and healthy environment.
<P>
     Some communities, like Charles City County, Va., recognize
that the public good is a more complex equation.  As reported
by John Tierney in a recent New York Times Sunday Magazine, Charles
City County receives waste from New York City, which pays to send
it out of state.  In Charles City County, jobs are plentiful,
the environment is healthy, and the students have new computers
in their schools thanks to the influx of trash cash.  In contrast,
New York City, as Tierney wryly points out, has lots of environmentalist
indoctrination in the classroom, but an otherwise crumbling educational
infrastructure.
<P>
     New York in fact is now learning the expensive lesson that
when you eliminate the cheapest way to dispose of waste, you begin
to see increasingly baroque misdirections of public energy and
a piling on of costs.
<P>
      Take the costs you bear for your bottled beverages. You
pay hidden costs, which can amount to as much as seven cents per
container, because the supermarket must now administer the deposit,
run machines to crush the bottles and cans, and pay the kid to
clean up all the plastic bags dripping with soda or beer.  You
pay costs for the distributors to administer the program as well.
<P>
     Then, add in the cost of additional taxes you pay to your
local government who recycle almost everything &#173;&#173; except
your plastic bottles and aluminum cans (the only valuable stuff
to recycle) due to the deposit law.  You trudge back to the store
while the municipality loses tens of millions, or in New York
City, hundreds of millions per year (including millions in water
and fuel oil to wash garbage) recovering items worth nowhere near
what it costs to recycle them.   It all translates into more local
taxes.
<P>
     You can thank the great impresario of baroque government,
Mario Cuomo, for some of this absurd inefficiency.  The simple
repeal of his 1983 bottle deposit law would at least cut the losses
of municipal recycling programs.
<P>
     But why stop there?  In the spirit of the holidays, when
we all want to save time and money, let's do more than go to the
store for the big sale.  Let's call our local government bean
counters, and tell them to audit our recycling programs.  A clear
look at the books will show that the government, like a Green
Grinch, is stealing the money, the presents, the soft drinks,
even the oil and hot water from our Christmas.

Carolan & Keating - November 25, 1996<br>
The Germtooth Letters<BR>
<P>
</h2>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3></center>
<P>
<br><blockquote>

     Several decades past, one of this century's greatest Christian
apologists, C.S. Lewis, published his remarkable reports on secret
correspondence taking place between certain agents of evil from
the netherworld.  The Screwtape Letters, as it was called, shocked
an entire generation.
<P>
     Today, Carolan &amp; Keating have &#173;&#173; through certain
spiritual sources &#173;&#173; obtained copies of similar correspondence
between entities stationed in New York.  One such message is reprinted
here for your edification: <BR><p>
<HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=left SIZE=3>
<P>
Thursday, 11/21
<P>
My Dear Germtooth,<BR>

<P>
     I have received your message, and I'm a bit disappointed.
 Your promotion to Secretary of Infernal Affairs in the Second
District means you are eminently qualified to deliver many souls
to our Father Below.  But if so simple a holiday as Thanksgiving
is enough to frighten you, as it seems to do every year, then
may I suggest you return to us immediately, so that I may devour
you with stuffing.
<P>
     While Thanksgiving is nauseating, its acknowledgment of the
enemy is usually only temporary.  True, there are little inklings
of guilt throughout the season, and we watch with some concern
as many of our choice morsels stray back to religious services
for a day or two.
<P>
     But if you have laid the groundwork well, the slothful soul
will not stay long, sensing that his cherished &quot;freedom&quot;
is threatened by archaic moral commandments.  You can count on
him to eventually opt for one of our own non&#173;threatening
bait religions,
or return to his own &quot;private spirituality.&quot;  I do enjoy
a soul so richly basted in its own pride.
<P>
     As you surely know, the holiday provides us with other excellent
opportunities.  Gluttonous intemperance during the holiday season
can be nurtured through the new year into a scrumptious array
of sensuality and fornication, usually by summer.
<P>
     And don't forget how many delicious family squabbles can
be started by simply reminding your subject that the holiday must
be a perfect day, which is impossible, and then upsetting him
so upon seeing one's father in an ugly tie.  Many a fine assault,
or in ideal cases, a murder, has been enjoyed on this holiday
thanks to a bad tie.
<P>
     Here's an excellent recipe to exploit before dinner:  Take
a pound of natural hunger, mix with a pinch of apprehension over
being judged by others, or a slice of personal vanity.  Spill
one glass of wine, and add a few harsh words.  Garnish with sour
faces, and a sprig of old resentments.  Flambe according to taste.
 C'est manifique.
<P>
     After football, and hopefully a Cowboys' victory, I like
to save some scraps for later enjoyment.  Try this.  First, melt
down the subject's guilt from overeating into a simpler form,
then work it into a froth during a news report on the starving
in Rwanda.  Keep him focused on how uncaring the world is while
folding in generous portions of pride with his own charity.  This
produces a flaky, puffed up compassion; so great that the subject
loves
humanity, but is unable to care for the man in his office or the
child across the street.  Thus will he more easily condemn others
for having too much, which is always tasty.  This recipe was first
brought over to Greenwich Village, but is now also very popular
at the Capital, and in some Chancery offices.
<P>
     Speaking of the Capital, you are doing a fine job overseeing
the production of delicious morsels for our consumption.  We are
still reheating the last governor you sent us in that delightful
inflagrante delicto sauce.  
<P>
     And those hollow&#173;core legislators you have been sending!
 What a remarkable medley of amoral immorality!  SlubGob swears
it cannot be done by simple political compromise, no matter how
much you whip it.  You must send us the recipe.
<P>
     Of course, the enemy would have us and those mortals believe
He would be able to fully satisfy us, which would of course make
eternity dreadfully boring.  Surely there has to be some kind
of challenge.
<P>
     But our victims, despite their fallen state, retain this
absurd belief in final satisfaction.  Indeed, we would not enjoy
them so much if they didn't, redirecting that hope as we do into
the political system, which promises to give &quot;security,&quot;
and &quot;prosperity.&quot;  Once we have taken that hope away
from Him, the enemy, and directed into him, or him, or her, it
is amazing how we can turn them against each other, and into our
waiting claws.  <BR>

<P>
Ravenously yours,
<P>
HairBug

Carolan & Keating - November 11, 1996<BR>
Bond Act on the Brain and Time for Big Al's Exit
<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
</center>
<P>
<BR>
<blockquote>
<DD><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he scene is a Manhattan hotel on election night at five minutes to nine.  Governor George Pataki is questioned about the Dole campaign by a local reporter. He answers by talking about the importance of his environmental bond act.  
<P>
Pataki is asked the question again.  The answer, once more, relates to the bond act.  When pressed another time, Pataki explains that the Dole camp "pulled out of New York about a month ago," so there was nothing that could be done.  Then, the Governor returns to the bond act.
<P>     
Those who read this column know that we have been generally supportive of George Pataki. We believe his tax cuts, for example, are a vital step to regaining New York's economic health.  We applaud Pataki's efforts to reform the worker's compensation system and lifting some regulations in the health-care arena.  But the Governor's behavior these past few months -- his myopic campaigning for the pork-barrel bond act especially -- raises serious doubts about both his strategic thinking and leadership regarding conservative ideas. 
<P>     
Forget the Dole campaign, which had it's own problems.  But what about the State Assembly races?  For months, many conservatives and Republicans have argued that winning the Assembly was vital to getting smaller government in New York.  Yet, with barely a peep from the Governor this fall, the GOP actually lost a few seats in the state legislature overall.
<P>     
Perhaps we should have seen the lack of leadership coming. Recall that last year, during another delayed budget, the Governor failed to bring that fight for smaller government to the mass media.  Now the Governor has traded his shot at a majority in the Assembly for personal image polishing with the Greens.  He is also rarely seen in Albany.  Such clear lack of strategic focus or zeal at the top of the GOP is surely not lost on Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Democrat Chairwoman Judith Hope, or the handful of Democrats who seem eager to run for governor in 1998.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=left SIZE=3>
<P>
 <DD><FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>s it our imagination or does Senator Al D'Amato become less and less subtle about his political opportunism with each passing day?
<P>    
After Bill Clinton scored big in New York, including heavily Republican Nassau County, Senator Al D'Amato made a remarkably transparent attempt to mend his reputation by suggesting maybe it's time to call a truce on Whitewater.  What irony, the most political Republican of all now reinforces the perception that the Whitewater investigations were always political by calling them off after the election.  This leaves the rest of D'Amato's party to answer the false charge of politicization, leading one Republican staffer to comment "Typical D'Amato. CYA." (Cover your a--).  
<P>
D'Amato performed a similar turnabout on primary night earlier this year.  After victoriously using the New York GOP's rigged primary rules for his own candidate, D'Amato called for eliminating those very rules in favor of a more open system.
<P>
     D'Amato's brazenness lies in the fact that everything he touches is political.  He poisoned Whitewater. He poisoned the bond act. He has poisoned George Pataki's reputation.  Nothing Al D'Amato does or says can be taken at face value.  Everything must be scrutinized for its underlying meaning.  Next time he holds a press conference to announce he's in love, listen carefully, there may be federal funding involved.
<P>     
We just wonder how much longer the GOP family will put up with brazen Al D'Amato.  How many losing candidates this year, for example, will work hard for King Al's re-election in 1998 after he left them to twist in the wind while he hawked the bond act?  Will many of these same local hacks continue to say "Yes boss," while enduring another of D'Amato's acid phone calls?
<P>
However, it's simply not a question of process with D'Amato any longer.  His political judgment must come into serious question in 1996, after appearing so astute in 1994.  After all, D'Amato led the early charge for Bob Dole.  D'Amato lined up every elected New York Republican official (barring Rudy Giuliani who came to Dole of his own accord much later) behind one of the most inept GOP presidential candidates ever.  D'Amato will attempt to blame the Dole loss on extremists in his party (some of D'Amato's local hacks started spinning this thesis on election night).  However, in reality, it was largely GOP liberals and moderates like D'Amato who pushed Bob Dole to the forefront.
<P>     
We wonder: Isn't there anybody in the whole New York GOP who will stand up and primary Al D'Amato -- some former Ambassador, some retired executive?  Is there no bond trader or investment banker in the state who refuses to kiss D'Amato's you-know-what?  Somebody who can't be bought with a patronage job, or who cares more about policy and economic freedom than pork.  Of course, there are some, but alas D'Amato controls the GOP patronage machine -- at least until 1998.  Post-1998 is when things might get interesting for New York Republicans.

<h2>
Carolan & Keating -- November 4, 1996<br>
Who Was Eugene Travis?<br>
</h2>
<p>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<br>
</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>In a democracy, ideas and choices matter.  Under the best of circumstances, rival political parties offer the electorate real alternatives in terms of governing philosophies.  Indeed, a country or state's well-being depends not only on rigorous economic competition in the free marketplace, but healthy competition in the political market as well.
<p>When the line between political competitors begins to blur, the consequences can be severe.  For example, from the end of World War II until the late 1970s, Great Britain fell into this deadly trap.  Both the Labour Party and the Tories worshiped the false idol of democratic socialism.  As a result, Britain's economy and position on the world stage suffered dearly.  Neither political party offered an alternative until Margaret Thatcher became prime minister.  
<p>New York has suffered a similar fate in the twentieth century.  Supposedly, Republicans are the party of private enterprise, free markets, and traditional social values, while Democrats offer government action and liberal views on social issues.  Unfortunately, the line between Democrat and Republican in the Empire State often blurs.  
<p>Three current examples stand out.  First, Republican New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was elected with Liberal Party support, has shown little indication that he understands that high city taxes and regulations have all but extinguished the city's entrepreneurial spirit.  Giuliani's unwillingness to seriously cut taxes and government shows him to be more Democrat than Republican.  Second, bipartisan support among the state's elected officials for the environmental bond act on Tuesday's ballot clearly illustrated a blurring of the lines between the parties when it comes to pork spending -- which is what the bond act was primarily about -- and the environment.  And third, with the New York Republican Party now officially a pro-abortion party, the GOP can no longer be presumed as the party of traditional values, nor a party that protects life and liberty.
<p>However, blurred lines between parties is not new to New York.  Indeed, the most prominent example was Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who out-taxed and out-spent every other governor in our nation's history.  Running a close second was one-time Republican Mayor of New York City John Lindsay, the biggest tax-and-spend mayor in U.S. history.  Further back, one sees another New York City mayor, Fiorello LaGuardia, the so-called fusion candidate.
<p>However, one of the earliest cases where New York's two parties lost distinction was in 1919, with New York's economy suffering heavy consequences to this day.  After the elections of 1918, Republicans controlled both state houses and Democrat Al Smith was the new governor.  Republican Eugene Travis served as state comptroller.
<p>With wartime prohibition coming into effect and the Prohibition amendment to the U.S. Constitution soon following, state officials were concerned over the loss of state and local revenues from liquor sales.  An inter-party deal was cut to impose a state income tax on individuals, allowing each party to avoid full blame.  With Republicans in control of both houses of the legislature, however, the income tax could have and should have been a dead issue.  
<p>Prominent opposition came from State Comptroller Travis.  Travis deemed the tax unnecessary.  For this simple act, Travis should be considered a Republican hero in New York.  He ignored an ugly deal other members of his party were willing to make at the time, and instead stood for principle, as well as fiscal and economic soundness.  
<p>Travis stood up against the most destructive and intrusive tax known to man -- the income tax.  The income tax has raised the costs of working, investing and risk taking -- the sources of economic growth -- while serving as high-octane fuel for the growth of government.
<p>Most political blurring in New York has been cases where Republicans give up on their limited-government principles in favor of traditional Democrat governmental activism.  The only prominent case of blurring in the opposite direction was when Democrat Governor Hugh Carey supported the elimination of the state's unincorporated business tax, a rather Republican thing to do.  The tax was phased out in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and entrepreneurship received a little boost in New York.  
<p>Recent Republican nibbling at the edges of big government and high taxes will not be enough to make New York an economic powerhouse once again.  If the GOP is to be a source of the Empire State's re-birth, they will have to advance bold measures.  
<p>Republicans should pick up the cause of Eugene Travis.  The income tax wasn't needed in 1919, and it surely will only hamper New York in the twenty-first century, with both capital and labor more easily avoiding onerous taxes.  Proposing an end to the anti-work, anti-investment, anti-risk-taking income tax would ignite entrepreneurship, economic growth, and job creation in New York for the first time in decades.  It also would be a major step toward New York Republicans becoming true Republican once again.

Carolan & Keating -- October 28, 1996<br>
Pre-Election Round-Up<br>
</h2>
<p>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<br>
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<blockquote>
<dd>A few observations before the November 5 election:
<ul>
<li>C&K's most interesting New York races to watch:<ol><li>Top notch Republican, Conservative, and Right-to-Life candidate Sue Wittig in New York's 26th CD has a real shot to topple nationally known green Democrat Maurice Hinchey; <li>Democratic Party honcho Judith Hope pins party hopes on Carolyn McCarthy -- whose husband was killed, and son shot in LIRR massacre -- in her race against Republican Dan Frisa in Long Island's 4th CD. McCarthy, a nice woman, knows nothing about the issues, including assault weapons ban she touts.  Big sympathy vote gives her the lead, though final Frisa mail blitz to undecideds could pull out the race in a conservative district.</ol>
<li>Missing: Governor of New York.  Governor Pataki has been seen promoting environmental pork bond act, catching a flight to Central Europe, and at Yankee Stadium.  However, the Dole for President campaign can't seem to find him.  Indeed, New York Republican lemmings must regret having followed their leader Senator D'Amato over the Dole cliff.
<li>It's a shame that Bob Dole and Jack Kemp have run an unbelievably inept presidential campaign and will lose on November 5.  The Dole-Kemp economic plan would have provided much-needed tax and regulatory relief for New York taxpayers, entrepreneurs and businesses.  The Dole-Kemp 15 percent across-the-board income tax reduction and the $500 per child tax credit would have saved New York families an estimated $1,646 per year on average.  The 50 percent cut in the capital gains tax, along with inflation indexing, would have provided a significant boost to investment, risk taking and economic growth.  Throw in some real regulatory and legal reform, and this Dole-Kemp plan makes the Pataki tax cuts look puny.  But New York will help send Clinton back to the White House, with real tax and regulatory reform put off until the next century.
<li>Throughout his career, Jack Kemp has enthusiastically reached out to black Americans and other minorities with a market-oriented agenda, while many others in his party neglected the minority vote.  We applaud Kemp's efforts. However, during recent weeks of this presidential contest, when Dole-Kemp can't even shore up the traditional GOP base, one has to wonder why Kemp still spends so much time in places like Harlem.  The numbers -- e.g., one percentage point of the black vote translates into roughly 0.1 percentage point of the total vote -- make it difficult to justify Kemp's regular campaigning in these final days in inner cities.  
<li>As is increasingly the case, New York Conservative Party turns out to be a mixed bag this year.  "Contract with New York" turns out to be a non-starter, as anti-Gingrich sentiment stifles talk of programmatic reform. However, Conservative Party legislative ratings for this year do show a decided shift to the right under Pataki, with even liberals like Sheldon Silver voting 50 percent conservative.  Perhaps lack of wedge issues produced grade inflation? Meanwhile, Tom Long, brother of Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long, gives Queens County Conservative Party endorsement in New York's 7th CD to fanatical pro-choice Republican Rose Birtley, running against pro-life Democrat Tom Manton by touting her support of partial-birth abortion.  Would Queens conservatives endorse similar extremists if they supported a progressive income tax or cutting patronage jobs for conservative lackeys?  Perhaps we don't want to know the answer to that question. Kudos, however, to Westchester conservatives for giving line to Joe DioGuardi, and not incumbent liberal GOPer Sue Kelly in 19th CD.  Kelly, for some undisclosed reason, warrants the undying, arm-twisting support of Speaker Newt Gingrich.
<li>Memo to Long Island Congressman Peter King: Gerry Adams called. He wants to congratulate you for taking on Louis Farrakhan so courageously in your campaign literature.
<li>For once, C&K agrees with the New York Democratic Party.  They recently asserted that Senator D'Amato's ads for the environmental pork bond act essentially amount to political shilling to re-build Senator Pothole's reputation.
<li>Ron Lauder seems to be suffering from a split personality.  On the one hand, he fights the good fight to keep New York City's term limits in tact.  On the other hand, according to The New York Times, Lauder forked over $25,000 to support the environmental pork bond act.
<li>After hockey's Devils won a Stanley Cup, they got a new arena deal from New Jersey officials.  Likewise, the Yankees' World Series victory will seal the deal for a new $1 billion-plus, taxpayer-financed Yankee Stadium.
<li>Conservative opposition to the environmental pork bond act has not exactly been robust.  Of course, New York's unprincipled business groups largely support this $1.75 billion boost in New York debt.  Some supporters even claim that the bond act will create tens of thousands of jobs!  Will New York political and community leaders ever understand that only a robust private sector creates wealth and jobs?  We doubt it.

The Myth of the Common Man
<BR>
</h2>

<blockquote>
<DD><FONT SIZE=+2>C</FONT>ruising the World Wide Web the other day, we came across the New York Democratic Party site.  Like most Web sites, it's a high-tech mix of text and graphics. But when you read it closely, you get a decidedly "retro" feeling. So retro in fact, it seems like the Democrats want you to forget the last 170 years ever happened.
<P>
     The Democratic Party, we are told, traces its origins back to two legendary American political figures: Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson.  Jefferson was an "anti-Federalist," who wanted to keep power out of the hands of an aristocratic elite that gained
special favors from government -- a kind of politics that caused chaos in Europe. Despite Jefferson's distrust of the uneducated masses, it is said, he was a theoretician of limited-government who paved the way for mass democracy.
<P>     
But with the election of Andrew Jackson to the presidency in 1828, the common man came out of the political wilderness.  The Jacksonians, who distrusted bankers and reflected the Western pioneer spirit, defeated powerful aristocratic forces in the Senate to take the presidency. Jackson welcomed the average person to participate in the affairs of his country.  Shortly following his term, the U.S. witnessed a seven-fold increase in votes cast in a presidential election.  Today, the two heroes are celebrated by the Democrats at their annual Jefferson-Jackson Day dinners. 
<P>     
Of course, when you look at today's New York State Republicans -- who seem about as close to an arrogant, self-serving European elite as you can get -- you can understand why Democratic passions for the common man are still inflamed.  But as far as we can tell, the Republicans at least spare us hypocritical history lessons.
<P>     
The Democratic myth of the "common man" has brought about exactly what Jefferson decried: saviors in government.  During the New Deal, the common man was told that an intrusive central government, run by the Democrats, would tell him what his interests and who his enemies were, and would tax and regulate him at unprecedented rates for his own good.  After the 1968 Democratic convention, the common man would become known by his better name, "member of the victim group," who needed the political class to gain redress for his discontents.
<P>     
New York's Democratic Party identifies the good of society with the good of certain segments of New York, like the teachers' unions, public employees unions, ethnic militants, and trial lawyers, among others.  But how, for example, does it advance the interests of the average family to drive up the cost of living through excessive taxation on income, food, fuel, and property, to support a burgeoning public sector?  How does it serve the interests of the common man to make him pay twice to give his child a religious education, or to be unable to fire lousy public school teachers?  How does it help the common man to pay excessive insurance rates because the Democrats protect trial lawyers who make fat commissions off excessive judgements?  To us it sounds an awful like the chaotic European politics Jefferson rejected.
<P>     
The problem of course is that America, and most assuredly New York, have abandoned Jefferson's most important notion: limited government.  Such a government makes no pretense to solve all man's problems, and does not manipulate groups of people in feats of social engineering.
<P>     
Indeed, in the eyes of Alexis de Tocqueville, when he came to observe the new experiment in democracy and chronicle it in Democracy in America, one of the saving graces of our nation was its absence of group or class envy.  The common man of de Tocqueville's day had no enemies for his government or his party to demonize. 
<P>     
We wonder if the same is true today.  Visit the Clinton/Gore '96 Web site, and you don't get that impression.  There, if you like, you can get updates on what the party will do for every victim group.  You can also download bumper stickers to support the common-man's President, who feels everybody's pain and protects the now-failing middle-class entitlements from demon Republicans.  There is a bumper sticker in Spanish, another with a pink triangle on it, and one for women.  But there was no bumper sticker that every one can use, one for "the common man" and his values.  Maybe that's because the common man doesn't put much value, or faith, in government.

Carolan & Keating -- October 14, 1996<br>
The Dying "Culture of Death"
<br>
</h2>
<p>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<br>
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<blockquote>

<p>It's ironic how destiny works.  Amidst all the hoopla in Albany over George Pataki's rather meager accomplishments, along with a dreary presidential campaign, a relatively unknown Attorney General by the name of Dennis Vacco quietly prepares to argue a case before the Supreme Court that will shake the republic, and make his a household name.
<p>The case is Quill v. Vacco, which the High Court has agreed to review after a Federal court struck down New York State's law against assisted suicide.  A decision will come early Summer.  No matter the outcome however, the case will mark the end of the culture of death.
<p>In the July 21 New York Times Sunday Magazine, the nation's foremost anti-euthanasia expert, Professor Yale Kamisar, expressed concerns that assisted suicide be seen as a privacy issue akin to that found in Roe v. Wade, which he supports.  Kamisar now wants limits on what one does with one's own body: "When the Court ruled in 1973, it termed abortion unique," the professor notes. "It never said the right of privacy should be extended this far."
<p>The Times reports that many pro-choicers are joining pro- lifers in a new anti-assisted-suicide coalition.  They argue that "pulling the plug," allowing someone to die from their own natural ailments, is not the same as intentionally killing them through lethal injection -- even if it is a "private" matter between a person and her doctor.
<p>We agree.  Who or what is the "cause of death" makes all the moral difference.  But Kamisar and friends are a little late.  When Dennis Vacco goes before the Supreme Court, he will be fighting seventy years of liberal jurisprudence -- which has deemed nearly every question of life and sexuality to be "religious" and therefore unconstitutional bases for the law.
<p>For example, in Hawaii, "marriage" is about to be redefined. Once linked to notions of heterosexuality, fidelity, and offspring, marriage is now an empty concept, to be defined according to one's constitutionally protected "liberty."  So too for "life," which the Casey decision says is another empty concept.  Mothers may define the "meaning" of the life of their child any way that want, and act accordingly.
<p>Now the new utopians say, "Why should we be bound by what Hippocrates said, when referring to both suicide and abortion he said: 'Doctors may not kill.'?"
<p>The chickens of privacy then have come home to roost.  Under the mantle of privacy, Americans have the right to be despairing lunkheads; to be shortsighted; to live life in terms of a false dilemma, and have doctors help them.  On abortion: "It's either my life, or this baby's, there is no other way."  On suicide: "Either I live in terrible pain, or somebody kills me (death with dignity), there is no other way."
<p>We do not agree with either murderous notion. As Hippocrates argued, there is always a middle way, and the doctor must find it.  Despite being armed with only a pestle and some herbs to ease pain, Hippocrates' had the more progressive vision, because he built medicine on metaphysics, which we have rejected.  He saw that doctors, as humans, not Gods, do not have the competence to determine the value of any life, but only to serve that life with pain relief, or healing.  It's ironic that with all our advanced skills for pain relief we demand the easier way.
<p>You can be sure however that our worried liberals will not invoke God before the Court, having already granted the humans god- like powers in Roe v. Wade and Casey.  They can only turn to their own self-interest, which may not be enough to stop the death march of liberty.  In the Netherlands, where assisted suicide is legal, doctors regularly kill people without their consent, because the law allows the doctor God-like judgement that some lives are objectively not worth living.
<p>If the Court strikes down state laws against assisted suicide, we expect a constitutional crisis undermining the judicially imposed culture of death.  Some governors are thought courageous enough to oppose the Court, like George Allen of Virginia, or Kirk Fordice of Mississippi.
<p>But even if the Court denies a broad right to assisted suicide, it is still a victory against the entire culture of death. For the Court would be implicitly accepting that medical tradition can have an objective nature against killing, against despair.  And from this small seed, new insights may grow.
<p>As psychiatrist Herbert Hendin told the Times about the desire for suicide, it is a "cry for help," and with proper care, the depression goes away.  Pain relief is always possible for the suicidal.  Then isn't the same relief, a fortiori, always possible for the depressed pregnant woman?
<p>Pray then, for Dennis Vacco. His job is nothing less than reversing the course of the established civil religion.

Carolan & Keating -- September 30, 1996
<br>
Higher Education in New York
<br>
</h2>
<p>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<br>
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<blockquote>
Since the days of ancient Greece, the process of education has been about finding the "reality" beneath the appearances.  As today's parents wonder about higher education for their children, they should know New York's vaunted college market is not as it appears.
<p>For example, take some course offerings at New York's "finest" educational institutions, as surveyed by the Young America's Foundation.  At Columbia, students can opt for "English W3500y: Topics in Gay Male Representation," or "Spanish and Portuguese BC3135y: Reading for Difference: Lesbian and Gay Themes."  At Cornell there's "Housing and Feeding the Homeless," or "Lesbian Personae," "Gay Fiction," or "Introduction to Sexual Minorities."  At New York University, there's "Race, Class, Gender, and Ethnicity in the City: The Politics of Urban Society," and "Sexual Diversity in Society."  
<p>Thinking of sending your daughter of Vassar?  Get ready for "From Bohemia to Queer: Contemporary Lesbian and Gay Communities in America," or "The Politics of Difference," which "explicitly explores," according to the catalog, "issues of race, class, gender and sexual orientation."
<p>These once-elite schools now reflect all the rot that has crept into "post-modern" education. The traditional core curriculum, which emphasized logical skill and general historical knowledge, has been dismantled in favor of the narrow, ideologically driven study of "socially constructed identity," and "victims of oppression." 
<p>An interesting lesson in how to respond to this nonsense comes from one of the classic texts of conservatism, God and Man at Yale by William F. Buckley, Jr.  The book caused a firestorm among Yale alumni some four decades ago with its dramatic charge that Yale had abandoned the traditional religious ideals of its Protestant founders.  And the book's success proved that no matter how much bleating there is about "academic freedom," academics teach at the grace of the alumni who keep the school and its particular traditions afloat.  If you violated those traditions, as was done at Yale, you lost funding.
<p>That's why we advise any donor to a school to do more than read the propaganda newsletter mailed out by your alma mater.  Read the course catalog, talk to fellow alumni, and ask the students how many classes are being taught about lesbians with a VCR instead of Dante and Shakespeare with a primary text.
<p>Of course, radical academics are not standing still.  They have been doing their level best to eliminate alumni control, by dramatically increasing the federal and state role in education. Now the government can demand diversity, civil rights, and affirmative action for "victim groups" in the schools.  And taxpayers already living paycheck to paycheck, with government laying claim to 40 percent of their income, have little time or incentive to root out university crackpots, though rich alumni might.
<p>Look at the slide in the State University of New York (SUNY) schools.  A shocking study by the Empire Foundation and the National Association of Scholars details just how far afield the multicultural fad has taken taxpayer-funded education in New York.  Using SUNY's own data, it was found that at the 16 major SUNY campuses studied, only half required students to take course work in Western Civilization, but all mandated the study of gender, sexuality, afrocentrism, etc.
<p>It was also found that at all the schools, students can entirely avoid taking quite a few of the eight traditional core courses.  At SUNY-Binghamton, for example, students are required to take gym, but not English composition, math, literature, or philosophy.  And at Freedonia, students can get through four years of college and never have to take any classes in history, literature, philosophy, foreign languages, arts, or science.  Kind of reminds us of the Freedonia run by Groucho Marx.
<p>And even where core requirements exist, students can satisfy the requirement with esoteric multicultural courses like "Saints, Witches, and Madwomen" (New Paltz's Writing requirement), or "Horror Literature" (Old Westbury, Writing and Reasoning Skills), or "Literature of Sports" (Cortland, Literature), instead of more rigorous general knowledge courses.
<p>What has been the response of the SUNY educrats to these criticisms, and others about alarming drop-out rates and declining SAT standards for entering SUNY student?  "The Empire Foundation is run by rich guys who hate taxes and don't like public education."  Those benefitting from a classical education recognize the logical fallacy known as the ad hominem circumstantial: dismissing your opponent because of his background instead of answering the argument.
<p>We'll admit our bias.  We think government-funded higher education is inherently wasteful, and destroys educational performance in favor of narrow political goals.  Of course, the trustees of SUNY, and the Faculty Senate (who are meeting this week), could prove us wrong.  They can change SUNY's course from left-wing indoctrination to a truly liberal education.  But until they do, we'll continue to consider ourselves the victims of their oppression.

Carolan & Keating -- September 16, 1996<BR>
Any Real Conservatives in New York?<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
In recent years, a few skirmishes seem to have broken out on the
conservative side of the political aisle.  Many in the media,
of course, have portrayed this as an epic war on the right between
social conservatives and economic conservatives.
<P>
Like most true conservatives, we fail to see what all the fuss
is about.  We're both economically and socially conservative &#173;&#173;
supply&#173;side, pro&#173;family, free&#173;trade, pro&#173;life,
hawkish, internationalist, property&#173;rights, small&#173;government
conservatives.
<P>
The controversy arises when self&#173;proclaimed &quot;conservative&quot;
politicians turn out, in reality, to be moderates or fence&#173;sitters.
 New York and the rest of the Northeast are full of such impersonators.
 Indeed, Governors Bill Weld (Massachusetts), Christie Whitman
(New Jersey), John Rowland (Connecticut), and New York's own George
Pataki, all claim to be conservatives.  However, their records
and positions show each to be mild economic and fiscal conservatives,
while being quite liberal on many social issues, most prominently
on abortion.
<P>
On the flip side, Pat Buchanan claims the mantle of conservatism
as well.  But in reality, Buchanan turns out only to be conservative
on social issues, while on the economics front he has become a
raving class warrior, touting the liberal, big&#173;labor line
on issues like trade and immigration.
<P>
This division between Buchananites and middle&#173;of&#173;the&#173;road
Republicans turns out not really to be a battle on the right at
all, but a fight between two very confused camps within the Republican
Party.  One side fails to understand the value of human life while
the other misunderstands the value of free, unfettered markets.
 Neither are conservative in a complete sense.
<P>
To get a sense of how truly conservative the New York congressional
delegation is, C&amp;K turned to two sources.  The Christian Coalition,
a pro&#173;family group with more than 1.7 million members, rated
the 104th Congress according to 13 key votes in the House of Representatives
and 11 key votes in the Senate.  These votes offer a good representation
of socially conservative issues, from abortion to welfare reform
to school vouchers to tax cuts.  The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a pro&#173;entrepreneur, pro&#173;free market advocacy
group with more than 40,000 small business members (C&amp;K's
Keating serves as chief economist for SBSC), rated Congress according
to 25 key votes in the House and 18 key votes in the Senate. 
The issues ranged from deregulation to private property rights
to spending reductions to tax cuts &#173;&#173; a good representation
of conservative economic issues.  
<P>
Indeed, as any good conservative would expect, the two organizations
had some overlap in terms of the issues on which Members of Congress
were rated.  Each group used a scoring system whereby 100 rated
best and 0 rated worst.  In the accompanying chart, C&amp;K combined
the two scores to arrive at a gauge for the complete conservative,
and ranked New York's congressional delegation accordingly.  A
perfect score is 200.
<P>
Not to our surprise, no New York Member of Congress scored a perfect
200, though three House Members impressively scored in the 190s.
 These three &#173;&#173; Solomon, Frisa, and Paxon &#173;&#173;
are all Republicans.  Gilman, Houghton, and worst of all, Boelhert
rated least conservative among New York GOPers in the House.
<P>
No Democrats scored well.  The least liberal, you might say, was
McNulty in the House, followed by LaFalce and Manton.  Ackerman,
Hinchey, and Serrano scored perfectly liberal zeros.
<P>
As for the Senate, Al D'Amato scored slightly favorable on the
conservative meter, and Pat Moynihan miserably.
<P>
Obviously, these ratings are not comprehensive, in that they reflect
only select key votes.  But they do give the reader a feeling
of where their elected officials generally come down  &#173;&#173;
left or right &#173;&#173; on the issues.
<P>
Overall, New York's congressional delegation rates very liberal.
 Indeed, in our view, the Empire State can claim only one or two
across&#173;the&#173;board principled conservatives in Congress.
 Meanwhile, little more can be said at the state level, with a
handful of principled conservatives in the Assembly and none to
be found among state senators, the Governor or the Lieutenant
Governor.
<P>
Of course, this dearth of true conservatism explains why New York
ranks among the worst in the nation in areas like taxes, government
spending, entrepreneurship, job creation, and abortions.<BR>

<h2>
Carolan & Keating -- September 9, 1996<BR>
Power to the People?<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan &amp; Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
     Remember the energy crisis of the 1970s: gas rationing, lines
at the pump, inflation?  Well, there was a silver lining, which
might now pay off big for New Yorkers.
<P>
      When experts predicted oil at $100 per barrel back then,
the power industry &#173;&#173; long a government&#173;protected
monopoly &#173;&#173; was forced to innovate. The 1978 National
Energy Act mandated that local utilities buy power from &quot;QFs&quot;
or qualifying facilities (wind power, solar power, etc.).  When
oil prices stabilized, QFs became boondoggles.  But at the same
time, they stirred a revolution called &quot;wheeling.&quot; 
Wheeling moves electricity long distances over transmission wires
and allows utilities to buy cheap surplus power from each other.
<P>
     Washington is about to repeal many arcane regulations in
wheeling and power production, creating an exciting, fluid market.
 Power producers will now be able to reconfigure and recapitalize
like other businesses, and sell across the country or around the
world.
<P>
     More importantly, they will be able to compete to sell to
individual homeowners (retail wheeling), just like in local and
long distance phone service.  Experts predict lower prices, which
will ripple throughout the economy.  Under federal waivers some
projects have already started.  Last April, New Hampshire began
wheeling for 17,000 customers.
<P>
     The state Public Service Commission (PSC), which governs
New York's utilities, has long called for retail wheeling.  An
admirable position, since not often do government regulators give
up jobs. But we fear their goal of retail power here by 1998 could
be derailed.
<P>
     As power producers and government disentangle, many inefficient
facilities, no longer protected by regulation, will have their
real value exposed by the market.  Naturally investors will look
for a bailout.  Many of the PSC's governing &quot;principles&quot;
for a retail market &#173;&#173; i.e. &quot;fair trade,&quot;
&quot;environmental protection,&quot; etc. &#173;&#173; provide
lots of wiggle room for these special interests to stick costs
on ratepayers.  Recent battles in Washington over telecommunications
deregulation went that way.
<P>
     What concerns us also is the role of New York's government&#173;created
power &quot;authorities,&quot; like the New York Power Authority
(NYPA), and the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA).
<P>
     NYPA was created in 1931, originally on the St. Lawrence
River to provide power to the Massena area. Like most government
bureaucracies it has regularly expanded its mission.  NYPA suggests
it is &quot;uniquely positioned&quot; to handle &quot;all&quot;
power transmission in the new retail market.  Some are suggesting
NYPA buy up transmission grids and independent power producers.
<P>
     LIPA was created in 1986 to respond to the reversal of fortune
of the Shoreham nuclear power plant.  After the Three Mile Island
accidents, attitudes toward Shoreham changed and LILCO investors
were left with a $4 billion liability.  A deal was made for LIPA
to dismantle the plant for $1, while the PSC still haggles with
LILCO over recovering its losses, a prime obstacle to recapitalizing
the utility.  The government solution is to have LIPA issue municipal
bonds to buy LILCO, thus eliminating federal taxes on it, thus
reducing electric rates for Long Islanders.  The Governor tells
us LIPA will eventually sell off parts of LILCO but run transmission.
<P>
     We wonder why, however, in the coming fluid market, government
authorities need to be involved at all.  There are, of course,
political reasons, such as relationships with bond traders and
grateful investors who contribute to political campaigns.  There
are the votes of myopic rate&#173;payers, clamoring for immediate
relief.  What's more, New York's authorities offer excellent opportunities
for patronage. Many a former free&#173;market conservative has
found a lucrative, out&#173;of&#173;the&#173;way home there.
<P>
     But why should LIPA buy generators, which might be worth
nothing in a market full of new generators?  Consumers will get
stuck with the cost.  (Or, a more efficiently capitalized LILCO
could also recover in the new world market.)
<P>
     Why should NYPA and LIPA lock up all the transmission business
in New York?  Recapitalized utilities can run transmission lines
themselves, and other entities with rights&#173;of&#173;way, like
railroads, subways, and phone companies, can stop monopolies by
offering transmission in a dynamic market.
<P>
     Clyde Crews of the Competitive Enterprise Institute warns:
&quot;The worst thing you can have is a government&#173;controlled
monopoly on transmission.&quot;  Even a private monopoly would
be better, he notes, since an unprotected monopoly would more
easily spur competing building of extra transmission facilities,
or even innovative production to circumvent the monopoly, (such
as microturbines for home use).
<P>
     The state PSC has so far kept NYPA at arms' length, offering
only vague statements that NYPA may have &quot;some role.&quot;
 They should have no role.  LIPA too should be dismantled.  LILCO
investors are victims of regulatory fickleness by government,
but that's their problem.  There is no need to lock ratepayers
into dangerous long&#173;term government deals, when so much potential
savings exists in the emerging market.
<P>
     These are the political obstacles.  We just hope the PSC
gets tough with special interests.

Carolan & Keating -- September 2, 1996<BR>
Term Limits: City and State<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
<P>
</center>
<blockquote>
     You know liberalism is in trouble when even New York City
Council members, some of the state's most hard&#173;left politicos,
are aping Bill Clinton by cloaking themselves in the mantle of
conservatism.  Just look at their current attempt to protect their
jobs with their &quot;responsible&quot; version of term limits
this fall.
<P>
     Recall that in 1993, New Yorkers voted 60 percent to 40 percent
to impose limits on their Council members of two terms of four
years each.  Now the Council is trying to weasel out from under
the law, offering a referendum to change the limits from eight
years to 12, and to &quot;restart the clock&quot; on their careers
so that many of them won't have to leave until 2007.  Council
Speaker and perpetual politician Peter Vallone argues that without
these changes there will be &quot;absolute chaos,&quot; as &quot;inexperienced&quot;
politicians take over the whole Council at once.
<P>
     Anyone who follows the City Council knows what its &quot;experience&quot;
is like. This past year the New York Post offered a shocking expose
of Council members' poor attendance records, uncouth manner, and
lack of initiative.  Priscilla Wooten, Democrat from Brooklyn,
recently summarized her 14&#173;year career in one line: &quot;I
just know how to play the game.&quot;
<P>
     A cadre of unelected special interests &#173;&#173; labor
unions, ethnic militants, real estate developers, and party bosses
&#173;&#173; help keep the same old hacks in power, bleeding the
city and state.  Much fault lies also with New Yorkers, who either
benefit from Council greed or don't turn out to vote.  Yet, even
the most principled voter can't undo this mess if given only a
&quot;choice&quot; of candidates dominated by those interests.
<P>
     Term limits takes the &quot;career&quot; out of politics,
offering a government based on ideas rather than personal friendships
and payoffs.  Term limits have been recommended by Thomas Jefferson,
John Adams, Ben Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, Harry Truman, and Dwight
Eisenhower.  Studies by the CATO Institute show a direct correlation
between length in office and increased pork&#173;barrel spending.
<P>
     According to U.S. Term Limits, 21 states, mostly out West
where big government is less in vogue, have instituted term limits
for their state legislators.  Over 3,000 localities across the
U.S. now have limits, with 26 localities in New York State (10
passing limits in 1993 alone).  And in major cities like New Orleans
and Kansas City, as Ronald Lauder points out, term limits have
not produced any negative consequences.
<P>
     Expect the battle in New York City to get personal.  Desperate
politicians are sure to try to muddy the waters, accusing millionaire
Lauder &#173;&#173; a prime mover behind New York's term limits
movement &#173;&#173; of what they themselves are guilty of: &quot;allowing
money to influence the political process.&quot;   Allen Roth,
a spokesman for Mr. Lauder, notes: &quot;As long as the voters
know that they now have the term limits they want, they won't
accept the Council's arguments.&quot;
<P>
     Internal polls for the term limits movement show opposition
to the Council's changes stands at 70 percent.  The most recent
New York Post poll shows support for the current limits at 63
percent to 18 percent.     And informed sources also tell us that
a surprising number of influential liberals are soon to denounce
the Council's term&#173;limits revision.  Mr. Lauder is going
to spend &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to defeat the new initiative.
 Even the New York Times, which does not support term limits,
has accused Vallone of trying to do an &quot;end run&quot; around
the will of the voters.  Expect a major defeat for the Council
this fall.
<P>
     Can conservatives parlay the scalping of Mr. Vallone into
something more?  The Conservative Party's &quot;Contract with
New York&quot; calls for term limits as part of the overall strategy
to win the statehouse this year.  And a poll conducted recently
by Fabrizio&#173; McLaughlin and Associates shows that voters
are more likely, by a margin of 72 percent to 10 percent, to support
a candidate who pledges to limit his own term.  Seems like a golden
opportunity for the New York GOP, which has been trying to win
the Assembly for years. 
<P>
     We're not so sure, however, that the current Republican leadership
are at all interested.  (After all, New York Republicans seems
as enthralled with doling out billions in pork dollars each year
as Democrats are.)  And under current law, no referendum to amend
the state constitution can go to the voters before the politicians
in Albany deign to support it on two separate legislative sessions.
 That's unlikely.
<P>
     Conservative activists need to put the heat on Governor Pataki,
who allegedly supports term limits.  If Pataki fails to make the
case for a term limits referendum &#173;&#173; a golden opportunity
for Assembly candidates this fall &#173;&#173; he would clearly
line up on the side of pork over principle.  A sufficient reason,
we think, for the Conservative Party leaders (who despise pork)
to run their own gubernatorial candidate in 1998.

<h2>
Carolan & Keating -- August 26, 1996<BR>
The Costs of Public Universities in New York<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
</center>
<P>
As collegians head back to campuses across New York and the rest
of the nation, our thoughts turn to the state and cost of higher
education today.  In particular, the taxpayer costs for the Empire
State's public universities are much steeper than most New Yorkers
seem to realize.
<P>
Make no mistake, both public and private institutions of higher
learning suffer problems.  The college professor, as one observer
has wryly noted, stands as the only profession &#173;&#173; perhaps
barring prostitution &#173;&#173; where productivity has actually
dropped since the time of Socrates.  Tenure shields teachers from
the healthy pressures of the marketplace.  College and university
professors regularly argue for increased compensation and fewer
working hours through their unions.  And while we all need to
stay abreast of the latest developments in our respective fields,
few of us can imagine getting regular sabbaticals &#173;&#173;
only in academia. 
<P>
When a work load of one, two, or perhaps three courses a semester
becomes too burdensome, &quot;over&#173;worked&quot; professors
can turn teaching duties over to graduate students.  In which
case, parents wind up paying for their sons and daughters to attend
classes with student teachers standing at the front of the classroom.
 Too often, professors are off publishing, while quality teaching
perishes.  Indeed, the ivy covered walls of academia can hide
many woes.
<P>
Meanwhile at private institutions, tuition costs rise ever higher,
no matter what the economic climate it seems.  But at least in
the private marketplace, individuals make a choice based on price.
 I.e., selecting a college and paying the commensurate tuition
is not coercive in nature, it is a choice.  The same cannot be
said of public university systems like the State University of
New York (SUNY) and the City University of New York (CUNY).  Tuition
and fees come no where near covering the full cost of education
at SUNY or CUNY.  New York taxpayers foot the majority of the
bill.
<P>
Public university systems serve as glaring examples of good intentions
through government action gone predictably far awry, resulting
in bloated bureaucracies and skyrocketing costs.  Naturally, New
York offers the most bloated university system.  SUNY, created
in 1948, ranks as the largest state university system in the nation
with 64 campuses.  CUNY, whose forerunners were given birth in
the 1930s, ranks third biggest with 19 schools.  State taxpayers
assumed responsibilities for financing CUNY's senior colleges
and capital programs after New York City proved itself financially
inept during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s.
<P>
The per student (full&#173;time equivalent) total cost of running
SUNY equals about $22,700 annually.  CUNY tops the $23,000 per
student (full&#173;time equivalent) mark.  In the meantime, undergraduate
tuition at SUNY is about $3,400 and $3,200 at CUNY.
<P>
Compared with other states, the average salary for a full&#173;time
professor at a public university in New York ranked fourth highest
in the nation in 1994 at just under $75,000.  Mind you, this is
based on a nine&#173;month contract.  In addition, New York claims
the highest per capita cost for state undergraduate scholarship
and grant programs in the nation.  And on top of all these state
campuses and costs, localities run their own community colleges
across New York.
<P>
The time has arrived to dismantle this government education monstrosity.
 With thousands of private colleges and universities across the
nation, no need exists for government&#173;run institutions of
higher learning.  These public colleges and universities originally
were created out of fears that private colleges were either too
costly or discriminatory.  Well, today, the total costs &#173;&#173;
student and taxpayer combined &#173;&#173; for SUNY and CUNY outpace
costs at many of the nation's most elite private universities,
and discrimination pertaining to college admissions is nothing
but a fading memory.  If anything, affirmative action has fostered
reverse discrimination.
<P>
Some will argue that the tuition costs at private colleges and
universities still remain out of reach for many students.  If
true, then doesn't it make more sense to provide a means&#173;tested
voucher to students in actual need for private institutions, rather
than maintaining a huge, costly government bureaucracy?
<P>
Lastly, closing or privatizing two of the nation's largest public
university systems would offer another benefit.  Unproductive
professors would be booted off the taxpayer dole.  Who knows,
private colleges and universities may some day demand more of
their professors, handsomely compensating excellence and punishing
non&#173;performance.  If it ever happens, it will be at a private,
not a government, school.

<h2> Carolan & Keating  -- August 19, 1996<br>
The Welfare Oracle</h2>
<p>
<h3>by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<p>
<dd>Daniel Patrick Moynihan is a jolly fellow.  With PBS's Charlie Rose or on This Week with David Brinkley, the senior Senator from New York makes everybody laugh.  Only one thing gets Moynihan upset: when somebody else tries to reform welfare. <p>
<dd>     After all, Pat Moynihan is America's welfare oracle.  Having taken a courageous stand in the 1960s with writings explaining the damage social programs do to black families (Beyond the Melting Pot and The Negro Family: The Case for National Action), Moynihan has been living off his reputation ever since.  His own record on welfare reform is a disaster. <p>
<dd>     Moynihan was a part of the Nixon Administration's failed efforts at "family assistance" in 1969, and his attempts at welfare reform in 1988 did nothing to "end welfare as we know it." Moynihan has spent his career simply tinkering around the edges of big government, preserving for another day his role as "welfare scholar." <p>
<dd>     The current welfare reform law just passed, which has Moynihan in hysterics, is a modest effort, and a mixed bag.  It does end the most crucial fault of federal welfare policy: the guaranteed right to assistance, regardless of behavior.  It also allows time limits, which are long overdue. <p>
<dd>     However, these time limits are too lengthy, and rather than getting welfare out of the hands of the federal government entirely, the measure offers only minor flexibility for states.  Meanwhile, federal welfare spending continues its ascent, albeit at a slower rate, and the demand for workfare will do nothing but create more bureaucracy. <p>
<dd>     Senator Chicken Little calls these minor changes "the most brutal act of social policy since Reconstruction."  Later, more guardedly, he admits: "We don't know what's going to happen." <p>
<dd>     We know what's happened so far.  Since the 1960s taxpayers have sunk over $5.4 trillion dollars into welfare, with a horrifying rise in illegitimate births (now 70 percent among blacks and above 30 percent among whites) and octupled spending to show for it. Illegitimacy is the single greatest contributing factor to poverty. At least now the states will have some ability to make demands on recipients -- a necessary change.  Pat Moynihan, who hasn't had anything intelligent to say on welfare in 25 years, can try his "expertise" elsewhere. <p>
<dd> Hats off to State Senator John Marchi of Staten Island for showing political imagination on welfare while Rudy Giuliani and George Pataki just cry to the media about what federal reform will do to New York. <p>
<dd>     Writing in the August 12 New York Times, Marchi notes that under current judicial interpretation, Article XVII of the State Constitution, the one that guarantees assistance to the poor, has been construed to hold that nothing more than "need" can be considered in giving aid.  No other state in the union has such a policy, which helps to explain why New York spends almost twice the national average on welfare.  New York's Medicaid spending stands at more than Texas and California combined. Marchi wants to change the Amendment, giving the state more flexibility to restrict social programs on behavioral grounds. <p>
<dd>     Of course, guess who's standing in the way?  Democrat Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver knows the poverty industry serves as one of his key special-interest constituencies. He is blocking a possible amendment from going to the voters of New York State. <p>
<dd>     This is a golden opportunity for the Republicans in the fall elections.  If New-Democrat Bill Clinton can reform welfare by taking away blanket guarantees, New Yorkers certainly can as well.  Indeed, such a step becomes imperative if New York is to avoid being even more overwhelmed by welfare rejects from more frugal states. <p>
<dd> Get rid of welfare, it can't be "reinvented."  Peter Salins of Hunter College and the National Center for Policy Analysis in Texas have a better idea: private unemployment insurance.  With extra disposable income from lower taxes once welfare is gone, private citizens can buy cheaper, more efficient unemployment protection, which along with private charity will provide a better safety net. <p>
<dd>      Private policies tie costs to behaviors.  With government, where various poverty interest groups simply force others to pay, wise behavior is not necessary, and costs inevitably explode. The same thing occurs with government health insurance and other forms of "social security," as FDR called them.  Call it the anaesthetic society, where people numbed by government have no reason to stop biting their tongue. <p>
<dd> The charge that welfare reform "will throw millions of children onto the streets" raises a serious concern.  Welfare has become a kind of blackmail liberals want us to pay to irresponsible parents so they don't hurt innocent children.  Such blackmail is made easy if welfare can be had by simply filling out a form.  If the blackmailers had to look other people in the eye, and mend their ways, like they do at private charities, they would be less bold.  State-level government welfare, rather than federal, is a start, but the more local and more private the help, the more quickly these kinds of child abuse will disappear.<p>

VPs from New York: From Rockefeller to Kemp?</h2>
<p>
<h3>by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<dd>The last New York Republican to serve as Vice President of the United States was Nelson Rockefeller under President Gerald Ford.  However, the former New York Governor was Republican in name only.  Today, the name "Rockefeller" is anathema to all but the few most liberal members of the GOP, as Rockefeller earned infamy as the biggest tax-and-spend Governor in our nation's history. <p>
<dd>During the GOP's darkest hour -- Watergate -- Ford chose Nelson Rockefeller as his VP.  The selection proved so unpopular that Rockefeller was forced to withdraw from seeking the number two spot on the 1976 campaign ticket, which eventually went to Bob Dole.<p>
<dd>Now twenty years later, Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole has turned to New York for his own running mate.  To a New Yorker, though, with a decidedly different political philosophy than many other New York GOPers: former Buffalo Bills quarterback, New York Congressman (for 18 years from the Buffalo area), and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp.  With the combination of his plan to cut taxes and the Kemp pick, Dole has managed to energize his formerly moribund campaign. <p>
 	<dd>With almost any other New York Republican as his number two, we would have written off the Dole campaign.  In so many ways, however, Kemp has always been the antithesis of the standard New York Republican. <p>
<dd>Kemp believes in the power of ideas, while the New York GOP generally believes in watching polls.  Kemp emphasizes supply-side tax cuts (he was political father to the Reagan tax cuts), deregulation, and sound money as the keys to prosperity.  The New York GOP, particularly the state and national legislators, often prefer government pork barrel spending. <p>
<dd>Kemp is pro-choice when it comes to education, and pro-life on the abortion issue --contrary to many leading New York Republicans. <p>
<dd>Kemp also possesses a Reagan-esque vision about the economy, individuals, and the nation; in contrast to often dour New York Republicans.  Where Kemp poses a real alternative to politics as usual with his boundless optimism, many New York Republicans have tried to merely slow down what they seem to think is New York's inevitable decline. <p>
 Kemp's optimism is already paying dividends for the Dole campaign.  He fires up the GOP activists -- from supply-siders to pro-lifers -- and helps the ticket reach out to blue-collar Reagan Democrats -- lost by George Bush -- and creates inroads to minority communities. <p>
<dd>Kemp's only weaknesses from a conservative perspective are his somewhat favorable view of affirmative action and some evidence of squeamishness when it comes to deep cuts in government spending.  Dole generally remedies such woes, however. <p>
<dd>The prospect of Kemp as Vice President could change New York's political dynamic as well.  Kemp could help polish the long-tarnished reputation of the New York GOP on the national stage, perhaps even restoring New York's good name to the pre-Bull-Moose days of Teddy Roosevelt.  Also, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is now sure to endorse Dole-Kemp (Kemp endorsed Rudy in his bid for mayor).  And remember that Governor Pataki always has had very good things to say about Kemp as a presidential choice.  After all, Kemp helped boost Pataki's gubernatorial campaign in its final days by traveling the state with Pataki, focusing on tax cuts.  A new Giuliani-Kemp-Pataki connection would surely change the fortunes of the New York GOP nationally and within the state. <p>
<dd>Will Kemp swing New York in favor of Dole?  Surprisingly, New York State has gone Republican in five of the past eleven presidential campaigns, and in three of the last six.  If nothing else, Kemp's strengthening of the ticket will help tighten up the numbers in the Empire State, thus giving the GOP a better shot in New York state and federal legislative races.  But barring any new Clinton scandals, New York will likely stay with Clinton. <p>
<dd>Still C&K sees a Dole-Kemp Administration offering both promise and challenge to the New York GOP.  Lower personal income and capital gains taxes promised by Dole, added on to the Pataki tax cuts, will help boost New York's economy.  Dole's promise to return power to the states under the Tenth Amendment, as well as his plans to use the new presidential line item veto, something even Ronald Reagan didn't have, threaten to dismantle New York's poverty industry and sink the pork barrel. <p>
<dd>Questions naturally arise:  Are New York Republicans ready to rise to the challenge that Bob Dole and Jack Kemp pose, now and during a possible Kemp presidency beginning in 2000?  Is the New York GOP ready for a more mature governing philosophy of lower taxes, less spending, and less insider dealings?  Can they shake off Nelson Rockefeller for Jack Kemp? <p>
<dd>To some extent, Governor Pataki and the GOP New York State Assembly have begun this process.  The jury is still out on the Republican State Senate and the verdict looks bad for Mayor Giuliani, who reneged on a promise to let the city's personal income tax surcharge finally expire.  We'll see in the coming months.

Olympic Fever in New York
</h2>
<p>
<h3>by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<p>
<dd>Like most everyone else, C&K is looking forward to the summer Olympics getting underway this week in Atlanta.  From baseball to gymnastics, fencing to sailing, skeet shooting to equestrian events, we'll watch as much of the games as we can, wearing our sports nationalism proudly.  C&K has caught Olympic fever. <p>
<dd>Recent reports illustrate that New York politicians are not immune to this fever either.  In fact, some of them are so excited they're planning to try to lure the Olympics, once more, to New York.  Previously, the winter games came to Lake Placid in both 1932 and 1980. <p>
<dd>Lake Placid is at it again.  The village's mayor, T. James Strack, recently announced that Lake Placid is considering a bid for the winter games of 2022.  Talk of competing for games so far off in the future is difficult to take seriously.  However, on June 26, The New York Times quoted Strack declaring: "Any good plan is a plan that is developed 25 to 30 years in advance."  We'll leave it to the future and our readers to decide whether Mayor Strack is a long-term visionary, or just an opportunistic politician looking to garner some short-term media attention. <p>
<dd>In the meantime, a more immediate effort has begun to bring the summer Olympics of 2008 to New York City.  No doubt, it's an exciting notion.  However, wild-eyed predictions are being made by various politicians and boosters in terms of the impact and costs of actually bringing the Olympics to the Big Apple.  We are told that tens of thousands of new jobs will be created at no cost to New York taxpayers.  Given Mayor Giuliani's similar predictions regarding a new government-built and owned stadium for the Yankees on Manhattan's west side, New Yorkers would be wise to be skeptical of such grand predictions. <p>
<dd>A sober assessment obviously is needed.  And we don't mean an assessment by a consulting firm paid for by the people in favor of the Olympics coming to New York City.  An independent assessment is required.  C&K humbly offers its services. <p>
<dd>First, it is crucial to understand that bringing the Olympics to New York City will in no way cure the city's economic ills.  The actual boost to the economy will be short-term in nature -- albeit probably a substantial economic blip, but a blip nonetheless.  Only deep tax cuts, regulatory relief, and government downsizing will cure New York City's economy, which has been in decline for decades. <p>
<dd>Second, if the games are funded through the private sector -- as is the attempt traditionally -- then whatever boost does occur will be real.  Extensive government involvement will only serve to tarnish the games -- creating numerous inefficiencies and boosting costs.  Fundamentally, private, voluntary funding is always far preferable to government taxation.  The market works far better than government bureaucrats. <p>
<dd>However,  just when New York City seeks the games, of course, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) seems on the verge of making government financial guarantees a part of the Olympics bidding process.  Preliminary cost estimates to bring the games to New York City in 2008 run in the neighborhood of $3.3 billion.  We wouldn't be surprised to see that number rise considerably.  In comparison, the Atlanta games will cost about $1.7 billion. <p>
<dd>One needs to remember that the 1984 games in Los Angeles were the first to actually make money.  The IOC obviously is seeking to protect itself from future losses through government guarantees.  In addition to the clear affront to New York's already overburdened taxpayers, consistent state and city fiscal troubles make such guarantees non-viable. <p>
<dd>In the end, we don't wish to play the part of party spoilers.  We believe New York City should pursue the 2008 Olympic summer games -- and even Lake Placid the winter games of 2022 -- with two provisions: 1) no taxpayer dollars or guarantees should be utilized, and 2) after the games, Olympic venues should be privatized.  After all, the state should be eliminating its Olympic Regional Development Authority, not expanding such a boondoggle. <p>
<dd>The summer Olympics of 2008 in the Big Apple, and the winter games of 2022 back in Lake Placid, are intoxicating ideas.  If taxpayers are not tapped, then C&K looks forward to helping the cause for bringing Olympic sailing contests to the waters around the Statue of Liberty, gold-medal baseball to Manhattan's west side, tennis to Flushing, and perhaps bobsledding and ice skating again to Lake Placid.  We've got tax-free Olympic fever.

<h3><i>Chemical Weapons in New York?</i></h3><p>

<b>by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating</b></center>
<p><br>
<blockquote>
<hr>
The story line includes chemical weapons, officials from the Hague, and the threat of 
international espionage for hundreds of businesses in New York.  It's not a James Bond film or 
the latest Tom Clancy page-turner, nor is it the paranoid tale of some militia group.
This is the story of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) -- an international treaty 
set to come before the U.S. Senate for ratification by September 14.  The CWC's stated purpose 
is to ban the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons.  Unfortunately, it falls far short of 
such vaunted goals while imposing considerable costs.  <p>
The CWC fails the most basic tests of an arms control treaty.  It is non-enforceable, 
non-verifiable, and does not serve the national interest.  Rogue states will still possess chemical 
weapons; small, mobile production facilities will elude detection; and the U.S. will lose its edge 
in terms of deterrence powers and the development of counter-measures.  		After all, 
proving the "non-existence" of something is an absurd and dangerous requirement on which to 
base a treaty.  As former Reagan Defense Department officials Douglas Feith and Frank Gaffney 
Jr. have noted: "The trouble is the CWC is a bad treaty -- one that will likely increase risk of 
chemical warfare around the world."<p>
And with rogue states emboldened in the chemical weapons trade, can bolder terrorists be 
far behind?<p>
Meanwhile, the costs of the CWC run high for U.S. entrepreneurs and businesses, and 
therefore, for the economy in general.  The international bureaucratic mind runs wild thinking up 
all of the possible ways that chemicals, normally used in quite legitimate and beneficial ways, 
could be turned to perverse ends.  Hence, private, law-abiding industries right here in New York 
will become subject to regulations, paperwork, and inspections from an international agency 
headquartered in the Hague, Netherlands.  Indeed, this would be the first time that U.S. private 
industry confronts foreign inspections.<p>
However, chemical companies are not the only kinds of businesses exposed to the CWC. 
 Enterprises in the food, pharmaceutical, electronics, paint, petroleum, biotech, textiles, 
fertilizers, brewing, distilling, and other industries could be subject to CWC regulations.  
According to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, more than 7,700 facilities in the U.S. are 
likely or possibly subject to the CWC.  In New York, the number stands at 560 facilities -- fourth 
highest among the states.<p>
New York businesses have long suffered from being beaten and battered by often 
senseless federal, state, and local regulations and taxes.  Adding new international regulatory 
burdens with a treaty that certainly does not serve, and may actually undermine national security, 
verges on madness.<p>
Make no mistake, the CWC creates formidable costs.  Time requirements to fill out the 
necessary paperwork on an annual basis range from an estimated 2.5 hours to 9.0 hours per 
chemical depending upon its classification, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.  
Fines for non-compliance range up to $50,000 per incident.  Inspections will cost firms $10,000 
to $50,000 per visit.<p>
Naturally, all these costs weigh far more heavily on smaller businesses.  Small enterprises 
don't possess the requisite experience and resources to deal with increased regulatory burdens.  
Small, entrepreneurial firms, though, drive economic growth and job creation.  As we've long 
seen in New York, as entrepreneurs suffer, so does the economy.<p>
However, no matter how big or small, every business subject to CWC inspections will be 
exposed to the threat of international industrial espionage.  Opportunities to steal U.S. trade 
secrets will be numerous.  <p>
The CWC is a lose-lose treaty.  Costs run high, with absolutely no benefits in the end.  
The only way to prevent the danger of chemical weapons is to show those who might use them 
that the price for such atrocities will be quite dear.  <p>
Thirty-four Senate votes against ratification will kill the deeply flawed CWC, and salvage 
a bit of common sense in Congress.  Sixty-seven votes for the CWC and political symbolism 
wins out over substance once again.  <p>
Senators Moynihan and D'Amato, are you paying attention?<p>

<center><h3>A Doleful Campaign</h3><p>

<i>by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating</i></center>
<hr>
     In the movie Amadeus, there is a scene which about sums up Bob Dole and his campaign for 
president.  After a performance of his opera, mediocre court composer Antonio Salieri 
approaches his colleague Mozart for his thoughts on the work.  Clearly unimpressed, Mozart 
cleverly replies, "What can one say when one hears such music, but . . . `Salieri'!"<p>
     What can one say when one sees such political strategy, but "Bob Dole," the Antonio Salieri 
of the Republican Party.<p>
     Dole's selection of Susan Molinari to be keynote speaker at the Republican convention is 
typical.  Trailing Bill Clinton by double digits among women voters (the "gender gap"), Dole 
attempts to prop up his sagging campaign with "image" rather than substance and selects what 
New York GOP boss Bill Powers would call "a skirt" -- a pro-choice woman.<p>
     Susan Molinari is a loyal Republican. She's not even much of a maverick on the abortion 
issue. Pat Buchanan likes her.  But can she give a rousing keynote address, a "stemwinder" as 
they say?<p>
     No doubt a woman attacking libidinous Bill Clinton at the convention will be dramatic.  But 
as an establishment Republican, Molinari will do little to solve Dole's problems with his key 
southern and western conservative base.<p>
     Even Molinari's influence with New York Republicans (her husband is Buffalo congressman 
Bill Paxon, her father former Staten Island borough president Guy Molinari) is meaningless.  Al 
D'Amato's GOP will not deliver New York for Dole. <p>
     D'Amato, meanwhile, is flailing about trying to revitalize his friend's anemic presidential bid. 
 D'Amato's criticisms of Dole -- that Dole is distracted by peripheral issues like tobacco and 
tolerance on abortion -- were conventional wisdom.  However, the media coverage D'Amato 
received shows just how desperate writers are for any kind of a story about the Dole campaign.<p>
     D'Amato's attack was not, as many suggest, an attempt to raise his poll numbers for the 
Senate race in 1998.  And while Ray Kerrison is right that D'Amato's criticisms of Dole are 
hypocritical after he blasted Herb London for disloyalty to George Pataki during the 1994 
gubernatorial race, D'Amato is not a "turn coat" just yet.  The Senator's remarks were simply a 
calculated move to make it appear that Dole can learn from his mistakes.  Given Dole's record, 
that's unlikely.<p>
     We will be surprised if Dole's tax-cut plan, to be announced soon, is anything but tepid.  The 
former Senate Majority Leader is stuck between a rock and a hard place.  He desperately needs to 
differentiate himself from Bill Clinton, while on the other hand, Clinton will attack a serious 
Dole tax-cut plan as disingenuous given Dole's long track record of tax hikes.  While this may 
frustrate the GOP rank-and-file, this is exactly what they voted for in the primaries.
Dole's chances -- growing slimmer every day -- lie with proposing a serious pro-growth 
tax plan, selecting a true conservative running mate in order to energize party faithful, and pray 
that scandal news will continue to emanate from the Clinton White House.  Otherwise, he's dead 
in the water.<p>
     Indeed, Republicans should consider dumping Dole at the convention.  One scenario is that 
before Dole gets to San Diego, he announces he'll pick a pro-choice VP, or he badmouths the 
California Civil Rights Initiative aimed at ending racial quotas.  This sends conservatives over 
the edge, and an open convention drafts a pro-life, supply-side conservative like Jack Kemp, 
former congressman from Buffalo.  The gender gap evaporates as the new candidate is forceful 
and sincere about his economic message.  (P.S. If Dole loses, look for establishment types to 
blame the pro-life position, instead of their own milquetoast economic message.)<p>
     Given Dole will lose New York, it's never too late to start thinking about protest votes.  If you 
want to vote for an egocentric crackpot, there's Ross Perot.  Or, you might vote for Libertarian 
candidate Harry Browne.  Libertarians have seen gains recently because their free-market 
philosophy is more sincere than the Republicans.  But there is an unsettling question about 
whether Browne believes in laws against murder!  Stay low and God help us if he actually won.<p>
     A more rational alternative is to write-in a principled, pro-life, economic conservative.  You 
know, somebody the Republican establishment thinks would lose.<p>

<P><br><b>
Addressing the Health Care "Crisis": Markets vs. Regulation
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating	
<p>
<i>July 1, 1996</i>
<p><br>
<hr width="85%">

<blockquote>
We're all at least somewhat familiar with the demise of "Clinton-care."  Upon entering the White House, President and Mrs. Clinton quickly got to work manufacturing a health-care "crisis" in America.  And on that basis, the Clintons tried to seize government control over the health-care industry -- about 14 percent of the U.S. economy.  Their efforts failed as Americans realized that for all of its problems, we still have the best health-care system in the world.  Greater government controls only would have increased health-care costs -- both in terms of more dollars and rationed care.	New York serves as the perfect example.  The health insurance market is heavily regulated in the Empire State.  A 1993 community rating law (a one-size-fits-all government price control), for example, sent costs skyrocketing, pricing some 500,000 individuals out of the health insurance market.  
	Now a Republican-led Congress is moving forward on health-care reform using the failures of both Clinton-care and New York as models, but on a smaller scale.  Led by Senators Ted Kennedy, Democrat from neighboring Massachusetts, and Nancy Kassebaum, Republican from Kansas, health-care reform measures have passed both Houses of Congress with the differences now being hammered out quite publicly.  
	Problem number one is that the Kennedy-Kassebaum plan includes a guaranteed issue requirement.  Guaranteed issue requires insurance companies to supply health insurance to all individuals, with little regard to their medical history or current disposition.  As with most government intrusions into the marketplace, it sounds great at first blush.  However, a moment of reflection reveals that under such a plan individuals possess every incentive to avoid paying for health insurance until the last possible moment -- hiking costs for all insured consumers.  Where tried at the state level -- like in New York -- guaranteed-issue has boosted costs as well as the number of uninsured.	The Senate version of this reform effort also includes an amendment requiring that mental health be placed on par with physical health in insurance plans.  The mental health industry lobbied hard for this amendment.  Not able to keep costs under control, mental health providers want government to force consumption of their services.  
<P>
	The results from such a mandate are quite predictable, including higher costs.  Indeed, premiums are expected to increase between 4% and 12% and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates total direct costs to the employer-based insurance market at $11.6 billion.  Also, the loss of employer-provided health coverage stands as a real threat, with CBO placing the number of Americans likely to lose employer-sponsored health insurance at 800,000.  Other effects include reduced choices in terms of health plans, as well as lost benefits and wages to pay for the additional costs.  	This mental-health mandate is a response to another manufactured crisis.  Right now, 99 percent of employer-based health plans provide some mental health coverage.  So-called "parity" does not exist because mental health is a rather vague notion, offering clear opportunities for abuse, is less easily damaged, and can be very expensive to treat.	The mental-health parity mandate applies to state and local governments -- hiking costs for already overburdened New York taxpayers -- but excludes the federal government's Medicaid and Medicare programs.  The Senators did not want to deal with rising costs in their own programs.	
<P>
One saving grace exists in this current health-care reform effort.  The House version includes a tax-free medical savings account (MSA) provision.  MSAs address the true problems of portability and skyrocketing costs in health care.  The MSA option combines a savings account for health-care expenses and a catastrophic insurance plan.  The employer deposits funds in the employee's MSA each year and whatever is not spent, the employee keeps, but if expenses are higher, catastrophic insurance kicks in.	Everyone benefits under the MSA plan.  Experience at more than 3,000 companies across the U.S. that currently use MSAs (even without federal tax benefits) shows that choices increase and costs decline.  Individuals with both few and many health-care needs have voiced satisfaction.  And as for portability, it's the individual's MSA -- if you move jobs, your MSA moves with you.	
<P>
Broadening the use of MSAs by extending the same tax benefits currently enjoyed only by traditional employer-provided health plans will reduce costs throughout the health-care system.  The main impetus to rising costs in health care are third-party payments.  When either the government or an employer-provided health plan foots the bill, the consumer and supplier of health care services need not concern themselves with costs.  We're all familiar with the doctor giving sample medication to people without insurance, while he writes a prescription for $75 when some big insurance company or the government is paying.  Without the traditional buyer-seller relationship, costs naturally increase.  
<P>
	Congress should let Kennedy-Kassebaum die in conference, and instead, pass a clean MSA bill.  In the meantime, our New York officials should show some leadership and pass tax-free MSAs for New York.  Market choices must replace government micro-management of health care.

New York in the Revolution
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating	
<p>
<i>June 24, 1996</i>

<blockquote>
Next week we will mark the 220th year of our nation's independence.  Many New Yorkers will celebrate with familiar rituals: barbecues and beach-going, and a little rebellion against government paternalism with delightful fireworks.	Yet, like so many other patriotic holidays, the Fourth of July has lost much of its meaning.  New York State residents seem blithely unaware of the Empire State's role in the war for independence.  Nor do they realize that as "free" Americans they are now taxed and regulated by government far beyond the levels that drove the colonists to war against the mother country.	Several violations of individual liberty were critical to stirring the colonists' desire for independence. First were the white pine laws of the early 1700s. The British, who wanted the trees for ship-building, declared all pines, even on private land, the property of the crown. Soldiers burned down the homes of colonists who resisted the law.	In the interest of raising revenue for its ventures and thereby violating its limited relationship with the colonies, the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765.  
<P>
The high tax, denoted by the presence of an official stamp on all news journals, legal documents, and official papers, brought the first cries for independence in an editorial in the New York Gazette.  New Yorkers threatened to destroy the stores of those merchants authorized to collect for the Crown. The Stamp Act Congress met in New York City from October 7 to 25, 1765, and when the first stamps arrived in New York harbor on October 23, riots broke out. Pamphleteers called for boycotts of British goods. A frightened imperial governor even dumped the responsibility for the stamps on the mayor of New York.  Needless to say, the act failed.	Later, in 1773, the British government attempted to control trade in tea. The Boston Tea Party soon followed. New Yorkers, learning from Paul Revere about events in Boston, boarded the merchant ship London and dumped its tea into the East River.  The British responded with "The Intolerable Acts" which suspended Boston's government.  New Yorkers worried that the British could easily suspend their government too, and so called for the first Continental Congress.	
<P>
Militarily speaking, about one-third of all battles in the Revolutionary War were fought in New York State.  Downstate, in the crucial struggle for New York City's harbor, came the Battle of Long Island -- fought in Brooklyn Heights and its outskirts. While it was a disaster for Washington and his men, British General Howe allowed Washington to slip past him to Manhattan Island, and then chased Washington north, eventually all the way to Peekskill, before Washington turned south and escaped to New Jersey.  During this time, Nathan Hale was captured as a spy and executed on the corner of Third and Sixty-Sixth in Manhattan.  New York City would remain in British hands until the end of the war.	
<P>
The other, more successful rebel campaign came upstate, in the years 1777-79, as three different British forces from Canada and New York City attempted to unite around Albany.  They sought to cut off New England from the rest of the colonies.  British general St. Leger, however, was routed on his way down through the Mohawk Valley region.  British General Burgoyne, though, defeating the rebels easily on his way south, was stymied by trees cut down to block the passage of his equipment. Left running out of food and subject to guerrilla attacks, he surrendered at Saratoga, an event which persuaded the French to enter the war on the American side.  In New York City, General Howe left his underling Sir Henry Clinton to both guard New York and meet Burgoyne in the Hudson Valley. Clinton, somewhat successful, came close to catching rebel New Yorkers forming the first state legislature in Kingston, in September 1777, before he was forced to retreat to New York City.	Rebel strength in New York led to the eventual defeat and surrender of Cornwallis, and the British at Yorktown on October 19, 1781.  General Washington proudly entered a liberated New York City in November 25, 1783.  It would eventually become the nation's first capital.  And on April 30, 1789, on the balcony of Federal Hall at Broad and Wall Streets, Washington was inaugurated the nation's first president.  
<P>
	 As historian David Ellis wrote, "No other state suffered more for the cause of independence than did New York. Its frontiers blazed constantly in guerrilla warfare. Armies marched and countermarched through its principal river valleys, strewing death and destruction behind them."  So as you relax and enjoy the beauty of firework displays, recall the sacrifices that took place right under your feet, by the men who desired freedom from tyrannical government.

State Budget Politics: Republican vs. Republican
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating	
<p>
<i>June 17, 1996</i>
<p><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
</center>
<blockquote>
Since coming aboard as New York State budget director in January 1995, Patricia Woodworth has been assailed by Democrats; public-employee unions and other special interests; State Senate Republicans; and some colleagues in the Pataki administration. Obviously she's doing something right.	An experienced and highly competent public servant, before coming to work for Governor Pataki, Patricia Woodworth helped bring fiscal sanity to the state budgets of Governor John Engler in Michigan and Robert Martinez in Florida.  Some tout her as a future budget director for a Republican White House. 	
<P>
Woodworth does not have to be in Albany, she doesn't need this particular job.  We're lucky to have her.  Still, many of our fine New York politicians criticize her as not knowing enough about New York's budget process.  Translation: Woodworth possesses no interest in the seedy, deal-making aspects of the State budget process, and, unlike many of her Republican colleagues, she is deadly serious about cutting the budget.	An assault on Woodworth by Democrats is to be expected. Democrats are at least principled in believing special-interest politics and bigger government are good things. However, State Senate Republicans, who talk about cutting government and taxes, and unleashing the private sector, exhibit little real interest in seeing that happen.  
<P>
They are hypocrites. And now, when the voters expect them to finally come through, they're turning against one of their own, and each other, much to the delight of the Democrats.	The Republican smear campaign against Patricia Woodworth is another instance of GOP pettiness and misogyny, along with the campaign against Betsy McCaughey Ross.  Our sources in Albany report wide acclaim for Woodworth as smart and savvy, who works extremely well with her staff of 350, and who, contrary to the whispers, is intensely loyal to the Governor.  She also has brought improvements to the state budget, which is far more readable now then ever before.  But, as one source told us, "When your the smartest kid in the class, people resent you."	State Republicans have run the state GOP for years like a private men's club.  Everybody is supposed to shut up and do what they're told.  When a woman who speaks her mind and sticks to her guns comes along, the cowards show their real colors and grumble to the media about  bitchy or flighty women.  	
<P>
State Senate cowards, who in this election year haven't the courage to stand up to the unions and other special interests that are strangling New  York taxpayers, also fail to stand up to Woodworth's boss George Pataki either.  So they attack an underling.  Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno sends out a press release calling for "restoration" of $1.2 billion to this years budget, while taking a swipe at the budget director.  His justification for the spending like: Well, it's less than last year's $1.5 billion.  And to think George Pataki dumped Ralph Marino for this guy.	Pataki has stayed above the fray and often seems remarkably dispassionate about a budget process that careens out of control.  But we won't pass final judgement on the Governor's budget performance until everything is finished.  While many pundits criticize the state for chronically late budgets, we're more concerned with the final product.  In the past, Senate Republicans forced late budgets by wrestling with Democrats as to how pork should be doled out.  Thus far, in the Pataki era, budget debates have been more substantive -- about tax cuts and real spending restraint. 
<p> 
If Pataki does not get a budget until July, but gains most of what he wants in terms of spending restraint and program reforms, he'll deserve high marks.  However, if he gets nothing out the current delay, then the Governor will deserve criticism.	In Michigan, Patricia Woodworth saw first-hand that standing by your principles and advancing a budget agenda of less spending and lower taxes is a political winner.  Michigan's John Engler withstood the assault from special interests, carried through with his ideas, and now is wildly popular.  Indeed, Engler may become Bob Dole's running mate for this coming November.	Confronted by big-spending Assembly Democrats and wet-fingered Senate Republicans, Pataki would be wise to give serious weight to the advice he receives from his budget director, while offering her more public support as well.

Recommended Reading for a New York Summer
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating	
<p>
<i>June 10, 1996</i>

<blockquote>
Summer is not only the season for barbecues, the beach, and golf; it remains ideal for reading a good book while sipping a cool drink.  We offer a few suggestions -- books both old and new -- generally in agreement with our conservative views.	First, we offer titles covering national issues.
<P>
<i>Why Government Doesn't Work</i> by Harry Browne (St. Martin's):  An eminently reasonable and readable book just out from the Libertarian candidate for president, explaining how government in the United States went from consuming 3 percent of every American's income in 1900, to 57 percent today (and growing!).
<P>
<i>The Seven Fat Years: And How To Do It Again</i> by Robert L. Bartley (Free Press):  Despite contrary declarations from establishment economists, the Clinton Administration, and much of the media, the U.S. economy is slogging along at an anemic rate of growth.  Bartley not only reveals the policies that lead to robust economic growth and real opportunity, but manages to turn economics into an interesting read.
<P>
<i>Lost Rights</i> by James Bovard (St. Martin's)  Bovard shocks the reader with case after case of law-abiding Americans killed, injured, left unemployed, or without property through the arrogance of our federal government. Keep the Rolaids handy when you read this one. 
<P>
<i>Atlas Shrugged</i> by Ayn Rand (Signet):  This is simply a great work of fiction.  Everyone we know who has read this book says the same thing about it; "It's happening now!"  Rand's huge novel about a mid-20th century America gone mad for economic "fairness" is chilling in its similarities to current events and attitudes among Americans. One overlong, didactic speech (about 50 pages) toward the end tires the reader, but otherwise this is a life-changing read.
<P>
<i>A Good Walk Spoiled</i> by John Feinstein (Little Brown):  This book has nothing to do with politics or economics, it is just a wonderful account of life on the PGA Tour.	Of course, several tomes addressing New York are well worth reading while relaxing in the shade.
<P>
<i>The Rockefellers</i> by Peter Collier and David Horowitz (Holt):  This book has been out of print, so check your library or track it down at a used book store.  A fascinating account of the family that gave us Nelson Rockefeller -- who as governor did more damage to the economy of New York than any other individual in history.
<P>
<i>Senator Pothole</i> by Leonard Lurie (Birch Lane):  Chronicles the rise to power, through Nassau County's sleazy Republican machine, of New York's junior Senator, Al D'Amato.  A bit heavy on detail, but otherwise a clear assessment of everything that is wrong with government serving the interests of the political clubhouse.  
<P>
<i>The Unmaking of a Mayor</i> by William F. Buckley, Jr. (Viking Press): Another out-of-print book worth tracking down.  A fascinating, depressing, and often hilarious account of William F. Buckley Jr.'s run for mayor of New York City in 1965, which effectively put an end to golden-boy liberal Republican John Lindsey's aspirations for higher office.  Nothing has changed in New York City, as this book shows.
<P>
<i>The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York</i> by Robert Caro (Vintage Books):  A Pulitzer-Prize winner detailing the politics of New York State and City -- a fascinating account of arrogance, power, and government run amok.
<P>
<i>The House of Morgan</i> by Ron Chernow (Atlantic Monthly Press):  A fine read about the history of one of New York's great banking houses.  Chernow exhibits an understanding of history, politics and economics, and writes well -- a rare combination. 
<i>Plunkitt of Tammany Hall</i> by William I. Riordan (Dutton): This requires another trip to the library for a classic on the men who wrote the book on New York political corruption.
<P>
<i>The Encyclopedia of New York City</i> edited by Kenneth Jackson (Yale University):  This weighty, oversized, 1,350-page encyclopedia is not easily dragged to the beach, but it should sit at the side of your favorite armchair to be thumbed through during the summer months.  Almost everything you ever wanted to know -- or haven't even thought of -- about New York City is included.  We simply consider it invaluable.	
<P>
Finally, when additional breaks from public policy are in order, we turn to baseball.  As the Yankees compete for the pennant, we recommend another oversized tome -- <i>The Yankee Encyclopedia</i> by Mark Gallagher (Sagamore Publishing).  Stats, player biographies, history of the Stadium, season summaries -- it's all there for an informative summer about the most storied franchise of our national pastime.

<P><br><b>
New York's Opportunity Dearth
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating	
<p>
<i>June 3, 1996</i>
<P><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br></center>
<blockquote>
The months of May and June overflow with college and high school graduation ceremonies.  Graduates, flush with optimism, look forward to new opportunities and launching careers.  Unfortunately, due to a dearth of opportunity in New York, many graduates are forced to seek their fortunes elsewhere.
<P>
	A look at the numbers confirms this bleak assessment.  Employment data from the state's Department of Labor for the years 1958 through 1995 (longest period they could supply) is quite depressing -- especially when compared with national figures. From 1959 to 1995, the U.S. annual rate of private-sector job creation topped New York's in all but three years. U.S. private-sector employment expanded by 106 percent between 1958 and 1995, while New York's grew by less than 25 percent. More recently, between 1989 and 1995, New York employment in the private sector fell by 4.6 percent versus U.S. growth of 6 percent.  Over the past year (March 1995 to March 1996), U.S. private-sector employment increased at a 60 percent faster rate than New York's. In 1995, a smaller percentage of New York State's eligible workforce participated in the labor market (60.9 percent) than the national average (66.6 percent), and a smaller share were employed in the once-Empire State -- 57 percent versus 62.9 percent for the entire nation.	New York City, once the state's economic energizer, has hung like an albatross around the neck of the New York State economy for at least the past four decades.  Incredibly, New York City's total level of private-sector employment in 1995 was almost 10 percent lower than in 1958.  From the city's employment peak in 1969, private-sector employment was down by more than 14 percent last year.  	
<P>
The cause of New York's jobs dearth is no mystery.  It results directly from a dearth in entrepreneurship.  After all, in any economy, small, entrepreneurial enterprises create the bulk of new jobs.  The formation of new firms and new business incorporations in New York -- two measures of entrepreneurial activity -- lag well behind the nation as a whole.
	From their respective 1987 and 1988 highs, new firms in New York were down by almost 12 percent in 1993 and new business incorporations off by 9 percent.  At the same time, new firms and new business incorporations across the nation reached record highs in 1993.  As for New York City, fewer small businesses called it home in the early 1990s than did in 1969.	Why are entrepreneurs verging on extinction in New York?  Quite simply, the answer is big government.  High taxes and onerous regulations have chased away investors and entrepreneurs.	A new report by one-half of Carolan & Keating (i.e., by Keating) published by the Small Business Survival Foundation ranks the 50 states and the District of Columbia according to the environment for entrepreneurship.  The Small Business Survival Index combines nine key government-related costs -- the personal income tax, capital gains tax, corporate income tax, property taxes, sales taxes, unemployment taxes, workers' compensation costs, estate taxes, and the crime rate -- into one comparative measure.  New York State ranks a dismal 46th out of 51.  
<P>
When added into the mix, New York City replaced the lowly District of Columbia as worst in the nation -- by far -- for economic risk taking.	Unfortunately, few, if any, of New York's elected officials realize how heavily government weighs on the economy.  Governor George Pataki deserves some credit for cutting income taxes and restraining the growth in state spending, but so much more needs to be done and we seriously question if he has the courage to do it.  As we've said before, State Senate Republicans simply blow with political winds -- last year fighting for tax cuts and spending restraint and this year crying out for higher state expenditures.  State Assembly Democrats stand as the major roadblock to pro-growth tax reduction, deregulation, and government downsizing.  At the local level, Republicans, Democrats, and school boards across the state seem content to continue hiking expenditures and taxes.	Most tragically, perhaps, New York City promises to continue as an economic basket case for the foreseeable future.  Mayor Giuliani apparently possesses little understanding of the true source of the city's woes.  He is willing to dole out more than $1.1 billion in corporate welfare for new ballparks for the Yankees and Mets, but has reneged on his promise to allow the city's personal income tax surcharge to expire at the end of this year.  The city's top personal income tax rate was scheduled to drop from 4.46 percent to 3.91 percent -- a small, but necessary first step to recovery.  Instead, Giuliani proposes a four-year extension of the surcharge.
<P>
	Of course, such an extension requires state legislative approval.  If state officials truly want to help New York City, they would forget about Giuliani's extension and allow the surcharge to expire.	Until taxes and government are cut deeply in New York, entrepreneurs and investors will continue to flee the state and many graduates will follow.

<blockquote>
As we discussed in our last column, today's "preservationist" environmentalism has wrought untold damage to our legal rights.  Through vague laws, arbitrary prosecutions, the regulation of private land in ways that destroy its value, and the use of tax money to buy land for no human use, preservationists have sought to impose their vision of "the public good" on America.	
<P>
Consider the recent Clinton Administration plan for federal "ecosystem management."  Preservationist Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt is pushing for a National Biological Survey to map and therefore "manage" every "ecosystem" in the United States. Once "discovered," these systems become the foundation for all future federal legislation.
<p>	
What's an ecosystem?  Well, that's a problem.  Babbitt observed in a 1993 congressional hearing that "...to some degree, an ecosystem is in the eye of the beholder." 	 As Alan Fitzsimmons, a Virginia-based environmental consultant, puts it, ecosystems are "mental constructs," simplifying tools of scientific research.  They are, Fitzsimmons notes, "arbitrary" "imprecise" and "variable over time."  Any portion of land can be simultaneously in hundreds of different ecosystems, because scientists define them as they go along. There is no scientific consensus on objective ecosystems.	One might think it curious that the federal government would want to make law based on something so shifting and arbitrary.  Not if it supports preservationist land grabs. If ecosystems are to be managed, the private land they invariably run over must be "managed" as well.	
<P>
New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation, working closely with the Nature Conservancy, has similar mapping plans. They want to move as much private land use regulation away from localities as possible.	Such "global thinking" has lead to a plethora of big government agencies working with special interests to "protect" their "ecosystems" and other artificial mental constructs. A few of New York's many examples:<br>	--The International Joint Commission (IJC) oversees the Great Lakes "ecosystem," touching on northwestern New York.  At the behest of Greenpeace, the IJC recommended "sunsetting" (i.e., eliminating) all use of chlorine-based chemicals.  
<P>
Respected scientists like Nobel laureate Mario Molina and toxicologist Steven Safe have described this as sheer lunacy.  As the American Council on Science and Health protests, chlorine is mankind's only effective source of cholera prevention, and is essential to the cheap production of cancer fighting drugs, vitamins, and even pipes that reduce water pollution.  Short-sighted environmentalists ignore the costs in human lives such a policy would bring.  Though concern for human life usually sits rather low on the preservationist agenda.  
<P>
And, not surprisingly, the Clinton Administration has accepted the chlorine proposal and is studying its implementation.	--There's also the recent attempt to make the entire Catskill region, including the cities of Plattsburgh and Glens Falls, a United Nations regulated "biosphere."  (We're not making this stuff up.)	--The Northern Forest Lands Project was initiated by Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and supported by the Sierra Club, National Audubon, etc. This alleged "ecosystem" runs 26,000,000 acres, across about 40 percent of the combined land mass of New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine.  Problem is, it's not a continuous "forest."  There are all kinds of farms in between and the land is naturally heterogeneous, but why let the facts stop you from regulating an ecosystem?
	
The real danger of preservationism is its socialist premises.  You don't own your property, the "concerned" take care of it for "everyone."  Preservationists have been quite busy undermining private property, the Founding Fathers' most sacred weapon against tyranny, enshrined in the Bill of Rights.	Of course, New York State features several of the country's leading authorities on the law of "public trust," which means some things are just so important, like "ecosystems," that the government must protect them even without compensating the property owner.  Some of these advocates reside at the Government Law Center of Albany Law School and Pace University Law School (home of darling boy of the New York media, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.).	
<P>
Public trust advocates admit it is a very vague idea. As Patty Salkin of the Government Law Center wrote last December, "An exact definition of a public resource is difficult to articulate."  But, as Robert Reis of the University of Buffalo Law School wrote, as public trust doctrine grows, "correlative private rights . . . would be precluded or significantly diminished."	If you are as bothered by all this as we are, you may wish to contact the Property Rights Foundation of America in Stony Creek, NY (518-696-5748).  Their research and publications will help you through this legal swamp (or is it a legal "wetland" these days?).  Remember Thomas Jefferson's words: "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."

Polluted by Environmentalism(First in a two-part series.)

<blockquote>
The Founding Fathers believed civil order could not stand without a secure right to property. The Bill of Rights forbids government from taking property, even for "the public good," without fair compensation for the owner.	This latter protection, derived from English Law, introduces today's self-anointed environmental do-gooder to the cold facts of economic life.  That is, unless he finds some way around the law -- as environmentalists across America and here in New York regularly do.	Some years ago, groups like the National Audubon Society respected private property by practicing "conservationism."  Hunters, fishermen, and bird lovers would pay to protect natural things, buying farms and forests, rare birds, etc.	But later, especially following Earth Day 1970, came "preservationism," a theory which sees nature as better left alone by man (preserved).  A quasi-religious philosophy, preservationism wants wild, dehumanized nature to be promoted by government.	
<P>
Today, preservationists are using taxpayer money to achieve their dreams.  Billions have been spent to buy land for no human use.  (In 1992, the State Department of Environmental Conservation spent $40,000,000 to buy one plot of Long Island property, at a cost of $117,000 an acre!)	Where property owners stand in the way, as in the Adirondacks, government agencies engage in "regulatory takings," allowing the property owner to keep the title, but restricting use in such a way as to destroy its value.	One Supreme Court decision illustrates this precarious situation: In South Carolina, David Lucas took a million dollar mortgage to buy waterfront land where he hoped to build two homes. The state passed a law denying his ability to build, in the name of protecting the view, preserving a "habitat," etc.  Lucas' land plummeted in value.  
<P>
Eventually the Supreme Court ruled he had to be compensated, but only because he lost 100 percent of the land's value.  If he lost less, the state would not have to compensate him, gaining a "public good" at the expense of the property owner!	In New York, the Department of Environmental Conservation has a list of land it wants to acquire or control.  The mere presence of a lot of property on that list can cause it to depreciate in value, as its use might be restricted.  Who compensates the homeowner?  Nobody.  When state government bodies, like the Adirondack Park Agency, make rulings about the use of property, who absorbs the cost?  The property owner.	
<P>
According to the Property Rights Foundation of America, based in Stony Creek, New York, approximately 64% of all New York State land is under or at serious risk of falling under preservationist control through either government ownership (bought with taxpayer dollars) or regulation.  And federal, state and local governments plan more acquisitions, in the Adirondacks, the Hudson Valley, the Finger Lakes, the Long Island Pine Barrens, etc.
	Equating preservationism with the "public interest" leads to conflicts of interest. For example, the head of one state zoning agency, the Hudson River Greenway Council, has legally received his salary directly from environmental special interests. Such behavior is illegal for almost any other public official.	Preservationism leads to bad legislation. Though the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, etc. sound impressive, they place vague and even contradictory goals into the law. Determination of what it means to preserve "biodiversity," "ecosystems," and "wetlands" has been turned over to unelected, unsupervised bureaucrats, leading to what Timothy Lynch, constitutional scholar at the CATO Institute, calls a "regulatory police state."	
<P>
Technical violations of federal law become impossible to avoid.  Prosecutions with political motives -- like appearing to be "tough on polluters" -- are skyrocketing.  Activist judges hold preservation so important they rule the federal government may prosecute someone who has neither intended to commit the crime (mens rea) or actually physically committed the crime (actus reus).  One man who simply removed tires from a dump was sentenced to three years in prison, and a $202,000 fine for altering a "wetland."	Then there's "bounty hunting," where environmental lawyers scrutinize paperwork for technical violations, then forcing businesses to pay settlements in the form of "contributions" to environmental groups.  You won't see that in the Sierra Club fundraising letters!	Assemblyman Richard Brodsky of Westchester, no friend of private property, has introduced legislation that would allow bounty hunting at the state level.  The Governor supports it!  What would the Conservative Party think, given their Contract with New York calls for controls on the environmentalists?

Government's Magic Wand

<blockquote>
	Politicians rarely make good economists.  In particular, we've come to expect rather sloppy economic thinking from Democrats over the years.   However, in New York, Republicans often are just as stupid as Democrats when it comes to the economy. Democrats and Republicans at the federal, state, city, and local levels across New York have raised taxes, increased regulatory burdens, and expanded the size of government, all in apparent blissful ignorance of the economic damage they inflict.  Now, members of both parties are clamoring to boost the minimum wage.  	
<P>
The minimum wage serves as one of those "compassion" issues politicians love to bandy about periodically.  With a wave of its magic wand, government simply declares that the minimum wage should be increased by 90 cents from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour -- President Clinton's current proposal -- and the poor will derive great benefits.  Of course, if the economy really worked that way, then why be such Scrooges?  Why not wave the magic wand of government compassion and increase the minimum wage to $10 per hour, or even $25 or $50 per hour? In reality, the minimum wage hurts those it purports to help, along with a host of small business owners as well.  Raising the price of teenage and low-skilled workers simply decreases the demand for them -- resulting in lost jobs.  Standard estimates of entry-level jobs lost due to a 90-cent minimum wage hike range from 130,000 to as many as 400,000.  And the U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimates that the current proposed increase in the minimum wage would boost direct costs for U.S. businesses by $12.5 billion over five years. 	For many workers, the minimum wage removes the first rung on the ladder of economic opportunity, with grim consequences.  
<p>
The habits, skills, and training that only come with employment are lost.  Welfare becomes a much more viable economic course as a result, with all of its foul effects for families and individuals.	Minimum wage supporters cry that the real value of the minimum wage has been eroded by inflation over the years, and the proposed increase merely seeks to recoup such losses.  Some advocate not only a hike in the minimum wage, but indexing the wage for inflation.  Sounds a lot like France, where the minimum wage rests at roughly $7.50 per hour, rising whenever inflation hits 2 percent.  Of course, France's unemployment rate runs at about twice the U.S. rate and job creation since at least 1980 essentially has been nonexistent. 	
<P>
At the state level, Democrats remain undeterred by the dismal economics of the minimum wage.  Their union supporters love minimum wage increases, utilizing such hikes to help argue for raises for their own members.  In mid-April, New York State Assembly Democrats voiced frustration with Republican foot-dragging in bringing the minimum wage hike to a vote in Washington, so they voted to increase the minimum wage in New York from $4.25 to $5.05.  	One might think that Republicans -- the party alleged to possess some understanding of markets -- would argue against minimum wage increases.  Not in New York.  Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno  recently declared his support for a minimum wage hike, but preferred the increase to occur at the federal level.  Bruno does not exactly shine as a profile in courage viewed from either side of this issue.  
<P>
	A clearer, but equally bad position emanates from various New York members of the U.S. House of Representatives.  A group of them served as original co-sponsors on a bill introduced on April 18 to raise the minimum wage by a dollar per hour -- even higher than President Clinton's proposal.  These New York Republicans favoring wage and price controls are Jack Quinn, Benjamin Gilman, Jim Walsh, Amo Houghton, Sherwood Boehlert, Rick Lazio, and Mike Forbes.  	
<P>
New York GOP party boss and U.S. Senator Al D'Amato quickly jumped on board the minimum wage bandwagon as well.  D'Amato is currently flailing around, grasping at any issue that might boost his sagging popularity.  (Perhaps the Senator will lash out at opponents of the minimum wage as economic ayatollahs?) With New York being such a prominent union state, these Republicans have thrown away sound economics in the hopes of political gain.  That is, pandering to big labor.  Such a strategy, of course, is laughable as unions will oppose these Republican re-election effort in New York with all of their power and resources.	In the meantime, other Republicans struggle for a plan to counter a minimum wage hike.  Here's our three-step solution, based on sound, pro-growth economics: 1) eliminate the minimum wage, opening up job opportunities for teenage, low-skilled workers, 2) cut income and payroll taxes so people can take home more of the money they earn, and 3) eliminate both federal and New York State capital gains taxes, boosting incentives for investing and entrepreneurship -- the true sources of economic growth and job creation.  It's the most compassionate thing to do.

Two Catholics and the Death Penalty 
<p></b>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating	
<p>
<i>May 6, 1996</i>
<P><br>
<hr width="85%">
<p><br>
<blockquote></center>
When George Pataki defeated Mario Cuomo in 1994, many saw the death penalty as a decisive issue in the race.  New Yorkers were worried about crime, and demanded tough measures. Cuomo vetoed death-penalty legislation 12 years in a row, claiming the penalty immoral and ineffective, and cited the teaching of his Church on the issue. Pataki, also a Catholic, stuck to the hard facts of crime and appeals to common sense.
<p>
	In a state with so many Catholic politicians and voters, appeals to Christian responsibility abound on this issue. Just this past week, Cuomo again cited the influence of his Church (and activist nun Sr. Camille D'Arienzo) and announced that he has signed a card indicating that should he be murdered, he does not want his killer to get the death penalty. (Of course, we all knew that already.)
<p>	
But then again, that's often the point for Mario Cuomo, who has made a career out of telling people all about his conscience; how it would not let him "impose his beliefs" concerning abortion, but it would let him impose his beliefs when redistributing people's income, or making them wear seat belts, or vetoing the death penalty. Now he would like to impose his conscience on New York from the grave.
<p>	
Personally, we prefer the Pataki approach to moral belief, refreshingly understated, and, at least on the death penalty, more in tune with his Church than many realize.	According to the Catholic Church's "Universal Catechism," which is meant to serve as a compendium of Catholic belief, the state has the right to punish evildoers, "not excluding, in cases of extreme gravity, the death penalty." (2266)  In the next section however, (2267), the Church calls for the use of "bloodless means" when "sufficient" to defend the public good.  The debate for Catholics then centers around who determines what punishment is "sufficient."	Catholic liberals have seized on section 2267, and a passing remark by Pope John Paul II in the encyclical letter "Evangelium Vitae" or "Gospel of Life," to argue that the Pope now teaches that the death penalty is always wrong. (A most curious position for a group of people who regularly deny the Pope's authority to pronounce on matters of abortion or artificial birth control.)
<p>
	Under Catholic doctrine, the Pope can only define entire classes of acts wrong for Catholics. Such acts are considered "intrinsically evil," independent of the circumstances.	But the Pope has made no such declaration about "all" acts of the death penalty.  He comes close, but leaves the door open, saying that public authorities "ought not go to the extreme of executing an offender except in cases of absolute necessity: in other words, when it would not be possible otherwise to defend society," adding his personal opinion about the state of present law enforcement: "such cases are very rare, if not practically non-existent."	While we have great respect for John Paul II, based on Catholic thought itself, the Pope, or any bishop, enjoys no more authority to judge the morality of a particular death-penalty case than your local auto mechanic.  Theirs is simply a prudential opinion, not an authoritative judgement for Catholics, and they have no idea how likely it is, in particular prisons, that killers serving life sentences, might kill, sodomize, or otherwise brutalize fellow inmates or guards.	In an interview following the death of Bronx police officer Kevin Gillespie, John Cardinal O'Connor reluctantly admitted as much. While urging mercy, he noted: "There is no question that the state has the right to exercise the death penalty if it judges it the only way to protect society."  The judgement, the Cardinal notes, belongs to the state.	But there is even more to the issue than "protecting society."  Too few clerics seem willing to acknowledge that the death penalty, like all punishment, is about justice -- what the criminal deserves for his crime.	Sacred Scripture, always authorative for the Christian, reminds us of this truth.  In Romans 1:28-32, Paul tells us of acts that "deserve death."  And Numbers 35:16 tells us that "the murderer shall be put to death."  Without the idea of just punishment, pious calls for "mercy" make no sense.
<p>	
The Christian tradition then, despite the protestations of some religious people, clearly asserts that murderers may receive justice (death), and that it is the state's business to dispense it, and maybe mercy as well.  In New York, that heavy responsibility falls on George Pataki, the courts, and the state legislature.	As Christians ourselves, we are content to accept this tradition.  In the end, unlike Mario Cuomo, we believe the death penalty exists to protect the living, not to prove the moral superiority of the dead.
