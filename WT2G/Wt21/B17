<p>
Every morning for seven years, Linda Desrosiers  packed her lunch before heading to work as a high-school cook. "I wouldn't touch the food they had us make," she says. "People looked at it and smelled it, but no one ate it."<p>
School janitors in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, an impoverished textile-mill town, confirm Desrosiers's stories of platefuls of grayish green beans and "beef surprise" winding up in the dumpster. One janitor said he changed the high school's industrial-sized garbage bags at least twice in each of the three lunch periods. <p>
In recent months, liberals led by President Clinton have argued that the federal school lunch program "ain't broke" and shouldn't be fixed. They argue, persuasively, that kids who are hungry won't learn. But they also make the false assumption that students actually eat the meals that the government subsidizes. Rhode Island is proving that students' nutrition levels can improve dramatically when subsidies for school meals are slashed.<p>
This academic year, the state of Rhode Island radically reformed its school-lunch program by dumping a quarter-century of centrally planned purchasing, hiring, and cooking. The state cut its $11-million school-lunch appropriation to less than $200,000 and fired all but 11 of the 780 workers who administered, cooked, and served the lunches. Now, private food-service contractors like Marriott and ARA Corp. plan the menus and feed the students. The school districts still get reimbursement from Washington, but the federal money is sent directly to the local districts on a per-meal basis. As a result, combined federal and state subsidies have fallen from more than $23 million in 1993-94 to $12 million—a 48 percent cut. <p>
The result: Kids are eating better. In the past seven months, student participation in school-lunch programs has soared, nutrition levels have risen to among the best in the nation, and poor school districts like Woonsocket are generating a profit.<p>
Brandon Powers, a sixth-grader at Woonsocket Elementary School, says the only downside of the privatized system is that it has put an end to daily "school-slop sculpture contests." "Now the food is pretty good," he says, "so people prefer to eat it rather than build with it." Even Desrosiers, now a cook for Marriott, eats it every day.<p>
Students at North Smithfield High School now eat their hamburgers instead of conducting experiments on the effects of mustard, catsup, and relish on burger flight. And students at a magnet high school in Providence no longer request extra gravy with their mashed potatoes just to provide greater contrast for finger-painting with their food. <p>
School officials back up students' claims that they are eating more. Since a private contractor took over Woonsocket High School's lunch program, janitors haul away 75 percent less garbage from the school cafeteria. Irene Scripsack, the business manager for the North Smithfield school district, says her janitors only collect 5 percent as much garbage as they used to. Scripsack won't say how often she ate the state's food, but admits it was "quite rare."<p>
"The state-run program suffered from what I call 'orange-ravioli syndrome,'" says John Caparco, the principal of Woonsocket High School. "Just providing food students should eat does not mean they'll eat it.  They were simply out to lunch when it came to making the food appealing." Caparco admits even he didn't eat the old food. "Now I get it all the time."<p>
Ellen McKenna, a junior dietetics major at the University of Rhode Island, demonstrated that plate waste was cut dramatically at schools that used private contractors. For instance, she found that most of the hot-food trays were "completely cleared of food" before they were emptied in the trash at Marriott's Potter-Burns Elementary School cafeteria in Pawtucket, where 32 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Likewise, at ARA's Central Falls Elementary School, where 89 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, students ate almost all of their carrots, breads, burritos, and sandwiches. <p>
At the state-run cafeteria at Lonsdale Elementary School in Lincoln, a wealthier community where the state-administered program had not yet been phased out, students were "picking at their food," rather than eating it. On the majority of the trays, most or all of the rice, bread, and fruit had been left uneaten. McKenna reports that students had difficulty identifying the food, and tended to push it around the tray rather than eat it. For instance, one student said he couldn't identify his ham-salad sandwich. McKenna described it as a "pink mush on a roll."<p>
After privatization, not only are students eating more of the meals on their trays, but more of the kids are buying meals.  In Woonsocket, for instance, where more than 77 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, participation has soared under Marriott's direction. During the 1991-92 school year, this "severe-need" district served 2,652 lunches a day. Now it averages 3,486 lunches daily—a 31 percent increase. Similarly, under the state-run system, Woonsocket only served 288 breakfasts daily; now it serves 597—a 107 percent increase.<p>
Woonsocket is the rule, not the exception. In Providence, where more than 70 percent of the students receive free or reduced-price meals, participation has increased 22 percent since a private vendor took over the cafeterias. And wealthy school districts, like North Smithfield, have recorded 25 percent more students eating school lunches since the state system folded.<p>
Between bites of a chicken-patty sandwich, Pauline Goin says she and her friends rarely bought lunch when the state ran the cafeteria, because the food was always a mystery—in both appearance and taste. "The other stuff was, you know, welfare food, and it tasted like it," the sixth-grader says bluntly. "This stuff is regular food—you know, for humans."<p>
Greater participation seems to improve discipline during the once-raucous lunch period. Woonsocket's Caparco says that the time his office spends handling discipline problems has been cut by about 20 percent. "If the kids are eating, it's harder to be fighting," Caparco notes.<p><b><center>Have It Your Way</b></center>
<p>
Ruth Eshelman, a nutrition professor at the University of Rhode Island, says that options are essential to students' satisfaction. "If I have a choice, I am much more likely to eat what I choose," Eshelman said. "If I have to eat carrots, they will be terrible, but if I pick carrots over green beans, the carrots might be wonderful."<p>
The state-run school lunch program offered no choice. Each week, newspapers across the state printed the upcoming menu with a total of five listings—the entire state had one option each school day. Private vendors, on the other hand, offer about 20 alternatives daily. Woonsocket High School students, for instance, can now choose from five meats, several cheeses, and two kinds of bread in the deli line. They can also pick from a list of three or four hot sandwiches, two salads, and a pasta dish. In addition, the menu offers pizza and burritos. Even if the student tires of these regular items, several specials are offered each day. Students also choose from a selection of fresh fruit and vegetables at every meal. And parents are sent a monthly menu describing each day's choices and their nutritional value.<p>
Private vendors also increase participation by using name brands: Pizza is supplied by a local Domino's franchise, and burritos are cooked according to a Taco Bell recipe. The name-brand packaging and advertising raise the likelihood that students will actually like the meal.<p>
Private vendors recognize that student involvement is vital to customer satisfaction. In Woonsocket and Providence, groups of students and parents meet monthly with Marriott's food-service directors. Dina Dutremble, Woonsocket's business manager, says the state never responded to local concerns; private contractors, on the other hand, conduct weekly taste-tests. <p>
Sandra Caron, a senior at Woonsocket High School who is a vegetarian, says that these meetings have allowed her to buy her lunch at school for the first time. After explaining to the food-service director that she and several other students would be willing to buy lunch if vegetarian entrées were more readily available, the company promised to look into it. "I suspected they would do what had always happened. Nothing ever happens," Caron says. "But within two weeks, there was a vegetarian item on the menu every day."<p>
Ellen Haas, a USDA official who supervises the school lunch program from Washington, doesn't trust the private sector. She insists that devolution to local districts, like Rhode Island's privatization initiative, will lead to "short-term malnutrition and a lifetime of serious and costly health problems." Her fears were echoed by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, who equated devolution to "a dagger pointed at the hearts of our children." But a careful review of nutritional data demonstrates that Rhode Island's new, private programs outperform its state-run lunches. Haas's office did not return several phone callls.<p>
Current USDA regulations require that school lunches provide at least a third of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of seven nutrients—ranging from vitamins A and C to iron and thiamin. Rhode Island's state-run school-lunch program, however, did not meet these minimums. Bethany Algier, a nutritionist with Rhode Island's Department of Health, notes that a 1991 nutritional audit of the school-lunch program found that  the state's program fell short in vitamin C and iron and did not meet the target for calories. Plus, this audit assumed implausibly that the students were eating everything on their trays. Although liberals can speak of the value of mandating nutrition levels, Rhode Island demonstrates that these mandates are not even enforced, and it is impossible to ensure the students will even eat the food.<p>
The private vendors, however, combat both these flaws by providing more nutritious meals that the students actually want to eat. According to the Department of Health's nutritional audit, Marriott's menus exceed the state's program by at least three-fold in each of the RDA's seven nutrient categories. In fact, the private-sector program provides students with more than double the RDA of vitamin C, protein, and vitamin A—600 percent of the federal minimum for school lunches.<p>
In addition to the RDA nutrients, the private vendors' meal plans have less fat, cholesterol, and sodium and more fiber than Rhode Island's state-run program. Over a 10-week period, the average Marriott lunch contained 33 percent less fat, 40 percent less cholesterol, and 40 percent less sodium than the state's lunches. Marriott's average lunch contained only half the saturated fat and twice the fiber of a government lunch.<p>
Desrosiers and other cafeteria workers don't find these numbers surprising. In the private kitchens, fruits and vegetables rarely come from the can, since the two leading companies, ARA and Marriott, can use their buying power to get price breaks on more nutritious fresh and fresh-frozen produce. In North Smithfield, the independent school-lunch program has promised parents that it will never deep-fry a single item it sells; it even uses low-fat mozzarella cheese on its pizza. This district's hamburger meat contains about 15 percent fat, while the state-run program never used beef with less than 30 percent fat.<p>
Most remarkable, however, is that private vendors don't just provide healthier meals that students will eat, they do it at a profit. Like discount book chains, Marriott and ARA make money selling a high-quality product cheaply by counting on high volume. The per-meal federal reimbursement formula gives the contractors an incentive to provide nutritious meals that kids will like, because the more meals they induce kids to buy, the greater their margins beyond fixed costs. So far, the strategy has paid off.<p>
The secret to making it all work is the plan's clever payment system. The complicated arrangement provides the private contractor with an incentive to feed more students and allows the school district to keep most of the profits. School districts pay the contractor an annual fee to run the program. This fee pays for everything from capital improvements to salaries and food. The school district then keeps all the money the students pay. In addition, the district keeps all of the per-meal subsidies Washington sends it. If these revenues fall short of the district's payment to the private contractor, the contractor assumes the loss. This way, the district can't lose money and the contractor has an incentive to keep costs down while serving more meals. If the district turns a profit, the contractor gets a small cut.<p>
Dutremble, the business manager for the Woonsocket School District, says that the school lunches were a daily headache under the state-run program. While the state provided all of the workers, menus, and food, her district had to pay for high-priced food-service equipment out of its local operating budget. These costs were often so high that some school districts could not afford "sneeze guards" in their serving lines.<p>
Under Marriott's direction, the program is self-sufficient and has already turned a $42,000 profit this year, most of which the district keeps. In Woonsocket, the money is being used to purchase a new $30,000 dishwasher and a truck to deliver meals more efficiently to the elementary schools. Providence's program will profit by more than $100,000 this year, and North Smithfield was $5,000 in the black as of January 1. <p>
In addition, fears that poor or small school districts would be ignored by private vendors are unfounded. In fact, poorer school districts—such as Woonsocket and Providence—are considered more desirable contracts for private vendors. These students are less likely to bring a lunch than their more affluent peers and therefore participation rates rise more dramatically when the food improves. Small school districts in Rhode Island joined together to negotiate joint competitive contracts. Lastly, the state limits the threat of corruption by putting the program out for bid frequently. Rhode Island prohibits  school-lunch contracts of more than a year, and limits the number of renewals.<p>
Rhode Island's experiment with privatized school lunches is the brainchild of a state legislator, Paul Crowley. A restaurant owner, Crowley was appalled to discover wages in state-run cafeterias were more than $4 per hour higher than at private restaurants, while nutrition levels were substandard. <p>
For years, Crowley's efforts to privatize the program were blocked by state-employee unions. Two years ago, however, Crowley found that the Providence school board had conducted a study showing that a private vendor would save the district more than $600,000 a year. School officials there said they abandoned plans to privatize their program under union pressure. Crowley said the unions even sent busloads of lunch workers to their meetings. After public hearings, Crowley amended the state's Fiscal Year 1995 budget to phase out the school-lunch program this school year. Under the new system, local school districts—rather than the state—are reimbursed directly from the federal government. As in all states, students pay some, all, or none of the lunch cost depending on their parent's income; Washington coughs up the rest.<p>
"We should be in the business of teaching, not feeding," Crowley says. "If other people make a better mousetrap, it makes more sense to buy theirs than build your own." <p>
Although school-district officials universally praise the private-sector lunch program, some are concerned about the GOP's block-grant proposal. Providence officials, for instance, expect the district-wide student body to increase by at least 800 kids next year, and fear that the block grant will not cover extra meals. But Crowley claims the program will still thrive under the block grant proposal. As a district's population increases, more students will buy meals. Since private contractors get paid on a per-meal basis, a larger student body would compensate for a reduction in per-student dollars.<p>
Rhode Island is evidence that converting federal funds to block grants can only improve the nation's school-lunch program. Given full responsibility for the programs, Crowley predicts more states will turn to innovative private alternatives that cost less and maintain higher standards.<p>
In fact, Crowley believes if school lunches had been devolved years ago, Rhode Island would have privatized sooner. "We have found that local districts are best off when they handle this on their own," Crowley said. "Blockgranting can only help us continue on this path."

<p>
Since the publication of "A Nation at Risk" in 1983, Americans have become increasingly alarmed about the dismal results and soaring costs of their public schools. No group of citizens has a closer view of these problems or a more immediate stake in addressing them than the parents of the country's 48 million schoolchildren. Here and there, parents have won minor battles to influence curricula or oust mediocre school-board members. But as individuals, parents are no match for the forces that favor the status quo.<p>
Parents' most promising forum to agitate for reform and hold their local educators accountable for failure already exists: the venerated National Congress of Parents and Teachers, commonly known as the PTA. Unfortunately, parents cannot count on either their local PTA or its national leadership to advance parental interests—or even air diverse viewpoints. As it operates today, the PTA is useless to parents who want to play a meaningful role in educational reform. <p>
The mission of the PTA has always been to "work on behalf of the best interests of all children on issues that affect their health, education, and welfare" and "to encourage parent involvement." With almost seven million members, the PTA offers great potential for promoting parental involvement in the educational welfare of children. But in the 1990s, that mission requires of the PTA something it has been unwilling to do: demand accountability for performance and spending at every level of the educational system.<p><center><b>Local Control</center></b><p>
Decades ago, parents had significant influence over their neighborhood schools. Over the years, however, school districts consolidated, teachers and administrators came to see themselves as credentialed professionals, and state laws standardized educational practices and curricula. Today, many parents are less likely to get involved in their children's educational environment. Nevertheless, the impetus for reform will have to come from parents active at the grass roots.<p>
The PTA ought to be helping such parents overcome the considerable barriers to holding local educators accountable. For instance, it should be of great concern to parents that student grades tend to be as high in low-achieving as in high-achieving schools, but the PTA deliberately avoids such educational issues.<p>
In the annual battles over allocating financial resources, the PTA should play a major role in deciphering complicated budgets for the benefit of interested parents. Instead, PTAs rally with teachers unions for tax increases, seldom questioning the effect on parents or the educational outcomes for students.<p>
Parents also deserve greater consideration of their  interests in the contract negotiations that determine pay and working conditions for teachers. For instance, teachers in Montgomery County, Maryland, refused to write recommendations for their college-bound students because such "extra" duties weren't in their contract. In some areas, a parent who wishes to lodge a complaint about a teacher must navigate a bureaucratic process established by contract. Parents may have to submit a written account of the grievance in order to secure a meeting with the teacher, who has the right to bring along a union representative. Some parents find such time-consuming and intimidating conditions a clear subordination of parental interests to teacher rights.<p>
It is indisputable that teachers are already well represented in negotiations. Therefore, an effective local PTA that works on behalf of parental interests should insist on more than the current minimal accord paid to parental concerns. Working through the PTA, parents could ensure that their schools:
<ul><li>Demand pro-parent scrutiny of teacher contracts;<li>Justify their annual budgets;<li>Air alternative views to the pro-union positions on privatization, teacher tenure, tuition-tax credits, school choice, and teacher standards;<li>Establish expeditious complaint procedures so that parents could challenge decisions and actions of teachers or administrators;<li>Make certain that student grades provide parents with adequate information about the educational progress of their children, or lack of it.</UL>	
<p>
Nowadays, local matters are greatly affected by policy at higher levels. State governments now have a hand in everything from funding to curricular standards. President Clinton's Goals 2000 legislation, enacted last year and under review by the new Republican-controlled Congress, may bring down the heavy hand of the federal government, too (see sidebar, page 88). Similarly, PTA members who wish to be active at the local level must take account of PTA policies set by the state and national hierarchies and imposed on individual chapters.<p>
At the least, the PTA has the power to keep parents informed of academic issues, from educational policies set at the national and state levels to the curriculum and employment practices of their local schools. At its best, the PTA could help frame the national debate over educational reform, lobby for some of the reforms that debate has already produced, and work to change the restrictive collective-bargaining statutes that tend to shield teacher unions and teachers from accountability and limit parental involvement.<p>Why the PTA Is Weak
<ul><li>PTA's ineffectiveness can be attributed to six inter-related areas:<li>Misdirected resources. At the local level, the PTA has become a fundraising auxiliary for school districts, while its child-advocacy efforts have focused on social, non-educational issues.<li>Stifled debate. Many PTA officials stifle open discussion of controversial issues and discourage parents from questioning the PTA's official positions.<li>Ignorance. Most PTA members have no idea of the policies advocated in their name by the PTA hierarchy at the national and state levels.<li>Careerism. The PTA's national officers are elected by a restrictive process that requires a national PTA presidential candidate to make a commitment of nearly 10 years to rise "through the chairs." Consequently, many PTA national leaders serve long after their own children have left school.<li>Transient membership. Parental interest is often high at the elementary-school level, tapers off in middle school, and all but disappears in high school. As a result, PTA officers and professional staff have inordinate influence.<li>Teachers-union influence. National PTA policies, which often are automatically adopted as state and local PTA policies, reflect the dominant influence of the teachers unions, especially the National Education Association (NEA). </ul>
<p>
Of these factors, by far the most important is the last. Parents and teachers in the PTA both claim to share the same goal: promoting the educational welfare of children. But the PTA's governance structure, in which unionized teachers play a major role, is fatally flawed. Fundamentally, parents and their children are the consumers of education; teachers are part of the producer complex. Elevating the interests of the producers above the interests of the consumers is a formula for irrelevance. In the last 12 months, I have attended two national PTA meetings and five state conventions, and I cannot recall a single instance in which any policy contrary to the interests of teachers unions was given a proper hearing.<p>
Ever since the 1960s, the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) have lobbied vigorously for state legislation requiring school boards to bargain collectively with teachers unions over the terms and conditions of employment. Teachers have the statutory right to bargain collectively in 34 states and the District of Columbia. Many school districts outside of those states engage in de facto collective bargaining with the teachers unions. By its refusal to challenge the teachers unions in collective bargaining, the PTA has eliminated itself as an independent advocate for parents. The PTA claims to "seek to participate in the decisionmaking process establishing school policy." But whenever school boards sacrifice parental interests to union interests as often happens in these negotiations, the PTA cannot and will not object.<p>
Such impotence has been apparent at least since the PTA's 1968 position statement on "teacher negotiations, sanctions, and strikes." The PTA resolution, reaffirmed in 1987, identifies the "dilemmas" that teacher militancy and union negotiations impose on PTA members:<ul>
<p>
"1. If the PTA provides volunteers to man the classrooms, during a work stoppage, in the interest of protecting the immediate safety and welfare of children, it is branded as a strike breaker.<p>
"2. If the PTA does not take sides in issue[s] being negotiated, it is accused of not being interested.<p>
"3. If it supports the positions of the board of education, which is the representative of the public in negotiations, the teacher members of the PTA have threatened to withdraw membership and boycott the local PTA activities." (Italics added.)</ul>
<p>
Collective bargaining is used in most school districts to resolve such issues as teacher compensation for extra curricular activities, class size, parental grievance procedures, and the frequency and scheduling of parent/teacher conferences. In effect, the PTA does not take sides on issues subject to bargaining, regardless of their impact on students, parents, or the public. That position constitutes a major victory for unions and a setback for parents.<p>
How are PTA members supposed to respond to this dilemma? The 1968 resolution urges them to be alert to symptoms of teacher dissatisfaction (abnormal turnover, complaints, and "teacher-supported legislation defeated by state legislature") before a strike and to promote the public airing of issues. At no point does the PTA suggest that teacher dissatisfaction may be unwarranted. The PTA's statement acknowledges that the teachers' threat to withdraw membership and boycott the organization greatly concerns the scores of PTA's professional staff members at the state and national organizations.<p>
This surrender may have the cost the organization anyway. The PTA does not keep track of the ratio of teachers to parents among its membership. But we do know that membership peaked in 1966, when more than 12 million teachers, administrators, and parents were members of the National PTA.<p>
The organization then lost more than six million members from 1966 to 1982, years when collective bargaining by teachers unions increased to unprecedented levels. With the withdrawal of parent activists who refused to accept the PTA's subservience to union interests, the PTA has evolved into an NEA front on non-educational as well as educational issues.<p>
To be sure, the PTA sponsors many worthwhile programs and activities. Few of them, however, relate to education. The PTA doesn't merely waste its potential for constructive action; it may even hinder reform. In recent years, the teachers' unions' formidable influence over the PTA has been seen in the following issues:<p>
Opposition to school choice. In addition to its refusal to challenge union positions in collective bargaining and teacher strikes, the PTA opposes vouchers and tuition-tax credits that would empower parents to choose private schools. Thus the PTA has capitulated to the NEA/AFT insistence on maintaining the public-school monopoly at all costs.<p>
Delegates to the 1994 state convention of the California Congress of Parents, Teachers, and Students (the California PTA) broke into thunderous applause when a speaker congratulated them on defeating the school-choice ballot initiative known as Proposition 174. "You were the voice of the California children!" she shouted. More than one million California PTA volunteers defeated Proposition 174, she said, and "all the California Teachers Association did was put up the money." <p>
In fact, the PTA provided a large bloc of foot soldiers in the campaign against Proposition 174. At one workshop, a PTA official reminded delegates that "we will pull the PTA Charter if any unit goes beyond the PTA agenda—as we would have with any PTA that supported vouchers."<p>
No matter how modest a voucher plan might be, the PTA can be expected to oppose it. In 1994, New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman was expected to introduce a pilot program for school vouchers in the ailing Jersey City school system. Nevertheless, state and national PTA officials called the plan a "threat" to public education. As a result, New Jersey PTA delegates voted to "[t]ake an active role in opposing" private-school vouchers. Not surprisingly, the PTA and the New Jersey affiliate of the NEA joined a coalition to defeat this and all other voucher proposals. <p>
Opposition to privatization. State PTAs structure their conventions to reinforce the national organization's opposition to privatization of school services. At Maryland's state PTA convention last year, the state vice president for legislative activity expressed hostility for privatization. Several delegates stomped out of a standing-room-only session on the topic when the state chairwoman refused to permit a balanced discussion of audience views on this issue. She instead rebutted criticism of PTA's opposition to contracting out school services. The reason for PTA opposition? Allegedly, some unionized employees could lose their jobs.<p>
Focus on non-educational issues. PTA programs are designed to diminish dissatisfaction with poor school performance. Instead of conducting hearings to address the causes of academic deficiencies, PTAs sponsor events presenting students' work in the most favorable light. Much time and effort goes into women's auxiliary or support services: trip chaperoning, bake sales, and other fundraising activities. Clearly, good PTA parents are supposed to be passive supporters, not active critics, of schools and teachers. <p>
Last summer, PTA delegates from 53 states and territories met in Las Vegas for the 98th annual national convention. Convention delegates received two days of workshops to learn how to produce materials that generate positive public reaction to PTA, respond to extremist groups challenging health/sex education curricula, implement the PTA's HIV/AIDS awareness programs, and rebut right-wing groups favoring school choice.<p>
Delegates considered resolutions on violence in video games, inhalant abuse, the quality of indoor air in portable classrooms, and the sale, resale, and destruction of confiscated firearms. These are typical of the non-educational, social issues on which PTAs focus their time and money.<p><center><b>The PTA Stifles Dialogue</b></center><p>
In its 1983 position statement in support of public education (revised and reaffirmed in 1991), the national PTA pledged to ensure that "adequate, objective, and language-appropriate information be available to parents so that they can make informed decisions." Unfortunately, the PTA is ignoring this directive.<p>
Given the way PTAs are governed, it is virtually impossible for parent members to develop parent-friendly policies that may conflict with the interests of teachers unions. Parents ought to have a forum for advocating the adoption of reforms like school-choice programs and the privatization of school services, ensuring that teachers are available for frequent conferences with parents, challenging teacher tenure, and assessing the value of report cards, grades, and standardized tests for measuring student performance. Unfortunately, many PTA parents are finding it increasingly difficult to articulate their needs and lodge their complaints within the PTA.<p>
Taking such action within the PTA would require parents to challenge teachers and teachers unions at meetings where both are present. Many parents fear teacher retaliation if they aggressively advocate parental over teacher interests. PTA parents also feel intimidated by the overwhelming pro-union bias in PTA publications and programs, as seen in the selection of convention issues and speakers.<p>
When one speaker after another proclaims the dangers of school choice, for example, it is difficult for rank-and-file members to challenge the PTA's position on the issue. PTA convention programs and publications ought to include balanced discussion of the issues.<p>
Indeed, open discussion of parental concerns is virtually absent at state and national PTA meetings. In practice, parents who seek accurate, unbiased information on educational issues are expected to fall in line with PTA positions.<p>
"The PTA severely limits the opportunity for dialogue and dissent," says Jo Cooper, an Oklahoma parent and 19-year PTA veteran. In 1994, the state legislative chairman of the Oklahoma PTA warned her not to publicly oppose national PTA positions. Cooper's offense? In a public meeting in her suburban Oklahoma City school district, she opposed the national PTA's enthusiastic support of the Goals 2000 legislation and HR 6, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Cooper believes both pieces of federal legislation will undermine local control.<p>
In 1992, Kathy Moran, a PTA official in Villa Park, California, received a letter from the state organization demanding that PTA leaders "do everything possible" to block the gathering of signatures for the 1992 state ballot initiative on school choice. When she tried to organize a debate on the merits of choice, she was told that PTA chapters must present only the anti-choice perspective. <p><center><b>What's a Parent to Do?</center></b>
<p>
Is it any wonder that a backlash is developing? Small groups of concerned and sometimes angry parents are challenging the status quo—including the PTA's deference to the teachers unions. Among their options:<ul>
<li>
Withhold support. Withholding dues to the state and national organizations can be an effective way to protest. At its recent board meeting, the Indiana State PTA lamented that it had to amend its annual budget after losing 3,000 members and their dues.<li>
Reform from within. Parents who believe the PTA can be reformed from within should form a "parental-control" caucus. Parents committed to pro-parent policies could bring about basic changes in the PTA. With a functioning caucus, they might find the strength to make their voices heard at state and national conventions. They could push to reform cumbersome procedures and restrictive election requirements in order to elect national PTA officers committed to pro-parent positions.<p>
Of course, for such internal reform to succeed, more parents now dissatisfied with PTA operations would have to become involved. Like-minded parents need to serve as officers of local chapters and as delegates to state and national conventions.<li>
Assert leadership locally. In Greenwich, Connecticut, local PTA president Kay Wall questioned the state's implementation of a misnamed "outcome-based education" program in June 1992. Without the support of the PTA, she organized a protest group, the Committee to Save Our Schools (SOS), which contributed to the collapse of Connecticut's plan. <p>
Within her local PTA chapter, Wall has organized and chairs an Academic Challenge and Excellence Committee (ACE) that focuses on restoring high academic standards for all children. "They don't really want parents involved in the way I want to be involved," Wall says, "which is knowing the details of the curriculum, knowing what is being tested, and questioning the new standards." Wall is also encouraging members to challenge the PTA's official support of Goals 2000.<li>
Revise PTA membership policy. As long as unionized teachers employed under collective bargaining are members of the PTA, it may be futile for parents to criticize educational policy. The NEA's own experience is instructive here. Before the enactment of collective-bargaining laws, the NEA included administrators at the local, state, and national levels. As a result, local NEA chapters were usually unable to promote teachers' interests, and actions of school administrators were seldom criticized.<li>
Encourage competition. If parents feel that their PTA cannot represent their interests, they should form alternative organizations. Some active parents are requesting disaffiliation from the national PTA. Janice Thompson, a parent in North Carolina who calls herself a "keeper of the home," ardently opposes the PTA's social agenda and its close association with teachers unions. Thompson emphasizes the need for parental involvement in academic issues, and feels that PTA affiliation is a hindrance, not a help, to parents who wish to raise academic standards.<p>
To build her case for reverting back to a local parent-teacher organization (PTO), she called the North Carolina State PTA office in Raleigh and asked, "What is the last thing the PTA accomplished in the classroom?" Says Thompson, "They didn't even have an answer." Last March, parents at her elementary school voted to revert to a PTO. "At the local level," Thompson says, "we know the issues, and here we can work with parents and the school for the benefit of the students." <p>
The PTO is organized locally, with no allegiance to state or national associations. Local parents, teachers, and administrators direct the activities, which are not unlike those of the PTA. Governance is usually through simple bylaws, determined by all parents who attend the meetings. It's true, as PTA literature points out, that a PTO does not emphasize lobbying efforts—but such efforts might contradict local standards and parental positions. Members of PTOs have found they can work through the local education maze more easily without the national-policy prohibitions and teachers union allegiances of the PTA. <p>
Activist PTO parents direct their energy toward improving their own schools and their own children's educational opportunities. While many appreciate a PTO's autonomy, some recognize its lack of organizational training and support.<li>
New opportunities for involvement. Current educational reforms are introducing new ways for parents to become involved in schools. For instance, charter and magnet schools within public-school systems often include provisions for parental involvement similar to requirements at private and parochial schools. School-management companies and for-profit businesses that offer services to public schools often stress active parental involvement. Parents should encourage this trend by insisting that school districts and schools retain the utmost flexibility in contracting for services.</ul>
<p>
At a time when special-interest groups are increasingly viewed in a negative light, the PTA is already well placed to act as a respected advocate for the educational interests of children and parents. As the struggle intensifies, the teachers unions will do their utmost to preserve the PTA as their subservient ally. The good news is that parents concerned about education want to do more than attend monthly PTA meetings. They are forming groups and creating procedures that will empower them as consumers of government services.

<p>
Every day, hundreds of travelers and visitors to New York City arrive at 42nd Street, across from Grand Central Station, after a disorienting bus trip from Kennedy or LaGuardia airports. Most of the passengers stepping out onto the sidewalk have a single goal: to find a taxicab. Meanwhile, beside each idling bus awaits another group, equally intent on their own mission: to steal from the disembarking travelers.<p>
These are Grand Central's "bag hustlers," the muggers, swindlers, and con men drawn to the area by the steady stream of bus passengers, as well as by the half-million or so commuters who pass through Grand Central each day. To these men, a confused tourist is like a limping gazelle: slow, defenseless, and tasty.<p>
Early one afternoon, a middle-aged visitor from Austria arrives at 42nd Street. Bags in hand, he scans the street for a cab. Before his eyes can even adjust to the light, he is approached by a bag hustler. The hustler, a stocky man in his late 30s, is confident, aggressive, and talks quickly. He offers to carry the man's bags and find a cab. His $20 fee, he explains, will cover the cost of the ride to the man's hotel. The man assents, unaware that the hustler has no intention of paying for the cab with the $20. Instead, he plans to take the money—and perhaps the man's entire wallet—and run into the crowd.<p>
As the two walk together to the curb, a third man appears, dressed in what looks like a policeman's uniform. "Excuse me," he says to the tourist, pointing to the hustler, "do you know this man?" The tourist, looking confused, shrugs. "Then why is he carrying your bags? He's a thief." Soon, other tourists are looking on, and the policeman repeats his charge to the crowd. "This man is a thief," he says in a loud voice, "stay away from him." The hustler drops the bags, and the cop escorts the now thoroughly confused but grateful tourist to a legitimate taxi stand down the block. In less than a minute, and with little fuss, the policeman has saved the tourist from one of New York's oldest scams.<p>
Except the man in uniform is not a policeman. He is a private security guard, hired by local property owners, and possessing no legal powers beyond those of an ordinary citizen. He is a member of a security detail employed by an organization called the Grand Central Partnership. In less than 10 years, this man and several dozen of his colleagues have helped transform the area around the train station from a chaotic maze of threatening streets into one of the safest sections of Manhattan. They have done it without wholesale arrests—and without the use of public money.<p>
Traditionally, security guards have been employed almost exclusively by businesses: either companies whose assets are so valuable that they require extra protection, such as banks and jewelry stores, or those whose size or physical structure renders police patrols ineffective against crime, like hospitals and railroads. But the role of private security is expanding. Increasingly, civilian guards are providing protection in places where only sworn police officers have walked beats: in public parks, central cities, and residential neighborhoods. And increasingly, the salaries of these guards are being paid not by businesses to protect goods, but by citizens hoping to protect their families and neighborhoods.<p>
The history of private security may be nearly as old as crime itself. The earliest security guards may have been the temple priests in the ziggurat at Ur, enlisted by wary Sumerian moneychangers in the third millennium B.C. to protect their lucrative banking operations. In the United States, where businesses have always assumed a large degree of responsibility for protecting themselves, private security guards predate police departments by more than 200 years. Allan Pinkerton, a Scottish immigrant and barrelmaker-turned-detective, started the country's first guard-for-hire service in 1860. His first job: dispatching uniformed civilians to protect meat-packing plants in Chicago. Pinkerton's company, which by the 1990s had revenues of more than $600 million, now shares the market with about 57,000 other private security firms in the United States.<p>
Private security is among the fastest-growing industries in the country. During the 1980s, security companies expanded at twice the rate of public law enforcement, and received 70 percent more funds. There are now two security guards employed in the United States for every federal, state, and local police officer. Civilian guards protect everything from nuclear-power plants to theme parks to government buildings, and their role in public life is growing larger. <p>
Private security companies can never take the place of police officers, and most do not want to. Security guards lack the moral authority that only government can give law enforcement. They also are hobbled by law. Civilian guards have only limited powers of arrest. In most states, citizens may make arrests only when a crime is committed in their presence; suspicion that a crime has taken place is not enough. And in some states, citizens may only make arrests for felonies, and then must immediately turn the suspect over to a police officer. Even those guards who do see felonies in progress are advised to arrest with caution. Unlike police officers, civilians who accidentally take innocent suspects into custody are liable for false arrest. <p>
For these reasons, security guards cannot routinely respond to violent crime. They cannot interrogate suspects or solve murders or negotiate the release of hostages. But they can augment police efforts, helping to maintain order in places where police forces are absent or spread thinly. And they can encourage citizens to follow community standards in a way police officers often cannot.<p>
Security guards can perform these tasks more cheaply than most police departments. Unlike police officers, guards spend nearly all of their time on the job. Since they seldom make arrests, they have little paperwork, and rarely have to testify in court. They are free to walk their beats, and—of great importance to employers—they accrue little overtime.<p>
Perhaps most important, security guards are flexible. Because they are not required to respond to calls for emergency service, they can go wherever they are needed to deter crime—and stay there. A business owner who fears robberies cannot force a police officer to stand outside the door of his business. But hired security guards can do just that. Private security gives citizens more control over their own safety. Used intelligently, security guards can be as efficient as any police department at keeping public order.<p><center><b>Law and Disorder</center></b>
<p>
By the mid-1980s, the streets of midtown Manhattan seemed to be sliding into chaos. Aggressive beggars clogged filthy sidewalks. Crimes of all kinds were on the rise. Local business owners became increasingly frustrated with the city's apparent inability to clean up the area. Some companies left Manhattan for good. A cluster of midtown property owners decided to stay, and to restore their neighborhood without the help of City Hall.<p>
In 1985, a group of planners led by real-estate developer Peter Malkin formed a "business-improvement district," a primitive form of quasi-government charged with keeping streets safe and clean. The group carved out a 50-square-block area surrounding Grand Central Station and on the cusp of Times Square. They called it the Grand Central Partnership. The owners of the 220 commercial properties within the district got to vote on the plan, and a majority agreed to join. Soon after, the New York City Council approved the plan. Although the area was not physically vast—about 80 acres of streets—it was in the center of one of the densest commercial districts in the country. Once its boundaries were set, the Grand Central Partnership contained more than 6,000 businesses, comprising a total of some 51 million square feet of commercial space, about the same as in all of downtown Los Angeles.<p>
To raise money for improvements, the property owners began taxing themselves, first at the rate of a little more than 11 cents per square foot of space, later at about 12.5 cents. For small businesses, the levy worked out to a couple of hundred dollars in extra taxes per year. For large properties, such as the PanAm building, the tax could add up to $300,000 annually. Collecting the revenue was easy. A state law passed in 1981 allowed the city of New York to gather the money along with municipal property taxes each year. The city then sent the money back to the partnership. The city threatened property owners who refused to pay with foreclosure. <p>
By 1994, the Grand Central Partnership was raising $6.3 million a year in property taxes. Most of the money went to visible projects. The partnership hired more than 30 street sweepers and trash collectors to pick up after the thousands of litterers who walk through midtown each day. It purchased new garbage cans, street lights and flower boxes, and built new sidewalks and gleaming granite curbs.<p>
To help foreign tourists find their way, the partnership hired multilingual guides and placed them outside of the train station. To make catching a cab easier, it built two taxi stands and stationed a guard in each to direct traffic. To make the neighborhood more inviting to pedestrians, the partnership spent $3 million to install 136 high-power halogen floodlights, which illuminate the Grand Central terminal at night. When more money was needed for capital improvements, the group issued $35 million in bonds, the interest on which was paid for by the property tax.<p>
<b><center>Vacating the Vagrants</b></center>
<p>
Completed in 1913, Grand Central Station was crumbling by the 1980s, and had become a magnet for every kind of social affliction. City police seemed unable or unwilling to restore order. In 1987, the New York Times described the area outside the train station as "chaotic and forbidding, often filthy and sometimes dangerous." Much of the chaos and filth, as well as much of the danger, could be traced to the nearly 500 vagrants living in the building. <p>
Since it had no jurisdiction within the train station, the partnership could not make the vagrants leave the terminal. Instead, it decided to lure them away. For years, hundreds of homeless men and women had gathered on Vanderbilt Avenue outside Grand Central to receive food handed out by volunteers. Starting in 1989, the partnership opened a "drop-in center" for the homeless in an old Catholic boys' school a couple of blocks away. Soon, the center was serving meals to hundreds of the same people who had once queued up outside Grand Central.<p>
Inside the old school, the homeless could sit down to eat. And unlike the street in front of the station, the drop-in center was safe, protected by a metal detector and security guards. As additional enticements, the center offered hot showers and job-training classes. Employees of the partnership began to help vagrants living in the train station find more permanent housing, relocating scores of them to shelter at YMCAs and even in city housing. Before long, Grand Central was nearly free of vagrants.<p><b><center>The Shock Troops</b></center><p>
As the partnership's social-service arm enjoyed success with the area's homeless population, its security division worked to assemble a guard force. By the winter of 1988, the security force was ready. Using $1.4 million of its annual revenues, the partnership put 18 uniformed security guards on the street around Grand Central each day, working overlapping shifts from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., seven days a week.<p>
Gerard Panza is a retired detective who runs the day-to-day operations of the partnership's security force. From his office in a building next to the train station, he plots the movement of crime through the district. On one wall hangs a map of midtown, with colored push pins marking the locations of recent crimes. Though the map is riddled with holes, few pins remain, testament to the success of the partnership's strategy for fighting crime. <p>
At times security guards have tackled serious, violent crime. Guards have disarmed a gunman and also foiled an armed robbery. But as Panza explains, the partnership's most important task is keeping the streets orderly. Security guards, he says, have set out to shove even the pettiest of criminals out of the partnership's domain. No public violation of law or exhibition of disorder is too small to merit the attention of security guards. As a result, Panza says, the incidence of crime of all kinds has fallen. <p>
The New York City Police Department agrees. According to the department's statisticians, within two years after the guards arrived, reports of crime within the Grand Central Partnership had dropped by 20 percent. The decline was even more precipitous in the area immediately surrounding the rail terminal. On the western part of Vanderbilt Avenue outside Grand Central Station, a street long famous for muggers and drug dealers, reported crimes dropped 83 percent (from 2,140 in 1988 to 367 in 1990). After three years, reports of crime in the district had dropped 36 percent, an achievement the city's assistant chief of police called "phenomenal." By the spring of 1994, more than five years after security patrol started, reported crime in the Grand Central Partnership had decreased by nearly 53 percent.<p><b><center>A Few Good Men</b></center><p>
The group's directors understood that the guards they hired would do much to shape the partnership's public image. It was a challenging task, because the public perception of private security has never been good. A 1971 Rand report described the "average security guard" as an "underscreened, undertrained, undersupervised, and underpaid" ne'er-do-well with "little education beyond the ninth grade." To this unflattering portrait, the Rand scholars might have added "uncontrollably aggressive" and "psychologically unstable." It is widely believed in the private-security industry that the mentally unbalanced are drawn to guard work. A number of recent, highly publicized incidents in which current and former security guards have committed crimes or gone unaccountably berserk have only seemed to confirm the stereotype. <p>
In order to screen out maladjusted candidates, the Grand Central Partnership advertises the jobs in relatively upscale publications like the New York Times and takes referrals from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. Although no federal laws regulate the hiring practices of private security companies, most states require guards to be at least 18 years old, and to be reasonably upstanding, sober citizens with no recent felony charges. In addition to these requirements, the partnership hires only applicants with a high-school diploma, and gives preference to those with military service. Each recruit is required to take a psychological exam and a drug test. Once they meet these standards, rookie guards are trained for seven days, mostly in the specifics of New York law.<p>
There are no explicit physical requirements for the job, but Richard P. Dillon, who runs the security operation for the partnership, says he likes to hire guards who are "as smart and as big and fast as we can get." In at least one category, it is clear he has succeeded. The partnership's guards—most of whom are men—tend to be physically imposing. Some are huge. The guards do not carry weapons, so physical size can be an important source of authority during an altercation.<p>
Successful applicants are paid well by industry standards. Salaries start at $10 an hour, rising to about $13 with seniority and good service. Benefits include health and life insurance, and two weeks' paid vacation. Once on the force, discipline is strict. Absenteeism and lateness are not tolerated, nor is sloppy dress, smoking in public, or even minor violations of the organization's many rules. Guards must use good manners, including courtesy titles, in their dealings with the public. Their uniforms, which bear a distinct and intentional resemblance to those of the city's police department, are crisp and clean. Under them, guards wear bullet-proof vests. <p><center><b>Tight Supervision</center></b>
<p>
Though they have succeeded in forming a largely professional force, the partnership's directors are under no illusions about the quality of person drawn to guard work, or about what could happen if the guards were managed poorly. Direct and quick communication between guards and supervisors is crucial to ensuring that guards are effective and stay within the bounds of the law. Guards are linked to their supervisors at all times by radios routed through the partnership's dispatching center on 34th Street. As they walk their rounds, guards talk frequently with their overseers, checking in over the radio and seeking approval for any consequential decisions.<p>
The partnership's supervisors are well-equipped to offer guidance. Each is a retired New York City police officer, with a minimum of 20 years on the force. The head of the group's security force, Richard Dillon, was a cop for 32 years before retiring in 1988 as assistant chief of the department. Most other supervisors retired as detectives or inspectors. <p>
Veteran supervisors are the partnership's insurance policy against mishaps. In addition to their superior equipment—each carries a concealed pistol and a radio with a direct line to the police department—supervisors bring a solid knowledge of the penal code. While guards, many of whom aspire to be police officers, are apt to swagger and overstep their authority, supervisors remain cool. William O'Connor, a retired detective who keeps watch over seven guards, says he struggles every day to keep his men within their legal bounds. "They're loaded with enthusiasm, and they would want to do more than private citizens can do." But, as O'Connor reminds his guards repeatedly, they are nothing more than civilians in uniforms.<p>
The distinction is vital. Nothing could destroy Grand Central Partnership's security force more quickly than a guard who assumes police powers and abuses citizens. It has happened before. In the late-1980s, members of the Nation of Islam began providing security to public-housing projects in several cities, including Washington, New York, and Los Angeles. With grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the sect's security firm sent guards into projects to clear out drug dealers. For a time, the group restored a measure of order to the projects. In the process, however, the security guards intimidated not only the drug dealers but residents as well. In a number of housing complexes, police had to intervene to keep the guards under control. In one case, the group lost its contract with a housing project in Los Angeles after being charged with negligence.<p>
In order to avoid similar mistakes, the partnership drills its guards on the limitations on the use of force. Physical force may be used, the guards learn again and again, only as a final resort, in self-defense, or to protect the life of another person. The partnership's security handbook, which explains the limits of civilian authority, is referred to as "the Bible"; guards take refresher courses on it every Thursday afternoon. To further protect themselves from liability suits, guards are required to call their supervisors the moment a problem arises. If the guards make an arrest or become involved in an altercation with a citizen, supervisors routinely interview bystanders as potential witnesses. In the event of a lawsuit, the statements they take may be used to protect the guard. So far, the precaution has not been necessary. The partnership's security force has been sued only once, by a bystander who was injured by a guard chasing a suspect.<p>
The supervisors' broad experience allows them to fill another role as well, that of ambassadors to the city's police. A working partnership between the two groups is vital to the success of the security force, but relations did not come easily. Like most police officers, New York cops are naturally suspicious of security guards, or "square badges," as they are unaffectionately known. In the eyes of police, guards seem to occupy a confusing gray area between public official and private citizen that many cops find disconcerting.<p>
To the surprise of no one, the partnership's guards received a chilly welcome from police when they first arrived in midtown. Due partly to the presence of retired cops in its ranks, however, the guards ultimately developed an amiable relationship with local cops. The two groups now share a substation across from the train terminal, and meet monthly to discuss crime trends.<p><b><center>A Cop's Best Friend</b></center> <p>
Over the years, police have adopted a laissez-faire view of minor lawbreakers around Grand Central, including baggage hustlers, aggressive panhandlers, and small-time marijuana salesmen. "The police are involved with other matters," explains Panza, who spent more than 30 years on the force. "They cannot concentrate on the quality-of-life crimes when they have major crimes. They must first reduce homicides, robberies, assaults."<p>
For police officers, the priorities make good sense. When a cop makes an arrest for disorderly conduct, for instance, he is likely to spend the rest of his shift at the station house filling out forms.<p>
In the meantime, his post out on the streets may remain unfilled, creating opportunities for additional, perhaps more serious crimes to be committed. "That's where we come in," says Panza. "We are the eyes and the ears of the police department. They appreciate our work because we try to solve some problems ourselves, without police intervention."<p>
Guards often go to great lengths to avoid summoning police unnecessarily to the scene of a disturbance. When a knot of marijuana dealers proved especially hard to dislodge, for instance, security guards simply took photographs of the sellers and handed them over to police. Most of the dealers quickly found new retail locations. As in the vast majority of cases handled by the partnership's guards, police never became directly involved. <p>
Of the 6,916 incidents to which the partnership's guards responded in 1994, only 624 required police assistance, and 122 resulted in arrests. That year, guards came across 31 people smoking marijuana in public. In each case, the guards told the smokers to move along, and in each case the smokers did. In cases of narcotics dealing, police were called just 6 percent of the time; in bag-hustling cases, 2 percent; in illegal panhandling cases, 1 percent; and disorderly conduct cases, 9 percent.<p>
In January 1993, security guards told 141 unlicensed peddlers to leave the area. One hundred and thirty-five obeyed the guards without incident. Police were called to handle only six of those cases; only two peddlers were belligerent enough to get arrested.<p>
Most of the time, guards convince violators to comply by explaining which laws they have broken, then politely asking them to leave the area. Most accede. Some do not. <p>
Three-card monte dealers, in particular, have a reputation for ferocity, and only the largest security guards are sent to ask them to vacate the sidewalk. When they are challenged, however, it isn't physical strength most security guards are likely to rely upon, but the power to arrest.<p>
Like all citizens, guards can make arrests when they see crimes committed, hold suspects until the police arrive, and act as complainants in the case against the arrestee. The difference between security guards and most civilians, however, is that guards will, when pushed, actually make an arrest. Most lawbreakers in the area know the guards aren't bluffing.<p>
The threat of even a citizen's arrest is apt to get a wrongdoer's attention. As security chief Richard Dillon puts it, "Criminals, even in New York, where they know they're not going to stay in jail very long, still don't want to be arrested." And, according to Dillon, security guards will make a genuine effort to arrest some criminals. "Our guys chase them five or ten blocks."<p>
When the victims of crime are tourists, security guards make an additional effort to see that the perpetrators are locked up. Visitors from out of town make appealing marks partly because criminals know that even if they are caught, their victims will most likely never return to testify against them in court. The charges will be dropped. To encourage tourists to testify, the partnership authorizes its guards to offer to pay victims' airfare back to New York for the court date. The guards believe this policy makes criminals more inclined to plea-bargain.<p>
<b><center>Deterring Petty Thieves</b></center> <p>
The partnership's guards look strikingly like New York City cops. The resemblance is deliberate. Says Panza, "We want people to think from a distance that it may be a police officer. That is a deterrent. By the time they ascertain that the guy is not a police officer, maybe the opportunity to commit the crime has disappeared." When they are not putting the hustle on bag hustlers, the guards spend their days doing what New York's police department no longer has much time to do: walking a beat and deterring thieves with their uniformed presence. <p>
Coconuts, a music store next to the train station, has lost large amounts of merchandise to theft. Professional shoplifters carry double-walled "booster bags" lined with aluminum to neutralize the store's electronic security system, and they routinely load up with free compact discs and cassette tapes. Store employees, knowing police would be slow to respond, could do little. But the security guards, says Edwin Ortiz, the store's manager, have helped cut down on the thievery. "I call them and they come running and hold the shoplifter till the police come." <p>
Joel Oks, owner of Portabella, a men's clothing store on Vanderbilt Avenue, also had a problem with shoplifters. Now, he says, the thieves have moved on to other areas, along with the drug dealers who used to stand outside his store. The criminals, he claims, have been frightened away by the security guards. "Wouldn't you be scared of this guy?" asks Oks, pointing to Jimmy Mena, a guard the size of a rhinoceros. "We don't have security problems any more. I give them all the credit." <p>
Oks may give the guards credit, but he has no idea how much he gives them in taxes. Like every store owner I surveyed, Oks did not know what he pays each year to the Grand Central Partnership. And like the rest of the owners, he does not seem to care. Whatever the amount, he says, the protection he receives is "well worth it."<p>
Alan Maleh, owner of Goldrush Fine Jewelry at the corner of 42nd Street and Madison Avenue, agrees. "I haven't seen a uniformed policeman around here in years." The guards, by contrast, "are there all the time. If we give a call, they come running over." Before the security guards, he says, "there were no cops." Muggers "would snatch a purse right in front of the store and they would be laughing, not even running away, walking away. They can't do that now. So they go somewhere else." Without guards, he says, "it's like a jungle out there."<p>
Store owners take comfort in the fact they can reach guards at any time on their portable radios and expect an immediate response. Toni Klein, who owns Cohen's Fashion Optical on 42nd Street, says she does not wait for a crime to occur before calling for help. The moment menacing-looking people enter her store, she requests a guard, who invariably arrives in moments. Like many citizens, Klein might feel foolish calling the police to deter crimes before they are committed. But the money she pays to the partnership—even though she is unsure of its amount—makes her feel entitled to preventive police protection.<p><b><center>Fresh Flowers in the Men's Room</b></center>
<p>
Perhaps no location in midtown Manhattan has benefited more dramatically from the presence of security guards than Bryant Park, a nine-acre patch of grass  behind the city's public-research library and adjacent to Times Square. Situated in the center of the city and ringed by office buildings, Bryant Park is a natural place for couples to stroll and office workers to eat lunch. For years, however, few dared enter the area. Until the late-1980s, the park was a dangerous and notorious place: Drug-dealing was rampant, people lived on park benches, and there were murders. <p>
Bryant Park's fortunes began to change when two security guards were assigned to the area. The guards started enforcing some simple rules: no panhandling in the park, no drinking, no drugs, no sleeping on the benches, no feeding the pigeons, and no wading in the fountain. For those who didn't get the message, a sign was hung listing the prohibitions in bold letters. Within a short time, many of the park's seedier tenants left for more hospitable terrain. Soon, law-abiding citizens took the place of vagrants, and the atmosphere  began to change. <p>
Bryant Park now hosts concerts during the summer, and free movies on the lawn every Monday night. There is virtually no serious crime. "We're getting so many good folks here doing so many good things," says William O'Connor, who supervises guards in the park." You're an oddball when you're sitting out there being drunk or disorderly."<p>
Nothing illustrates the revival of Bryant Park more powerfully, however, than the condition of its men's room. By their nature, bathrooms are among the most vulnerable of public spaces. In New York, they are often stark symbols of urban decay. Frequently scarred by graffiti, and filled with drug dealers, amorous homosexuals, and vagrants bathing in the sinks, public men's rooms are places most savvy New Yorkers avoid at all costs. <p>
Bryant Park's men's room, however, is different. Its full-time attendant keeps the room tidy and stands guard. As a result of his vigilance, the men's room is as spotless as the lavatory in an upscale restaurant. Next to the sink is a bouquet of fresh flowers, fragrant evidence of the power of private security to enforce order in public spaces.<p>
More communities are certain to follow the example of the Grand Central Partnership. They may have to. Just as rising medical costs have forced hospitals to give more responsibility to nurses, cities may find that sworn police officers—whom they must train, pay relatively well, and sustain on pensions—are too expensive for fighting and deterring certain types of low-level crimes. To maintain basic civic order, rent-a-cops may be a better deal. <p>
Many communities already think so. In 1993, residents of Georgetown, an affluent and historic neighborhood on the western edge of Washington, D.C., hired a security guard from the Wells Fargo Company. Crimes, particularly thefts from cars, had been increasing in the area for years. About 100 neighbors chipped in approximately $160 a year—about 44 cents a day per household—to hire a uniformed guard to patrol their six-block area. From 6 p.m. to 2 a.m., five nights a week, the guard passes each house in the area at least once every hour.<p>
After a year of employing the guard, residents found their streets transformed. Fresh graffiti stopped appearing on buildings. Burglaries within the six-block area decreased by 55 percent, robberies by 50 percent. The security guard also stopped at least two serious crimes. In one instance, he frightened off two men attempting to kidnap a local couple. <p>
The decrease in crime was so dramatic that other parts of Georgetown soon began hiring guards. Within a year and a half, 90 percent of the neighborhood was covered by security guards.<p>
In the mid-1980s, East Hills, New York, a village of 6,700 on Long Island, hired about 30 uniformed security guards to take the place of sworn police officers. The unarmed guards cruise the streets of East Hills 24 hours a day, reporting crimes to county police, and generally acting as guardians of order. Although the service costs residents an extra $360,000 a year in property taxes, it has remained popular. Local politicians credit the program with reducing the town's burglary rate.<p>
Citizens concerned about disorder in their neighborhoods may find that security guards are the most cost-effective way to make their streets safer. "We don't do homicides, we don't do rapes," says O'Connor of the Grand Central Partnership. "But we do other quality-of-life things. Police are not going to come for an illegal peddler when they're up to their necks in gun runs. That's the reason we're here: We do the work the police have trouble getting to because they're so busy." If the results of these private security firms are any indication, this sort of policing can help restore community life—keeping everyone less busy worrying about crime and more busy building families and neighborhoods.

<p>        	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT></B>othing could be more heart-breaking than the sight of a baby born with an 
addiction to cocaine. There is very little doctors and nurses can do to ease the pain of 
these innocent newborns, whose mothers' use of hard, illegal drugs during pregnancy 
constitutes nothing less than blatant child abuse.</P>
<P>	Walk into the neonatal unit of any hospital in America, and you will see crack-
cocaine babies. Some cry and shake uncontrollably. They refuse to take food. Many die.</P> 
<P>	And those who survive are far more likely than other children to be sentenced to 
lives of behavioral problems, birth defects, and learning disabilities.</P>
<P>	Nationwide, one in 10 children born has been exposed to cocaine in the womb. 
This condition affects 350,000 babies a year. Our society can address this problem 
effectively. We can significantly reduce this type of child abuse. Unfotunately, the policy 
of the Clinton administration is to protect, not the children, but the "rights" of the mothers 
to escape the consequences of their actions.</P>
<P>	Several years ago, when I was serving as a circuit solicitor in South Carolina, I 
became aware of the growing problem of crack-cocaine babies at Charleston's Medical 
Unversity of South Carolina (MUSC). My office worked with the hospital to aggressively 
confront pregnant women with the consequences of their drug use. Over a five-year 
period, we presented all pregnant mothers who tested positive for cocaine use with a 
choice: Either seek drug treatment or face arrest and jail time.</P>
<P>	This became one of the first "crack-baby" prevention programs in the nation. And 
the program worked. Scores of women agreed to enter rehabilitation and stayed off drugs 
for the remainder of their pregnancies. Before-and-after statistics present a clear picture. 
Before the sanctions took effect, 24 pregnant mothers a month tested positive for cocaine. 
Virtually none of them was willing to seek help voluntarily. Then, beginning in 1989, 
when we launched a tough amnesty program, the number testing positive for cocaine 
dropped to five or six a month. Prenatal visits as well as live births at the hospital stayed 
the same. Other states were looking at our success as a model.</P>
<P>	Tragically, the cocaine-baby program, which was clearly saving lives, was 
effectively shut down by the Clinton administration. Under the president's direction, a 
swarm of federal officials came to Charleston making unfounded allegations of 
discrimination and accusing the hospital of violating the "privacy rights" of the addicted 
mothers. The Clinton administration warned us that a private civil-rights suit was 
pending, and threatened to cut off $54 million in federal assistance, or about 60 percent 
of the facility's annual budget. Last year, the hospital finally relented, ending the 
successful intervention program.</P>
<P>    Now, once again, the babies cry out in agony. And once again, hospital staff with no 
legal recourse must watch pregnant women knowingly cause neurological damage to 
their unborn children. MUSC nurse Shirley Brown expressed the frustration eloquently: 
"You just have to sit around with your hands tied and watch them destroy a baby." 
Indeed she is right. If this is what President Clinton has in mind when he calls for a return 
to individual and community responsibility, then this administration faces a profound 
moral crisis.</P>
<P>	Administration officials and representatives of the American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU) called the cocaine-baby program punitive, discriminatory, and invasive. 
In fact, it was none of the above.</P>
<P>	By the late 1980s, nurse Brown and her staff noticed an increasing number of 
pregnant women coming to the hospital--not for prenatal care, but because of 
hemorrhaging or other acute problems related to their pregnancies. In the course of 
treatment, many of these women tested positive for drug use, usually cocaine. Thus the 
program grew out of a deep concern among the hospital staff for the welfare of both 
mother and child.</P>
<P>	At first, the hospital tried to educate the women about the damage they were 
causing to themselves and to their unborn babies. Sadly, hospital workers could not 
convince many of the expectant drug-addicted women to enter a drug-treatment program. 
Most wouldn't even return for any type of prenatal care at all. The women--mostly poor 
and uneducated--received free counseling. They were offered free drug treatment and 
free prenatal care, but few participated in the program voluntarily.</P>
<P>	At the same time, the delivery and treatment of crack babies was putting a 
tremendous strain on hospital resources, as well as on the moral sensibilities of hospital 
personnel. Normal neonatal delivery costs can be as low as $500 per baby, but the costs 
of cocaine babies and the intense postnatal care they require have increased 
tremendously. The hospital has seen bills reach $750,000.  Most are born to welfare 
mothers, so Medicaid and the hospital were picking up the bill. According to the General 
Accounting Office, a single cocaine baby can run up a lifetime tab of $1 million in 
medical and educational costs.</P>
<P>	At the time we launched the cocaine baby program in Charleston, I was circuit 
solicitor. Last year, I was elected attorney general for South Carolina, and now view the 
problem from a statewide perspective. Hospitals across our state see drug-damaged 
babies with growing frequency. In every major city in the country, hospitals have units 
devoted to crack mothers and crack babies. But no one dares to forcefully address the 
causes of the problem. We are merely watching it happen and paying an increasingly high 
price in dollars and human suffering. We saw an opportunity to make a difference.</P>
<P>	During the operation of the cocaine-baby program in Charleston, everyone 
concerned was brought to the table--social workers, people from Charleston County 
Substance Abuse, drug-rehabilitation specialists, law-enforcement officials, hospital 
officials, and my office, which was willing to prosecute when necessary. We all agreed 
on one principle: We needed a program that used not only a carrot, but a real and very 
firm stick.</P>
<P>	Those who argued most forcefully for the cocaine-baby program were people who 
dealt with drug addiction every day: the rehabilitation specialists. They told us that 
"unless you have sanctions in place, unless you understand the basic irresponsibility of 
these drug-addicted women, it won't work."</P> 
<P>	Working closely with Chief Reuben Greenberg of the Charleston Police 
Department, we set up an amnesty program with sanctions for those who don't abide by 
the rules. Whenever a prenatal patient tested positive for drugs, hospital staff first 
counseled the mother about what she was doing to her unborn baby. They presented her 
with a letter from the solicitor's office explaining that she faced arrest and prosecution 
(crack cocaine use is a felony in South Carolina) if she refused treatment. The solicitor's 
office then promised to drop all charges if the woman successfully completed a drug-
treatment program. We saw this as a child-abuse prevention program with a goal of 
producing a healthy child.</P>
<P>	We had solid legal grounds to act in this manner, especially in the third trimester 
of the pregnancy. During the final trimester, the fetus is regarded as viable, that is, 
capable of sustaining life on its own, and is therefore granted significant protections 
under both federal and state law. Indeed, the viable fetus is a person under the law. In this 
legal context, we offered pregnant women immunity from prosecution, free medical 
services, and free access to a program of drug rehabilitation. All we asked of them in 
return was to enter the program in good faith and to stop abusing their unborn children 
with illegal drugs.</P>
<P>	Politically correct resolutions by the American Medical Association and the 
American Pediatrics Association denounced the policy as punitive and unwise. The 
National Institutes of Health also sent down some officials, who made the incredible 
claim that the hospital was conducting coercive experiments on pregnant women. Then 
the Clinton administration, ideologically driven by the absurd notion that a woman's 
privacy rights overrule a mother's most basic responsibility to her own child, would not 
allow us to protect the lives of the babies or their self-destructive mothers. Donna 
Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, sent an investigative team from the 
department's ethics division. One HHS official, without offering any evidence, claimed 
the program had "a chilling effect on minority pregnant women seeking prenatal health 
care."</P>
<P>	Of course, the cocaine-baby program was not punitive. The program was not 
designed to put people in jail. It was a humanitarian effort to save lives through tough, 
decisive action under urgent circumstances. In fact, the women involved in the program 
almost invariably avoided jail.</P>
<P>	Most of the pregnant women who tested positive for crack cocaine (after they 
understood their options) agreed to enter the drug program. The small number who 
refused the program were indeed arrested, but nearly all of their cases were dismissed 
because the women quickly agreed to enter the program once they saw we were serious. 
Only two continued to refuse help, and they were ultimately placed on probation. The 
cocaine-baby program was not a punitive "lock-up" program, but an amnesty program. 
And it was working.</P>
<P>	Also, there is absolutely no evidence that it scared anyone away from prenatal 
care. Remember, very few of these women came to the hospital in the first place to take 
advantage of prenatal services. They came because of urgent medical problems related 
either to their pregnancy or to their addiction.</P>
<P>	Opponents of our cocaine-baby program continually failed to understand that 
prosecutorial action, like a thermostat, can be constantly adjusted. Charges can be 
dropped at any time. We can add conditions.</P> 
<P>	The system has a great deal of flexibility that can be used to motivate 
irresponsible people to take responsible action. Many public defenders (though they are 
not likely to admit it publicly) thought the cocaine-baby program was a great idea.</P>
<P>	Cocaine addicts need a strong motive to mend their ways. And most drug and 
law-enforcement officials also agree. A federally funded research survey showed that 
about 30 percent of those who enter public drug-treatment programs do so only because 
of direct or indirect legal pressure. The Office of National Drug Control Policy noted in a 
1992 report that "the criminal justice system can steer offenders toward drug treatment as 
a condition for deferred prosecution."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration, however, seemed utterly unconcerned with common 
sense or practical solutions to a problem that is literally destroying the lives of adults and 
infants. Within a matter of weeks, HHS also sent investigators from its Office of Civil 
Rights. They alleged that the program was discriminatory toward blacks. Marie Chretien, 
a regional manager in the Office of Civil Rights, claimed in a letter to the hospital that its 
substance-abuse policy "may result in an adverse disproportionate impact on African-
American women."</P>
<P>	It is true that most of the women treated were black. The hospital serves a 
primarily indigent population, and most of the patient population is black. The South 
Carolina Drug Prevalence Study showed blacks were more likely to use cocaine than 
whites.</P>
<P>	Ask Police Chief Greenberg, who is also African American, if this policy was 
discriminatory. He would be among the first to tell you that cocaine use is much more 
common in South Carolina among blacks than whites--and that the black community 
was benefiting most from the prenatal program. "[The program's opponents] don't care 
about the race issue. They're just using this as a tactic," Greenberg says. "I was glad that 
somebody was finally doing something to help kids in the black community. It was 
giving kids a chance who otherwise would not have anything close to an equal playing 
field. At least at the point of birth, that child ought to be given the best opportunity for a 
full and productive life."</P>
<P>	In spite of all this, the HHS civil-rights office threatened in a letter last June to cut 
off federal money to MUSC unless it backed away from its aggressive treatment program. 
"It is the government's obligation to ensure that federal funds do not support a program 
which discriminates," Chretien wrote in the letter. "This obligation entails making a 
formal determination of whether there is a violation of the Title VI regulation--and if 
negotiations for voluntary compliance fail, the initiation of administrative enforcement 
proceedings to terminate federal financial assistance."</P>
<P>	What continues to amaze me, as the state's chief law-enforcement officer, is the 
groundlessness of the discrimination charge. In October 1993, the liberal, feminist Center 
for Reproductive Law and Policy filed a civil suit against the hospital alleging that its 
policy was racially discriminatory, and thus a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of 
the 14th Amendment. The New York-based center, an offshoot of the ACLU, asked a 
federal judge to issue an injunction against the hospital to suspend the drug-testing 
program. The judge declined, finding no basis for the discrimination charge.</P>
<P>	It's no coincidence, by the way, that shortly after the feminist group failed in its 
lawsuit, investigators from the Clinton administration swooped down on the Medical 
University. I am convinced their plan was coordinated with HHS officials. So is the 
hospital. "It was obvious to us there was collusion between the center and all the federal 
agencies that came down on us," says the university's president, Dr. James Edwards.</P>
<P>	Whether HHS officials would have followed with their own lawsuit is unclear. 
Almost certainly they could not have won in court. But they didn't need to. The hospital, 
dependent on federal funding, never had a chance. HHS agents made an ex parte decision 
that the program was discriminatory. And so they exercised the federal version of the 
golden rule--that is, they've got the gold, so they make the rules.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration was willing to withhold millions of dollars from the 
Medical University, stop all of its Medicaid assistance, shut down its children's hospital 
and its cancer center, discontinue dozens of medical services from radiation oncology to 
pediatric surgery, close down its 558 beds, and force the hospital to turn away its 
patients--all to end a program that offended the liberal sensibilities of Donna Shalala and 
Bill Clinton. A gun was held to the hospital's head, and for the protection of all the other 
patients, the hospital had to agree to give up.</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, this saga isn't over yet. The Office of the Solicitor and virtually 
everyone else involved in the hospital's prenatal drug policy is being sued by the Center 
for Reproductive Freedom on behalf of five women who tested positive for cocaine.</P> 
<P>	They want $3 million. It's a complicated suit, but it boils down to a claim that the 
program violated their right to privacy. In fact, the so-called constitutional right to 
privacy does not protect the results of a drug screen, especially not in this case.</P>
<P>	First of all, you don't have a right to use crack cocaine; it's a felony. Second, all 
of the women knew about the amnesty program--there were public-service 
announcements about it, the women voluntarily came to the only hospital in the state that 
sponsored it, they were counseled about the consequences of testing positive, and they all 
signed consent forms before being screened.</P>
<P>	Medical personnel are held legally accountable for the health of both mother and 
unborn child throughout the pregnancy. In fact, malpractice insurance exists to support 
the obligations of primary-care providers in just such cases. If a fetus is damaged by 
inadequate, mistaken, or negligent medical practice, the hospital would quickly face 
lawsuits. So how is it that we have no legal means to keep mothers from seriously 
damaging or destroying their own babies? "If the mother is not going to be held 
responsible," says nurse Brown, "then I don't think any nurse or physician giving 
obstetrical care should have to be held liable."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration apparently believes that infants have no rights at all 
until the umbilical cord is cut. But the U.S. Supreme Court has never said that the states 
do not have a compelling interest in protecting the health of the unborn in the third 
trimester when they can live outside the womb. Indeed, case law in South Carolina and 
elsewhere suggests that society does have certain obligations to the unborn child, 
certainly at very advanced stages of development. South Carolina courts have interpreted 
"person" to include a viable fetus.</P>
<P>	We put tremendous resources into prosecuting child-abuse cases because of the 
great damage done to children, and we make no apologies for that. The cocaine-baby 
program we started in South Carolina was, most of all, a child-abuse prevention program, 
protecting the smallest and the most innocent of children.</P>
<P>	President Clinton and his messengers appear to be fundamentally unconcerned 
with the hundred of thousands of cocaine-addicted women who stagger into the delivery 
units of hospitals across the land. The only remedy they offer to the horribly damaged 
children who result from this madness is to increase the flow of Medicaid dollars, 
provided by taxpayers, to pay a price so large that it is literally impossible to calculate. 
And the greatest frustration of all is knowing that this increasingly expensive tragedy can 
be prevented. One of the most basic responsibilities a mother has is to her child. If a 
mother injected cocaine into the tiny arm of her infant, causing permanent brain damage 
or death, certainly that mother would be arrested and prosecuted.</P>
<P>	Yet that is exactly what addicted mothers do when they consume cocaine 
throughout their pregnancy. In South Carolina, we tried to do something about it. The 
program we created was working. Now it is no more. And as long as powerful federal 
bureaucrats continue to manipulate federal funding to serve a bizarre agenda that is deaf 
to the cries of damaged babies, there is nothing more we can do.</P>
<P>	Why is the Clinton administration stopping us from protecting our children?</P>

	  <B><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT></B>n Father's Day 1986, Richmond Police Detective George Taylor 
stopped Wayne DeLong for a routine traffic violation. DeLong, recently 
released from prison after serving time for murder, shot and killed the 
policeman.</P>
<P>	Leo Webb was a divinity student at Richmond's Virginia Union 
University who liked helping people. One of those he helped was a man 
named James Steele, on parole for a malicious wounding. One day in 1991, 
Steele entered the bakery where Webb worked part time, shot him to death, 
took his money, and went out partying.</P>
<P>	Tragic as such stories are, what makes these two particularly 
disheartening is that both could have been easily prevented. Both killers, 
jailed earlier for violent crimes, spent only a fraction of their sentences in 
prison. We are now paying the dividends of a liberal justice system that 
refuses to take punishment seriously: Virginia has witnessed a 28 percent 
increase in criminal violence over the last five years. Three out of every four 
violent crimes--murder, armed robbery, rape, assault--are now committed by 
repeat offenders.</P>
<P>	This is why my administration pushed through legislation, which took 
effect on January 1, 1995 that will impose penalties for rape, murder, and 
armed robbery more than twice the national average for those crimes. We 
have abolished parole, established the principle of truth-in-sentencing, and 
increased as much as fivefold the amount of time that violent offenders will 
actually spend in jail. Experience vindicates what commonsense has always 
told us: The only foolproof crime-prevention technique is incarceration.</P>
<P>	 Our new system is attempting to unravel 30 years of paper-tiger laws 
based on the questionable philosophy that people can change, criminals can 
be rehabilitated, and every violent criminal--even a murderer--deserves a 
second chance. The new law in Virginia will prevent thousands of crimes, 
save lives, save money, and restore trust in the criminal justice system. 
Despite this, we now face entrenched opposition from liberals in the General 
Assembly, who hope to thwart reform by withholding funds to build the 
minimal number of prison facilities needed to house Virginia's most violent 
inmates.</P> 
<P>	A few weeks after taking office in January 1994, I created the 
Commission on Parole Abolition and Sentencing Reform. It was a bipartisan 
commission of prosecutors, judges, crime victims, law-enforcement officers, 
business leaders, and legal scholars. William Barr, a former attorney general 
of the United States, and Richard Cullen, a former U.S. Attorney for the 
Eastern District of Virginia, co-chaired the commission. They had a daunting 
task.</P>
<P>	I called for a special session of the General Assembly in September 
1994 to focus the public's and the legislature's attention on this issue. I gave 
the commission six months to demonstrate the need for change, develop a 
detailed plan, and explain its costs and implementation.</P>
<P>	We were quickly able to show why a complete overhaul was necessary. 
Convicted felons were serving about one-third of their sentences on average, 
and many served only one-sixth. Violent criminals were no exception. First-
degree murderers were given average sentences of 35 years, but spent an 
average of only 10 years behind bars. Rapists were being sentenced to nine 
years and serving four. Armed robbers received sentences averaging 14 years 
and served only about four.</P>
<P>	Amazingly, a prior conviction for a violent crime did not affect this 
phenomenon. Even murderers, rapists, and armed robbers who had already 
served time for similar offenses were receiving the same sentences and 
serving the same amount of time as first offenders.</P>
<P>	Statewide, the violent crime rate had risen 28 percent in five years, 
even though the crime-prone age bracket (15 to 24 years) was shrinking. 
Criminologists widely regard trends in the size of this demographic group as 
the best predictor of criminal activity. Unfortunately for Virginians, the 
crime-prone-age population is expected to rise sharply in the state beginning 
in 1996--all the more reason to press forward with reform. The peak age for 
murder and armed robbery has been dropping steadily; by 1993, it stood at 18 
years for both crimes. More than three-quarters of all violent criminals in the 
system in 1993 had prior convictions.</P>
<BR>
<H3>The Plan</H3>
<P>	Only a multi-pronged approach can begin to turn these numbers 
around. Virginia's new law means, first of all, eliminating discretionary 
parole, in which a parole board can release an offender after he has served 
only part of his sentence. In Virginia, this policy clearly was being abused: 
offenders received 30 days of good time for every 30 days they served--
effectively cutting their sentences in half as soon as they came in the door.</P>
<P>	But this is not all. We need to eliminate "good time" as well. In order to 
encourage good behavior among inmates and allow correctional officers to 
maintain order, the commission proposed a system of earned-sentence 
credits. This system would allow inmates to earn a maximum of 54 days per 
year--a dramatic reduction from the average of 300 days they had been given 
in the past.</P>
<P>	Long before our bill became law, we held town meetings across the 
state to solicit advice from citizens, and discussed the plan's details with 
prosecutors, victims-rights groups, corrections experts, and criminologists. 
The need for more prison space became a primary concern. Even before I took 
office, Virginia was expected to double its prison population by the year 2005. 
The state was facing a shortfall of 7,100 prison beds by 1999. At the same 
time, opponents of the plan were already carping about too little spending on 
crime prevention and education and too much on building prisons.</P>
<P>	Obviously, judges need some mechanism to guide their sentencing 
decisions. A system with no parole and no "good time" could not afford 70-
year sentences for drug dealers or 150-year sentences for armed robbers. But 
how much do we increase the time served for violent offenders? Our 
commission found an answer by evaluating the relationship of recidivism to 
time served and age of release. The data showed that the longer an offender 
remained behind bars, the less likely he is to commit another crime after 
finishing his sentence. Similarly, the older the offender upon release, the less 
his propensity to commit more crime. In fact, after 37 years of age, the 
likelihood of violent crime drops dramatically.</P>
<P>   Although preventing criminals from committing further acts of violence was 
the primary goal, the increases had to reflect the notion of retribution as well. 
We wanted Virginia to send a message to violent criminals: We will not 
tolerate violence, and if you commit a violent crime, you will stay in prison 
until you're too old to commit another one.</P>
<P>	Virginia increased prison time for violent criminals as follows:
<UL>
<LI>  100 percent increase for first-time violent offenders.
<LI>  125 percent for first-time murderers, rapists, and armed robbers.
<LI>  300 percent for those with previous convictions for assault, burglary, or 
malicious wounding.
 <LI> 500 percent for those with previous convictions for murder, rape, or armed 
robbery.</UL>
<P>	To target the young violent offender, we counted comparable juvenile 
offenses as felony convictions when determining a sentence. For example, if 
John Smith is found guilty in a juvenile court of armed robbery at age 14, and 
was convicted of another armed robbery at age 19, the sentencing guidelines 
call for a 500 percent increase in the time he normally would have served 
under the old system.</P>
<P>	By abolishing a bankrupt parole system, and by drastically reforming 
the "good time" credit provisions, Virginia courtrooms are redefining what the 
truth-in-sentencing debate is really about. Under our system, every inmate 
convicted of a violent crime will serve a minimum of 85 percent of his or her 
sentence. Nationwide, criminals on average serve well below 50 percent of 
their sentences. There is simply no surer way for the state to protect its 
citizens from society's most dangerous members.</P>
<BR>
<H3>Saving Lives and Money</H3>
<P>	 Had the law been in effect nine years ago, it would have saved the life 
of Detective Taylor. Had it been in effect four years ago, Leo Webb would be 
alive today.</P>
<P>	The most conservative estimates show that more than 4,300 felony 
crimes would have been prevented between 1986 and 1993 if the current 
system had been in place. That number is based on actual convictions--real 
cases, not projections.</P>
<P>	Over the next 10 years, the new law will prevent at least 119,000 
felonies, including 26,000 violent crimes. Because of those averted violent 
crimes, an estimated 475 lives will be saved, 3,700 women will be spared from 
rape, and more than 11,300 aggravated assaults will not be committed. As a 
result, citizens will save more than $2.7 billion in direct costs.</P>
<P>	Back in September, when it became clear that the legislation would 
pass with overwhelming support, some vocal opponents claimed that 
abolishing parole was a declaration of war on young black males. They 
demanded that the Commonwealth spend more money on prevention 
programs, and charged that, by focusing on punishment, we were merely 
catering to "white fear." Their arguments fell on deaf ears.</P>
<P>	The crime prevented as a result of the new law will benefit the African-
American community--one-fifth of Virginia's population--more than any 
other group. Of the preventable murders that occurred between 1986 and 
1993, about 65 percent involved black victims. For assaults during that same 
period, about 60 percent of the victims were black. Taylor and Webb were 
both African Americans.</P>
<P>	Of all the crimes committed by recidivists during that same period, 60 
percent would have been prevented if the current law had been in place. 
There is no other prevention program that can show even a fraction of this 
success. That is not to say that other prevention programs are not valid or 
important. However, it is clear that when it comes to violent offenders, 
incarceration is the most just and the most efficient.</P>
<P>	Virginia has been spending an average of $658 million in taxpayers' 
money each year on handling recidivists. This is the cost of new 
investigations, new arrests, and new trials. The total cost of the prison 
construction needs for the next 10 years is about $750 million. The new law 
will force us to build more prisons--but not many more. Virginia would have 
doubled its prison population in the next 10 years anyway.</P>
<P>	The difference is that under the old system, the ratio of violent 
criminals among the prison population to non-violent has been 50:50. 
Marijuana dealers, embezzlers, and petty thieves have been serving time in 
the same $40,000-per-year hard cells as murderers, rapists, and armed 
robbers. Under the new guidelines, the inmate ratio will be 70 percent 
violent, 30 percent non-violent. This is obviously a more cost-effective use of 
medium- and maximum-security prison space.</P>
<P>	Try telling that, however, to the liberals in the General Assembly. I 
asked lawmakers in February for $402.6 million as a first installment in 
revamping our prison system. They voted to provide only $104.4 million. They 
are shortchanging prison construction, making it more likely that dangerous 
criminals will be released early--and be back in our neighborhoods. 
Increasing prison terms without increasing prison capacity is precisely the 
mistake that too many other states have already made.</P>
<P>	Part of the problem with the current system of incarceration is its near 
inability to distinguish between dangerous criminals and the more routine, 
petty offenders. Under our plan, we are building low-cost work centers to 
house first-time and non-violent offenders. These work centers operate at 
about half the cost per inmate as a standard prison, and they ensure that the 
inmates get work opportunities while incarcerated. The average length of 
stay at a work center will be about 10 to 18 months. We can build these 
facilities quickly, freeing up bed space in the prisons for violent criminals.</P>
<P>	The abolition of parole and establishment of truth-in-sentencing rules 
was the centerpiece of my campaign for governor in 1993. During that 
campaign, critics claimed my approach was too drastic and too costly. Pundits 
and politicians still doubt that Virginia can overhaul its entire criminal-
justice system without breaking the bank. Those naysayers failed to hear the 
public's demand for change. The people of Virginia--particularly crime 
victims and their families--are tired of seeing criminals walk free after 
serving only a fraction of their sentences. Businessmen can't afford to watch 
deals collapse because potential clients are concerned about crime. 
Prosecutors and police are frustrated that their hard work often amounts to 
abbreviated prison stints for criminals.</P>
<P>	In order to overturn the status quo approach to crime reduction, we 
listened to all those people and presented extensive research to show that 
what we had been doing was not working. Public safety is the primary 
responsibility of government. Without it, nothing else can succeed. Education, 
economic development, and health care all suffer when people feel 
threatened.</P>
<P>	Virginians came together to formulate and implement this reform. We 
looked at what North Carolina, Texas, Florida, and the federal government 
had done in the area of sentencing reform. We borrowed some of the best 
aspects of those systems and avoided some of the mistakes they made. In the 
end, we did it the Virginia way.</P>
<P>	The principle that guided this effort, and should guide policymakers in 
all issues, is honesty. Easy-release rules prevent judges and juries from 
preempting the community's judgment about the proper punishment for 
illegal conduct. Under the new law, judges will not have to play guessing 
games when imposing sentences. Police officers will not have to see the same 
criminals out on the streets only a year after their last arrest. Criminals will 
know that they cannot beat the system. Crime victims and their families will 
finally see justice done. Virginia's citizens can now trust that their 
government is working to make this Commonwealth a safe place to live, to 
work, and to raise families.</P>

<h2>Press Conference Statement by C DeLores Tucker<br>
Chair, National Political Congress of Black Women, Inc.</h2><P>
<i>October 26, 1995</i><P>
<br width=50% size=3></center><P>

I regret that a long standing engagement prevents me from joining <a href="/empower/pr1026a.html">Bill Bennett</a> and <a href="/empower/pr1026b.html">Joe Lieberman</a> this morning at this timely and necessary press conference. However, I am proud to join with them in focusing on other segments of the entertainment industry that is constantly poisoning the cultural environment of our society. <a href="/empower/pr1026c.html">Mindless television</a> shows that target young audiences are corrupting our culture and doing great harm to our children. I believe that it is time to confront the performers and companies that produce these shows. In our campaign against Time-Warner's involvement in the production and distribution of Gangsta Rap music to children we did not get results until Bill Bennett and I confronted the executives of Time-Warner. It is time now to confront those responsible for these culturally corrupt television shows.
          <P>
If we are to restore a measure of decency to the cultural mainstream of our society we must expand our efforts to the area of television. Those who produce and air these degrading and denigrating shows need to be made aware of what they are doing to the youth of America.
<P>
I look forward to working with Sen. Lieberman and Dr. Bennett and in this on-going public campaign.

<title>Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Almost three years ago, then presidential candidate Bill Clinton stated that increasing the minimum wage is "the wrong way to raise the incomes of low-wage earners."  The wrong way back then, but the right way now as increasing the minimum wage is viewed as a politically popular strategy to reconnect with the Democrat's traditional base of working class Americans.<p>
While most economists agree that minimum wage increases do more economic harm than good (both for workers and the economy), President Clinton has proposed a 21 percent increase from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour.<p>
Democratic party leaders in the Congress are also working feverishly to include a
minimum wage hike into welfare reform proposals, presumably to be acted upon this fall.<p>
Studies conducted over the past 25 years have consistently concluded that with each 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, a corresponding 1 percent to 2 percent decline in entry-level employment results.  The General Accounting Office,  the Brookings Institution, the Employment Policies Institute Foundation, the Congressional Budget Office and various Presidential Commission's have all reached this universal conclusion.<p>
Even the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the "New Democrat" organization once led by the President, declared that "the minimum wage can be allowed to fade into history." <p>    
As minimum wage hike proponents pose the issue as improving the living wage of lower-income workers, most businesses and their workers view minimum wage jobs as entry-level positions -- by which the majority of workers gain skills to move onto higher-paying work.<p>
An independent study in 1992 demonstrated that within a 12 month period, 63 percent of American workers at the minimum wage earned higher wages.   Not surprisingly, about half of minimum wage employees were either young adults under the age of 21, or teenagers. <p>
According to a study by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank in
Washington, D.C., raising the minimum wage emotionally appeals to most Americans, but doing it would be a mistake.<p>
According to the foundation study:<p>
<ul>
<li>Raising the minimum wage will harm the nonworking poor by raising prices and
destroying entry-level job opportunities.
<li>Raising the minimum wage does not generally help low-income households -- the increased income from minimum wage jobs would mostly go to families far above the
poverty level, not to poor minimum wage workers.
<li>Employers will respond to a minimum wage increase by cutbacks in hiring, reducing
workers' hours, or lowering pay and benefits and skipping pay raises -- responses that
hurt, not help, workers.
<li>A $5.15 increase in the minimum wage will result in approximately 400,000 lost entry-level jobs.  A wage increase may result in more skilled workers being enticed into the job market, but fewer unskilled job opportunities (entry-level jobs) would be available.</ul><p>
Grant Maloy, a small business operator from Orlando, Fl., testified earlier in the year
before the Joint Economic Committee on the President's proposal to raise the minimum wage.  As the owner of a wholesale foliage nursery, Maloy stated that his industry pays $5.24 for entry-level work, well above the minimum wage.<p>
"Wages have increased because of pressure both within the industry and from other
industries, as well as the need to keep quality employees.  How is it possible that one central government can know what millions of businesses can afford to pay?  The answer is they can't," says Maloy.<p>
According to Maloy, minimum wage policy is insincere.  While the government expects a
business owner to pay a minimum wage, the owner himself may be making much less.  Maloy estimated that he was making about $2.00 an hour when he started his business.<p>
Surveys of the American public continue to show widespread support for increasing the
minimum wage, and in 1989 Congress overwhelmingly backed the last minimum wage increase -- more than 90 percent voted in favor of the hike.<p>
Political experts agree that if a proposal to increase the minimum wage makes its way to the House or Senate floor for a vote, it may pass.  No member in Congress wants to be labeled as "anti-worker" despite the widespread research showing the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage on those it purportedly is supposed to help.<p>
On the other hand, the public's dissatisfaction with Washington and misguided
government attempts to solve every problem may indeed resonate with the minimum wage issue as well.<p>
More importantly however, is how the public will view the President's proposal.  Is the
President proposing to raise the minimum wage to truly help the working poor?  Or will the public perceive his proposal as a political ploy to gain votes in 1996.<p>
What remains certain though, is the growing universal belief that the minimum wage
does little for increasing job opportunities for those who need it most.<p>

I am interested in a position that will allow me to combine the talents I have developed in both political analysis and economics.  However, as you can see from the attached <a href="file:///J|/COMMON/INTERNS/NICKG/resume.htm">resume</a>, I have extensive experience in many related fields, and I always enjoy new challenges. 
 
<p>I feel that it is important for me to maintain a practical, real-world perspective while developing my academic abilities. I am proud of the fact that I have financed my entire education through scholarships and summer jobs related to my field of study.  This work experience has enhanced my appreciation for the education I am pursuing.  I find that I learn as much from my summer jobs as I do from my academic studies.  For example, during the summer of 1995, while working for the National Center for Policy Analysis, I gained a great deal of practical experience in the field of public policy development and critique.  When I returned to school in the fall and took Advanced Policy Analysis, I found that my experience with the NCPA had thoroughly prepared me for the subject. 
 
<p>Having said all this, I realize that your first consideration in hiring an applicant must not be the potential educational experience Heritage can provide, but the skills and services the applicant has to offer.  I hope the experience and education described in my resume suggest how I might be of service to Heritage. 
 
<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss with you how I might best assist Heritage in fulfilling its present corporate needs.  I will be available for employment from May 14 through August 31, 1996.  Please let me know what summer internship opportunities are available at Heritage for someone with my education, experience, and interests.  You can reach me at the above address or by phone at (518) 555-0000.
<P>
Thank you for your consideration. 
<p>

plain of western Kansas.  This common sense conservative from America's heartland
has unparalleled experience as the present Senate Majority Leader and having been Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, a candidate for President, his party's nominee for Vice President, a member of the House of Representatives, the Chairman of the Republican Party, a state legislator, and a county attomey.

LEADERSHIP<p>

President Reagan said of Senator Dole that 'His title of Leader is not just a job title, it's a
description of the man." President Bush went on to call Senator Dole "a great Republican
Leader, as great as any in the past." Bob Dole is only one of 15 Americans ever to serve
as Senate Majority Leader, and his first stint in that position in the mid-1980s won
national praise.  The <i>Congrestional Ouarrerly</i> cited Senator Dole as having "proved a
point that badly needed proving at the time.  The Senate could be led."

Senator Dole's effectiveness as a consensus-builder and his commitment to both deficit
reduction and economic growth have eamed him accolades from his peers -- Republicans,
Independents, and Democrats alike.  On issue after issue, Senator Dole is a statesman
who has made his mark.  A survey conducted by the <i>Des Moines Register</i> concluded that
Senator Dole is "easily [America's] most influential maker of farm policy." Senator Dole
has earned national praise for his leadership on behalf of the disadvantaged and
Americans with disabilities, and for his mastery of foreign affairs.

SACRIFICE<p>

During World War II, Bob Dole was a platoon leader in the legendy Tenth Mountain Division in Italy.  He was gravely wounded on the battlefield in 1945 and twice decorated
for heroic achievement.  His decorations include two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star
with Oak leaf Cluster.

FAMILY<p>

Senator Dole was born in Russell, Kansas, and is married to Elizabeth Hanford Dole,
President of the American Red Cross.  Senator Dole also has a daughter, Robin, who
resides in Washington, DC.

<title>Pete Wilson: Biography</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Pete Wilson: Biography</h2>
</center>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
As Governor of California since 1991, Pete Wilson has not only led his state through tough times, but has achieved fundamental change that has attracted attention from around the nation.
<P>
Throughout his career, Pete Wilson has shown the optimism, confidence,
vision, and courage to make change and to lead.
<P>
Governor Wilson has enacted what <I>The San Francisco Chronicle</I> called "some of the boldest welfare reforms in the nation" to promote work and encourage individual responsibility."
<P>
He was the first governor in the nation to sign a "Three Strikes and You're Out" bill into law. He also sponsored and signed California's "One Strike" law, one of the toughest laws in the country targeting rapists and child molesters.  And Pete Wilson was
 the first governor in a quarter-century to enforce California's death penalty.
<P>
Governor Wilson is the national leader in the drive to stop illegal immigration. He was a leading proponent in the successful campaign to pass Proposition 187, an initiative to cut off taxpayer-supported services to illegal immigrants.
<P>
Pete Wilson has achieved all this despite a first term that saw natural disasters -- including floods, earthquakes and wildfires -- a prolonged recession, severe cutbacks in California's aerospace industry and painful military base closings.
<P>
But then, Pete Wilson has never shied away from a challenge.
<P>
Pete Wilson has born August 23, 1933, in Lake Forest, Illinois, and raised in Missouri, where he excelled as a student and an athlete. He attended Yale University on a Naval ROTC scholarship and served three years as a Marine Corps infantry officer before

going on to earn a law degree from the University of California, Berkeley.
<P>
Elected to the California Assembly in 1966, the same year that Ronald Reagan was first elected governor, Pete Wilson went on to serve as the highly effective Mayor of San Diego for more than a decade. He amended the city charter to make public safety the 
first and most important responsibility of city government and increased the number of
police officers patrolling San Diego's streets.
<P>
As a United States Senator, Pete Wilson's fiscal conservatism earned him the Watchdog of the Treasury Award every year when he was in Washington. And his toughness was proven yet again when, recovering from a burst appendix, he was wheeled into the Senate
 on a gurney to cast a tie-breaking vote for deficit reduction.
<P>
As Governor of California, Governor Wilson has made the tough choices necessary to keep state spending  $18 billion below the level projected four years earlier and to actually reduce the state's General Fund budget from one year to the next, for the firs
t time since World War II.  He also trimmed the state bureaucracy to its lowest level, as a percentage of state population, since Ronald Reagan was governor.
<P>
To improve California's jobs climate, Governor Wilson reformed the state's notoriously corrupt and job-killing workers' compensation system -- reforms that have cut rates by more than 30 percent.  He enacted job-creating tax incentives equal to a 10 perce
nt cut in the corporate and business income tax, and is now pursuing a 15 percent tax cut for every business and individual in the state.
<P>
In 1994, Governor Wilson was overwhelmingly re-elected by the voters, who gave him more votes than any other governor in California history.  
<P>
During his re-election campaign, <I>The Los Angeles Times</I> broke a 24-year tradition of neutrality in gubernatorial races to endorse Governor Wilson for re-election saying: "Wilson is a firm, hands-on administrator ... [who] is taking on the state
bureaucracy and streamlining government."
<P>
<I>The San Francisco Chronicle</I> also endorsed him noting that "Wilson's effectiveness, industry, persistence and toughness under fire have been tested and proven in the cauldron of a painful and gloomy period of California history."
<P>
In his second Inaugural Address, Governor Wilson described his vision for a better California as a place "where work is respected and rewarded, where every right is balanced by responsibility, and where freedom thrives and opportunity burns bright."
<P>
The Governor lives in suburban Sacramento with his wife, Gayle, and enjoys reading history and cheering for the San Diego Chargers.

<title>Senator Arlen Spector: Biography</title>
</head>                         
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Senator Arlen Specter: Biography</h2>
</center>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
U.S. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania declared his candidacy for
President of the United States on March 30, 1995. That announcement
followed a whirlwind 100 days of exploratory travels that drew enthusiastic
support across the country, along with organizational and fundraising
triumphs.<p>
Sen. Specter is a fiscal/economic conservative and social libertarian, in
the spirit of his former Senate colleague Barry Goldwater, who said
government should stay out of our pocketbooks, off our backs and out of our
bedrooms. Sen. Specter introduced legislation in March 1995 to replace the
nation's Byzantine income tax system with a simple 20 percent flat tax on
businesses and individuals. His plan would spur economic growth, increase
fairness and compliance and save taxpayers billions of dollars and hours.
Sen. Specter is pressing to remove the anti-abortion plank from the
national platform.<p>
Sen. Specter chairs the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He also
chairs the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Labor, Health & Human
Services and Education, which oversees all federal health and education
spending. He has introduced several bills that emphasize preventive health
care and cost cutting without new bureaucracy.<p>
Sen. Specter began his public service career as Assistant District Attorney
of Philadelphia, winning the first national conviction of labor racketeers.
He quickly earned a reputation as a tough and effective prosecutor, which
led to an appointment in 1964 as assistant counsel to the Warren Commission
to investigate the assassination of President Kennedy. He is credited with
a major role in the investigation.<p>
His legal achievements led to his election as District Attorney of
Philadelphia in 1965, the first election of a Republican in more than 18
years, and re-election in 1969 by more than 100,000 votes. During his two
consecutive terms, he helped to restore death penalty statutes in
Pennsylvania, worked to improve prison conditions and prosecuted consumer
fraud cases. He fought relentlessly to convict corrupt public officials,
rapists and hardened criminals.<p>
Arlen Specter was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1980. He has established
himself as a legislative leader on crime, drugs and terrorism, and is the
only candidate with hands-on crime-fighting experience. He has introduced
several bills to limit the endless appeals in capital cases, to make the
death penalty a meaningful deterrent. His Armed Career Criminal Act, signed
into law in 1984 and expanded in the 1986, makes it a federal offense with
a mandatory 15 years to life sentence for a career criminal found in
possession of a firearm. This law has been especially effective against
major drug dealers. Sen. Specter also crafted the Terrorist Prosecution
Act, a tough anti-terrorism bill, and wrote legislation creating the
independent CIA Inspector General, the only reform legislation to emerge
from the Iran-Contra affair.<p>
Arlen Specter was born to immigrant parents in Wichita, Kansas, on Feb. 12,
1930, and grew up in the small town of Russell. After graduating Phi Beta
Kappa from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951, he served stateside in
the Air Force Office of Special Investigations for two years during the
Korean War. He graduated in 1956 from Yale Law School where he was an
editor of the law journal.<p>
Sen. Specter lives in Philadelphia with his wife, Philadelphia Councilwoman
Joan Specter. They have two sons, Shanin and Stephen, and a granddaughter,
Silvi Specter.<p>

<title>Congressman Robert Dornan's Biography</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Robert K. Dornan Biograohy</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
U.S. Congressman Robert K. Dornan, from Garden Grove, California, now serving in his
eighth term, represents California's 46th Congressional District.  Located in Orange County south
of Los Angeles, the District is comprised of all or parts of the cities of Anaheim, Santa Ana,
Garden Grove, Tustin, Irvine, Stanton, Orange, Fountain Valley and Fullerton.<p>
<h2>Congressional Duties</h2><p>
Congressman Dornan represented California's 27th District beach cities in Los Angeles
County from January 1977 to January 1983.  In 1984, he was elected from California's 38th
District in central Orange County.  Much of the 38th was reapportioned into the 46th District in
1992.<p>
Because of his background in national security, Dornan was chosen to serve on the Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence.  He also serves on the Armed Services Committee where he has
championed such vital defense projects as funding for the B- I and B-2 bombers, the F/A- 18 fighter and
the V-22 tiltrotor, development of effective ground combat identification systems, and maintaining proper
levels of Guard and reserve forces.  As the Defense Department downsizes in the post Cold War era,
Dornan has worked to assist those U.S. soldiers, sailors and airmen who will be released from duty.  His
proposal to assist discharged service members gain teacher certification will help integrate former militarypersonnel into the civilian economy and also help raise the quality of American education by tapping into the vast human resources and expertise of U.S. armed forces personnel.<p>
Dornan was a member of the former Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control
where he was involved in formulating U.S. policy to fight the war on illegal drugs.  He is an active
supporter of the new "Weed and Seed" program that is designed to "weed out" criminals in drug-infested areas and plant the seeds of economic and educational opportunity.  As a result of Dornan's efforts, an area of Santa Ana, California, has been designated as a "Weed and Seed Pilot Program."<p>
Dornan's other congressional duties include memberships on the Human Rights Caucus, Grace
Commission Caucus, Empowerment Caucus and Hispanic Caucus.  He is a permanent observer to the
Geneva Arms Control Negotiations.  During 1989 and '90, Dornan chaired the Republican Study
Committee.  He continues to sit on the RSC Executive Committee and chair its foreign affairs and
defense task force.  He is co-chairman of the Republican POW/MIA Task Force.  He is a member of
congressional task forces on Tax Policy and Job Opportunities, Welfare Reform, the Strategic Defense
Initiative, Civil Rights, and Terrorism.<p>
 Dornan is honorary president of the American Chapter of the International Committee for a
Free Vietnam.<p>
<h2>Personal</h2><p>
Congressman Dornan, a Roman Catholic, was born in New York City on April 3,
1933, to Harry and Mickey McFadden Dornan.  He married the former Sallie Hansen of Santa
Monica, California, on April 16, 1955.  They have five children: Robin Mary, Robert Jr.,
Theresa Ann, Mark, and Kathleen Regina.  The Dornans have nine grandchildren.<p>
<h2>Professional Experience</h2><p>
After graduating from Loyola High School in Los Angeles in 1950 and attending Loyola
University until 1953, Congressman Dornan, at age 19, volunteered for service in the United States Air
Force.  Upon earning his silver wings, he served as a peacetime fighter pilot with the world's first
supersonic jet fighter wing.  In 1958, Dornan left active duty and joined the California Air National Guard
as a fighter pilot and then the U.S. Air Force Reserve as a rescue and seaplane pilot and an intelligence
officer, achieving the rank of captain.  He survived two jet fighter emergency parachute ejections as well
as two "dead stick" forced landings (F- 1 00 jet fighter and H- 1 3 solo helicopter).<p>
Dornan has piloted virtually every aircraft in the U. S. military arsenal including the B-1, U-2 and
the SR-71 "Blackbird" as well as the Israeli "Kfir," the British "Tornado," "Harrier" and "Hawk," and the
French "Mirage." He completed his service in the Reserve in May 1975.<p>
Dornan produced and hosted radio and television public affairs shows in Los Angeles
from 1965 to 1976.  In 1968 and 1969, he was awarded Emmys.<p>
Throughout the 1960s, Dornan was active in domestic civil rights activities.  He marched
with Rev.  Martin L. King, Jr., in August 1963.  In addition, in 1970, on his television program
"The Robert K. Dornan Show," he originated the POW/MIA bracelet as worn by more than 5
million Americans and, in 1979, the Prisoner of Conscience bracelet worn for Soviet Jewish and
Christian dissidents.<p>
 Dornan was president of the American Space Frontier Political Action Committee from
1983 to 1988.<p>
<h2>Awards and Honors</h2><p>
In recent years, Congressman Dornan has been recognized for his efforts to spur economic
growth by working to reduce taxes and government spending.  For example, the National Tax
Limitation Committee rated him 100 percent for his record of fiscal responsibility and the
National Taxpayers Union ranked the congressman as one of the 30 most frugal members of the
House.  Dornan has also received the Golden Bull-dog Award from the Watchdogs of the Treasury
and the Jefferson Award from Citizens for a Sound Economy.<p>
In addition, Dornan received the Spirit of Enterprise Award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
the Guardian of Small Business Award from the National Federation of Independent Business, the SoundDollar Award from the Free Congress Foundation, the Thomas Jefferson Award from the Food
Distribution Industry, the National Leadership Award from the American Security Council, and an award

endorse for president then Vice President George Bush.  He seconded the nomination of Bush
for President at the New Orleans Republican National Convention on August 17, 1988.  During
the 1988 campaign, he campaigned in more states (34) than any other of Bush's surrogate
speakers.  In 1992, Congressman Dornan was again national co-chairman and California vice
chairman of the Bush for President campaign.<p>

<h2>Richard Lugar: Biography</h2>
</center>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
Senator, Farm Manager, Educator, Mayor, Entrepreneur, School Board Member,
Naval Officer, Rhodes Scholar, Valedictorian, Runner, Grandfather, Father,
Husband...Statesman.<p>
Richard Green Lugar-a fifth generation Hoosier-is the senior United States
Senator from Indiana. The former two-term mayor of Indianapolis was elected
to the Senate in 1976, and re-elected in 1982 and 1988.<p>
Surveys have shown that Lugar is the most popular public figure in Indiana;
he shattered all statewide election records in his last campaign, capturing
the most total votes, 1,430,525, greatest plurality, 761,737, highest
percentage, 68.1, and most counties, 91 of 92.<p>
<h2>National Leader in Agriculture, Nutrition, Forestry</h2><p>
While known as a valued national spokesman for U.S. interests in
international debate, Lugar is the highest ranking Republican official in
agricultural matters, as senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
Lugar often worked on his father's Marion County farm as a boy and
continues to actively manage the cultivation of its 604 acres of corn,
soybeans and trees.<p>
<h2>Outstanding Legislator</h2><p>
During his third Senate term, Lugar became the fourth person ever named
"Outstanding Legislator" by the American Political Science Association.
In addition to noting bills successfully authored by Lugar, the award
recognized his ability to extend his influence on policy and public opinion
beyond traditional limits of parliamentary debate. For example, Lugar is
credited with helping generate crucial political and public support for
U.S. military action in the Persian Gulf War by leading the national debate
with several bold policy statements-prodding the public, (Congress and the
Bush Administration) to action.<p>
<h2>Democracy's Advocate</h2><p>
During the 99th Congress (1985,'86), Lugar served as chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, restoring its power and eminence. In 1986,
Lugar entered the crucible of the Philippines presidential election, where
he recognized Corazon Aquino as the legitimate winner and spotlighted the
corrupt activities of supporters of former President Ferdinanci Marcos
ultimately convincing President Reagan to back Aquino.<p>
In 1993, Lugar was named to the prestigious Intelligence Committee by
Senate leadership recognition of the value of his involvement in nearly all
aspects of U.S. national security.<p>
As a Navy ensign in the late 1950's, Lugar served in the highly sensitive
position of naval intelligence briefer. He rose at 2:30 am, memorized
overnight intelligence reports from around the globe and summarized them
verbally for the Navy chief, CIA director and others. Lugar also briefed
President Eisenhower in the White House.<p>
Starting in 1991, Lugar and Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn, of Georgia,
forged an effective bipartisan alliance aimed at prompt dismantlement and
conversion of the post-Cold War Soviet nuclear stockpile.<p>
<h2>International Trade Adds Hoosier Jobs</h2><p>
Lugar also promotes U.S. political, diplomatic and military leadership in
world affairs as a critical factor in domestic politics. Hailing from a
state which ranks among the very top exporters per capita, Lugar advocates
the expansion of global trade. He has sponsored trade conferences in
Indiana, and encourages foreign leaders to buy Indiana products.<p>
<h2>Progressive Mayor of Major City</h2><p>
As the former mayor of Indianapolis and president of the National League of
Cities (1970-'71), Lugar is an expert in economic development, housing and
other urban issues. As the chief executive of his hometown from 1968-'75,
Lugar revolutionized the very form and function of the nation's 12th
largest metropolitan government by unifying Indianapolis' downtown and
urban neighborhoods with surrounding suburban communities.<p>
Lugar is a running enthusiast who promotes health and nutrition programs.
As Roll Call Magazine stated: "Lugar is more than fast. He is in remarkable
overall physical condition, as tough as the limestone for which his state
is famous."<p>
<h2>The Fiscal Conservative</h2><p>
In Congress, Lugar supports the pro-growth policies of low taxes and tight
purse strings; he is an advocate of a balanced budget amendment and line
item veto. Lugar is known by his colleagues for discipline and fiscal
prudence, having maintained a 98 percent voting attendance records and
having voluntarily returned more than $2.4 million in office funds.<p>

<h2>Biographical Chronology</h2><p>
Dick Lugar was born April 4, 1932 in Indianapolis, Indiana. He graduated
first in his class with straight A's, both at Shortridge High School and
Denison University, in Ohio. Lugar was co-president of the student
government at Denison with his future wife, Charlene Smeltzer. They married
September 8, 1956 and have four sons and six grandchildren.<p>
Charlene has established an endowment fund for fighting birth defects and
infant deaths, in part through prenatal care provided aboard the
"Mom-mobile," which tours urban neighborhoods. She has said that her goal
is "to make Indiana the safest place in the world to have a baby."<p>
Dick Lugar graduated from Denison in 1954, then became a Rhodes Scholar in
Pembroke College at Oxford University. Next he volunteered for active duty
in the Navy, in which he served three years and four months. In 1960, Lugar
returned from the Pentagon to Indiana to help manage his family's farm and
food machinery firm, Thomas L. Green & Company. Founded by his grandfather,
the small manufacturing concern on Indianapolis' near west side celebrated
its 100th anniversary in 1993.<p>
Dick Lugar succeeded in his first run for public office when he won a seat
on the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners. Lugar then defied
odds-makers in 1967, winning the first of two mayoral terms. In 1976 Lugar
won a seat in the U.S. Senate, after an unsuccessful bid two years earlier.
After his reelection in 1982, he was elected to the Senate Leadership as
chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. In 1985, the
Republican caucus picked him to be chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee. Lugar was named the co-chairman of the Arms Control Observer
Group in 1985, and was appointed to the Intelligence Committee and
Congressional Reform Committee in 1993.<p>

<CENTER><B>Daniel Casse on Lamar Alexander</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT></B>amar Alexander is an unorthodox, populist, and persuasive Republican
leader. That is why I gladly moved from Washington to Nashville
to work on his presidential campaign, and why I believe he will
be the party's nominee in 1996. 

<P>
Our legislative branch's leadership
of national government is a temporary (albeit fascinating) phenomenon.
But we need our next president to set the agenda, not take his
cues from Congress. Conservatives should be looking for a candidate
who can present a bold design for government along with the ability
to execute it. 

<P>
Lamar Alexander has the imagination, energy, and
executive background to do both. The major themes of his campaign-growth,
freedom, and personal responsibility-are indisputably conservative.
But what distinguishes him is his unorthodox approach to politics,
his populist style of governance, and his skills of persuasion.


<P>
<B>Unorthodox.</B> In 1978, Alexander was elected governor of Tennessee,
only the third Republican to win that office this century. Nothing
that followed was typical, either. He began his crusade to improve
Tennessee's pitiful public-school system by introducing merit
pay and master teachers, relatively radical notions that weakened
the teacher unions. The National Education Association fought
him vigorously. He ignored warnings that it was hopeless, fought
back, and won. 

<P>
Alexander broke new ground on other issues. At
a time when most governors were using state airplanes to fly to
Washington, Alexander closed Tennessee's D.C. office altogether.
He chided other governors for behaving like senators. As early
as 1981, he advised President Reagan to end the federal role in
education. Four years later, he called two relatively unknown
congressmen named Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott and invited them
to join a small group of GOP governors to plot a united strategy
for second stage of the Reagan Revolution. 

<P>
He showed the same
verve when he arrived at the Department of Education in 1991.
By then, the intellectual excitement of the Bill Bennett years
had passed, and the Bush administration's school-choice agenda
amounted to little more than photo-ops with local education activists.
Alexander understood that school choice-despised by country-club
Republicans and misunderstood by most suburbanites-was at risk
of becoming a political loser. His &quot;America 2000&quot; program
was a true grass-roots initiative that breathed life into education
reform. Conventional wisdom dubbed it a quirky agenda that offered
little federal legislation. But it tapped into a decentralization
movement that remains the only path to school choice. His 1992
school-choice bill was a true voucher program for public, private,
and parochial schools, but the Democrats in Congress made sure
it never came to a vote. 

<P>
<B>Populist.</B> Alexander's well-publicized
assault on Congress-&quot;cut their pay and send them home&quot;-is
no mere slogan. It reveals his deep sympathy with the populism
that has justifiably become the bedrock of conservative politics.
An unapologetic champion of term limits, he sincerely believes
that a citizen legislature would transform the character of the
federal government. With none of Ross Perot's demagoguery, Alexander
offers a mature, but no less revolutionary, brand of popular discontent
with government in Washington. 

<P>
While some Republicans still waver
on the wisdom of block grants, Alexander is advancing the idea
both philosophically and practically. He suggests ending the federal
role in education, welfare, and job training altogether. He applauded
the Supreme Court decision striking down the 1990 Gun-Free Schools
Zone Act, an attempt to federalize local responsibility that every
GOP senator supported. &quot;We know what to do&quot; is the central
tenet of his populist conservative political theory, which holds
that Americans should be given the freedom to make decisions about
their own lives. Although every Republican will offer bromides
about &quot;states' rights&quot; or &quot;new federalism&quot;
during the coming months, Alexander's own policy prescriptions
suggest a fully conceived populist vision.

<P>
<B>Persuasive.</B> If conservatives
are to remake government, we must do more than merely express
support for conservative ideas. We must also win over others not
fully in our camp. It didn't take much leadership to point out
that the Clinton health-care plan was a socialistic fantasy. The
political challenge was to convince half the nation-including
many Democrats-that the Clinton plan was bad medicine. 

<P>
The job
of president is almost entirely about setting a principled agenda
and then persuading the country of its wisdom. Alexander's public
career has prepared him to do just that. As governor, he led a
Democratic legislature toward his goals. When 38 governors competed
to get GM's Saturn division to build its plant in their states,
Tennessee won, in part because Alexander convinced the company's
executives that a right-to-work state with school choice, merit
pay, and no income tax was the best environment for business.
No tax breaks were involved. 

<P>
As the chairman of the National Governors
Association, he transformed its agenda by convincing fellow members-including
Bill Clinton, John Sununu, Dick Thornburgh, and Michael Dukakis-that
they should end their obsession with Washington issues and focus
on state matters instead. 

<P>
A president who is at once unorthodox,
populist, and persuasive will quickly establish a very different
type of presidency. But that is exactly what conservatives and
libertarians should be looking for next year.The danger we face
is that, with an irreparably damaged president in the White House,
Republicans will try to coast to victory in 1996 on a poll-driven
platform of GOP boilerplate.  Alexander will offer none of that
blandness. He governed Tennessee in the 1980s in much the same
way that Wisconsin's Tommy Thompson and Michigan's John Engler
govern in the 1990s. True, his view of the role of the federal
government may be at odds with much of established Washington.
But it is a view understood and applauded around the country.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Paul Gottfried on Patrick Buchanan</B></CENTER>
<P>
The announcement by Pat Buchanan of his candidacy for the Republican
presidential nomination has done more to change the Republican
race than has the entry of any other candidate. More than any
other contender, Buchanan represents the populist right and has
fought all of its enemies. He has tangled with the liberal media;
the gay, feminist, and civil-rights lobbies; and the corporate
economic interests allied with big government. He has also dished
out, in his provocative speeches and blistering columns, fully
as much as he has taken. There is a certain bulldog tenacity about
him that even his bitterest opponents acknowledge. When Buchanan
believes he has been unfairly attacked, he stands his ground,
and he shows as much civility or incivility to his critics as
they display toward him. In 1992, I thought that he should have
done more to defuse accusations of being anti-Jewish, a charge
that plagued him particularly after he had linked support for
the Gulf War to the activities of Israel's &quot;amen corner.&quot;
But Buchanan would not apologize for what he--and others, including
commentators Michael Kinsley and Rabbi Jacob Neusner-took to be
a false charge. As he told his Jewish advisers, he would not dignify
a &quot;libel&quot; charge by responding to it. 

<P>No, I do not always
agree with Buchanan's positions, but they are honestly stated
and consistently held. Unlike senators Gramm and Dole, he has
not waffled on affirmative action or aid to illegal aliens, which
Buchanan has always opposed. And like Alan Keyes, but unlike most
of the other Republican candidates, he is genuinely opposed to
abortion. 

<P>
Equally important to me are the populist themes that
resonate in his campaigns. In the Wall Street Journal in 1993,
Irving Kristol predicted the inevitable success of a national
leader carrying out Buchanan's ideas. Buchanan's passionate concerns-violent
crime, immigration controls, the disintegration of morals, and
the disappearing jobs of American workers-are now, according to
Kristol, widely shared. New York cabdrivers, even those from the
Third World, express most of these concerns with equal vehemence.
Kristol is no friend of Buchanan or his candidacy, but he does
recognize the timeliness of his populist themes-and the foolishness
of those who would resist them. 

<P>
Buchanan belongs to a movement
that is also sweeping Europe. In Italy, Austria, and Germany,
there is a surging populist protest against capricious public
administration. There is also a growing demand that government
bring itself into line with the beliefs and traditions of those
it is intended to serve. Democracy, populists maintain, is not
an exercise in sensitivity training or the formulation of administrative
policy. It is the practice of self-government by self-identified
communities, whether regional or national. 

<P>
When the popular will
seeks to affirm traditional morality or limit the political community,
but is disregarded or overruled judicially, then both democracy
and citizenship are devalued. This is now a regular occurrence
in the U.S. The populist call for both political accountability
and true self-government has joined a conservative goal: the defense
of family and traditional communities endangered by a therapeutic
managerial state. 

<P>
Buchanan personifies the populist revolt against
this. Unlike neoconservatives and gentrified Republicans, he concedes
nothing, rhetorically or programmatically. He calls for seismic
change: devolution of power to states and open confrontation with
moral and cultural revolutionaries posing as value-free judges
or public servants. As president, he would not merely dicker with
liberal administrators. He would find ways to dispatch them and,
wherever possible, dismantle their agencies. 

<P>
Buchanan's spiritedness
and unwavering conviction persuade me that he would make a difference
as president. Unlike Ronald Reagan, he would not leave the Washington
power structure as he found it. He would make strenuous efforts
to restore the dual federalism established by our founders. 

<P>Buchanan
knows that genuine democracy must come from below. It cannot be
mandated from Washington or, in imperialist fashion, imposed abroad.
In our own country, democracy is an ideal to be recaptured, not
a blueprint to be forced on other nations. 

<P>
I doubt that Buchanan
would be a rigidly isolationist president. His stern warnings
against foreign entanglements have a constructive aim. He rightly
fears that our own society is deteriorating in many ways. Especially
now that our communist enemy is gone, it may be best to work on
domestic problems instead of shouldering the burdens of other
peoples.  

<P>
Nor should we encourage unskilled workers from less
developed lands to immigrate, take advantage of our social services,
and displace those most at risk in our own work force. America,
as Buchanan sees it, should hope neither to remake nor to absorb
the rest of humanity. In contrast to the nationalism expressed
by Ben Wattenberg, one of his frequent debating partners, Buchanan's
nationalism has no global imperative and is respectful of cultural
differences. Because of his feisty and principled character and
his democratic counterrevolutionary vision, I shall cast my own
vote in the Republican presidential primary for this modest nationalist.

<CENTER><B>DavidKuo on Bob Dole</B></CENTER>
<P>
The elections of November 1994 did more than usher in the first
conservative Congress in two generations. They also signaled the
public affirmation of a conservative agenda. In so doing, they
forced conservatives to change both their congressional and their
presidential perspectives. Suddenly, long-held conservative hopes
became new-found conservative realities. The balanced budget is
fashionable-the only real question now is whether it will be accomplished
through the budget process or through an amendment to the Constitution.
Federalism is renewed and devolution is the new buzzword. Illegitimacy
is bad and the family needs to be strengthened. As conservatives
consider whom among the presidential candidates to support in
1996, the question is, &quot;Who is best suited to take us to
the next stage of our conservative realignment?&quot; The clear
answer: Bob Dole. 

<P>The next stage of the realignment is not for
communication and symbolism, but for the detailed work of devolving
federal power, strengthening families, and reasserting American
interests abroad. It is a stage for implementing an agenda already
defined. 

<P>
Although some things may have caused conservatives some
angst, the simple fact remains: On every serious issue on our
agenda, Bob Dole is not only on board, he is the leader. 

<P>
This
is not a recent phenomenon. The man now calling for the abolition
of the departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development,
Education, and Energy is the same man who voted against creating
both Education and HUD. The man now speaking out against our nation's
social pathologies has a pro-life voting record of nearly 100
percent. The man now advocating a U.S. foreign policy based on
American interests has been one of the leading voices in foreign
policy for years. And the man who has pledged to balance the budget
has made tough choices, year after year, on spending cuts. 

<P>
Today,
Bob Dole is arguably the most respected statesman in the country.
He has proven himself an excellent strategist who remains cool
under fire, a coalition-builder, and a political achiever. He
has demonstrated both the courage and the decisiveness that will
be required to implement our agenda. 

<P>
Too often, conservatives
have belittled and diminished legislative experience as a liability-suggesting
that a man who legislates cannot be trusted with the ideological
mantle. But as Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and even Bill Clinton
have learned, accomplishing-legislating-is difficult business.
Any agenda, however aggressive, however bold, however visionary
is merely an agenda unless it is implemented. But Majority Leader
Dole is not only a legislator, he is a master at getting things
done. And President Dole would be able to translate his experience
and ability into the tough work of reversing 30 years of growth
in the welfare state. 

<P>
Many contend that the president's most important
role is commander-in-chief of our armed forces, and they may be
right. Though Cold War pressures have receded, our recent dalliances
in Somalia, Bosnia, and North Korea testify to the continuing
need for serious and responsive leadership. Bob Dole, who has
emerged as the leading Republican voice in foreign policy, would
bring to the presidency a developed view of world affairs. His
view combines two things: an expansive interpretation of America's
role in the world and a personal and pragmatic understanding of
the dangers of global involvement. 

<P>
For someone who has worked
for both the National Right-to-Life Committee and Empower America,
all of these things are important. But the real source of my attraction
to Dole lies elsewhere. The true reason I believe Bob Dole should
be president of the United States stems from his character. 

<P>
The
presidency helps define the character of the country. People look
to the president for leadership, inspiration, and guidance. The
president should be someone to whom parents can point and tell
their children, &quot;Be like him.&quot; In Bob Dole, parents
could point to someone who served his country in war, overcame
physical infirmities thought to be insurmountable, and dedicated
his life to serving the American people-all good and noble things.
He has also proven himself to be a man who keeps his word.

<P>
In the 1980s, following a decade of turmoil and the &quot;malaise&quot;
presidency, America needed a particular kind of conservatism-an
inspiring conservatism of sweeping visions, a conservatism that
could hasten the downfall of communism abroad and the restoration
of confidence at home. In President Reagan, it had an unparalleled
leader. But America now needs something very different. It needs
a conservatism that is still visionary, but one whose greatest
virtue is belief in community and responsibility. In Bob Dole
it has its rightful leader. His presidency would not only bury
the aberration that is the Clinton presidency, but would also
consolidate the conservative revolution.

<P>
<CENTER><B>William E. Dannemeyer on Bob Dornan</B></CENTER>
<P>
True leadership emanates from men who say the right thing at
the right time to the people who need to hear it most. This is
how I think of Bob Dornan. In my mind's eye I return to 1990,
on a typically hot and humid July morning in Washington, D.C.,
where a not-so-typical debate began to boil on the floor of the
House. 

<P>
At issue was the expulsion of Representative Barney Frank,
who had brought shame upon our institution for misjudgments involving
a male friend and prostitute over an 18-month period. As the sponsor
of the resolution to expel Frank, I can tell you that the experience
was one of the most intensely sobering dramas with which I was
ever involved in my 14 years of service in the House. It was not
a time for the timid. Only four members spoke in favor of the
expulsion. Bob Dornan was one of them. 

<P>
Bob began his comments,
&quot;I have not been this nervous in this well in over a 14-year
span in this House.&quot; And then he did something that has become
trademark Dornan, something only courageous men can do under fire.


<P>
Knowing that he stood virtually alone, knowing that ridicule and
contempt would be heaped upon him by Frank's defenders and a vicious
liberal media, Bob turned and looked Barney Frank square in the
eyes, not once turning his attention elsewhere, and said what
had to be said to the man who needed to hear it most: &quot;I
don't care about the details. The devil is in the details. That
is for you lawyers.&#133; I will vote for expelling you because
you did not have the honor or decency to resign.&quot; 

<P>
Bob Dole,
as inspirational as his life has been, would never have shown
such leadership. Phil Gramm would have become invisible. Dick
Lugar would have prayed that the moment would quickly pass. And
Arlen Specter would have defended Frank. Under those circumstances,
not one of these Republican candidates, who all serve in elective
office, would have done what needed to be done or have said what
needed to be said. This is a major reason why I support Bob Dornan
for president. 

<P>
Bob's conservatism is real. It is passionate. And
it is based on a deep and abiding faith in God. I was glad, although
not surprised, to hear Bob inject themes of liberty and virtue
into the presidential debate. Unlike the congressional colleagues
who have become his presidential competitors, Bob actually understands
the historical, moral, and philosophical basis of these themes.
He knows, and has stated, that we cannot be a free people unless
we are a virtuous people. He did not need million-dollar handlers
to tell him that. Nor did he need the incessant prodding of pro-family
special interests to motivate his comments. He knows the relationship
of liberty to virtue because he is a self-motivated student of
truth. 

<P>
History is one of Bob's closest friends. His life-long
relationship with history has honed his bubbling idealism into
a practical and balanced conservative philosophy. As a staunch
proponent of lower taxes and lower federal spending, Bob knows
the bounds of governmental authority, not only because he has
worn this mantle of authority over the last 18 years in Congress
but also because he has studiously examined history. From ancient
Rome to modern America, Bob Dornan knows what makes nations rise
and fall. The presidential rivals who serve with him in Congress
haven't got a clue. 

<P>
Bob Dornan is not the only good conservative
in this race for the presidency. Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes are
also running-and I count each as my friend. Even so, when I have
to choose, it is Bob Dornan I will support. Few other qualities
in a presidential candidate could offset a lack of elected public
service. Bob has been elected to Congress nine times, in Democratic
districts. These experiences have built character that cannot
be found anywhere else in politics.Moreover, Bob's record of service
both in and on behalf of the military is a nearly essential requirement
of the role of commander-in-chief. I know Bob feels it is an absolute
requirement. Through a variety of circumstances, he has witnessed
firsthand how America has influenced the world for good and has
developed the deepest appreciation for U.S. sovereignty. Bob Dornan
would not rush us off to war, nor would he abandon genuine freedom
fighters anywhere in the world. In determining this delicate balance,
I know he would excel-always erring on the cautious side in preserving
American lives and sovereignty. 

<P>
Bob Dornan belies the public persona
crafted and manipulated by an adversarial media elite. His passion
for life, his love of country, his deep commitment to his wife
Sallie and their children and grandchildren, and his uncanny identification
with all types of people sometimes make him an easy target for
mean-spirited and shallow adversaries. Yet he has remained eternally
optimistic about life and about the future of America specifically.
Great men deserve even greater opportunities to show their mettle.
This is why I unhesitatingly support Bob Dornan for president
of the United States of America.

<CENTER><B>Lewis E. Lehrman on Phil Gramm</B></CENTER>
<P>
Who is the authentic heir of the Reagan Revolution, the iron
man who can fulfill its promise? Who among us is the leader with
the compelling vision, the experience, and the perseverance to
lead us out of our time of troubles? I say I know such a man.


<P>
Born a son of the South, a grandson of Yankee immigrants, raised
in Georgia, and grown to manhood in Texas, he has risen to leadership
by virtue of his own remarkable energy and intelligence-just as
he rose to the rank of legislative statesman as the senior senator
from Texas. Phil Gramm is the man. 

<P>
Born poor, self-made, and unencumbered
by the cultural baggage of country-club Republicans, Phil Gramm's
life has demonstrated the promise of the American dream: that
every American, no matter how humble his beginnings, has the right
and the opportunity to rise by indefatigable effort and indisputable
merit as high as he might go. Phil Gramm will rise to the highest
office in the land because he will, conventional wisdom notwithstanding,
roll up the primaries in 1996. And he will win the general election
going away. 

<P>
This is how Phil Gramm will win! He will win with
the most compelling campaign of conservative ideas. He knows what
he believes and loves what he knows. He will win by recruiting
legions of true conservative activists to embrace his definition
of the American dream. He will win by the sheer force of his superior
talent and leadership, which explains why he has built more organization,
raised more money, and won over the vast majority of conservative
activists who know where he stands. 

<P>
Every true conservative who
aspires to the highest office should uphold a clear program of
reform designed to restore our limited constitutional government.
Yet we know, from the failures and disappointments of the past,
that a program by itself is not sufficient. Neither will it be
sufficient in 1996 to choose careerism or time-serving political
credentials. 

<P>
The conservatives now assembled for victory have
learned from hard experience that the man who leads us will only
be sufficient unto the task if he has, in addition to the gift
of intellect and a well-laid plan, something more. That something
is true grit, unimpeachable character, and the irrefragable tenacity
to carry his plan for a rebirth of the American dream to total
triumph. We the people want a president of the United States whose
impeccable conservative ideas and matchless record are joined
with a driving will to win. We want a winner, a big winner, a
man with a strategy for victory.

<P>
In the domain of political economy,
Phil Gramm is the best-trained, best-equipped presidential candidate
in American history. A free-market professor of economics long
before it was trendy, a co-author of the Reagan economic program,
he is the very apostle of low tax rates, a balanced budget, stable
money, and a deregulated economy. Phil Gramm is without peer in
his grasp of how to create full employment, long-term interest
rates of 4 percent, and a tax code based on a flat rate. 

<P>
In the
domain of defense policy, Phil Gramm has prepared himself for
the post-communist world. He has declared that he is &quot;ready
for a world where the lion will lie down with the lamb, and if
such a world comes about, I want the United States of America
to be that lion.&quot; No other policy is acceptable to Phil Gramm,
whose presidential inaugural oath, registered in heaven, will
require him to &quot;preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution
of the United States of America.&quot; 

<P>
Believing as I do that
economics and foreign policy are contingent, but cultural and
social principles are central, what assurance does one have that
President Gramm will encourage and foster the indispensable moral
reformation of the public square? Speaking in May before Liberty
University and The Heritage Foundation, Phil Gramm said: &quot;Faith
and family produced the values and virtues that helped make America
the world's greatest and most powerful nation long before we had
any of the trappings of greatness and power.&quot; Quoting Alexis
de Tocqueville, Gramm said, &quot;'Not until I went into the churches
of America, and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness did
I understand the secret of her genius and power. America is great
because she is good, and if America ever ceased to be good, America
will cease to be great.' I believe that Alexis de Tocqueville
was right 160 years ago, and I believe he is right today.&quot;


<P>
In more specific terms, Gramm has argued that &quot;the social-security
net that we erected has become a hammock. Government programs&#133;have
changed the way we behave, corrupted our values, and diminished
our virtue. As we look more and more towards Caesar to take care
of us, we have turned more and more away from family and faith.
In rendering unto Caesar, we have stopped rendering unto God.&quot;


<P>
And thus we are brought to consider the soul of the Republican
Party as we debate its presidential nomination. During the greatest
crisis of American history, the Republican Party of the United
States was founded on the everlasting covenant of &quot;free soil,
free men, and free labor.&quot; And with the victory of our party
and of President Lincoln came vindication of the inalienable right
to liberty and the end of slavery in America. More than a century
later, the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan came to stand for
many things, but there was one unique covenant in the platforms
of 1980 and 1984. Let us call it the one needful thing. And what
is that thing? Senator Gramm described &quot;the day when all
unborn children are welcomed into life and loved when they get
here.&quot; A Republican Party-indeed, a Republican president-without
a commitment to the inalienable right to life, without unequivocal
opposition to abortion, is as unthinkable as a Republican Party
without Lincoln, the inalienable right to liberty, and unequivocal
opposition to slavery. 

<P>
We conservatives know that, after this
imminent contest for the presidency, our philosophical agenda
entails no less than the comprehensive reformation of our political
institutions. But to pursue a goal without the right man and the
right means to attain it is to court political disaster. Republicans
are blessed with several authentic candidates. But I believe that
Phil Gramm is the only leader with the intellect, the force of
will, and the preparation for greatness who can marshall our forces
for an overwhelming and irreversible victory over our foes.

<CENTER><B>Mary Parker Lewis onAlan Keyes</B></CENTER>
<P>
For the millions of Americans who are brokenhearted over the
decay of moral standards, the disintegration of families and neighborhoods,
and the slaughter of innocents in the womb, Alan Keyes is the
most powerful spokesman on the scene today. More than any other
candidate, Alan Keyes offers a healing message of hope and renewal,
based on the immortal principles of our great Declaration of Independence,
and delivered without apology to the better angels of our nature.


<P>
The former president of Citizens Against Government Waste, Alan
Keyes offers credentials second to none as a champion of Americans
fed up with overtaxation, overspending, and overregulation. For
example, when many Republican leaders were assuring us that Dick
Darman's 1990 budget deal was a winner for George Bush and the
GOP, Alan warned that the agreement would prove disastrous for
taxpayers, the economy, and the party. Events proved him right.


<P>
Today the GOP endorses the policies of tax reduction, spending
restraint, and local empowerment that Alan has championed for
years. That is well and good. But as Alan eloquently reminds Republican
audiences, economics is not at the heart of what ails America.
Serious though they are, our economic problems are largely derivative,
the consequences of having abandoned the moral and constitutional
principles of the American founding. The transfer state is bankrupting
America, but the transfer state comes into its own only when hordes
of people see nothing wrong with living off the toil of others.
In any event, moral vices produce the social problems for which
government programs are inevitably proffered as solutions. 

<P>
That's
why Alan's front-and-center emphasis on moral issues is the only
genuinely practical approach. Consider these words from his February
19 address to the New Hampshire Republican State Committee: &quot;Why
is it that we spend so much money on welfare and illegitimacy?
Why is it that we spend so much money on crime and violence in
our streets? Why is it even that we spend so much money dealing
with the problems of irresponsible behavior that contribute to
the decline of the health of this nation? I think you all know
in your hearts what the real answer is. We don't have money problems,
we have moral problems. And it's time we stood up and faced that
truth.&quot; We will never succeed in relimiting the federal government
until we restore the family to its rightful place as the first
and best &quot;welfare provider&quot; and strengthen the marriage-based,
two-parent family as the fundamental moral unit of society. 

<P>
Of
all the policies eroding the moral foundations of family life
and American freedom, the policy of abortion on demand poses the
greatest danger. There are, of course, many decent people on both
sides of the abortion controversy. Nonetheless, the pro-abortion
position is anti-family. As an institution, the family both depends
upon and nurtures an ethic of duty and self-sacrifice. But the
pro-abortion position fosters an ethic of self-indulgence. It
says, in effect, that the convenience or pleasure of the adult
is the supreme law. 

<P>
Worse, the pro-abortion position implicitly
justifies political despotism. The Declaration of Independence
proclaims the right to life to be a gift from God and, therefore,
inalienable. The pro-abortion argument assumes either that government
(not God) is the source of rights, or that we have the right to
decide whose humanity shall be recognized and whose shall not.
Obviously, the doctrine that there are no natural rights (hence
no natural wrongs) advances the ambitions of those whose chief
interest lies in the expansion of government power. But liberty
is also subverted when we claim the authority to decide who among
us is human, and who is not. Alan put it this way in an April
8 speech to Delaware Republicans: 

<P>
&quot;Don't you realize that
opens the door to every form of tyranny? Because all I have to
do if I want to snuff out your life or trample on your rights
is decide that you're not human. And of course you'll look at
me and say, 'But you can't do that.' And I'll say, 'Well, the
last time the American people decided they were going to draw
the line, my folks ended up on the wrong side of it.' And I don't
think it was because we had the poor judgment to draw the line
in the wrong place. I think it was because we claimed a right
we do not have. We do not have the right to draw that line. God
drew it, and all we have the right to do is respect His will.&quot;


<P>
Slavery and abortion on demand are both what Alan calls &quot;Declaration
issues&quot;-moral wrongs that must be addressed because they
contradict the basic premise of a self-governing polity. I believe
Alan sees so deeply into the nature of the abortion controversy
because he has thought long and hard about slavery and the black
experience in America. 

<P>
Keyes's book, <I>Masters of the Dream:
The Strength and Betrayal of Black America</I>, is not just an
antidote to decades of left-wing revisionism. It is a meditation
on the universal significance of the black experience-the moral
and civic lessons to be learned therefrom. Slavery did not make
blacks slavish, nor did material deprivation turn them into passive
victims. Rather, slavery whetted their natural thirst for freedom,
much as it did to the Hebrews of old. Deprivation taught them
to recognize the true, non-material basis of human dignity. To
survive in the face of adversity, blacks had to become diligent,
dependable, hopeful. They learned to honor hard work, self-discipline,
family, and the riches of the spirit. Such qualities of moral
and spiritual strength are the key to restoring the true American
dream-the dream of freedom. 

<P>
Beginning in the 1960s, black America
was betrayed by the same forces that are destroying the dream
for all Americans: the perverse incentives of the transfer state,
and the debilitating doctrines of sexual permissiveness and moral
relativism. Alan Keyes's candidacy is a candidacy like no other.
Drawing on the moral lessons of black history, the imperishable
truths of the Declaration, and the arts of statesmanship, Alan
Keyes will elevate the 1996 presidential contest to a plane not
seen in America since the Lincoln-Douglas debates.

<CENTER><B>MitchellE. Daniels Jr. on Richard Lugar</B></CENTER>
<P>
 As they search for the best national leader in 1996, conservatives
should look beyond words, votes, and even public actions. The
true measure of authenticity must encompass not only what a man
has shown to the camera, but also what he has shown to his family,
his neighbors, and his Maker. For Dick Lugar, conservatism is
not merely a school of thought, it is a way of life, and it is
in that context that he emerges as the right man to lead America
back to strength and virtue. 

<P>
By every conventional yardstick,
Dick Lugar has been a rock of conservative principle and consistency.
As the mayor of Indianapolis, he cut taxes five times in eight
years, and battled tirelessly against federal intrusion into state
and local autonomy. As a senator, he has amassed a voting record
in the most conservative fifth of each Congress in which he has
served; statistically, he was Ronald Reagan's number-one supporter
for the eight years of the 40th presidency. 

<P>
Lugar's campaign for
the presidency is animated by these same bedrock beliefs. His
determination to shrink government and reduce spending is confirmed
by his ongoing, often lonely battle to cut agricultural subsidies
and free American farmers to plant for the market, not the government.
Like Churchill, he believes that &quot;The responsibility of Ministers
for the public safety is absolute and requires no mandate. It
is in fact the prime object for which governments come into existence.&quot;
He knows, and is unafraid to state, that the safety of our country
cannot be left to chance, but will demand American activism on
nuclear proliferation, ballistic-missile defense, and terrorism.


<P>
Dick Lugar rejects the current establishment's constrained vision
of a U.S. economy growing at only 2 or 3 percent per year. His
clarion call to abolish all taxation of enterprise is the single
most radical and promising idea on the 1996 agenda. Alone among
the candidates' reform proposals, it would uproot today's entire
anti-growth, anti-savings regime of income, capital-gains, and
estate taxation, and turn loose a 1980s-like explosion of investment,
exports, jobs, and higher incomes. 

<P>
But for all its macroeconomic
appeal, the true significance of the Lugar tax plan lies in its
underlying values. Leapfrogging the flat tax and its imitators,
Lugar would abolish at a stroke the most dehumanizing aspects
of modern statism: the invasions of privacy, the abuses of power,
the insidious invisibility of withholding, and the unspoken assumption
that income belongs to the state rather than the individual. Through
their consumption decisions, individuals would have full control
of the rate of their taxation. In a real sense, Dick Lugar's tax
plan is the ultimate expression of conservative philosophy. 

<P>Anyone
can write a platform. Many have compiled positive records of words,
votes, and public deeds. It is the rarest of public men who can
also lead a life in complete congruence with the principles he
espouses. 

<P>
Dick Lugar has lived the virtues of self-discipline,
duty, devotion to country, and religious faith that we all admire
but practice imperfectly. He was first in his class in high school,
first in his class at college; he has been a Methodist lay minister,
and an Eagle Scout. Like Bill Clinton, Dick Lugar visited the
American Embassy in London while he was a Rhodes Scholar; unlike
Clinton, Lugar went there to enlist in the U.S. Navy. 

<P>
Lugar served
his country with distinction, including a stint as intelligence
briefer to Admiral Arleigh Burke, the chief of naval operations.
Returning to his home town, he saved a struggling family manufacturing
business, carried on the family farming operations, and with Charlene,
his wife (and co-president of their college's student body), built
his own little platoon of four sons. As a school-board member,
he fought for racial integration and against forced busing. That
brought him to the public's attention, and eventually to an elective
career. But throughout his public life, he has remained closely
involved in both his businesses. Dick Lugar has always been a
citizen legislator. 

<P>
When President Lugar calls Americans to reassert
the moral superiority of hard work, personal responsibility, intact
families, and respect for life, his conviction will not be drawn
merely from congressional testimony of the latest policy analysis.
His leadership of a cultural recovery in our country will be grounded
in a life of commitment to virtues early learned and deep embedded.


<P>
The conservative revolution is yet to be won. Building upon the
congressional breakthrough of 1994 will require the election of
a Republican president, and not just any Republican will do. Total
triumph will only be won by a president who can attract and hold
the respect and affection of millions of citizens. 

<P>
Dick Lugar's
brand of inclusive, reasoned, friendly conservatism has allowed
him to build larger coalitions and shatter electoral records throughout
his career. Just as he is the candidate most certain to disarm
President Clinton in a general election, he is the man best equipped
to win the enduring trust of the larger majorities whose support
will consummate the conservative crusade.

<CENTER><B>Roger J. Stone
Jr. on Arlen Specter</B></CENTER>
<P>
Arlen Specter is a Jew, he comes from a big city, he has a record
of commitment to racial equality (without quotas), he's pro-choice,
and he believes strongly in tolerance and the First Amendment
doctrine of church-state separation. For social-issue conservatives
who take their marching orders from Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed,
who believe in Pat Buchanan's &quot;holy war&quot; for the soul
of America, some or all of these factors probably make Specter's
candidacy anathema. Frankly, this article is not addressed to
them. 

<P>
The conservatives to whom this article is addressed are
conservatives like myself-the kind of conservatives I met in 1964
as a member of Young Americans for Freedom, fighting the good
fight for Barry Goldwater; the conservatives I led as National
Chairman of Young Republicans, and worked with beginning in 1976,
and then in 1980 and 1984, to give America eight magnificent years
of a Ronald Reagan presidency; and the supply-side conservatives
I worked with in Jack Kemp's 1988 presidential campaign in an
effort to continue that tradition. 

<P>
This article is addressed to
conservatives who, like Barry Goldwater, believe that government
ought to get off our backs, keep out of our pocketbooks, and stay
out of our bedrooms. This article is addressed to conservatives
who, like Ronald Reagan, believe in a strong America: strong enough
militarily to secure our interests and keep the peace around the
world, strong enough domestically to win the war against drugs
and violent crime on our streets. This article is addressed to
conservatives who, like Jack Kemp, believe in an American future
of unlimited economic opportunity and unprecedented growth fueled
by low taxes, free trade, and free markets. 

<P>
To those libertarian
conservatives, who I believe are the true core of American conservatism,
I say Arlen Specter is your candidate. In Arlen Specter, you will
find a senator with a strong record of conservatism that goes
back to his first days in the senate. In the Specter '96 campaign,
you will find a program thoroughly grounded in conservative ideals
and ideas, and a candidate committed to fiscal and economic conservatism
who has the best chance of beating Bill Clinton in a general election.


<P>
First, the Specter record. Arlen Specter came to the Senate in
1981 with an outstanding background in law enforcement as Philadelphia's
district attorney, where he fought successfully to end plea bargaining
and win stiff sentences for violent criminals. In the Senate,
he immediately made tough anticrime policies a legislative priority,
and authored the 1984 Armed Career Criminal bill, the first federal
law to use &quot;three strikes&quot; to get long-term jail terms
for repeat offenders. A strong believer in the deterrent force
of the death penalty, Arlen Specter has for 15 years been the
driving force in Congress to put teeth back into state death-penalty
laws by eliminating ridiculous judicial delays in carrying out
death sentences. 

<P>
Throughout the Reagan presidency, Arlen Specter
was a solid supporter of the revitalization of the American military,
including the Strategic Defense Initiative. He firmly opposed
any effort to relax the Cuban embargo. He has been at the forefront
of the fight to combat terrorism at home and abroad, and was a
leading Senate voice in support of the Gulf War resolution. Recently,
he has been a vocal Senate force in opposition to the Clinton
administration's appeasement of North Korea and its pointless
risk of U.S. lives in Haiti. 

<P>
Specter's fiscal record in the Senate
is solidly conservative: long-time support for both a balanced
budget amendment and the line-item veto (including sponsoring
his own legislation during his second term); support for the Reagan
era tax cuts; and, early this year,his own flat-tax bill-the Senate's
only such legislation.

<P>
For the same reasons that Specter has opposed
government interference into Americans' private lives, he has
always opposed gun-control and supported the rights of law-abiding
citizens to own firearms. He believes that swift, certain, and
severe punishment of criminals, not confiscation of guns from
the public, is the effective way to fight violent crime.

<P>
The defining
themes of the Specter '96 campaign are squarely conservative.
As Arlen Specter said in announcing his candidacy last March:
    
<P>
&quot;With the election of a Republican Congress in 1994 and
a Republican president in 1996, we have a unique opportunity to
move America toward unprecedented prosperity and unlimited opportunity....


<P>
&quot;We do so by implementing our core Republican values: smaller
government; less spending; lower taxes; civil rights and liberties;
strong national defense; and effective crime control.&#133; I
stand before you today as a man willing to work with every ounce
of my energy and every fiber of my determination to renew once
again the dreams of freedom and opportunity that for 200 years
have made this nation the envy of and the example for the world.&quot;


<P>
In his announcement speech, Specter made just two specific pledges
on domestic policy, and both reflect the fundamentally conservative
orientation of his governing philosophy: to balance the budget
by 2002 (and to write the first check to reduce the national debt
in January, 2003); and to deliver a flat-tax bill to the Congress
at his own inauguration. 

<P>
The flat-tax concept-a single 20 percent
tax rate on all business and personal income, elimination of all
loopholes and deductions except for a portion of home-mortgage
interest and small charitable contributions, and no taxation on
interest, dividends, and capital gains-has become the economic
centerpiece of the Specter campaign. As welcome as specific tax
cuts might be, they are mere Band-Aids for a tax system that is
long on bureaucrats, rules, and regulations and short on incentives
for economic growth. The future of conservative fiscal policy
lies with the flat tax-House Majority Leader Dick Armey said the
next president would be elected on a flat-tax platform-and Arlen
Specter is the only Republican candidate to commit foursquare
to such a system. 

<P>
Conservatives need to be realists. We need to
recognize that Bill Clinton is not as vulnerable as he once seemed
or as we might like. The 1996 Republican nominee will face in
Bill Clinton an energetic campaigner, a president determined to
use the considerable powers of incumbency in support of his re&euml;lection,
and a man zealously supported by interest groups determined to
retain their last link to political power. As conservatives, we
need a Republican nominee who can defeat Bill Clinton in a general
election-and that means Arlen Specter. 

<P>
Since 1980, Arlen Specter
has won three tough Senate races (and two tough primaries) in
a bellwether state where Democrats have always far outnumbered
Republicans. In 1992, despite the fury of radical feminists over
his defense of Clarence Thomas, Specter carried Pennsylvania by
three points while George Bush was losing the state to Clinton
by a million votes. Arlen Specter has a reputation as an indefatigable
campaigner-a reputation I can tell you is well deserved. He has
the intellect, tenacity, and toughness to take on Bill Clinton
in a presidential debate-and to win going away. 

<P>
In Arlen Specter,
conservatives have the chance to support a candidate committed
to a balanced budget and a flat tax at home, and to the restoration
of American strength, resolve, and credibility abroad; a candidate
who has the knowledge and experience to lead a national war on
crime and drugs; and a candidate who can win the White House on
these issues. Conservatives who see themselves as heir to the
libertarian legacy of Barry Goldwater, the Reagan tradition of
American strength abroad and limited government at home, and the
Kemp commitment to broad-based growth and prosperity belong in
his camp.

Today the commonsense conservative philosophy that so many have
fought for, for so long, holds sway in the Supreme Court, in the
U.S. Senate, and in the House of Representatives. There is only
one piece missing in the conservative political jigsaw puzzle-the
White House. When that piece is in place, a picture of real political
revolution will emerge, a revolution that could roll on well into
the next century.

<P>
That is why the stakes next year are so high.

<P>
There
have been three successful conservative Republican presidents
elected in our lifetimes-Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon,
and Ronald Reagan. I've worked to help elect and then serve with
two of them, and I believe there are certain requirements that
a person must have to win the Republican nomination and then the
presidency.   

<P>Here's the short list:
<UL>
<LI>They must have rock-solid
conservative views on national security and economic policy, and
they must be in accord on a wide range of social issues important
to the conservative base of the Republican party.
<LI>They must
be political warhorses, with a powerful political base-preferably
California (54 electoral votes), New York (33 votes), or Texas
(32 votes)-and skilled campaigners. Executive experience in government
is a big plus.
<LI>They must have high intelligence, great stamina,
and a record free of scandal. Running for president against any
incumbent Democrat, in the teeth of a hostile, liberal press,
is a mind-numbing, exhausting gauntlet. 
</UL>

<P>
The Republican candidates
running for president in 1996 are a distinguished group; any one
of them would be a dramatic improvement over President Clinton.
By the fall of 1995, it is likely that the race will narrow to
three men: Senator Dole, Senator Gramm, and Governor Wilson. They
are all good men, but I believe that one of them-Pete Wilson-best
meets the criteria for getting nominated, getting elected, and
governing successfully. 

<P>
<B>Peace and National Security.</B> Pete Wilson
has a strong, consistent record of conservative positions on national
defense and foreign policy. Known as a national defense hawk in
the U.S. Senate, he was a leading supporter of President Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and one of the few who called
for early deployment. An expert on strategic nuclear policy and
arms control he was a critic of the SALT II treaty and backed
President Reagan's INF treaty.  

<P>
As governor, he has been an outspoken
critic of President Clinton for squandering U.S. prestige and
influence around the world and cutting national defense spending
to dangerously low levels. 

<P>
In the 1950s, he was a platoon leader
in the U.S. Marines. On national-defense matters, they don't come
any tougher than former U.S. Marine officers. On national security,
Pete Wilson is as tough a defender of U.S. interests as any Republican
running. 

<P>
<B>Prosperity and Economic Policy.</B> As a U.S. Senator, he
consistently supported both a constitutional amendment to balance
the federal budget, and line-item veto authority for the president.
As a candidate for the Senate, he strongly opposed the 1982 tax
increase; and as senator, he voted against President Bush's 1990
tax increase. 

<P>
When he became the governor of California in 1991,
he inherited the worst economic mess in the state's history. The
deficit facing him was one third of the state's general fund request,
comparable to a $500 billion deficit in today's federal budget,
but with one big difference-the California constitution mandates
a balanced budget. Unlike Washington, where you can take seven
years to achieve fiscal responsibility, he only had one year and
a legislature controlled by Democrats. Although some taxes were
raised, the lion's share of that deficit was eliminated by tough
spending control. 

<P>
In fact, during the four years of his first
term he held spending flat in current dollars. If you account
for inflation, real spending went down-not from some bogus baseline
projection, but from actual 1991 spending levels. If the federal
government had exercised comparable toughness, the federal budget
would be in balance today. 

<P>
California also went through a few
other trials-drastic defense-industry cutbacks, the collapse of
real-estate values, fires, floods, mudslides, riots, and earthquakes.
But Pete Wilson's tough spending control, unmatched in any other
state, laid the foundation for a strong economic recovery that
confounded the experts-a recovery strong enough to generate sufficient
new tax revenues to pay off temporary debts, to fund spending
increases for education and law enforcement, and to propose a
15 percent across-the-board tax cut for all individuals and businesses.
If the Democratic-controlled legislature refuses to pass the tax
cut, Pete Wilson has vowed to hold a statewide ballot referendum
and let the voters decide. When passed, the new tax rates will
be below what they were when he took office. 

<P>
Pete Wilson is the
only Republican candidate proposing a true supply-side tax cut-not
increased deductions or exemptions, but an across-the-board reduction
in tax rates. 

<P>Speaking to the Republican Midwest Leadership Conference
on May 19, 1995, he spelled out the Reagan supply-side formula
for economic prosperity: &quot;If we both cut taxes and cut spending...there
is every reason for not just optimism but for justified confidence
in America's dynamic growth.&quot; 

<P>
<B>Justice and Social Issues.</B>
Here his record is overwhelmingly on the side of conservative
values, a clear sense of what is right and wrong, and of achieving
justice. Pete Wilson, the governor of our largest state, took
the lead not only in reforming welfare, but also in actually cutting
the amount of benefits paid. He was the first political leader
to sound the alarm on the injustice of paying billions of taxpayers'
dollars for the welfare, medical care, and education expenses
of illegal aliens. He led the battle for &quot;three strikes and
you're out&quot; for career criminals, locking them up for life
after their third felony conviction. 

<P>
A supporter of term limits
for politicians and the kind of federalism the Founding Fathers
intended for the United States, he has led the fight against the
heavy hand of federal mandates, declaring that California is &quot;not
a colony of the federal government.&quot; 

<P>
He has fought for regulatory
and legal reform, proposed a state constitutional amendment to
limit regulatory excesses, and issued an executive order suspending
the environmental regulations that contributed to the recent flood
damage. He has consistently vetoed legislation that would extend
special rights to gays, while opposing measures that would discriminate
against them. Pete Wilson, an expert pistol shot when he served
in the Marine Corps, has always supported the fundamental Second
Amendment rights of Americans to keep and bear arms, subject only
to some commonsense restrictions that support law enforcement.
On affirmative action, he has called for commonsense justice-a
color-blind society in which people would be treated equally regardless
of race or gender. 

<P>
On the social issue that most troubles the
Republican party today-abortion-Pete Wilson holds strong, consistent
views. While fully aware of the deeply held beliefs of those who
oppose all abortion and the reasoning behind those beliefs, he
has also carefully considered the rights and responsibilities
of the individuals involved, and the dangers of allowing an already
too powerful federal government to intrude itself into the most
intimate, difficult decision a woman can make. He strongly believes
we should encourage the kind of responsibility that would make
abortion unnecessary, that the question of abortion is best left
to the family and church, and that we should try to remove this
issue from the political arena to the extent possible. 

<P>
Is this
conservative? Well, it is the position shared by a substantial
majority of the Republican Party. Considering the terrible moral
dilemmas involved, it is a commonsense conservative view. 

<P>
<B>Electability.</B>
Most of my conservative friends are primarily interested in ideas
and principles, but for those who are also concerned with mundane
things like winning elections and taking power, I have a final
thought. 

<P>
If Pete Wilson wins the Republican nomination in 1996,
he will win the 54 electoral votes of California in the general
election. No Democratic nominee can be elected president without
winning California. 

<P>
Therefore, the nomination of Pete Wilson is
as close to a guarantee as you can get that Republicans   will-for
the first time in 44 years-control both houses of the Congress
and the White House. 

<P>If that happens, well then, as Ronald Reagan
once said: &quot;You ain't seen nothin' yet.&quot;

<P>
<I>Martin Anderson

is a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.
He has worked in seven presidential campaigns and served as economic
and domestic adviser to presidents Nixon and Reagan.</I>

<title>TH Spotlight on The Leader: Congressman Dick Armey</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
August 21, 1995
<h2>TH Spotlight on The Leader</h2>
</center>
<hr size="5" width="70%">
<p>
Congressman Dick Armey is "one of his party's most prolific and effective idea machines," according of the Wall Street Journal.  His former colleague Vin Weber calls him a "one-man think tank in cowboy boots."
<p>
With his unanimous election as the first Republican Majority Leader since 1954, Armey continued the string of victories that, in just ten years, has transformed him from a little-known economics professor into a leading figure in national politics.
<p>
As principal architect of the Republican "Contract with America," Armey palyed a key role in helping his party win majority control of the House and Senate in 1994.  When he and then -Minority Whip Newt Gingrich decided to present America with a ten-point agenda to be considered in the first 100 days of a Republican Majority, Armey supervised the drafting of the Contract bills and then worked tirelessly to gather  wide public support for the effort.
<p>
Armey is well-known for the flat-tax proposal.  Under his plan, all income would be taxed at a flat 17-percent rate, with no credits or exemptions for low-income earners and children.  A family of four earning $38,600 would pay no federal income tax.  "You could pay your taxes on a form the size of a postcard," he says.
<p>
Armey first came to national prominence through his advocacy of  free-market, pro-growth policies, and his attacks on wasteful federal spending programs.  His 1988 base-closure legislation broke a decade-old log-jam in Congress, enabling the Pentagon to shut down hundreds of obselete military facilities.  Two years later, Armey led a bipartisan coaltion oposing outdated farm programs, an effort which saved taxpayers over $14 billion.  For his budget-cutting efforts, U.S. News and World Report named him an "unsung hero."
<p>
Armey has consistantly advanced and defended the philosophy of President Ronald Reagan.  In 1990, when taxes and regulations were once again on the rise, Armey led House Republicans in opposing the "Budget  Summit Tax Increase" and the re-regulation of the economy.  As the ranking Republican on the Joint Economic Committee in 1991-92, he argued vigorously that Americans of all income classes would benefit instead from lower taxes and economic freedom.
<p>
Following the GOP's 1992 defeats, Armey ran for Conference Chairman, the third-ranking position in the House GOP leadership, arguing the party needed more assertive conservative leadership.  Suprising most pundits, he beats the incumbant, 88 to 84, with strong support from the newly-elected freshman.
<p>
In 1994, Armey's north Dallas district reelected him with 77 percent of the vote.  A native of Cando, N.D., he has worked at a grain elevator and as a telephone lineman.  He holds a B.A. form Jamestown College (ND), a master's from the University of North Dakota, and a Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma.  He is a former chairman of the University of Texas economics depatment.
<p>
In his new book, The Freedom Revolution, Representative Armey describes the Republican victory in November of 1994 as, "...in every sense, a Freedom Revolution -- a revolution in the bold sense of scrapping an entrenched, arrogant political order, of tossing out the moneychangers.  But, even more, a revolution in the humbler sense of revolving back to our points of origin.  A revolution not so much in power as in faith -- the faith of our fathers."  As Representative Armey states, "This is not a moment for the timid," and through his great writings and speeches one can clearly see that the Leader stands poised on the front lines of the Freedom Revolution.

THOUGHTS FROM THE BUSINESS WORLD ON DOWNSIZING GOVERNMENT
<P>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee.  I was pleased to accept your invitation to discuss some corporate approaches to organization and downsizing and their possible relevance to the federal government.  I believe I do have a somewhat unusual perspective on this issue, having spent roughly 20 years in the corporate world.
<P>
I am pleased to be back in these chambers.  As a young member of the Congress during the 1960s, I had the opportunity to serve on this Committee when it was known as the Government Operations Committee.  At the beginning of my tenure, the government we oversaw was much smaller and simpler than the complex and overwhelming behemoth that so many of you in this Congress have pledged to reform.
<P>
With your permission, I thought what I would do this afternoon would be to merely summarize some of the concepts in my prepared text, which all of you have received in advance, and then allow the maximum amount of time for questions.
<P>
If my memory serves me correctly, one of the issues of my time in Congress was whether or not to close a dairy at the U.S. Naval Academy.  That example may be good for a laugh today, but those who tried to sell off the dairy were accused of not understanding the importance of a captive milk supply for the Midshipmen.  Heaven forbid that the Naval Academy would have to buy milk from the private sector like everyone else.
<P>
While that may seem like a trivial example compared with the sacred cows that must be challenged today if you are to balance the budget by 2002, the fact remains that the federal government is one of the few institutions that still thinks itself able to afford the luxury of sentimentality at taxpayers' expense.  Businesses eventually cannot afford to hold on to activities, people, practices, divisions or subsidiaries that have become not central to the core business, outmoded, inefficient or a financial drain on the rest of the company.  Rather, they have to figure out what they should and should not be doing and then take decisive action to get their financial affairs in order.  If they fail to do so, they die.
<P>
When taking over a troubled company, a knowledgeable CEO checks his or her "teeth to tail" ratio, as they say in the military.  It involves undertaking a thorough review of the company's assets and resources and then promptly divesting those that are not central to the future success of the institution.  This forces the company to focus on its "core" business and to avoid wasting manpower, time and money on ventures that are secondary to what is vital to the long-term health and success of the company.
<P>
A good example of a corporation recently undergoing such a top-to-bottom restructuring is Sears, Roebuck and Company.  Sears in recent years decided to move from a widely diversified company to a company focused on its core businesses.  During this restructuring it closed a hundred unprofitable stores, took Dean-Witter, Discover, Allstate Corporation, PMI, and S.P.S. public, sold off unneeded assets and even disposed of the famed Sear Tower in Chicago.  Some of the cash raised from these sales was used to buy out thousands of middle managers, and the rest was plowed back in to strengthen its basic businesses.
<P>
One of the most painful and visible aspects of their restructuring was the decision to close Sears' catalog division--the business on which Sears was built.  The truth is that the catalog division was unprofitable and a drain on the company's main businesses.  As difficult as it was, however, this break with the past told Sears stockholders that management was serious about fundamentally restructuring the company and putting it on a path for growth.
<P>
The experience at Sears, and the experiences at hundreds of other companies, including two I helped to downsize--G.D. Searle & Co., a pharmaceutical company, and General Instrument Corporation, an electronics company--can provide valuable lessons on how to and how not to downsize and overhaul the federal government.  There is no one formula for successfully reorganizing a major corporation or the federal government, beyond the fact that it requires making tough, serious decisions, and it is often easier for someone from outside the institution who understands that this is his or her assignment to do it than it is for an insider.  Also, not surprisingly, it is best done by someone who knows how to do it.
<P>

<B> Define The "Core" Business</B>
<P>
As overseers of the federal government, an institution which, for the sake of discussion, is arguably in Chapter XI, Members of Congress will need to treat the job of restructuring it in the same urgent, tough-minded manner so many corporations around the country are now doing.  The goal must be to earn back the confidence of the taxpayers, who are the real stockholders of the federal government.  This does not mean simply "patching," as management guru Peter Drucker has characterized Vice President Gore and his associates of doing.  The reason National Performance Review (NPR) efforts have received so little public attention, said Drucker, is that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"In any institution other than the federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinventions would not even be announced, except perhaps on the bulletin board in the hallway.  They are the kinds of things that a hospital expects floor nurses to do on their own; that a bank expects branch managers to do on their own; that even a poorly run manufacturer expects supervisors to do on their own--without getting much praise, let alone any extra rewards."(1)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Certainly the NPR is a worthwhile effort -- a good idea.  But, much more is needed.  Techniques such as Total Quality Management, procurement reforms, or streamlining middle management will improve government, but they will only affect the problems in government programs at the margins.  Well-intended corporate managers have used the same sort of techniques and still failed or suffered.  It is vital that many of these things be done, but only after one has decided and dealt with the more central issues of what businesses to be in.
<P>
The first task is to decide what the core business is.  Once this decision is made, then everything else is secondary.  For the federal government, the four basic departments -- State, Defense, Justice, and Treasury -- have a solid basis for existence.  The other departments were either more narrowly based, were an afterthought, or both.  Some had utility when they were established, but no longer do.  Others, in my view, probably did not have a need to be at the Cabinet level even when they were first established.  A number of them were recommended and created less for organizational reasons and more to gain favor with a particular interest group.  Once one has determined the core functions to be performed by the federal government, all other activities should be scrutinized for elimination, downsizing, reorganization, movement to state and local governments or privatization.
<P>
I begin with the conviction that the first place activities should be undertaken is with the individual citizens and private organizations; next, if government must be involved, by local governments, state governments, and only last by the federal government.  In the past, this was not a workable principle in some instances because of the issue of civil rights, even though in theory it was compelling and rational.  It was clear that if some activities were left to local or state government or to individuals there would not be appropriate protection against discrimination.  Given the many civil rights laws on the books today and the progress that has been made, it is no longer the problem it was in earlier periods.  Today government services are being delivered to minorities in a nondiscriminatory manner.
<P>
My conviction is that as overseers of the federal government, Congress ought to use federal solutions only as a last resort.  The question must be asked whether a problem is truly a federal responsibility, or can it better be handled privately, by voluntary organizations, by local governments, or state governments.  I understand how difficult this is in Washington, DC, given the fact that all the institutional pressures seem to run the other direction.  But I'm reminded of a sage warning former Missouri Congressman Tom Curates once said, "Public money drives out private money."  And it does.

<P>
<B> Cut Sharply and Rapidly</B>
<P>
I read an article recently which set out some useful advice on downsizing from CEO Al Dunlap, who apparently did a skillful and swift job of restructuring Scott Paper Co.  On downsizing, he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Do it once, do it severely, and get it over with.  When a company says it is going to restructure over the next three years it won't happen . . . Don't do it!  You paralyze the company."(2)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This is sound advice for the Congress as it undertakes the massive task of balancing the federal budget by the year 2002.  Cut severely and rapidly.  Don't wait.  Whatever it is you do the odds are overwhelming that you should have done more, rather than less, and that you should have done it sooner, rather than later.  There are so many pressures in Washington, D.C., to keep the status quo, that the most frequent mistake is to make too few changes or to cut too little.  If in fact one cuts too much, which is very rare -- indeed probably unprecedented -- it is easy to add back.  But, once you cut and then find you have to go back and cut again, it is harmful to an organization.  Do it once.  Do it well.  Don't under do it.  And then let people get back to work.  Don't try to cut the dog's tail off one inch at a time, hoping it won't hurt as much.
<P>
And, a caution.  After the reductions have been accomplished, don't turn your head for a second or you will find the waste moving right back in.  It is inevitable that it will happen, and fast, unless the overseers are vigilant.  As the saying goes, "If you're coasting, you're going down hill."
<P>
Although the balanced budget plan drafted by the House Budget Committee is remarkable in its specificity and scope, in my view it ignores the principle of "cutting decisively and rapidly," in that it proposes phasing out some programs and agencies over a period of three to five years.  If a program or agency is outmoded and inefficient, phasing out its funding over a period of time will not make it less so.  For instance, I agree with those who propose to eliminate taxpayer funding for Amtrak, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and dozens of other programs that are not, or are at least no longer, appropriate federal responsibilities.  But why inflict on these programs the "death of a thousand cuts."
<P>
If Amtrak, for example, should be given the flexibility and the challenge to compete in the private sector, then why can't it be done sooner, say over the next 12 months, rather than over the next five years?  My advice is to sever public ties with much greater speed.
<P>
The Small Business Administration continues to dodge reform.  It was not even ten years old during my freshman term, yet, in a 1963 article on pork barrel spending, Life magazine exposed the SBA as a new "device for soaking up money and getting rid of it."  Based upon its early track record, we should have had the good judgment to close down the SBA decades ago.  I hope that this Congress will have the courage to act this year.  It is never to be desired, but given the current budget situation, good intentions and throwing money at problems hoping some of it will stick and do some good is unacceptable.

<P>
<B> Downsize</B>
<P>
I also recommend that Congress move swiftly to cut management and get personnel costs under control.  It is guaranteed that there are more managers and more staff in the federal government than are needed.  In less than seven months, Scott Paper eliminated 11,200 people, one-third of the work force.  The company cut 71 percent of the headquarters staff, 50 percent of management, and 20 percent of the hourly employees.  They discovered they really weren't needed.
<P>
Another example is G.D. Searle & Co., where I served from 1977 to 1985.  There we reduced the centralized corporate activities down to about 20 percent of their prior size, divested some 30 to 35 businesses, sold a variety of assets, downsized the company to close to 65 percent of its prior employee base, with the not surprising result that it worked better, earned more, and investors and owners moved the stock from about $12 a share to $50 to $60 a share.
<P>
So too at General Instrument Corporation where I served from 1990 to 1993.  There we divested five or six businesses, sold a number of assets, downsized and focused on the core business, and dramatically reduced the size of corporate headquarters, with the result that the investors and owners of the company moved the stock from below $15 a share to $50 a share.
<P>
There are hundreds of companies that are doing the same thing.  Some do it after they should have, others do it ahead of the curve.  Some wait too long, and they suffer and die.  Clearly the U.S. government is well behind the curve.
<P>
No doubt the federal government suffers even more waste on a percentage basis throughout the bureaucracy than even poorly run companies.  According to the NPR, the federal government has over 280,000 persons formally classified as "supervisors, managers, and executives, all of whom perform control functions, costing billions of dollars."  "At times," reports the NPR, "the federal government's management control system resembles a theater of the absurd."3    To make the point, if one used the Scott Paper model on downsizing as a guide, theoretically some 140,000 of these managers could be cut immediately, saving taxpayers billions of dollars.  For example, I see fewer and fewer companies where every manager has a special assistant or two.  But in government, it seems even special assistants have assistants.  Don't get me wrong.  I used to be one and I used to have one or two.  And I suspect many of you do.  Indeed, some are needed.  But, the revolution in information technology has changed the way work can be done so that excessive layering of organizations can be avoided.
<P>
<B> Reordering the Flow Chart</B>
<P>
There are a variety of ways to merge federal agencies and departments, and certainly no one way is perfect.  For example, over 20 years ago, Richard Nixon and the Ash Commission recommended that there be four basic areas:  defense, foreign policy, the economic, and domestic.  One can find powerful reasons for either merging or terminating many of the newer departments.  Some of their functions will, or course, need to continue, but certainly much of the overhead is not necessary.
<P>
While I have no special insight as to which is the preferred way to reorganize our government, I am persuaded that probably one-half to two-thirds of the non-central departments are no longer needed in their current form.  For example, the Republican proposal to close down the 93-year-old Department of Commerce seems reasonable to me.  It lacks a clear sense of mission and the fact that it duplicates the work of dozens of other departments and agencies is a sign that taxpayers could do without it in its present form.  The same could likely be said for others of the newer departments, such as Energy, HUD, Education, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Appalachian Regional Commission and EDA.  For example, the veterans were served before the VA was made a Cabinet rank department, as they should have been.  And they can be well-served, possibly better served, if it were to move out of the Cabinet and have some of its functions turned over to the private sector.

<P>
<B> Don't Micromanage</B>
<P>
There is no one perfect organizational arrangement.  The right people can make a poor organizational structure work well, and wrong people will assure that the best possible organizational arrangement will work poorly.  People are the key.  That is why the delays in the Presidential appointment process have been so damaging.  In many cases, cabinet and sub-cabinet posts have not been filled until after a non-trivial fraction of their entire term is over.
<P>
An important rule for a corporate board is to avoid trying to micromanage the CEO and the company.  Boards need to give management the direction to be sure, but also the freedom to run the company in the most effective and profitable way they see fit, and then hold them accountable.  One of the problems in government, and something that contributes to waste and mismanagement of the Executive branch.  My recollection from my days in the Executive branch is that Congress imposes so many restrictions, requirements, and requests on the Executive branch, no one of which is debilitating, but in the aggregate are like the threads the Lilliputians used to prevent Gulliver from moving.  This was certainly a problem at the Pentagon and I suspect still is, because of the blizzard of requests for studies and the directives and rules generated by the multiplicity of Congressional committees and subcommittees.  I want to commend you for taking steps to reduce the number of committees and subcommittees earlier this year.  It was a good start.
<P>
However, smaller government is an unachievable goal if Congress continues to try to tell the Executive branch when to turn right, turn left, speed up, or slow down.  What Congress needs to do is tell the Executive branch generally the direction to go, where the sides of the road are, and what the speed limit is.  Then Congress should stand back, oversee, and evaluate the administration on how well they do it, and if necessary calibrate the directions or change the drivers.  Too many hands on the steering wheel will put the truck in the ditch.

<P>
<B> Big Government and Big Business</B>
<P>
Anytime anyone proposes a change, there will be opposition and concern.  Change is not easy for people.  However, the fact that there is opposition and concern about proposed changes does not mean that the changes are undesirable.  Indeed change in both people and organizational assignment can bring in fresh thinking and approaches.  Certainly the entire country has seen the fresh breeze blowing through the Congress since the changes earlier this year.  It is refreshing, as even a number of my friends from the new Minority agree.
<P>
In Washington, D.C., change is a particular problem for several reasons.  Any change in the Executive branch tends to result in changes in people and organizational structure.  The effect is that it makes life less certain for people in the bureaucracy, which not surprisingly they resist.  It also makes life difficult for those they deal with -- Washington lawyers and lobbyists.  These folks have invested many, many years in the relationships and knowledge they have achieved, which, for them, is the coin of the realm.  Therefore, it should be no surprise that they often become the earliest and most effective opponents of change.  This is not because they think the change is unwise or unnecessary, but because they could lose their investment in the people and the structure as currently arranged.  They would have to start over again developing such relationships and knowledge.  This is certainly not a reason not to change.
<P>
Further, any change proposed in the Executive branch tends to result in difficulties for Congressional committees in that jurisdictions of committees can be affected.  There will be winners and losers.  Therefore, the predictable result of any proposed change tends to be that some Members of the Congress oppose it.  Here again, it is not a reason not to change.
<P>
It is important not to lose sight of the reality that Washington, D.C. is arranged in a way that only large companies are able to hire the lawyers, lobbyists, and representatives necessary to effectively interact with the Executive branch of the federal government and the Legislative branch to their advantage.  Only large companies have the resources to stay the course while the Executive departments and agencies study and delay decisions on matters that directly affect them.  Indeed, that is a competitive advantage large companies have -- they have the resources and they have the staying power.  Big businesses have the institutional capability to effectively interact with big government.  That is not true of small businesses.  Dealing with the federal government can suck the very life out of small companies that have to compete with big businesses in trying to avoid having government unintentionally take actions that are harmful to them.
<P>

<B> A Thought for Congress</B>
<P>
Thirty years ago, I testified before the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress.  One of my recommendations was to terminate the practice whereby Members of the House and Senate frequently announce federal grants, contracts and projects in their states and districts.  It didn't happen.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I said then:
<P>
" . . . to encourage or assist Members (of Congress) in making initial announcements of Federal grants, projects, and particularly Federal contracts, leaves at least a shadow of a question as to whether or not the contract or project was awarded solely, as it should have been, on factors such as cost, performance, and national interest.  I would think that a procurement officer or Corps of Engineers' official, for example, who based his decisions on needs, cost, and performance, would not be pleased to see Members' announcements of these contracts or projects leaving the impression that they may have influenced his decision."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

I suggest that government likely would shrink if Members ended this policy and thereby eliminated the incentive to have the federal government become involved in so many activities that belong in the private sector or in state or local government.  In short, implementing that recommendation would help.  As long as this practice remains, the incentive will be upside down and more and more activities are likely to move toward Washington, D.C.

<P>
<B> Privatization Insures Accountability</B>
<P>
"Corporacy" is a term relating to the private sector, meaning corporate "bureaucrats running corporations for their own good and the shareholder be damned."  Fortunately, and not surprisingly, the competitive marketplace punishes companies that become "corporacies."  Indeed, the most valuable thing that exists in business and in the non-governmental sector is the opportunity to fail.  And fear of failure focuses the mind.  Government programs are effectively insulated from the rigors of the marketplace and therefore are denied the possibility of failure.  The task for government is to find some substitutes or proxies for the possibility of failure -- for the "bottom line" -- in business.  One approach would be to have more "sunset" provisions to force legislative review after a period of years.  While not always appropriate, one other essential way of bringing this  level of accountability to the delivering of services is privatization.
<P>
Some thirty years ago, Nobel Prize Economist Milton Friedman told me that the best way of curing the problems of waste and inefficiency in the U.S. Postal System, then the Post Office Department, was to amend the law so it would no longer be a monopoly, and thereby would be forced to compete.  He was correct.  I have questions about some of the so-called "government-owned" corporations.  One effect can be to insulate such an activity from being accountable to either the marketplace or to Congress.  And, everyone needs to be accountable to someone.  The U.S. Postal Service and Amtrak are two examples.  Still other so-called government corporations, such as the Legal Services Corporation, aren't really corporations.  All the word "corporation" in the their title does is befuddle and confuse.
<P>
Certainly a number of these activities should be cut loose from taxpayers' purse and allowed the privilege of competing in the marketplace.  Competition is what brings out the best in people and organizations.  As the saying goes, "it is your enemies who make you strong."  I am attracted to the idea of divestiture or privatization of a number of government-owned enterprises such as the Air Traffic Control System, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, the Government Printing Office, public housing, defense stockpiles, and unneeded federal buildings and real estate.  I have no view as to whether it might make sense to make some of these activities "corporatized" government agencies as an interim step toward full divestiture.  In some cases, such a step might be useful in getting the some enterprise's books in order, providing time to inventory their assets, and in preparation for selling them off to people who know how to run such activities.
<P>

<B> Asset Sales</B>
<P>
I have trouble understanding why the federal government should be borrowing over $200 billion per year to cover its deficit when it is sitting on billions worth of assets that could and should be sold to the private sector to raise cash and which would then be forced to operate on a more cost-effective basis.  As the Dunlap article points out:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Inside every corporation is the biggest bank one is ever going to find -- its own assets.  My philosophy is, before you go looking for outside funding, look inside first at what you don't need.  We sold S.D. Warren, a paper subsidiary, for $1.6 billion.  It was a fine company but I believe you can't be in two capital intensive businesses and do well at both.  We sold other operations and have another $1 billion of assets on the block.  We are on track to be debt-free in 1995.  All this from a company that was heavily in debt, whose bonds weren't investment grade, when I arrived."
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Some twenty years ago, I chaired the Property Review Board in the Nixon Administration, which supervised the review of literally hundreds of federal real properties for movement to their highest and best use outside of government.  The resistance in both the Executive and Legislative branches was enormous.  That opportunity is still there and, given the current budget situation, must be seized.
<P>
Unfortunately, I am told that for the past decade or so, asset sales have been seen as somewhat of a gimmick here in Washington, D.C.  It is not a gimmick in the business world and need not be seen as such in government.  The goal of such sales is to use unneeded or under-utilized assets to reduce liabilities and to free up funds to be focused on more important needs.  This is a business-like strategy I believe the U.S. Government could usefully adopt.  I understand that the Majority's balanced budget plan does target a number of assets for sale to the private sector such as the Power Marketing Administration, the Helium Program, and the Uranium Enrichment Corporation.
<P>
That would be a start, but there are billions of dollars in assets which could still be tapped to reduce government's borrowing.  For example, the Heritage Foundation, in its very useful study, has suggested selling the government's $150 billion portfolio of direct loans to the secondary market.  This is an idea that could generate as much as $100 billion in cash.  Such steps could save taxpayers billions in future interest payments as well as have the advantage of moving such assets out of the government and into the more productive private sector.
<P>

<B> Conclusion
</B><P>
As the Congress goes about the business of putting meat on the bones of the balanced budget plan passed last month, it will have to make tough decisions.  I recognize the difficulty of that task, having served here in the House.  But I've learned that the decisions that are made every day in the corporate world are sometimes even more difficult, because the very survival of a company can be at stake.  The choices you make affect people with real careers, mortgages, and families to raise, to be sure.  But since you oversee an enterprise facing bankruptcy, you can have confidence that the decisions you make, however tough, can help to restore the long-term health of the government, our economy, and our country.
<P>
I thank you for this opportunity to share these thoughts, and I would be happy to entertain questions.

<blockquote>

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:
<P>
It is a pleasure to address this Committee on a subject which
has wrought enormous devastation on large parts of American society.
It has been well documented that during the last 15 years, American
society has experienced an alarming increase in social pathologies.
Almost every social pathology got worse, and many got much worse.
But during this pedod--specifically from 1979 to 1992--there
was one area where we made significant progress: curbing drug
use. Unfortunately, the latest reports indicate a resurgence of
drugtaking which began in 1993 and continues to get worse.
<P>
The progress against drugs was the result of a significant cultural
shift. During the late 1960s and much of the 1970s, drug use was
widely thought of -- especially by the young -- as harmless fun
or mere selfindulgence.  But by the late 1970s and throughout
the 1980s, when the human carnage caused by drug use became impossible
to deny, it became increasingly -- and far more accurately --
seen as a personal, medical and economic catastrophe.
<P>
Parents, educators, students, clergy, community leaders and even
the media helped to change and harden American opinion about drugs.
Behavioral change followed, and the federal government and many
states implemented intelligent antidrug strategies. As a result,
overall drug use went down. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s,
casual drug use by Americans dropped by over fifty percent. Between
1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declilied by almost eighty
percent. For a decade, drug use among young people steadily declined.
<P>
But last year, the nation received bad news on the drug front.
 Drug use among adolescents is once again on the rise. According
to the latest study from the University of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research, one in four students has used illegal drugs
before reaching high school; among 8th graders, 13 percent say
they have smoked marijuana in the last year ~ double the rate
of 1991; and over 40 percent of all 10th graders and nearly 50
percent of all 12th graders have used some illicit drug, induding
LSD, inhalants, stimulants, barbiturates, and cocaine and crack.
<P>
And hospital emergencyroom visits -- dominated by aging, inner
city drug addicts -- have increased to the highest number ever.
Cocaine, heroin, and marijuana cases all increased sharply to
new levels.
<P>
In the words of the Michigan study's principal investigator, Lloyd
D. Johnston, the drug trend is &quot;a problem that is getting
worse at a fairly rapid pace,&quot; and is being abetted by a
dedine in peer disapproval and a general softening of teenagers'
attitudes towards drugs.
<P>
These findings are part of a disturbing pattern, in a series of
studies which have documented a sharp rise in drug use. This increase
in drug use<B> should</B> have mobilized the federal government
to forcefully state the case against drug use, to enforce the
law, and to provide safety and security for its citizens. Instead,
the Clinton administration has abdicated its responsibility. The
Clinton administration has been AWOL in the war on drugs. It has
said or done little to encourage those fighting the good fight
and has proposed fundatientally misguided policies. Indeed, it
has shown much more interest in the baseball strike than in the
devastation of the young by drugs. Consider the record:
<UL>
<LI>Days after taking office, the administration cut the Office
of National Drug Control Policy's staff by more than 80 percent.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Soon after assuming of fice, Attorney General Janet Reno announced
that she wanted to reduce the mandatory minimum sentences for
drug trafficking and related federal crimes. Her focus? She is
engaged in a neverending search for the &quot;root causes&quot;
of crime and drug use.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The administration has endorsed a drug strategy calling for
a cut of more than 600 positions from drug enforcement divisions
of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the PBI, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and other federal agencies. It is to the United States
Congress's credit that this proposal was largely rejected.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The administration has also proposed cutting more than 100
drug prosecution positions in the U.S. attorney's offices; a cut
in funds for drug interdiction and drug intelligence programs
from fiscal 1994 levels; and an unfocused, wasteful drug treatment
strategy that will do little to target hardcore users.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Last year, the Clinton Administration directed the US. Military
to stop providing radar tracking of cocaine trafficker aircraft
to Colombia and Peru.  Congress again had to reverse this senseless
policy directive.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>This week, for the first time in history, the nation's drug
control strategy was introduced without the participation of the
president.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<I>If present trends continue, by 1996 the Clinton Administration
will have presided over the greatest increase in drug use in modern
American history.</I> And let me reiterate: this will have occurred
after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent
between <TT>1979 </TT>(the peak) and <TT>1992, </TT>and a reduction
of almost <TT>80 </TT>percent in cocaine use between <TT>1985
</TT>(the peak for cocaine) and <TT>1992.</TT>
<P>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy.
The Clinton admir istration suffers from moral torpor on this
issue. Policy follows attitude. In 1991, when asked about his
past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never &quot;broken
any drug law.&quot; A year later, he admitted that when he was
in England, he had experimented with marijuana but &quot;I didn't
like it. I didn't inhale it, and never tried it again.&quot; Later,
when asked whether he would inhale if he had it to do over again,
he answered, to laughter: &quot;Sure, if I could. I tried before.&quot;
<P>
Keep in mind, too, that former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders
has been the administration's most prominent voice on drugs during
the last two years. Throughout her tenure, Dr. Elders had favorable
words to say about drug legalization. And apparently her dismissal
had nothing to do with her irresponsible and outspoken views on
drug policy.
<P>
These statements&#151;as well as massive policy failures&#151;are
significant because of the mindset they reveal and the signals
they send. One of the conditions that allowed the drug epidemic
to occur in the first plate was the collapse of institutional
authority. Government in the 1970s often didn't know where it
stood or what to say about drugs; Peter Bourne, who served as
President Carter's adviser on drugs, said that &quot;cocaine is
probably the most benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread
use.&quot; Today such institutional collapse is echoed in some
segments of the public Just yesterday a Baltimore grand jury recommended
that marijuana be &quot;decriminalized&quot; and that other drugs,
such as cocaine and heroin, be distributed to addicts by doctors.
It's time for all of us to reread <I>A Brave New World.</I>
<P>
Government officials, through legislation and public discourse,
can legitimize and delegitimize certain acts. In a free society,
few things matter more than speaking about the right things in
the right way&#151;and making moral common sense the touchstone
of social policy.
<P>
During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her &quot;Just
Say No&quot; campaign. But it turns out that &quot;Just Say No&quot;
is far more effective than &quot;I didn't inhale.&quot;
<P>
Mr. Clinton spent much of the presidential campaign and the first
two years of his presidency decrying, in the name of the defenseless
poor, the social programs of two Republican administrations. But
today, on one of the issues that disproportionately harms the
poor&#151;that is wiping out many of the children of the poor&#151;he
and his administration have demonstrated indifference.
<P>
That being said, the question remains: where do we go from here?
During the question and answer time, I expect to get into some
spedfics of an effective drug strategy. But here, briefly, is
a framework for what I think would work based on my experience
in the Bush administration.
<P>
If we mean to renew our efforts in the fight against drugs, the
federal government needs to do a number of things. They include
allowing communities to choose their own antidrug priorities by
combining federal antidrug support with that from states and localities;
putting the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal
drugs from abroad, and giving the military control over the entire
interdiction process. We need to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocainesource countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine, and require the Attorney
General first to identify all major drug trafficking organizations
known to be operating in the U.S. and then to create a plan to
dismantle them. In short, there is a lot which the federal government
ought to be doing which it is not now doing.
<P>
Mr. Chairman, I want to conclude by making an obvious but often
overlooked point: success in the drug war depends above all on
the efforts of parents and schools and churches and police chiefs
and judges and community leaders. When I was President Bush's
&quot;drug czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities. I made
a point to go where the problem was the worst and to visit and
to learn from the people who made things better. I saw, as just
one example, Reuben Greenberg's heroic efforts in Charleston,
South Carolina, where he cut the crime rate to its lowest point
since the 1950s. I went to public housing projects and innercity
schools and drug treatment programs; I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements. The point is we know what works.
The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and toughminded and intelligent policies. The
people I visited and people all over the country are doing great
work. Ant that work will surely go on. But they deserve to have
the federal government meet its responsibilities, too. And right
now, that's not happening.  It's a disgrace.

Empower America <i>Highlights</i>
</h2>
<h2>Empower America Forges Ahead</h2>
</center><br>
<i>At a press conference on November 13, 1996, Empower America Co-Directors Vin Weber, Jeane Kirkpatrick, William Bennett, Lamar Alexander and Board of Directors member Donald Rumsfeld discussed the future of Empower America.  The following are excerpts from their remarks.</i>
<p>
<b>VIN WEBER:</b>  We've spent the last days assessing what happened in the last elections, the state of the debate and dialogue in the country, the state of our organization, what may have been accomplished, and where we're going from here.  In summary, we're very upbeat, positive, and optimistic about what has happened in the country, but certainly there are challenges ahead of us.  The election, and the debate in the election  and it's reflected in both parties  indicates the triumph or at least the progress of many of the ideas that we believe in and that this organization cares about.
<p>
There was no discussion in this campaign by any candidate about a bigger government, about higher taxes.  The debate was how best to restrain the size of government, what is the best path to reducing the scope of government, or what combination of  tax cuts  targeted or across-the-board  shall we employ.
<p>
There was no talk in this campaign about building new bureaucracies in Washington.  There was talk about various options for empowering individuals and decentralizing power out of Washington.  Some things probably were not talked about as much as they ought to be, such as national security policy and various social issues that Bill Bennett and others have been most prominent in talking about.
<p>
And there's a big agenda yet to be fulfilled over the course of the next 4 years.  But the good news is the debate has shifted dramatically in what we think is the right direction.  And we look forward to contributing to the debate and dialogue and trying to have an impact on the newly reelected Republican Congress as well as the Clinton Administration over the course of the next 4 years.
<p>
<b>JEANE KIRKPATRICK:</b>  We feel that the outcome of the election was very gratifying  The issues with which we have been preoccupied from our founding  served to refuel the discussion in political campaigns and the discussion between the parties.  The outcome is very positive from our perspective.  The new Congress is overwhelmingly committed to the principles and ideas that Empower America has been purveying and working on, reflecting on, and discussing and debating from our founding.  We think that this is missed to some extent by many of the people who have been discussing the election outcome, because there were so many predictions that the Congressional class of '94, with its emphasis on reducing and limiting the size of government, would be repudiated.
<p>
There were so many predictions of that outcome that many people didn't notice it didn't happen.  A good many people have spoken and written almost as if it had happened, as if there had been a repudiation of the class of '94.  In fact, what did happen was precisely an affirmation of those fundamental principles of the class of '94, including the multiple initiatives to reduce the size of government and its share of our lives and resources.  Since we're an organization concerned above all with policy and principles, and those principles were affirmed by the American electorate, we feel very good about it.  
<p>
<b>LAMAR ALEXANDER:</b>  My own view is that the voters knew exactly what they were doing last week.  I think they were saying to the Democrats, to President Clinton, we heard you say the era of big government was over and we agree with that.  But just in case you have a memory lapse, after you get back in, we're going to give you a Republican Congress to make sure you don't slip in more big government on us.
<p>
And I think the voters were saying to the Republican Congress, we know you believe in the end of the era of big government and you're going in the direction generally we think the country ought to go.  But until you can learn to tell us what's at the other end of that bridge to the future if you're totally in charge, we're not going to go with you.  I believe we'll never have an end to the era of big government until we have a Republican President to go with a Republican Congress.  And I believe there will never be a Republican President until Republicans learn to say what they're for, until they do a better job of explaining how tomorrow will be better than today if they are in charge of the government.
<p>
And that is also the mission of Empower America, I believe, to help paint a picture of our future, to look ahead, and say:  what will the post-big government era look like?  It's really not enough to say we're for abolishing the U.S. Department of Education and for home schooling, both of which I'm for.  There's something in between that affects about 90 percent of the American people.  So, our objective is how do we have the best schools in the world with less governmentwith a government that gives us tools and requires more from ourselves.
<p>
So, we've got some work to do.  We need choir practice, I think, on the conservative side.  And we need to paint a picture of what America would be like if the end of the era of big government comes.  That should be our mission.
<p>
<b>WILLIAM BENNETT:</b>  Let me talk about some of the issues I think we ought to address and that we  will address.  I believe below the presidential level the most important result of the elections was Prop 209 in California.  California, the country's most populous state and most culturally and ethnically diverse state, voted  by ballot referendum  to end preference and discrimination by race and gender.  It is a very interesting thing.  We will now have an argument about this issue in the courts and elsewhere.  To my point of view this was the right thing to do, a very momentous result.
<p>
Second, the courts.  In general, I don't think we give enough attention or pay enough attention to what is going on in the courts.  There is a very real risk, at least on a large number of issues, that the courts are abrogating the rights of a democratic people.  They are entering into areas where the people should decide:  Romer v. Colorado and doctor-assisted suicide, for example.  We'll see what happens with same-sex marriage.  These are areas where I think the democracy should work, people should weigh in on what they think.  The courts should not lift these things from the democratic process, arrogate them to themselves, and tell democracy that it's not fit to decide these important matters.
<p>
Third, there has been a lot of talk in the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns about big government, the end of the era of big government, too much government, and the devolution of government.  I think we've got some homework to do, and Empower America will try to do it.  Somebody needs to sit down and say:  Well, do we want a national weather service, do we want a drug czar, do we want a Bureau of the Budget, do we want HHS?   Why?  By what criteria?  By what principles?  Do we start with Lincoln?  Should government do those things which the people may not do so well for themselves?  This is analytic work.  We should be specific.  I think this would be a challenge to both Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals.
<p>
Finally, I'll continue work in the area with Sam Nunn and Joe Lieberman and colleagues at Empower America, such as Dennis Prager and others, on this whole area called the culture, which I think central to the future of this country.  If we are the world's most important country, most powerful country, most affluent country, most envied country, we are also the country that leads the industrialized world in murder, violent crime, in juvenile crime, in cocaine consumption, in pornography production, in pornography consumption, in abortion, in divorce, in teenage suicide, and a host of other things.  
<p>
Some of us think these are problems that we need to address.  We think that the whole area has now opened up.  The President has addressed these issues as well, such as what he did the other day on liquor ads, of television, television advertising, the movies, sports, and I imagine he will continue to discuss these.  These are legitimate issues of public inquiry and public policy debate, but not necessarily government regulation, by any means.  Because these things shape our country and our culture and our children, Empower America will continue to work in this area.
The final point.  Some of us are concerned that this "vital center" that's being talked about doesn't become a kind of national hugging fest and that it doesn't become a kind of diffident or dormant middle.
<p>
There are important issues before us.  There are important differences.  Let me pick the hardest one, right now.  It is the ethical matters raised about the President's conduct of office, the abuse of power.  Many of these issues are in the hands of the independent counsel.  But not all of them, and not all of the responsibility is there.  Congressional oversight is required, and it is dictated by law.  We have been through this before, and congressional oversight must not go by the boards.  I think the people at Empower America feel very strongly that we should encourage our friends on the Hill to exercise that responsibility if that is needed.

<p>
<H2>Welcome Back, Jack!</H2>
</center>
Co-Director Jack Kemp has returned to Empower America after a leave of absence since mid-August to run for Vice President of the United States.  The former Congressman and Housing Secretary is a Founding Co-Director of Empower America.  Throughout the campaign, Secretary Kemp espoused many of the ideas he developed while at Empower America.  Tax cuts, the need for a fair, flat tax, indexing capital gains and cuts in capital gain taxes, and fairness and equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of race are among the central issues with which Mr. Kemp has long been associated.
<p>
	Secretary Kemp ran on the Republican ticket with Senator Bob Dole.  Empower America, an issue advocacy organization, does not endorse political candidates for any offices at the local, state, or federal levels.  However, it is with a great deal of pride that the Empower America family welcomes back Jack Kemp.

<H2>Chairman's Letter</H2>
</center><p><br>
DEAR EMPOWER AMERICA ASSOCIATE:
<p>
          The political process by which America selects elected representatives is now over.  While Empower America does not endorse candidates, we were nonetheless thrilled that one of our Founding Co-Directors, Jack Kemp, was selected to be a Vice Presidential candidate.  After a vigorous and arduous campaign, Jack has returned to Empower America.  On behalf of the Board of Directors, Co-Directors, staff, and Empower America associates, supporters, and friends, I congratulate Jack for his distinguished contributions to our country and welcome him back.
<p>
          I hope this edition of Empower America Highlights conveys to you the sense of renewed vigor and commitment all of us feel to continue to advance the purposes of this organization.  I hope as well that you will recognize the extent to which the ideas and issues we have developed over the last four years did become agenda setters for the political debate which just occurred.  Most interesting, and gratifying, to us was the adoption of many Empower America positions by both major political parties.  I hope you feel as committed as we are to continue to shape the political debate and to experience the satisfaction of seeing ideas become actual policies.  That is our goal, and all of us at Empower America deeply appreciate your participation and support.
<p>
					Sincerely,
<p>

					Thom Weisel<br>
					Chairman

<H2>Crime Council Issues New Report</H2>
<p>
<b><i>Bennett, DiIulio and Walters Release New Book</b></i><p>
</center>
The Council on Crime in America, co-chaired by Empower America Co-Director William Bennett and Carter Administration Attorney General Griffin Bell, plans to release its second and final report this winter.    This report will provide wide-ranging recommendations on policies and initiatives that public officials, citizen-based groups, and individuals can take to reduce, control, and prevent crime in their neighborhoods.  
<p>
The Council on Crime in America was established in November 1995 to examine violent crime, crime prevention, and law enforcement efforts across the nation.  Earlier this year, the Council released its first report, which provided a comprehensive description of the extent and nature of crime in America.   The report argued that effective crime-fighting strategies must address three distinct challenges:  preventing violent crime, protecting the citizenry from violence, and restraining convicted violent criminals.   Effectively restraining violent criminals is necessary not only to  effectively address the first two challenges, but also to restore public trust in a criminal justice system that has functioned largely as a revolving door for predators -- releasing them back to the streets faster than they can be apprehended. 
<p>
Since then, the Council, led by co-chairs Bennett and Bell, has sponsored grassroots crime hearings across the nation to better assess public attitudes toward crime and explore community-based crime-fighting initiatives.   The publication of the final report will represent the culmination of the Council's research and findings and will highlight the most effective strategies and policies in America's on-going fight against crime.
<p>
<i>Body Count:  Moral Poverty...And How To Win America's War Against Crime and Drugs</i> is a new book by Empower America's William J. Bennett, and crime/drug experts John J. Dilulio, Jr., and John P. Walters in which the authors warn of ever increasing rates of crime and violence in the next decade, especially from a new generation of "super-predators."  <i>Body Count</i> contains a wealth of data and statistics that illuminate the depth of current and future crime waves, as well as the counterproductive operations of the nation's criminal justice system.  In a review of the book in the October 23, 1996 <i>Washington Times</i>, Gene Koprowski writes that "these disarming trends in demographics and drug use must be dealt with by attacking the cause, rather than the symptoms, of the problem. and that is, the [authors] say, the simple abdication of our institutionsfrom the family and the clergy to the entertainment industry and the federal governmentof their role as moral leaders."  As Bennett, Dilulio and Walters argue, "Many people have ignored or forgotten something that almost everybody once knew:  the good requires constant reinforcement and the bad needs only permission."  <i>Body Count</i> can be purchased at most bookstores.

<H2>CCRI WINS</H2>
</center>

<b>Proposition 209:  "The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin..."</b>
<p>
<p>
In an important vote with national significance, the citizens of California chose overwhelmingly to end decades-long practices of legally mandated racial and gender preferences that had come to be known as "affirmative action."  Empower America supported the passage of the California Civil Rights Initiative (C.C.R.I.), stating that "it is the first step in the necessary elimination of discriminatory and divisive practices."
<p>
Empower America Co-Director William Bennett commented, "C.C.R.I. will put us back on the path of the U.S. Constitution and Martin Luther King  the moral path."  C.C.R.I. reestablishes the spirit of the civil rights movement and the original intent of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that "no person...shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation, or be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance."
<p>
The term "affirmative action," as originally conceived by the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, was a moral injunction to reach out to the best-qualified people  regardless of race  and provide all people with equal opportunities.  However, during the past 30 years, well-intentioned but misguided efforts to address genuine racial inequalities have led to policies of racial discrimination because policies which mandated preferences on the basis on race shifted the emphasis from equality of opportunity to equality of results, and from individual rights to group entitlements.  The result was a divided America:  those who could legally be favored under the law, and those who could be legally discriminated against under the law. 
<p>
Martin Luther King's dream to judge Americans by "the content of their character" and not "the color of their skin" was embraced by C.C.R.I. chairman Ward Connerly, who led the successful effort to pass Proposition 209.  Empower America believes that the long civil rights crusade is embodied today not in racial preferences, but in school choice, lower taxes, economic growth, an end to rampant drug use and crime, and policies which emphasize opportunity over preference.  The California vote has opened the door for America to embark on an important national debate.  In that debate, Empower America will have a strong voice in favor of increased opportunity for all and equal treatment of every citizen under the law.

<H2>New EA Study Highlights Military Contribution of Immigrants</H2>
</center>
<p>
On the eve of Veterans Day, Empower America held a press conference with several leading immigration and veterans groups to release a study on the military contributions of immigrants to the United States.  The conference was held on Capitol Hill on November 7. 
<p>
Participating in the conference were Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett, Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), Alfred Rascon, a Mexican-born immigrant hero from the Vietnam War, and representatives from some of America's leading think tanks and veterans organizations, including the American Immigration Law Foundation, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S., the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, Heroes and Heritage, and the Japanese American Veterans Association.
<p>
The study, entitled <i>In Defense of a Nation: The Military Contributions of Immigrants</i>, was written by immigration expert Stuart Anderson, the director of trade and immigration studies at the Cato Institute.  It is a comprehensive historical account of the willingness of immigrants to participate in the defense of their new homeland and of the significant military contributions immigrants have made in areas such as weapons development.
<p>
The report tells the stories of numerous acts of bravery performed by American immigrants.  For instance, a special regimental combat team made up of the sons of Japanese immigrants was the most decorated of its size during World War II, even though the immigrant families of many of these men were interned by U.S. government authorities.  The study reports that more than 20 percent of Congressional Medal of Honor recipients in U.S. wars have been immigrants.
<p>
An immigrant war hero born in Mexico, Alfred Rascon, whose courage in Vietnam is described in the study, spoke at the press conference about the allegiance of immigrant soldiers.  As reported in the <i>Washington Post</i>, Rascon's "immigration status and ethnicity were not issues in the military.  'When you're wearing a uniform, everybody's green,' he said."  "I was always an American in my heart."
<p>
Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett said one of the purposes of the study was to acknowledge the "courage and patriotism" of immigrant soldiers, and, as the Roman poet Virgil said, "to give the honorable their due."  As a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial pointed out, "in an era where anti-immigration sentiment seems to focus on what benefits immigrants take away from this country, it seems worth it to recall their contributions to the nation's survival."
<p>
Copies of the report can be obtained by sending a check for $7.95 made payable to Empower America, to our address: 1776 I Street, NW, #890, Washington, D.C. 20006.

<H2>Rumsfeld on How Washington Has Changed</H2>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<b><i>Rumsfeld has been a member of Empower America's Board of Directors since its founding.  His distinguished public service includes four terms in the U.S. Congress, a Cabinet member during President Richard Nixon's first term, U.S. Ambassador to NATO, President Ford's Chief-of-Staff and Secretary of Defense.  Mr. Rumsfeld left Washington, D.C. in 1977 for a successful career in the private sector.  Senator Bob Dole brought him into his presidential campaign as a senior policy advisor and then chairman.  We found Mr. Rumsfeld's observations, made at Empower America's November 13 press conference, about how politics in Washington, DC has changed over the last 20 years insightful and instructive:</b></i>
<p>
As a non-Washingtonian, and a businessman from Chicago, I have several quick observations about how things have changed over the last couple of decades in this city.  
<p>
One change that struck me involves political polls; specifically the extent to which public opinion polling has seemingly almost taken over the political process, the proliferation of polls and the dominance they seem to have in the media's eyes.  I suppose that reporting on a poll is a relatively easy story to write.  It doesn't take a lot of legwork or thought to report on a poll.  I was also struck by the fact that the polls on the 1996 campaign were so wrong, for what I believe to be most of the campaign.  I think the final polls, the bulk of them, were in the 12 to 18 percent range in terms of the differential that they projected between President Clinton and Senator Dole.  It turned out to be 8 percent.  I should add that there were two polls that were quite close, Reuters and <i>Hotline</i>.
<p>
The effect of these polls on the campaign was not trivial.  A great many people were predicting and assuming that the campaign was over in May, and June, and July, which affected human behavior adversely from the standpoint of the Dole effort.
<p>
A second observation is the extent to which focus groups seem to have taken over the political process.  I had not been aware of it.  I watched some of these politicians stand up and in just a few sentences use the word "extremism," six, eight, ten times.  Over and over and over again, they did it.  I watched Mr. Gephardt on MEET THE PRESS just last week, even though the campaign is over, use "extremism" two or three times in the first few minutes.  No one ever stopped him and asked him, "What is extreme?  What are you talking about?  What do you mean?  Why is that word appropriate?"  No one in the media ever seems to call them on it.  
<p>
The phrase "risky tax scheme" obviously had been favorably focus-group tested.  It also was used over and over in the campaign.  If it hadn't worked so well, it would have been amusing.  What is a scheme?  A scheme is when somebody is tricked, in this context, out of their money.  It is when you promise a tax cut, come into office and impose a tax increase instead.  That's a scheme.  Leaving money in someone's pocket, as Senator Dole suggested, is not a scheme.  And yet no one ever called them on it.  I was intrigued; I have to admit it, it worked.  It dumbfounds me the extent to which there was a conscious attempt to manipulate the voters.  The politicians seemed to look for a word that's ugly and then used it repeatedly, and no one said, "Wait a minute, what do you mean?" 
<p>
I don't want to be judgmental about these things, because I am still trying to absorb it all.
<p>
The third thing that struck me, after being out of this town almost twenty years, is the extent to which politicians and the media spend enormous amounts of time not as politicians and not as journalists, but as "stars"  "media stars."  Putting on makeup, and taking off makeup.  Hustling from one event to another, where the basic task is to communicate through the media.
<p>
That seems to have led to a situation where the staff members in this town, in a sense, have begun serving as the politicians.  Now, I don't know that that's a fair comment, but I believe it is true to a much greater extent than was the case when I came here in the late 1950s as an assistant to a Congressman, and then served in the Congress in the '60s and the executive branch in the '70s.  It is a changed situation, regarding the roles that people are playing.  Remember the way the country evolved.  Members of the House and Senate under the Constitution were intended to be the human link between their constituency and their government.  And to do that, one has to actually think, to talk to constituents, participate in the legislative process, synthesize things, and be a true link.  
<p>
The roles have so shifted that, to a major extent, the people that are serving that role of link are young people, very bright, very talented staff people, who in many cases have never been in their bosses' states or districts, don't have the backgrounds of their principals, don't have the knowledge that theoretically their bosses were elected to bring to Washington, D.C., and to contribute to the legislative process.

Empower America <i>Highlights</i>
</h2>
<h2>The Media on the Media, the Elections, Liberals, Conservatives, Etc...</h2>
</center><br>
<i>At a panel discussion on November 19, 1996, hosted by Empower America, four highly regarded journalists analyzed the recent elections.  Selections from their remarks follow.</i>
<p>
<b>MICHAEL BARONE,<i>  U.S. News & World Report</b></i><br>
	This election was a pretty good election for conservative causes, but not entirely.  First, the country didn't move left, Clinton moved to the right.  Here you have a Democratic president who felt obliged to say the era of big government is over and attempted to campaign by moving sharply to the right on issue after issue...The Congress stayed Republican despite the $35 million labor expenditure; despite the Medicare issue which used be one of the third rails of American politics; despite a generally biased press and particularly a tough negative press which advocated and assumed the defeat of the Republican Congress for [many] months before the election...The country is in a very different placeDemocrats have 12 fewer senators, 60 fewer congressmen, 11 fewer governors, 500 fewer state legislatorsthan where it was when Bill Clinton was elected 4 years ago.
<p>
	The second point is on the level of government.  Four years ago, Democrats and liberals had several projects underway.  They wanted to increase tax levels...because they felt government should have more revenue.  They wanted to federalize health care.  They wanted to change the welfare programs but in ways that would be more centralized and federalized.  The Democrats did get their tax increase in 1993, but they got it at a ruinous political cost and also governmental cost, which is that taxes are completely off the table.  You can search this country very hard and not find a politician advocating more new taxes...The country made a decision...to keep health care reform devolved, and that decision is really not up for appeal.  Welfare...started partly as an attempt by House Republican leaders to bring up the welfare bill for the third time after Clinton had vetoed it twice.  But in fact he signed the [third] bill, [and we] are now having the defederalization of welfare...You don't see Democratic candidates running saying let's federalize welfare.
<p>
	The third point I would make is that to a very considerable extent, international markets are playing an important role in American politics and in politics all over the world.  And that is affecting the debate in a couple of places that tend to tilt conservative.  First, Clinton has made the most important appointment of his second term, and that's Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve.  Why is Clinton talking about doing something about Medicare and producing the same kinds of cuts and slashes that he attacked during the campaign?  The answer is that when you look at the budget, [Medicare is] where the money is, and the international marketplace is looking at the budget and the marketplace is telling him he has no choice but to do this.  	
<p>
	My last point is on cultural issues.  I think the verdict is a very mixed one from either a conservative or liberal point of view.  Our politics, it seems to me, is very often an argument between discipline and therapy...Discipline won with the Congress, with Proposition 209 on racial quotas and preferences in California, won in the South and Rocky Mountains.  The therapy approach won with Clinton, some key state legislatures going Democratic (California and Michigan), in New England and the Metroliner corridor, which voted quite strongly for the Democrats this time, and in the general tone of the campaign...I think those fights, those cultural wars as Pat Buchanan called them, are very likely to continue with the resolution unclear or mixed.
<p>
<b>RON BROWNSTEIN, <i>Los Angeles Times</b></i><br>
	Turbulence has been the defining characteristic of American politics over the last 6 years.  We've had three successive sharp swings in voter opinion:   George Bush goes from a high 90% approval rating in the wake of the Gulf War, to his repudiation in 1992 in which he suffered the fourth largest decline in the share of the vote won by an incumbent from election to election in American history.  Then, Bill Clinton comes in on a wave of good feeling and in the first 6 months he sees his approval rating drop faster than any new incoming President in the history of Gallop polling.  Clinton's approval rating then goes up and down, recovers a little bit in the fall of '93, but suffers another sharp decline in '94, resulting in the Republican Congressional landslide in '94, which was a landslide of truly historic proportions.  
<p>
	But in '95, the cycle kept rolling.  Newt Gingrich, having a sort of odd baby boomer competition with Bill Clinton, takes it to a new level by driving down the approval rating of the Republican Congress almost as fast as Clinton drove down his own approval ratings in '93.  When you get to the fall of '95, you see as clearly as public opinion can ever show you, an unequivocal pivot in the way Americans looked at Bill Clinton.  Up until then, most of the time his approval rating was under 50%...more months than not.
<p>
	Every incumbent president we've had with an approval rating over 50% in an election year wins easily.  Those under 50% have had tumultuous races in which the incumbents lose:  Eisenhower '56, Nixon '72, Reagan '84 in the first group; Ford '76, Carter '80, Bush '92 in the second group.  I believe the incumbent president's approval rating is the single most important predictor of where a presidential race is going to go.  
<p>
	In the crucible of the budget fight, Bill Clinton regains his footing and is, I think, redefined for Americans in two ways:  he goes from being weak and liberal...to being strong and moderate...[We then] seemed to be poised for a third collapse, the absolute failure of the Republican majority to win reelection.  We don't get that.  In the summer of '96, they regain their footing in Congress...the late sag in Clinton support...around new ethics allegations...pushes him down and Republicans hold on to Congress even as Clinton wins victory in '96, which was unimaginable in '94.  Almost every time in American history that a party that wins as many seats in the mid-term elections as the Republicans did in '94, they win the White House 2 year later:  1890, 1910, 1930 with the Democrats; 1958 with the Democrats; 1966 with Republicans; 1974 with Democrats.  It usually is a precursor of a turnover, so Clinton's turnaround should not be minimized.
<p>
	I think we are moving now from turmoil and turbulence to uneasy equilibrium [stemming from a] partisan standoff between two plurality coalitions that are almost demographic and geographic mirror images of each other:  a Democratic coalition that is heavily based on the support of women and a Republican coalition that is heavily based on the support of men; a  Republican coalition that is centered in the South and the Mountain West and the Plains States, and a Democratic coalition that is moving toward a realignment of the Northeast, dominance of the northern tier states and the West Coast...
<p>
	If you average Bush and Dole's share of the popular vote, it was the lowest for Republicans in any consecutive election since the first two Franklin Roosevelt elections.  On the other hand, in Congress, the solidification of Republican control over the South is bolstering them in the same way that the one-party South helped the Democrats for so long.  The Republicans also show that they can convert majority into money, into advantage, in close races as Democrats were able to do.  Republican candidates showed a great deal of skill in tailoring themselves to local conditions.
<p>
<b>JOSETTE SHINER, <i>The Washington Times</b></i><br>
	I am an ardent defender of the free press and of the American press, and all it takes is a few trips abroad to understand just how fine our media is...[However,] there is a bias in the media;  the polls and surveys that have been taken tell the story.  Eighty-nine percent of the bureau chiefs and reporters in the Washington press voted for Clinton, more than 50% describe themselves as left-of-center, and only less than 5% describe themselves as right-of-center.  But if you look at the Clinton vs. Dole coverage, you will not see bias there.
<p>
	I think the bias is far more profoundly felt in the sense that it is a whole paradigm, the whole view of the media of the debate in America today...For example, the debate over decentralized government, the size of government, has swept the globe.  You can't go to any capitol in the world where this isn't THE debate of our time.  It has been a debate throughout American history.  And yet the inclination on the part of the media is to either turn that into a debate over compassion versus greed, or into a debate over who really cares about poor people.  Simplifying that debate, rather than honoring it for how profound it is, has affected this election tremendously.  
<p>
	When you are dealing with a paradigm like that you have to start with the basics and say, we are not talking about who are good people or who are bad people.  We're talking about a legitimate debate to see if we have found the exactly perfect size of government...The debate over what our society upholds as the standard of behavior is also a legitimate debate and is not about who is mean spirited or who is generous spirited...
<p>
	I think the other problem in the media is a ever-growing desire to be players in the political process.  This is reflected in a quote by Sydney Blumenthal [a journalist]:  "I'm not a reporter.  I don't believe that the accumulation of isolated fact upon fact yields some sort of pure Truth."  When asked about telling the truth about Clinton, he said, "I've urged other reporters to desist from writing anything that could jeopardize Mr. Clinton's chances."  He was then asked, "Well, don't you have to tell the truth?"  He said, "It doesn't matter.  This is too important."  Blumenthal is a caricature of the reporter who wants to [be a player].  
<p>
	More important is the ill-advised experiment of the newspapers in North Carolina.  I'm going to read from a <i>New York Times</i> story:  "Several of this state's major newspapers and television and radio stations have agreed on the real concerns for residents this year, and working together are trying to force candidates to address them.  Among the newspapers, the coordination is so tight that they've begun publishing virtually identical stories by the same reporters each Sunday.  The reports describe the presidential and statewide candidates' stands on issues like crime and taxes which residents said were important when polled by news organizations two months ago."...The candidates in North Carolina were tremendously frustrated because they were not allowed to set the agenda.  I think three cheers for real old-fashioned journalism where we'd go in and don't feel that we need to define the process.  
<p>
	The third trend that I think is disturbing is this overreliance on polls...In the media, one of our sacred rules is when sources are discredited, you drop them.  The polls this year were almost all wrong, by a large margin.  And so this reliance in our coverage on polls throughout the process not only disempowers the voter, but it's misleading.  You'd think at some point, we in the media would say, we're going to make our own judgments and pull back to some degree from the polling, but I think the opposite trend is taking place.
<p>
<b>WILLIAM KRISTOL, <i>The Weekly Standard</b></i><br>
	The good news obviously is the Republicans holding Congress for the first time since 1928.  It means that '94 was a fundamentally important election, and if you talk to Republicans around town, they're pretty cocky.  There are 32 Republican governors.  Every time in this century there is an election in the sixth year of a presidency, the out party picks up seats.  So if things go normally in '98 Republicans will increase their majority in Congress.  There will be a fresh shot at the White House in 2000 without an incumbent Democrat and with a fresh crop of Republican contenders.  Ideologically, big government is discredited.  The exit polls in this election showed a strong plurality of conservatives over liberals in the American electorate.  And in the core issue of do you think government should be somewhat bigger and do more to solve our social problems or smaller, smaller beats bigger by about two to one.  So there is a fair amount of good news out there.
<p>
	...Now the bad news.  The fact that there is good news, that Congress was held, that Dole was a particularly weak presidential candidate, as was Bush in '92, has led to much too much complacency on the part of conservatives.  The fact is that the Republicans barely held Congress, and wouldn't have held it if the elections had been held 2 weeks or 10 days earlier.  They held it because of the Indonesian money scandal and because Clinton sat on his lead a little too comfortably.  If Clinton had come in at around 52, 53 percent, the Democrats would have, I think, taken back the House and the mood would have been very different.  So to sit back complacently because of an incredibly narrow margin in about 15 Congressional districts that the Republicans held, is, I think, foolish.  
<p>
	Young voters, always a leading indicator, who went big for Reagan in '80 and '84, went big for Clinton in '96.  That's a big problem.  Hispanics, all the Republican progress that was made in that group over the last 15 years was erased.  Some of the data isn't very encouraging.  Everyone is confident about '98, but as someone pointed out to me last week, every other rule of American politics has been broken in this decade, why shouldn't the rule that the out parties pick up lots of seats in the sixth year be broken? 
<p>
	The last two Republican presidential candidates got 38 and 41 percent of the vote.  Some people don't think Congress is more important than the presidency.  But I continue to believe if you really want to change American policies and public policy, you need the presidency.  If you think back to the history of the 20th century, we remember President Wilson, President Roosevelt, President Johnson, President Reagan.  You don't remember Speakers of the House or Majority Leaders in the Senate in those periods.  And there is a reason for that.  If you really want to change the country, you need the presidency and you need Congress and you need big majorities in both.  And 38 and 41 percent is a weak showing, very weak showing at the presidential level...
<p>
	The '96 election in retrospect will be viewed as the calm before the storm.  We have a good economy, the country has been at peace, the scandals haven't quite broken.  You could have a very choppy next couple of years and the electorate could break big one way or the other.  It's a great opportunity and risk.

Empower America <i>Highlights</i>
</h2>
<h2>From Newspaper Opinion Pages...</h2>
</center><br>
<p>
<b>About Foreign Policy</b><br>
"The campaign is already in the home stretch and Americans have heard little about what the presidential candidates think we should do in the world, or to the world....In this presidential campaign, no one is asking:  What are the nature and limits of our obligations to others?  Are they different than those to our countryman?...Most Americans think our government's foreign policy should serve the national interest, as it's commonly understood.  But at least among America's elites...a tendency has developed to see any one's problems as our problems and every one's interests as our own....The Clinton administration has been trying to do some of these things in Somalia, where it spoke of 'nation building,' in Haiti where it spoke of 'restoring democracy,' in the U.N., where it has emphasized the emergence of a New World Order...and no one has asked American voters if they are willing to see their hard-earned tax dollars spent for these purposes." <br>
		Jeane Kirkpatrick, <i>The Washington Post</i>, October 6, 1996
<p>
<b>About Welfare Reform</b><br>
"There is now a powerful consensus that the welfare system is ruinous and fundamentally flawed.  At the same time, there are different, compelling, but mostly untried, theories about what ought to replace it.  It is now time to try them....Welfare subsidizes and helps sustain illegitimacy....That is the area where I believe we ought to concentrate our reform efforts, as well as on promoting adoption and channeling more support to private and religious poverty-fighting charities....Others think that replacing welfare with public service jobs is the best way to go.  The only way to prove who is right and who is wrongor determine what is the best mixis to test these social theories against reality.  This is precisely why we need to allow the states to try different approaches.  Which is precisely what this welfare bill does." <br>
		William J. Bennett, <i>The Washington Post</i>, August 19, 1996
<p>
<b>About the Tax Code</b><br>
"We now have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to unleash our economy from 60 years of accumulated policy mistakes by throwing out the Internal Revenue Code and replacing it with a low, single-rate, simple tax system that is pro-growth and pro-family.  As was pointed out by the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform (TRC), which I had the privilege to chair, fundamental overhaul of the tax system would accelerate real economic expansion to at least 4 percent a year for five or six years.  Such an acceleration of growth would not be inflationary, because the expansion wouldn't be induced artificially by unwarranted monetary expansion at the Fed but rather would be generated by unleashing the pent-up productive capacity of the economy." <br>
		Jack Kemp, <i>The Washington Post</i>, August 2, 1996
<p>
<b>About Education Reform</b><br>
"...I think there are two very clear visions of what schools should look like in the new century.  Sen. Dole's view and the Republican view is of independent neighborhood schools, both public and private, that are safe and drug-free, that have high academic standards, and among which parents may choose the best one for their childrenhelped by vouchers to pay part of their tuition costs....President Clinton and the teachers unions by and large want schools with a new name, but schools that look a lot like what we have today....[this] vision means more government control, more union control, more court regulation, more federal programs." <br>
		Lamar Alexander, <i>USA Today</i>, October 30, 1996
<p>
<b>About Indexing Capital Gains</b><br>
"...a farm, home or business purchased 30 or 40 years ago for $20,000 and sold today for 10 times that amount would attract capital gains tax not on the difference between $200,000 and $20,000, but only of the real price increasethe value of the gain adjusted for inflation.  In many cases, nearly the entire tax liability would disappear....It is nothing short of confiscation for our national government to take 28% of the values of U.S. farms, ranches, mills, mines and shops when they are sold simply because a government regulationnot even an act of Congressdefines inflation as a capital "gain," when any fool knows it is not....What better example is there of the people's wisdom than the fact that they prefer not to sell their assets when they know the value will be decimated in the process?  It has nothing to do with the rich, but with the tens of millions of ordinary people who have to pay taxes on inflation rather than invest the proceeds in job-creating enterprises." <br>
		Theodore J. Forstmann, EA Founding Chairman, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, October 22, 1996
<p>
<b>About Tax Cuts</b><br>
"Tax cuts a 'free lunch'?  Who in the world does Mr. Clinton think created this lunch in the first place?  Mr. Clinton's alternative of 'targeted tax cuts?'  In effect, Mr. Clinton is saying Washington has to direct us how to spend our money.  Americans should be able to make their own decisions as to what best fits their needs." <br>
		Steve Forbes, EA Board of Directors, <i>The Washington Times</i>, August 15, 1996
<p>
<b>About the Federal Budget</b><br>
"For the record, both the administration budget and the one adopted by Congress in June...allocate exactly the same amount, year to year, for Social Security.  Adding in Medicare, Medicaid, welfare reform, the Earned Income Tax Credit and other social programs mandated by law, the difference in total spending between the two proposals amounts to less than 1.5% on nearly $6 trillion in projected government spending over the next six years....Critics insist the Dole plan's capital gains tax reduction is aimed at benefiting 'the rich,' yet Internal Revenue Service data for 1993 show that 57% of all tax returns reporting capital gains came from taxpayers with incomes below $50,000 per year....Keep in mind, though, the Dole plan is more than numbers and economic assumptions.  Its ultimate rationale is grounded in moral philosophythe recognition that individuals are entitled to the fruits of their labor." <br>
		Judy Shelton, EA Board of Directors, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, August 27, 1996
<p>
<b>About Economic Growth</b><br>
"Under a policy regime of higher taxes, more regulation and a bigger welfare state, President Clinton asserts that today's economy is the best in three decades....What does the historical record show about the economy's performance?....The 2.5 percent average gross domestic product (GDP) growth experienced during the Clinton expansion years is unusually weak by historical standards, almost two full percentage points lower than the average annual growth rate attained during the past five economic expansions." <br>
		Lawrence Hunter, EA Chief Economist, <i>The Washington Times</i>, October 14, 1996
<p>
<b>About Affirmative Action</b><br>
"Thirty years ago, the animating spirit of the civil rights movement was noble:  America as a colorblind society...true to the principle of equal justice.  The most eloquent embodiment of that movement was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose dream was an America that judged individuals by the 'content of their character' and not 'the color of their skin'....That dream has been deferred...[and] replaced by something ugly, narrow and pernicious:  a color-conscious society in which race-based discrimination has become the centerpiece of the liberal civil rights agenda." <br>
		William J. Bennett, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>, August 12, 1996

<H2>Commentary About Empower America</H2>
</center><p><br>
<b><i>The Washington Times:</i></b>  Empower America Strategy, Stars Rise<br>
"In a town loaded with think tanks, Empower America is the think tank of the moment....At its inception, Empower America was considered a refuge for conservatives who where out of power...Now, Empower America is in the game." <br>
		Brian Blomquist, August 15, 1996
<p>
<b><i>The New York Times:</i></b>  Influential Group Brought Into Campaign by Kemp<br>
"Not long after Bill Clinotn defeated President Bush in 1992, Theodore J. Forstmann, a New York investment banker, sat down with Jack Kemp to discuss creating an organization in Washington to chart a new course of conservative causes, particularly Mr. Kemp's advocacy of stimulating growth by cutting taxes....The result was Empower America....Said Tex Lezar...who took over in May as chief executive of the organization, 'You could say it's been a shadow government.'"<br>
		Douglas Frantz, September 1, 1996
<p>
<b><i>U.S. News & World Report:</i></b>  A Conservatism of the Head<br>
"...the secret of the Dole campaign has been ideas.  The proximate source of these ideas was a small Washington think tank started four years ago as a home base for William Bennett and Jack Kemp, with Jeane Kirkpatrick, former Rep. Vin Weber, Steve Forbes and Lamar Alexander as principals.  Everyone played a key role in sculpting Dole's message." <br>
		Michael Barone, August 26, 1996
<p>
<b><i>Human Events:</i></b>  Conservative Spotlight<br>
"....[this] all-star lineup, according to Empower America President and CEO Tex Lezar, gives the organization both grassroots appeal and high-level visibility, which the group uses to promote conservative ideas in each codirector's area of expertise....Lezar said, Bill Bennett works as a proponent of 'tougher approaches on criminal justice and drug policy, the need for mediating institutions and personal responsibility to revitalize the culture.  Jack Kemp, of course, is the leading spokesman of what he calls "entrepreneurial capitalism" or pro-growth economics....[he] is also a proponent of a "conservative approach to do more for those who have been left behind by liberal, statist welfare policies"....Jeane Kirkpatrick [is] the foremost advocate "anywhere for a strong America and the use of America's military and diplomatic strength to advance America's interests"  Vin Weber's legislative background gives him a keen understanding of "where the political process and policy come together'"...Lamar Alexander focuses on education....In addition...[his] experience in running for President has made him very knowledgeable and very concerned about the issue of campaign finance reform.'"<br>
		Steve Schwalm, November 1, 1996
<p>
<b><i>The Minneapolis Star Tribune:</i></b>  Think Tank Spawned GOP Tax-Cut Plan<br>
"Not long after Bill Clinton won the presidency and ended a 12-year Republican reign in the White House, four leading conservatives formed a think tank in hopes of carrying forward their vision of lower taxes and less government....No one could have guessed that four years later the four Empower America founders and a cast of others from the organization would dominate Dole's campaign and help shape the tax cut that is its centerpiece.  Aside from Dole's selection of Kemp as his vice presidential running mater:   Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, an Empower America director and financial backer, is Dole's national campaign chairman.   Weber and Rumsfeld are the campaign's policy co-directors, and Weber picked the committee that crafted Dole's proposal for a 15 percent cut in income tax rates.   Empower America's co-founder Bill Bennett, who was education secretary in the Reagan administration, is a campaign co-chairman.... Co-founder Jeane Kirkpatrick, the former U.N. ambassador, is a Dole foreign policy adviser.   Ex-Empower America chairman Steve Forbes is a Dole economic adviser....[Weber] said the Dole camp turned to Empower America for 'intellectual horsepower.'"<br>
		Greg Gordon, October 28, 1996
<p>
<b><i>USA Today:</i></b>  Dole Gets Not Just Kemp, But His 'Brain Trust' Too<br>
"Empower America provided Kemp with an important political forum....and when he was named Dole's running mate, he arrived with a conservative brain trust...." <br>
		Judi Hasson, August 13. 1996
<p>
<b><i>Education Week:</i></b>  Empower America Cast in Key Role in Dole Campaign<br>
"In the past two months, perhaps no trio of Republicans has shared the spotlight with Bob Dole as much as Jack F. Kemp, William J. Bennett, and Lamar Alexander.  All three are influencing Mr. Dole's presidential campaign in different ways, yet they have something in common:  All have been waiting in the wings as co-directors of Empower America, the Washington think tank that promotes 'progressive conservative policies based on principles of economic growth, international leadership, and cultural renewal'....Voucher legislation first prepared in 1992 by Mr. Alexander, as secretary of education in the Bush administration, has been the basis for Mr. Dole's 'opportunity scholarship' proposal in an election in which voters say education is at the top of their agenda....And while the November election will render a verdict on Mr. Dole's agendaincluding its Empower America themesofficials at the organization plan to plow ahead with their efforts regardless of the election results." <br>
		Mark Pitsch, September 18, 1996

<H2>Bennett: Politics Aside</H2>
</center>
During the last three decades, America has experienced an unprecedented degree of social regression. If things continue the way they are going, we may well see the end of the American experiment in ordered liberty. To be more specific: if current trends in juvenile crime, illegitimacy, family disintegration, community breakup, education, and drug use continue, this experiment in self-government will end. This is a conclusion based on a disinterested analysis of social facts. After all, there is nothing inevitable about this experiment. Our system of ordered liberty was brought about by will and thought and reflection, not by chance. The Founders said that we would have to maintain certain efforts to keep it together. Some of those efforts are being maintained. But many are not.
<p>
During our Candidate School, you have heard from some people we regard as among the ablest and smartest around in various policy areas. Public policy is crucial; here at Empower America, we are trying to advance the most intelligent and thoughtful policies we can. But I believe the cultural arena is even more important. That is not to say that cultural ideas can't be significantly influenced by people in politics. Indeed, they can. But I have to say, I think it probably matters more for the cultural future of this country what happens in movies and television, and on the radio and in classrooms, than what happens on Capitol Hill.
<p>
Talk to a group of teenagers and tell me if they sound more to you like they're listening to C-Span or MTV. And I will tell you: they sound a lot more like MTV. This doesn't diminish the political task. It just makes it clear that there are other tasks as well. And of course the two are related.
<p>
I think that if the philosophy of life being promulgated in TV commercials, movies. television and other cultural media changed, it would probably bring about more of a positive change in American life than virtually any piece of legislation we can imagine.
<p>
There is the belief among many of the people who have the most power and influence to shape attitudes that the most important obligation in life is to yourself, that your duties are to yourself - not to God, not to country, not to work, or family, or wife, or children, but to self. And if self is not happy or satisfied. then it must take priority. This, in my view, is a social disaster and an invitation to barbarism. It is a dagger aimed at the heart of our society. But it prevails in many quarters . It has been given to us by some intellectuals. Much of Hollywood pushes that view. And it is central to much of contemporary liberalism. I think it is poisoning the moral environment of America.
<p>
Bad philosophy has destroyed the lives of many people in this country. It has destroyed many homes, many communities, and will continue to unless we confront it directly. If you do try to fight this thing by taking on its proponents, you will be in for one heck of a fight. But it is a fight worth having. Indeed, it is one of the fights that matters most.

Empower America's <i>Highlights</i>

<H2>Kemp: Growth and Hope</H2>
</center>
Empower America was founded to present conservatism's positive face, on the premise that the instincts of the American people arc naturally optimistic and that their values are predicated upon the virtues of a Judeo-Christian society . We believe that conservatives should always be forward looking, not backward looking; optimistic, not pessimistic; confident, not timid; and inclusive, not exclusive.
<p>
You cannot lead anybody with pessimism. Can you imagine a quarterback going into the huddle and saying, "Gosh, it's hot out here. Wow, those guys are big over there. I know this play has never worked before, but I don't know what else to do. Let's try it again." No great adventure has ever been led by anybody who says it can't be done. Leadership has to be predicated upon confidence in one's own abilities as well as on a belief in the inevitability of ultimate victory.
<p>
Leadership should be centered around a world view of hope, optimism, confidence, and the ultimate achievement of victory - for the right reason. The Bible says overcome evil, overcome it with good. Conservatives are obligated morally, not only to indict darkness, but to also light candles; not only to be against that which is bad, but also to be for empowering and unleashing the potential of the human spirit.
<p>
A great conservative named Oswald Spengler wrote <i>Decline of the West</i> in 1931. He was pessimistic about democracy. He thought that democracy wouldn't survive against fascism and Nazism. One of the founders of <i>National Review</i>, James Burnham, wrote <i>Suicide of the West</i>. He said we were going to commit suicide because democracy wouldn't work. Jean Francois Ravel, another leading conservative, wrote a book in which he said democracy will turn out to be a parenthesis in the history of the world.
<p>
Unlike these men, I'm an optimist. I always knew we would win. Sometimes, however, it has been tough maintaining this positive outlook. I know there are problems. Human rights abuses continue in China, the Middle East, and Bosnia Despite these problems, democracy has defeated all of the "isms" of years past - absolutism, fascism, Nazism, and communism.
<p>
Socialism is dead intellectually. Isolated pockets remain in Cuba, North Korea, and in the economics departments of some of our Ivy League colleges, but very few people today talk about socialism as an answer to poverty. In my view, there is only one real answer to poverty: a system based on private property, limited government, the rule of law, and entrepreneurial capitalism. The Left has tried to make Americans feel guilty about this kind of a system - to envy the rich, to desire a redistribution of wealth, and to centralize power. Thanks to computers and the telecommunications revolution, much of the world now has instantaneous access to information. This revolution will be the ultimate undoing of modern liberalism's centralizing tendencies. Markets will be energized, unleashed, and individualized. In this new environment, mistakes in government policies can cause capital to flow out of a country as fast as it flows in. All of this means that governments cannot control commerce like they used to.
<p>
My entire political career has been dedicated to the proposition that conservatives should be positive and optimistic and demonstrate a concern for the underdogs in our society. It is outrageous that conservatives have allowed liberals to steal genuinely good words - welfare, for instance. Don't think of welfare in terms of what the Left has described. I care about the "welfare" of my family. Welfare is not a bad word. We have allowed it to become synonymous with government handouts . What welfare really means is the well-being of someone. Conservatives <i>should</i> care about the welfare of the American people. We <i>should</i> want everyone to be able to get a good education, get a job, get married, have children, and move up the economic ladder.
<p>
People don't care how much you know until they know that you care. That is why conservatives must be inclusive. We have got to show South Central Los Angeles that we care about them just as much as we care about Wall Street. If our policies will not work in East Saint Louis, how can we sell them to Russia or Eastern Europe?
<p>
I proposed the idea of free enterprise zones for the District of Columbia in order to enhance the city's ability to recover its middle class. Two hundred thousand families have moved out of D.C. over the past 15 years because of taxes, crime, and a lack of educational quality. I helped introduce a Hong Kong-like tax code for D.C. because we have to do something radical to save the nation's capital. Many liberals in Washington knocked my head off, saying, 'There goes Jack Kemp again, trying to help the rich, only thinking of himself." Recently, D.C.'s Delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, introduced a Hong Kong-like tax code for the District of Columbia. A flat, 15 percent income tax for the whole city. She is an African-American and a liberal Democrat. She introduced my bill for D.C. within 24 hours. She called it "The Economic Recovery Act." With that kind of a strategy, how can the Left say that conservatives don't care about the welfare of the poorest among us?
<p>
Liberals have shown that they care by putting people on welfare. Conservatives have got to show people how to get off of it, and how to get into jobs and education and the type of opportunity for which we are working. Every single voter - regardless of color, regardless of residence - is a potential consumer you have to communicate with. If you understand your job, your product, and treat people with care and concern, even though they may not vote for you, you've done a service for conservatives. If we have a good product, conservatives ought to be able to sell it in any area and to anyone in the United States.
<p>
Conservatism and optimism are not mutually exclusive. I believe that successful candidates for public office in 1996 and beyond will be the ones who embrace policies and strategies that exhibit both of these qualities. It means advocating a message of hope and it means supporting ideas that will spur economic growth. How you execute your campaign, how you approach leadership, what your attitude is toward people is essential to the outcome. Does anybody doubt that? Whether it's a huddle, a home, a business, or politics, your attitude will determine the outcome of your endeavor. If you've got the right outlook, the willingness to succeed, and the love in your heart for this country, your message and the strength of your ideas will be more powerful than any army in the history of mankind.

<p>
<H2>Kirkpatrick: US Credibility</H2>
</center>
I am pleased to be at this Empower America event with all of you candidates who are running for office and hoping to turn good ideas into the policies of the United States, at the local, state and national level. I'm sure you're going to know what to do after you're elected: to implement the policies that create free people, that strengthen free people, that expand and protect freedom, and that encourage the ingenuity, enterprise and energy that free people apply in situations where initiative and enterprise are permitted to prevail.
<p>
Our foreign policy is - always and inevitably - an expression of our government and our society, our will and our purpose, as is every government's foreign policy an expression of the morality and purposes of that society and that government. Policies of a government are not likely to be much better than the quality of its government - at least not for long. This is especially so in national security matters, where credibility depends directly on the government's strength and also its will. I firmly believe that American credibility, and the appreciation of our strength and our purpose, is our most important asset in the conduct of foreign affairs and national security. I believe the Clinton Administration has been squandering American credibility, power, reputation and respect in the world. I think our credibility has declined along with our military strength. There is a very real correlation - it is an unfortunate correlation when you are weak, and a fortunate one when you are strong - between strength and respect. We have been the strongest government and country in the world. We probably still are the strongest country in the world, but we are a good deal less strong than we were four or five years ago. We are a good deal less strong than we were when the Berlin Wall came down. We are a good deal less strong than we were when Bill Clinton was inaugurated.
<p>
When our credibility suffers, those leaders contending for ultimate power, in, for example, China, are strengthened. Those most likely to use force, like firing missiles to threaten Taiwan, are strengthened. And when our credibility suffers, North Korean dictators, like Kim Jong II, are more likely to violate the demilitarized zone, and more likely to offer new challenges to South Korea and other neighbors. And when American credibility suffers, the governments of countries like Iran, Syria and Libya are greatly encouraged.
<p>
We are becoming less strong because our military - our forces and our weapons, our research and development - are being permitted to decline by the refocusing of attention and reallocation of resources in the Defense Department. Generals in the Defense Department are confessing, reluctantly, to committee chairmen in the House National Security Committee that the level and rate of procurement which the Administration is providing for our future is not adequate to provide for our future. The military will be short of a good many things that we need. Already training budgets have been displaced by what are thought to be more urgent needs. Our armed forces' spare parts budgets have been raided for what are thought to be more urgent needs. And our research and development is just simply neglected.
<p>
The Clinton Administration has doggedly declined to invest in a missile defense for the United States, not facing the fact that if we don't develop a missile defense, we will not be able to help anyone else defend themselves against missiles either. Apparently, it occurred to the President recently that Israel might need some help with missile defense, and announced that the United States would assume that responsibility. The fact that some systems exist for missile defense comes from the research and development that was undertaken in the Reagan Administration. This was for a much larger missile defense program, one which would be able to defend you and the citizens you hope will vote for you, one to protect and defend the whole country. Unfortunately, Bill Clinton has shut down almost all of this program in the last three years. One hopes that he will reconsider missile defense for the United States.
<p>
This President is not oriented toward thinking about defense. He is not oriented toward providing for American strength. He is, in fact, reluctant to think about strength. The whole Administration is reluctant to think about strength, including even the Defense Department, of all the places to be reluctant to think about strength. The President and the Administration, the Secretary of Defense, have gone forth into the world again and again, carrying a very large carrot to deal with very disagreeable dictators, like Kim Jong II of North Korea, like Syria's Assad, like Fidel Castro, like some of the Chinese some of the time.
<p>
I believe that the decline in our credibility has already produced unfortunate experiences, such as the shooting down of American planes and the murder of American pilots over international waters near Cuba. Even though our media kept talking about Cuban exiles, those were American citizens flying very small, unarmed, American planes, which were shot down near Cuba. And what happened after they were shot down, unprovoked, these unarmed planes which had done no harm to anyone? What happened? Actually what happened, of course, was nothing happened. Nothing at all, there was no retribution of any kind. I don't know what Ronald Reagan would have done in that situation. But the point is, we don't know because Fidel Castro wouldn't have done something like that when Ronald Reagan was president. Muammar Khaddafi did something like it when Ronald Reagan was President, and he found out what Ronald Reagan would have done. <p>
The fact is that when America is strong and America is purposeful, and we stand with democracies, and we stand with freedom, we strengthen peoples and countries who share our values. The whole world profits. When our strength declines, and our credibility, strength and purpose are questioned by thugs, the world becomes more dangerous.

<H2>Candidate School Sets Out Fall Course</H2>
</center>
The notion that "ideas have consequences" is central to the work and mission of Empower America, and was at the core of Empower America's 1996 Candidate School held on April 29th in Washington, D.C. Candidates and campaign strategists from local, state and national races in twenty-four states met with Empower America's Co-Directors and leading policy experts for a detailed discussion of the issues that are central to the 1996 elections.
<p>
In his welcoming remarks, Empower America Co-Director Vin Weber told the candidates, "Our organization was founded in order to bring important political ideas to the forefront of our national debate, where they can be vigorously deliberated and acted upon. Empower America's candidate training school and briefing book are just one part of that broad effort. Our intention is to reach beyond the necessary issues of campaign management (i.e., polling, fundraising, advertising and organization) to the <i>intellectual</i> content of the political process. Our ambitious goal is to help seed the national political debate with substantive thought. We believe it is that dedication to ideas and issues that distinguishes this instruction."
<p>
The seminar was opened by Empower America Co-Director Jack Kemp, who spoke of unleashing America's economic potential. The path to the American dream must be opened, said Kemp, by reforming the tax code; removing barriers to work, savings and investment; and by opening the possibilities for all citizens to gain access to capital and credit.
<p>
Jack Kemp's remarks were followed by a panel of economic policy experts discussing three of the most significant reforms necessary for economic growth. Dan Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation offered a detailed discussion of tax reform; Mike Horowitz of the Hudson Institute described the need for tort and regulatory reform; and John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis (N.C.P.A.) addressed a topic that is about to become a leading economic and political issue: the privatization of Social Security.
<p>
A second panel, entitled <i>E Pluribus Unum</i>, tackled the fragmentation of American society. Stuart Anderson of the Cato Institute described the benefits of legal immigration and the unwise nature of current anti-immigration initiatives; David Murray of Statistical Assessment Service offered an excellent explanation of the true nature of American "oneness" and the pitfalls of "multiculturalism"; and Brian Jones of the Center for New Black Leadership spoke of the social harm produced by preferential policies based on race and gender.
<p>
Panel three turned its attention to devolution of societal responsibilities from government to civil society, and the need to rebuild and strengthen community institutions. The speakers were three leaders in that effort Adam Meyerson of the Heritage Foundation, editor of <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship;</i> Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a pioneer in community and individual self-help efforts; and Mike Gerson. policy director for Sen. Dan Coates, who spoke on behalf of the Senator's 19-point legislative program to strengthen civil society, the Project for American Renewal.
<p>
At lunch the candidates heard from former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick discussing foreign policy and the erosion of America's hard-earned credibility and worldwide leadership during the Clinton presidency.
<p>
Two afternoon panels instructed the participants on a wide range of domestic issues. and on the experiences of the 104th Congress . Domestic issues were covered by five of the top thinkers in their fields. John J. DiIulio covered crime; former assistant Drug Czar John P. Walters discussed drugs; Chester E. Finn of the Hudson Institute spoke on education; Merrill Matthews of the N.C.P.A.'s Center for Health Policy Studies reviewed health care; and the former Director of the U.S. National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, Douglas Besharov, spoke about welfare.
<p>
Three leaders of the Freshman class of the 104th Congress conducted a lively question and answer session during the final panel, informing the candidates from their own experience. Congresswoman Sue Myrick (9-NC), Congressman Sam Brownback (2-KS) and Congressman Dave McIntosh (2-IN) urged the attendees to join their "revolution" to reduce government and return power and responsibility to Americans.
<p>
The final remarks were delivered by Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett. Dr. Bennett spoke of the need for cultural and societal renewal in America, and of the forces and policies that have weakened our culture. His address wrapped up a day that several candidates described as bringing focus and a winning edge into their strategy. "So much good information." said a candidate for U.S. Senate, "I'd do it again."

<H2>EA Releases Influential lmmigration Study</H2>
</center>
At a recent press conference in Washington, DC, William Bennett and Jack Kemp released a study sponsored by Empower America about employment-based immigration. The report, <i>Employment-Based Immigration and High Technology: Issues and Recommendations,</i> examines the impact on the wages and employment opportunities of native-born Americans produced by the employment of foreign-born engineers and scientists.
<p>
The author of the study, Stuart Anderson, a visiting scholar at the Cato Institute, compiled data from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and conducted interviews with engineering and computer industry corporate leaders to determine if immigrants hurt job opportunities for American engineers and scientists, as is commonly believed. The study concluded that U.S. high tech companies hire foreign-born engineers and scientists because, in these highly specialized industries, they frequently possess unique skills and fill key technical niches in the U.S. Iabor force.
<p>
Foreign born high-tech employees are not paid less than their U.S. counterparts, which is also commonly believed. Indeed, data from the NAS show that the median salaries of foreign-born engineers and scientists are significantly <i>higher</i>, not lower, than their native-born counterparts who completed their Ph.Ds in the same year. Furthermore, the study demonstrates more generally that foreign-born engineers and immigrants play a significant role in creating jobs in the high technology fields through entrepreneurship and innovation.
<p>
Calling the study a "wakeup call," Dr. Bennett and Secretary Kemp called the report "a warning specifically to those who believe that scaling back on legal immigration will help the American worker. Friends of the American worker are by necessity defenders of immigration, for immigrants serve as a catalyst for economic growth. This study dispels the myth that employing immigrants displaces American workers."
<p>
The study was distributed to all the members of the U.S. Congress as they considered legislation aimed at curbing legal immigration. Empower America's role in shaping the final outcome of this legislation was significant. Provisions aimed at reducing employment-based immigration were eliminated from the Senate bill; and, ultimately, the Senate voted to split their immigration reform bill by considering legal and illegal immigration separately. Similarly, the House passed a bill that cracks down on illegal immigration, but rejected provisions that would have reduced legal immigration by nearly one-third.

<H2>EA Announces New Leadership</H2>
</center>
The Board of Directors of Empower America has appointed Thomas W. Weisel as Chairman of the Board and Tex Lezar as President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Weisel served as Acting Chairman when Steve Forbes took a leave of absence as EA's Chairman to run for President in the Fall of 1995.
<p>
Weisel is founder, Chairman and CEO of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco one of the nation's leading securities firm. Under Weisel's leadership, Montgomery Securities' annual revenues have grown over the last 25 years to exceed $500 million. Weisel holds five National Master's titles in cycling and has served as Chairman of U.S. Skiing, the governing body of the U.S. ski team.
<p>
EA Co-Director Jack Kemp called Weisel, who specializes in taking smaller "growth" companies public, "the embodiment of the American dream." Kemp continued, "Thom has demonstrated in his professional life that entrepreneurial capitalism works. He has spent his life pushing entrepreneurs toward success. His real-world insight and world-class fundraising capabilities will continue to be of tremendous benefit to Empower America."
<p>
Empower America's new President and CEO, Tex Lezar, comes to the organization from Dallas, Texas, where he is engaged in private law practice. Lezar, who served as Assistant U.S. Attorney General under President Reagan and edited <i>Making Government Work A Conservative Agenda for the States</i>, has been a prominent litigator and appellate lawyer in Texas since 1977. In 1994, Lezar was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Texas.
<p>
Bennett, Kemp, Kirkpatrick and Weber jointly said, "Tex Lezar comes from the school of Ronald Reagan and adheres to its credo - an optimistic faith in freedom, democratic capitalism, strong national defense and time-honored values. He has a sound knowledge of public policy and politics, and brings to Empower America the fruits of an impressive career in government, law, and politics. We are very pleased to have Tex aboard."
<p>

<H2>Co-Directors Support Missile Defense</H2>
</center>
<i>The Defend America Act of 1996 (H.R. 3144) would mandate the development and deployment of a national missile defense by 2003 to protect all Americans against the threat of accidental or limited ballistic missile attack. Empower America Co-Directors Kirkpatrick, Kemp, Bennett, and Weber sent a letter to the entire House of Representatives urging that they vote in favor of this vital legislation. Excerpts from the letter follow:</i>
<p>
"Today, dozens of countries have or are seeking to acquire ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. These include Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya, to name a few. Incredibly, America still has no defense against this threat. Even a single missile launched at our nation - whether deliberately or by accident - would have tragic consequences, and, if it were armed with a nuclear, biological, or chemical warhead, the results would be catastrophic.
<p>
The technology exists today to move forward with a limited ballistic missile defense that is able to protect Americans in all 50 states - and to do so at an affordable cost. The Defend America Act would make it clear that Americans will no longer remain hostage to unlawful states and the decisions of their unpredictable rulers.
<p>
The Clinton Administration still refuses to take our vulnerability to a missile attack seriously. The Administration has said it does not foresee missile threats to the United States emerging in the next 15 years. They ignore the still formidable Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals and place an historically unwarranted faith in the intelligence community's ability to recognize Third World missile threats in a timely manner - before they materialize. Our underestimation of the scope and magnitude of Iraq's missile program prior to the Gulf War is proof enough of this.
<p>
It is crucial to ensure that all Americans have the protection they deserve against threats to their security. But today, Americans have no protection against ballistic missile attack. We therefore urge you, in the strongest terms, to vote for the Defend America Act."

<H2>From Newspaper Opinion Pages...</H2>
</center>
<b>About "Same-Sex" Marriage </b><br>
"I believe that overall, allowing same-sex marriages would do significant, long-term social damage...Recognizing the legal union of gay and Iesbian couples would represent a profound change in the meaning and definition of marriage..Marriage is not an arbitrary construct; it is an 'honorable estate' based on the different, complementary nature of men and women - and how they refine, support, encourage and complete one another. To insist that we maintain this traditional understanding of marriage is not an attempt to:put others down. It is simply an acknowledgment and celebration of our most precious and important social act....It is exceedingly imprudent to conduct a radical, untested and inherently flawed social experiment on an institution that is the keystone in the arch of civilization. That we have to debate this issue at all tells us that the arch has slipped."<br>
      William J. Bennett, <i>Washington Post,</i> May 21, 1996<p>

<b>About Expanding NATO</b><br>
"Support for the admission to NATO of Eastern European democracies has been growing in Washington. A bill for which bipartisan support is expected has been drafted in the House International Relations Committee calling for NATO 'at early date' to include, at a minimum, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.... There is no spirit of Munich here. The bill's authors believe - as I believe - that it is about time that the new democracies begin to enjoy the full benefits of freedom, including credible security. Should such a bill be acted on before the Russian elections? Will it damage Yeltsin's chances - as some have argued? I think not. A weak, timid West would be far more damaging. Yeltsin and the Russian democrats will win if it is clear that the resurgent communist/fascist spirit cannot prevail. Enlarging NATO will send just that message."<br>
      Jeane Kirkpatrick, <i>New York Post,</i> April 10, 1996<p>

<b>About a Flat Tax for Washington, DC</b><br>
"Our nation's macro economy is a democratic-capitalist economy based on private property and rewards for productive human activity. However, we also have a concurrent, micro economy that is almost a Third World socialist welfare state...and nowhere is it better illustrated than in our nation's capital, Washington, DC.... Spending cuts and fiscal restraints must be an integral part of any plan to relieve the current financial burden and restore credibility to the nation's capital. But we believe the most important step is for the District government and Congress to fully embrace the proposal to reinvigorate the District announced last month by Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives. Norton has introduced the DC Economic Recovery Act, also known as a progressive flat tax plan, which will create much needed jobs, expand the tax base and serve as a great enticement to middle-class families to come back home to Washington."<br>
      Jack Kemp, with DC Council member Kevin P. Chavous, <i>Washington Post,</i> May 5, 1996
<p>
<b>About Stable Money</b><br>
"Businesses bringing their goods and services to the international market place should not have to contend with unpredictable exchange rate fluctuations that transform legitimately earned profits into currency losses. What is necessary in today's global economy is not a European Monetary Union so much as a viable plan for international monetary reform aimed at serving the needs of an open world economy dedicated to free trade."<br>
      Judy Shelton, EA Board Member, <i>Wall Street Journal Europe,</i> April 25, 1996
<p>
<b>About Tax Reform</b><br>
"What's truly driving voter frustration is a desire for clarity - for sharp-edge, distinct alternatives on how to move the country ahead...instead of beginning our debate by arguing over what appears on Page 6,743 of the tax code, why not begin on Page One? If we're sincere about wanting the public to participate in the debate over tax reform, shouldn't we start deciding whether we want to keep the current system we have?"<br>
      Theodore J. Forstmann, EA Founding Chairman and Member of the Tax Reform
      Commission, <i>Washington Times,</i> April 5, 1996
<p>
<b>About "Rap Rubbish"</b><br>
"A question for parents: What would you do if you discovered that someone was encouraging your sons to kill people indiscriminately, to find fun in beating and raping girls, and to use the word 'motherf---er' at least once in every sentence?" <br>
      William J. Bennett, Joe Lieberman and C. DeLores Tucker, <i>USA Today,</i> June
      6, 1996

<H2>Rapping Obscene Music, Empower America Launches "Round Two" in Values Campaign </H2>
</center>
On May 30, Empower America launched "Round Two" of the campaign against obscene and harmful music Iyrics being produced and marketed by major entertainment companies. Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett announced the venture at a joint press conference in Washington, DC, with Senator Joe Lieberman (CT), and C. DeLores Tucker, Chair of the National Political Congress of Black Women.
<P>
In this second round of the ongoing campaign, Dr. Bennett, Senator Lieberman, Dr . Tucker and Senator Sam Nunn (GA) released a radio ad calling on five of the largest music companies to end their involvement with degrading and indefensible music Iyrics. The ad targets music that glorifies murder and drug use, and that celebrates the beating and raping of women. The companies named in the ad and at the press conference are Time Warner, as well as foreign-owned Sony of Japan, Thorn EMI of Great Britain, PolyGram (owned by Philips Electronics) of the Netherlands, and Bertelsmann of Germany. The ad is airing on both national and local talk shows.
<P>
Listeners who hear the ad are encouraged to call Empower America's hotline to add their names to a petition being sent to the companies. The goal is to reach as many people as possible, who will, in turn. contact these companies and ask them to reconsider their support for this music.
<P>
Time Warner, the target of Empower America's first campaign against obscene music,took a positive step with their sale of Interscope Records last September. However, since that time, they have not limited their production and distribution of offensive music on some of their other labels. As a result, Empower America is again calling on Time Warner, as well as the other four foreign-owned corporations, to refuse to sponsor this cultural rot.
<P>
Prior to the press conference announcing the campaign, letters were sent to the heads of the corporations, and to their American subsidiaries, asking them to "make normative judgments about what is acceptable to produce and market" and calling on the corporations to "refuse to sponsor this vicious, vulgar music."
<P>
Empower America plans to continue efforts to focus scrutiny on obscene music Iyrics, and to ask major corporations to refuse to sponsor garbage. Said Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett, "We are going to continue to put the heat and light on these guys...We're in it for the duration."

<H2>Virtue on Public Television This Fall</H2>
</center>
William Bennett's highly acclaimed anthology, The Book of Virtues, is being brought to life in a new, fully animated television series: "Adventures from The Book of Virtues." The new television show will premier in the fall on PBS.
<P>
Produced by PorchLight Entertainment in association with KCET in Los Angeles, "Adventures from The Book of Virtues" will air during prime time on PBS stations nationwide for three consecutive evenings, beginning on Labor Day, 1996. The series draws its themes from Dr. Bennett's collection of classic American stories, Greek mythology, European fairy tales, African fables, Asian folk tales, Native American legends and Bible stories.
<P>
The characters and stories in each adventure will exemplify the traits of good character and depict the virtues illustrated in the The Book of Virtues, which has sold over two million copies. Many well-known Hollywood stars will be lending their voices to the heroic characters and villains in the series.
<P>
William Bennett has been highly critical of network programs aimed at our nation's youth and believes that the way to respond to poor television programming is either to turn the television off or to try to put something on that will lift up spirits and minds. Dr. Bennett is hopeful that "Adventures from The Book of Virtues" will add some much needed lift to family viewing time.
<P>
<B>Call your local PBS outlet for viewing times on Labor Day.</B>

<FONT SIZE=5>Bennett: Educating America on Crime<BR>
</center>
</FONT>
<P>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America's William Bennett was recently named
co-chair of the bipartisan Council on Crime in America. The commission
will present hard data to educate both the public and the media
on the nature and extent of the crime problem in the United States,
and identify policies and initiatives that protect citizens and
promote justice. Dr. Bennett co-chairs the Council on Crime with
Griffin B. Bell, who was Attorney General in the Carter Administration.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Council on Crime's first report, The State of
Violent Crime in America, generated widespread media attention.
It revealed that despite the recent drop in crime rates in certain
cities, the dangers law-abiding citizens face are near an all-time
high. These dangers are compounded by the reality of &quot;revolving
door&quot; justice which allows criminals to walk free on probation,
parole or pre-trial release. In fact, one out of every three convicted</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> criminals is under the &quot;supervision&quot; of
the justice system at the very time they commit more murders,
rapes and other violent crimes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;This study paints a realistic and sobering
picture of violent crime in America,&quot; Bennett said, &quot;but
it is not without its rays of hope. If the success that cities
such as New York and Houston have had in reducing crime rates
teaches us anything, it is that the common sense of the American
people is right when it comes to crime: tough law enforcement
is a necessary part of the solution.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Council's report also corrects some of the misinformation
about criminal justice spread by the popular press. For example,
the widespread myth that too many people are imprisoned in America
is refuted by the Council' s finding that only one criminal for
every 100 violent crimes actually goes to jail. Evidence that
over 90 percent of all state prisoners have been violent criminals
or are recidivists dispell inaccurate reports that prisons are
populated with nonviolent offenders. And the report presents calculations
which demonstrate that imprisoning violent offenders saves dollars
as well as lives: a single rape costs its victim and society an
average of $87,000 - many times greater than the cost of
keeping a rapist in prison for a year.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;This is an important report,&quot; Bennett
noted, &quot;it is rigorous, toughminded, and common-sensical.
It provides important information on the nature of the crime problem
in the United States. But more importantly, it points to the problems
in the American justice system that can be fixed, and if fixed,
can and will save lives. I am convinced that the first and fundamental
responsibility of government is protecting the citizenry. It is
the key provision in the social contract. And there is simply
no way that civil society can flourish if there is lawlessness
in the streets.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Council on Crime will be holding several grassroots
hearings across the nation over the next several months to highlight
innovative policies and citizen initiatives to counteract crime.
The final report, which will offer policy prescriptions to cut
crime, increase the effectiveness and responsiveness of the criminal
justice system, and promote citizen safety will be issued in the
summer of 1996.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Along with Bennett and Bell, other Council members
include Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham, former U.
S. Attorney General William Barr, Florida Attorney General Robert
Butterworth, Princeton Professor John DiIulio, California Prison
Commissioner John Gillis, Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith
and Colorado Attorney General Gail Norton. H</FONT>

<p>
<FONT SIZE=3>Kemp: Flatter, Fairer Tax System Urged<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>In January of 1996, the National Commission on Economic
Growth and Tax Reform issued a comprehensive report to Congress
and the country. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker
Newt Gingrich created the Commssion last year to analyze the current
system and develop proposals for an entirely new tax system. Empower
America Co-Director Jack Kemp was appointed Chairman of the Commission.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The &quot;Kemp Commisson&quot; held hearings throughout
the country to learn the views of the American people about the
current tax system and their ideas for a new tax system. The Kemp
Commission found that the current tax code is far too complex,
intrusive and unfair, and is, in effect, a dead weight on the
American economy. As stated in the report, <i>Unleashing America's
Potential: A Pro-Growth, Pro-Family Tax System for the 21st Century:</i>
&quot;We believe the current tax code cannot be revised, should
not be reinvented, and must not be retained. Therefore, the commission
is unanimous: It is time to throw out the seven-million word mess
of tax laws and regulations and begin a new.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Commissioners outlined six working principles
they believe a tax code must have to ensure that the system is
fair while accurately reflecting and fostering the high ideals
of the American democratic-republic.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> These principles include: <i><b>fairness</b></i>, treating citizens
equally before the law;<i> <b>simplicity</b></i>; making compliance as easy as possible;
<b><i>neutrality</i></b>, so that people and not government make the choices;
<b><i>
stability</b></i>, so that people can accurately plan for their futures;
and <b><i>visibility</b></i>, so citizens will have an honest sense of the true
cost of government. The Commission also stressed that <b><i>economic
growth</i></b> must not be inhibited by the tax code.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With these firm principles anchoring the Commission's
vision, it offered recommendations for a new tax system to stimulate
a vigorous national debate about how best to change the current
system. The Commission proposed a low, single-rate of taxation
with a generous personal exemption&Ntilde;to remove those people
least able to bear a tax burden from the tax rolls. Such a system
would remove the biases against work, saving, and investment present
in the current system's double, triple, and quadruple taxation
of income.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another major recommendation was to make payroll
taxes fully deductible for working men and women. And it recommended
abolishing separate taxation of capital gains.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Addressing the current pattern of a constantly changing
tax code, the Commission also strongly recommended a 2/3 super
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> majority vote in Congress be required to increase
tax rates in the future. This will provide a measure of stability
in the tax system so people and businesses can better plan future
savings and investment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Secretary Kemp and other members of the Tax Reform
Commission recently testified before the Senate Finance Committee
where they outlined the very real and substantial problems with
the current system and strongly advocated the creation of a new
tax system for a new millennium, one that accomodates the new
information age and stimulates technological revolution.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Tax reform will be a key issue in the 1996 elections,
and many candidates have endorsed the single-rate model outlined
by the Kemp Commission. The dissatisfaction with the current code
is producing a groundswell of support for radical tax reform.
The Kemp Commission made a substantial contribution to this rising
tide of change by providing the philosophical justification for
a new, single-rate tax system for America's 21st century.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The fourteen Commissioners came from large and small
business sectors, academia, and the public sector. Empower America'
s Founding Chairman, Ted Forstmann, served as one of the Commissioners.

<FONT SIZE=3>Kirkpatrick: Facts on National Security<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America Co-Director and former US Ambassador
to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick has taken issue with President
Bill Clinton's State of the Union (SOTU) assertion that his administration
has &quot;enhanced the security of the American people.&quot;
In a series of recent speeches and articles, Ambassador Kirkpatrick,
who is also a syndicated columnist, stated that &quot;almost everything
President Clinton said in his State of the Union address concerning
foreign policy is misleading, much simply untrue.&quot; Some major
national security issues which merit examination include:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>National Missile Defense</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton's statement that &quot;for the
first time, since the dawn of the nuclear age, there are no Russian
missiles pointed at American children&quot; is misleading, as
it ignores the overwhelming need to defend the United States from
attack by ballistic missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The evidence that rogue regimes hostile to the United
States - such as Iraq, Iran and North Korea - are undertaking
extraordinary efforts to acquire advanced missile and weapons
technology is overwhelming. Two years ago, then-CIA Director James
Woolsey testified to the Congress, &quot;More than twenty-five
countries, many of them hostile to the United States and our friends
and allies, may now have or are developing nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons, and the means to deliver them.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton vetoed the Defense Bill on December
29, 1995, in large part because he objected to the Congressional
increase in ballistic defense program funding and mandate to deploy
the defense system by 2003. In his veto message, Mr. Clinton argued
that deploying this defense system would violate the 1972 Antiballistic
Missile Treaty (ABM) between the United States and the former
Soviet Union. As EA Co-Directors Jeane Kirkpatrick and Jack Kemp
wrote to Senator Strom Thurmond (R-SC), Chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, last fall: &quot;The ABM Treaty, designed
for a bipolar world, always had dubious value. It is now wholly
outdated .... It dismays us that instead of focusing on our current
needs, opponents of ballistic missile defense worry about outdated
arms control treaties with countries that no longer exist.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The development of missile defenses today is technologically
and economically feasible. We can speak and act with confidence
in the world only when we can defend ourselves.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is interesting to note that public opinion polling
and focus groups indicate that most Americans are unaware that
the United States is unprotected from ballistic missile attack,
and believe this capability already exists. When they learn this
is not the case, they support national missile defense. President
Clinton did not mention the need to develop this defense capability
in his State of the Union speech. But as Ambassador Kirkpatrick
has said repeatedly, &quot;This is the most important issue in
defense policy for our times.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>Bosnia</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As a candidate for the presidency more than three
years ago, Bill Clinton pledged to use air strikes and lift the
arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims so they could defend
themselves against Serb aggression. Instead, in recent testimony
before the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives,
Ambassador Kirkpatrick pointed out that &quot;more than two and
one half million have been displaced from their homes in this
war, more than 200,000 killed. Concentration camps, torture, mass
rape and mass murder have become familiar again in the region.&quot;
President Clinton's State of the Union assertion that &quot;we
stood for peace in Bosnia&quot; - while, as Ambassador
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> Kirkpatrick wrote, &quot;prisoners starved, young
men died, war and refugees spread across the country - is
shameless.&quot; Had President Clinton kept his campaign promise
to help the victims of aggression defend themselves, 25,000 U.S.
troops may not have had to spend this past Christmas enforcing
a tenuous peace agreement in Bosnia.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>Clinton's Use of Force</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton said that he has kept our military
strong, and has used force &quot;only where we must.&quot; But
as Ambassador Kirkpatrick has written, &quot;In truth, the Clinton
administration has not used force only when it must.&quot; In
Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti, it used force when other policies would
have been equally or more effective, and the expressed goals for
these military interventions have not been achieved. &quot;A 'proud
nation' was not constructed in Somalia; 'democracy' was not restored
in Haiti; Bosnians were not protected from ethnic cleansing.&quot;
</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>
Neglecting Major Powers</b><BR> 
</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=2>Ambassador Kirkpatrick also cites the Clinton administration's
neglect of relations with major powers. &quot;Here,&quot; she
writes, &quot;there is a sad contrast to the Bush administration,
which focused on building and enhancing US relations with Western
Europe, Japan, China, Russia. All these relations have now deteriorated.
The President - off in pursuit of unconventional goals - is
neglecting the store.&quot; </FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America and the Heritage Foundation recently
co-hosted the 1996 &quot;Congressional Advance&quot; for many
conservative freshman Members of the House of Representatives.
The Congressional Advance, held on January 25-26 in Baltimore,
marked the one-year anniversary of last year's Congressional Retreat,
which introduced the new conservative Members of Congress to Capitol
Hill. The Congressional Advance, like the Retreat, provided an
important forum to help the freshman Members plan the enactment
of a conservative agenda. Empower America CoDirector William Bennett
delivered the keynote address entitled &quot;The Republican Revolution:
The Next Steps.&quot; The conference also included panels on &quot;Government
Downsizing,&quot; &quot;Empowering Citizens,&quot; and &quot;Strengthening
America' s Families and Culture.&quot; More than fifty Members
of Congress attended the Advance, including several sophomore
Members of Congress.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>Gallup Poll Finds Public Still Wants Tough Drug Control
Policy<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><i>According to a recent Gallup Poll, Americans still
view drug abuse as one of the most serious issues facing the country
in spite of decreasing public discussion by the media about the
&quot;war on drugs.&quot; Fully 94 percent of poll respondents
ranked the drug problem second only to violent crime. William
Bennett, former director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy (&quot;Drug Czar&quot;) under President George Bush, was
invited by the Gallup organization to review the polling results
and comment on their implications for public policy. His remarks follow.</i>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<center><FONT SIZE=2>Statement by</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>WILLIAM J. BENNETT</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>to accompany the release of the Gallup Poll</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>A 1996 VIEW OF THE DRUG PROBLEM IN AMERICA</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>December 12, 1995<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Toward the close of my tenure as Secretary of Education,
in a speech before the White House Conference on a Drug-Free 
America, I called for a &quot;transformation of government
policy to match, and build on, the transformation of public sentiment.&quot;
I was referring to the public' s recognition that drug use was
no longer considered harmless fun or mere self-indulgence, but
a personal, medical and economic catastrophe. That was in 1988,
and indeed we did continue to mount a strong offensive against
drugs throughout the Bush administration from 1989 to 1992 - with
real results. Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned
the drug war. But public sentiment, as this Gallup Poll attests,
has not changed. Americans still want a tough and decisive
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> drug control policy with the federal government rightfully
leading the fight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is no surprise that Gallup found more than nine
in ten Americans seriously concerned about drug abuse, and that
the issue of drugs rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.
Americans should be concerned, because the news is bad; drug use
among adolescents is once again on the rise after the steady and
dramatic decline of the 1980s and early 1990s. According to the
Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University,
&quot;the jump in marijuana use among children 12 to 18 years...signals
that 820,000 more of these children will try cocaine in their
lifetime. Of that number, about
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and addicts.&quot;
More bad news is that drug related hospital emergency-room cases -
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts - have
reached the highest levels since 1978. Cocaine, heroin and marijuana
cases all have increased sharply to record levels.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>What Americans have witnessed - and reacted
to in the Gallup Poll - is the result of a failure of public
policy brought about by a moral torpor on the drug issue. Policy
follows attitude. But the public' s attitude is not one of indifference
toward the scourge. When asked what they wanted to see <i>a lot more</i>
of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law
enforcement and education of the young, and <i>two-thirds</i> cited reduction
of the supply of drugs coming into the United States. By contrast,
<i>fewer than 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>half</i> - 43 percent - asked for more treatment
programs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The current policy of &quot;treatment on demand&quot;
presents a record of failure that is reflected in the weak support
it received in the Gallup Poll. Unlike the effective and modest
treatment programs sponsored by churches and using variants of
the 12-step method, thc government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly
wasteful and ineffective. From 1988 to 1994, federal drug treatment
spending almost tripled while the estimated number of treatment
slots actually declined. And the discouraging result is that overall
cocaine treatment is not significantly reducing the population
of hard core addicts. We must 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>turn our support toward the proven models of treatment,
while recognizing the harsh realities of cocaine and crack addiction
as yet one more compelling reason why preventing casual drug use
by the young - the first step on the path to addiction - is
so important.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Gallup Poll respondents put drug interdiction high
on their list - the percentage of those calling for increased
efforts to reduce the incoming supply of drugs into the U.S. was
88 percent. Those respondents are right - the government
should put the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of
illegal drugs from outside our borders and give the military control
over the entire interdiction</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> process. We know that strong interdiction works.
In 1989, the U.S. military followed Columbia's internal crack-down
on the cocaine cartels with the most extensive detection, tracking
and interdiction effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from
the Andean countries north. These events 
produced substantial disruption in the cocaine supply
to the U.S. between 1989 and 1991. Drugs were less available on
the streets; cocaine-related emergency room cases declined; reported
cocaine deaths decreased; the estimated number of heavy users
fell; and casual use dropped dramatically. Today, U.S. foreign
policy no longer takes the drug problem seriously, and the once strong
military interdiction role has been abdicated. We need now to
restore our interdiction efforts and to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine source countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>More law enforcement efforts to punish and convict
people for the use 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>and sale of illegal drugs were endorsed by 83 percent
of the Gallup respondents. Even more forcefully, by 85 percent,
those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should
be legalized in America. The response is wise on both counts.
Law enforcement requires action at the federal, state and local
levels. The federal role requires 
the identification and dismantling of all major drug
trafficking organizations known to be operating in the U.S. Law
enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention education are state
and local responsibilities for which current federal aid should
be block granted without mandates.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The majority of respondents (85 percent) who oppose
legalization of drugs send a strong message to those who would
propose such an option. Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not
dangerous and threatening to society because they are illegal.
They are illegal because they are dangerous and threatening to
American society. Any relaxation 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>in standards of illegality would make drugs more
accessible, cheaper and morally permissible. On this issue there
has long been a great gap between a select few who favor legalization - and
the overwhelming body of the American people who reject such a
policy of despair. In the Gallup Poll, the people have again made
that point.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Success in the drug war depends above all on what
happens in America' s homes, classrooms, churches, voluntary associations,
television and movie screens, city streets and civic halls. It
depends on the efforts of parents, teachers, clergy, police chiefs,
judges and community leaders. When I was President Bush' s &quot;drug
czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities. I made a point to
go where the problem was the worst and to visit and learn from
the people who made things better. I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements. The point is, we know what works.
The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and toughminded and intelligent policies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Gallup organization has given us <i>A 1996 View
of The Drug Problem in America</i>. That view clearly shows that the
American people also understand what needs to be done and are
ready to renew the fight.</font>

<FONT SIZE=3>EA to Host Spring Candidate School<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
</center>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Building on the success of EA's efforts in 1994 to
inform candidates for office about Empower America's political
message, EA Co-Directors Jack Kemp, William Bennett, and Jeane
Kirkpatrick invite 1996 candidates to join them in Washington,
DC on Monday, April 29 for Empower America's 1996 Candidate School.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Educating candidates for local, state and national
office is one of EA's most important functions. While most candidate
schools concentrate on the nuts and bolts of running for office,
Empower America's training is devoted entirely to a discussion
of issues and their philosophical and political foundations. The
EA messages of economic opportunity, cultural renewal and international
leadership are stressed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>During the day-long event, a variety of political
instructors will address the attendees:
individual leaders, policy experts, political
analysts and elected officials. EA will bring together the best
thinkers and the best ideas to help each candidate form a solid
base of information and craft a winning message. Another valuable
component of the sessions is to learn from participating candidates
about issues and concerns being raised by citizens in their districts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As in 1994, Empower America will prepare a detailed
candidate briefing book for all participants, and will make the
book available to candidates who are unable to attend.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1994 Empower America worked with candidates for
office ranging from local school boards to the U.S. Senate. &quot;Graduates&quot;
include some of the leading &quot;revolutionaries&quot; of the
104th Congress - Congressmen Joe Scarborough (FL), Bob Barr
(GA), Ron Lewis (KY), Dick Chrysler (MI), Phil English (PA) and
Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee. Jack Kemp, William Bennett
and Jean Kirkpatrick look forward to exchanging ideas with the
1996 candidates who want to become better informed about Empower
America' s policy agendas.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For further information, write: Candidate School,
Empower America, 1776 I St., NW, Washington, DC 20006, or call
202-452-8200, or 1-800-761-2044. </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>Campaign Tackles Trash TVTalk Shows<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ads aimed at shows' advertisers having effect<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For the past several months, Empower America Co-director
William Bennett has been involved in a public campaign with Senators
Joe Lieberman (D-CT) and Sam Nunn (D-GA) to focus scrutiny on
certain 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>daytime television talk shows. The campaign has resonated
strongly with the American people, many of whom have contacted
Empower America to express their relief that someone has finally
given voice to the concerns they have about the filth paraded
on television.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Consider the subjects discussed on a number of talk
shows during the past year, according to <i>Electronic Media </i>(April, 1995):
a l3 year old discussing her sexual experiences which began when
she was 10; a male guest admitting to sleeping with his girlfriend's
mother; a woman claiming to have been impregnated while making
a 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>pornographic movie; or the following titles: &quot;Sex
Caught on Tape,&quot; and &quot;I'm Marrying a 14-year Old Boy.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Clearly, shows such as these cross the line of decency.
They celebrate the perverse, and they normalize trashy behavior.
The campaign against trash television is based on the premise
that companies should stop their support of this kind of demeaning,
degrading content. And if they continue their support, they should
be able to justify publicly what they are doing.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The campaign has had a number of different components.
Dr. Bennett and Senator Lieberman have written letters to the
heads of major corporations - Sony, Tribune, Time Warner,
National Amusements, King World, Gannett - which own the
companies that produce the shows, asking them to reconsider their
support of trash television, and questioning whether profits these
companies derive from such degrading, valueless products are really
worth it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In addition, advertisers have been targeted
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>for their support of trash talk television.
On December 7, Dr. Bennett, Senators Lieberman and Nunn unveiled
a television ad calling on major advertisers to stop sponsoring
cultural rot, and asking them to reconsider
their support of these programs. There are
indications that some of them already have: Sears Roebuck, Unilever
NV, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Mars Inc. have said they are withdrawing
advertising from some of these programs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>And on January 22, Dr. Bennett, Senators Lieberman
and Nunn called on the owners of local stations to use their influence
to take the trash out of talk TV, with an open letter that ran
in the daily newsletter of the annual conference of the National
Association of Television Program Executives (NATPE).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Since the campaign began, we've had evidence from
a number of quarters that the tide is turning. Not only have some
advertisers pulled out, but a number of shows have been canceled.
Several station managers in 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>California and in Colorado have decided to discontinue
airing shows they deem unacceptable. And a January poll by <i>Broadcasting
&amp; Cable</i> of TV general managers shows that 83 percent agree
that talk shows are purveyors of &quot;sleazy, tasteless subject
matter with little if any redeeming value.&quot; And the new shows
being offered up for next year focus less on sensationalism.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Viewers also have a responsibility. Instead of simply
lamenting the debased state of our popular culture, citizens need
to take action. While turning off these shows, or requesting companies
to 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>stop producing this kind of material won't eradicate
all of the garbage on our television screens, it will make an
important step toward relegating this trash to the sidelines,
and out of the mainstream. And so the campaign continues to petition
men and women of good will - viewers, sponsors, producers - to
do something about it. </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;We laid out a philosophical framework for revising

a woman or man would face as they take the first two or three
rungs in the ladder. And we came out specifically for the deduction
of the payroll tax, which is a huge burden on working men and

<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America is making an impact! In this important
political year, when American citizens and candidates will be
participating in the long process which will culminate in the
selection of America's president and Congress, Empower America's
ideas and issues have become an essential part of the debate.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Whether the issue is a flatter, fairer tax; crime,
drugs and television trash talk shows; or U.S. military forces
in Bosnia and the need for national missile defense - Empower
America's ideas are shaping the agenda. We urge Empower America
Associates to get even more involved in the days ahead. There
is so much to be done, and each of you has an important role to
play.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Re-ordering the size and scope of government in our
nation and in our lives is an immense project. By attending your
local town meetings, writing letters to your elected representatives
and the editor of your local newspaper, calling in on radio talk
shows, meeting with your neighbors and discussing the issues,
you can make sure that your concerns and your ideas are heard.
And by doing so, you demonstrate the most fundamental tenet of
our shared beliefs: that individual citizens, not government,
are responsible for setting the nation's priorities and deciding
how best they are met.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We have never been better positioned to make a difference.
In January 1996, Empower America celebrated its third birthday.
In this short time, we have established an organization unlike
any in Washington today. The energy, commitment and involvement
of Empower America's Co-Directors and grassroots Associates have
made us a formidable team. Like you, Bill Bennett, Jack Kemp and
Jeane Kirkpatnck share a positive vision of America's future.
Our shared belief in economic growth and opportunity, social and
cultural renewal, and strong international leadership can lead
a vibrant Amenca into the twenty-first century and the information
age.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Your continued involvement and commitment are essential.
and we are grateful for your support and activism.<BR>
</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=2>Sincerely,</Font>

VOL. 3 NO. 2, FALL 1995

<H3>"Beyond the Contract: The Next Steps"</H3>
Speech by Rep. Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House
</CENTER>
<p>
MAY 9,1995, WASHINGTON, DC-- This is V-E Day, and there is a parallel about which we need to be aware. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that our generation has a rendezvous with destiny. He was referring to dealing with Italy, Japan and Germany. That generation ultimately, reluctantly, rose to that challenge, driven in part by Pearl Harbor, and ultimately succeeded.
<p>
We then had a rendezvous with destiny in containing the Soviet empire until it collapsed. For 45 years we did that. We led the largest worldwide coalition in history, and we sustained forces against the Soviet empire far longer than anybody thought a democracy could. So we've won two enormous victories on the world scene in the last two generations.
<p>
The surprising thing, I think, is that our current rendezvous with destiny is here at home. We have to renew American civilization because if it continues to decay, we will literally be incapable of being effectivein the world and the world market.
<p>
The situation is very grave. It is obvious to all of you if you watch any local television news anywhere in the country, that we have a level of violence, a level of decay, a level of brutality which is not sustainable in a free society. I've often said that you can't maintain civilization with 12-year-olds having babies, with 15-yearolds killing each other, with 17-year-olds dying of AIDS, with 18-yearolds getting diplomas they can't even read. And all four of those things are happening in our country.
<p>
There is much more to do. For starters, we will be building on the success of the Contract. We adopted the Contract last summer and fall. We stood on the Capitol steps in September and introduced it to the American people; then we based our campaigns on it. We ran a TV Guide ad that had no negatives, no attack on Bill Clinton and no antiDemocratic rhetoric. It just said, "Give us a chance, here's what we'll do," and outlined the Contract With America. We then got elected.
<p>
Starting the opening day, we kept our word. We passed nine reforms in a 14 hour opening day--the longest in United States history. We continued keeping our word. We brought up every item we said we would. We passed 30 out of 31 items. The only legislative item we lost from the Contract was term limits, where we got 85 percent voting "yes" from the Republican side, 82 percent voting "no" on the Democratic side, and because term limits require a Constitutional majority of 290, we couldn't get it to pass. In the first 93 days, we had a total of 302 recorded votes.
<p>
We're now looking at "where do we go from here?" I think the answer lies in three large projects at the vision level, and then, nine strategies. Let me very briefly run through these visions and strategies:
<p>
We have three major things we have to do. We've got to communicate to the American people that there is an American future that's better--better economic growth, better technology, better services, better opportunities, better safety--and we want to work with the American people to get to that better future.
<p>
Second, we have to have a dialogue. I think it's very important for us to go beyond just debating liberals. We have to have a dialogue with the American people. We have to get people engaged and talking about their future.
<p>
Out of that new vision of a successful America, and new dialogue with the American people, we want to establish a new partnership. Remember, this is not government-to-citizen, this is citizentocitizen. The Constitution begins, "We, the people of the United States," and what we've got to do is go back and reestablish that as a reality in everyone's life.
<p>
I also believe that if our children are going to compete in the world market they have to do a whole lot more homework than they've been doing. My guess is they've got to do probably two hours a night. I think we literally cheat them if they don't have enough homework to learn how to study, to acquire the information they must have in order to compete with Germany, Japan and China. However, I do not suggest that that means we need a "Federal Department of Homework Checkers." Instead, we need to reestablish a partnership where we expect parents to care about their children's education, and we make that a standard and a routine expectation.
<p>
This is why I believe that what we're doing is as much a cultural change as it is a political change. We are reasserting the core of American civilization. The road there is made up of nine strategies.
<p>
First, we have to renew American civilization. That means reasserting the work ethic, family, savings--all the core values that started with the notion that we're endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. Remember that is the most radical statement of human rights in history--that power comes from God to you, and then you loan it to the government. The power doesn't come from God to the government.
<p>
Second, we need to be competitive in the world market. We get high economic growth by reestablishing a system in which entrepreneurs are encouraged to go out and compete, in which there are enough savings, and in which we're prepared to create American jobs through world sales. To do that we have to rethink litigation, regulation, taxation, education, the welfare system, and the bureaucratic structure of government, because we are not a competitive society today. If we want our children to have the best jobs on the planet with the highest take-home pay, it's going to take real effort.
<p>
Third, we have to accelerate moving into the information age. The fact is there are extraordinary opportunities out there, and we are doing too little to take advantage of them.
<p>
The fourth strategic change we need is to replace the welfare state with the opportunity society. We can design a volunteercentered, spiritually-centered replacement for the welfare state that dramatically improves the life of the poor. Every time you hear a liberal jump up to defend the current-system, just remember that what they're telling you is that they are prepared to use the children as the device to keep the bureaucracy. It is inexcusable what we do to poor children in the inner city. We have to replace the welfare state with an opportunity society.
<p>
Fifth, we have to decentralize power and disperse power. They are two different things. Decentralization gets it out of Washington; dispersing it gets it back to you. Ultimately, block grants are, in my mind, a first step toward a dramatic degovernmentalizing of America. One of the reasons we were so strongly for the $500 child tax credit was to make the flat assertion: "parents who earn it have a higher claim than bureaucrats who want to spend it," and that we want the money to stay with the parents, not go to a bureaucracy. That's a very different model of how you organize America.
<p>
Sixth, for the parts of government that we do keep, I think they should be the best in the world. I think our principle ought to be that if you're going to have a federal government it ought to be excellent. I am not anti-government. I think we need a lean, effective government. What we have today is a big, fat, sloppy, ineffective and weak government, incapable of setting priorities and incapable of doing well the things government should focus on.
<p>
Seventh, we should balance the budget. It is a practical matter, and I can give you the simple moral test. For most of American history we paid off the family mortgage and we left the children the farm. In this generation, we're gradually selling off the farm and leaving the children the mortgage. A child born this year will pay $187,000 in taxes in their lifetime, just to pay interest on the federal debt, that is $3,500 per working year just to pay interest. Interest on the debt will be larger than the cost of national security in 1997. That gives you some sense of scale. More and more, your taxes will go to pay interest to the bond-holders than will go to pay for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, intelligence agencies, and defense bureaucracies combined. Now, that is not sustainable, which is why I think we do have a profound challenge to balance the budget.
<p>
In addition, Medicare has its own freestanding problems. The Clinton Administration's Medicare Trustees reported that Medicare literally runs out of money by 2002. And when you look further into the future to when the baby boomers retire, it's dramatically worse. We have the challenge to be prepared to implement the reforms that are necessary to save Medicare now, and then to have a commission which will look at how you save Medicare in the baby boom years, which is a massively bigger challenge than trying to save it now.
<p>
Eighth, I think we have to have a strategy of safety for the American people. If your government can't protect you, then you have no constitutional liberties. We have an obligation to reassert and reestablish the legitimate right of every citizen, that they ought to be able to live without fear in a safe country which loves its children enough to protect them from the predators who right now dominate all too many of our streets.
<p>
Lastly, we have to have a strategy for leading the planet. We are the only country large enough, complex enough and strong enough to lead the human race. If in fact we allow our culture to collapse and our economy to decay, there is nobody who can replace us. If we can't do the first eight things in order to set ourselves up to be able to lead, and we collapse as leaders, you will in fact, I think, leave your children a dark and bloody planet. In that sense I think Chechnya and Bosnia, Rwanda and Somalia are harbingers of the kind of future that could come if America grows weaker.
<p>
I think over the last couple of years that Empower America has been a very helpful part of this. I think that it really has given us a range of ideas. There is a whole series of things we've done over the last couple of years that I think have been very, very helpful. We can continue building this momentum; we need as many voices and as many systems out there as we can get that are educating, encouraging, and pushing in the same general direction. And so I appreciate very, very much the chance to be here with you today, and I thank you all very much for coming.

<H3>Empower America's Victory Against Time Warner</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America has scored an important victory on the cultural front. For the past several months, William J. Bennett, Co-director of Empower America, and C. DeLores Tucker, Chair of the National Political Congress of Black Women, have been involved in a public campaign against offensive and misogynistic music Iyrics. They have targeted their efforts on Time Warner, one of the greatest perpetrators of this kind of cultural filth. This spring, Time Warner increased its investment in "gangsta rap" by expanding its stake to 50 percent of Interscope Records, the label behind such artists as Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre, Nine Inch Nails, and Tupac Shakur. Such "artists" extol the rape, murder, and torture of women. Some of these Iyrics glorify sexual abuse and even celebrate the murder of police officers. Columnist John Leo called Time Warner's investment "the cultural equivalent of owning half the world's mustard gas factories."
<p>
As a result, Bennett and Tucker called on Time Warner's sense of corporate responsibility and citizenship to end their sDonsorshiD of such music. They asked Time Warner to stop producing music which was unworthy of human consumption or corporate support.
<p>
In May, Bennett and Tucker met with Time Warner executives to present their case. At that time, their appeal fell on deaf ears. Bennett and Tucker then expanded their efforts to include a television ad, press conferences in New York and Los Angeles, as well as radio and television programs. In addition, Dr. Bennett wrote to Gerald Levin, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, and both Tucker and Bennett wrote letters to members of the Board of Directors of Time Warner, informing them of the kind of music Time Warner was involved in producing and distributing. In June, Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) joined Tucker and Bennett in a radio ad and press conference calling on Time Warner to exercise corporate responsibility.
<p>
The campaign has had strong resonance with the American public. The New York Times, The Wall Street Joumal, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, Time, and Newsweek have all covered the story. Political figures from both parties, including President Clinton, and Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, have voiced their support for Empower America's efforts.
<p>
On September 27, Time Warner announced that it planned to sever its ties with Interscope Records, selling its 50% stake back to Interscope founders Ted Field and Jimmy Lovine--an indication that shame and a call to corporate responsibility do work. Dr. Bennett applauded Time Warner's decision, and said that the company was "acting like a leader" in its decision to sell Interscope. Said Bennett, "I congratulate them, they did the right thing. I hope this is a statement about a larger point--that there are some things so bad that no responsible company will market and sell them to our children."
<p>
Empower America will continue to monitor the fate of Interscope, to see which music company, if any decides to purchase it. If other major companies pick up Interscope, they will hear from us. We will continue to press our case against corporations which peddle filth as entertainment for children.

<H3>EA Letter To Our Readers</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
The level of change effected in the first session of the 104th Congress has been unprecedented. Members passed more bills and worked more hours than during any previous congress. The battle over the size of the federal budget and the scale of Washington's bureaucracy is being won by those who would cut the size and scope of government.
<p>
This coongress accomplished policy goals that the cynics and skeptics dismissed as impossible. Nine of the ten components of "The Contract with America" passed the House of Representatives during the first hundred days of the 104th Congress and were sent to the Senate for consideration. Many of those measures have now passed the
<p>
Senate, while others continue to move through the legislative process under the guidance of those who understand the rightful limits of federal power.
<p>
The majority of members elected in November, especially those serving their first term, are committed to the empowerment agenda. They believe that individuals --not the federal government--should make the choices that affect their own lives. They know that high taxes hurt families and businesses at all income levels.
<p>
We have many friends in Congress, but we must remain active. This puts us in a position to get things done. We are working with individuals who understand the ideas that are important to us and who can act to promote them.<p>

Continue to write your representatives in Congress. Attend local town meetings and other events that allow you to meet with your representatives and articulate your views on national issues. This focal point of American politics allows you to become active in the governing process at the grassroots level.
<p>
We greatly appreciate your continued support and activism.
<P>

<H3>Empower America On The Hill</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America's Co-directors and board members have-been busy and active with the new Congress. We have been working with the Congressional leadership since January of 1993 to advocate the principles we represent. The new 104th Congress has provided us with a heightened opportunity to work for change. Our Co-directors and board members have tes fied before numerous Congressional committees promoting the empowerment agenda. Following are some highlights from the testimonies of Jeanne Kirkpatrick, William Bennett, and Jack Kemp.
<p>
<b>Jeanne Kirkpatrick:</b>
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jeane Kirkpatrick spoke to the House Foreign Relations Committee on January 24, 1995 about "National Security and International Affairs in the Context of Cooperation and Limitation." She was one of the select foreign policy experts chosen to give remarks on stability and instability in the international arena, and policy directives America should pursue.
<p>
Dr. Kirkpatrick said, "I believe this Congress and the National Security Revitalization Act have arrived just in the nick of time. Our military forces are beginning to 'go hollow,' and are feeling the full impact of schedules and budgets which have left them over-deployed and undertrained, overworked and underpaid."
<p>
<b>William Bennett:</b>
<p>
Empower America Co-director William Bennett testified several times before the new Congress. Of particular interest were his remarks to the United States Senate Budget Committee on January 24, 1995. His testimony was in regard to the topic, "Governing in the 21st Century." The new Congress has the opportunity to change the role and enormous size of the federal government, which Dr. Bennett strongly advocates in part through a "radical devolution" of decision-making.
<p>
Dr. Bennett told the committee, ":..it is critical to take a step back and establish once again a clear delineation of government's role. We need to articulate once again the proper responsibilities and limits of government--things like providing for the defense of the nation, waging war, building infrastructure projects, administering transfer payments, keeping the streets safe, and the like."
<p>
<b>Jack Kemp:</b>
<p>
Jack Kemp testified before the Senate Small Business Committee on October 19th in support of Senators Abraham and Lieberman's enterprise zone bill. The bill, entitled "The Enhanced Enterprise Zone Act of 1995," is closely patterned after Kemp's -bill from the 80's.
<p>
i In his testimony, Kemp pointed out, "How can we possibly begin to address the problems of crime, drugs, and education without first recognizing that without jobs and opportunity, there is little hope and few reasons to graduate from school, stay off drugs, and resist the underground economy? Without the expectation that there is a good job waiting out of college or high school, there will be no link between effort and reward, and no way to address fully the social pathologies that are all too prevalent in our inner cities."
<p>
Kemp went on to say that "over the past several years, the federal government has created an economic climate in America that is indifferent at best, and hostile at worst, to the agents of economic growth. Washington now imposes a vast array of income taxes, corporate taxes, payroll taxes, regulations, and mandated benefits that encourage businesses to keep employees to an absolute minimum. Today, the combined tax and regulatory burden on risktaking-- the process by which new enterprises and jobs are created-- has climbed to the levels of the early 1980s."

<H3>Kemp Heads National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jack Kemp was chosen to chair the newly formed <a href="http://www.townhall.com/taxcom/">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich appointed Kemp to lead the eight member commission in proposing a new economic pratform.
<p>
The goals of the new commission are ambitious and sweeping. Senator Dole charged the commission with moving "beyond tax reform toward a complete overhaul of the entire tax system." He added, "that's why we have asked Jack to reexamine the entire 4,000 page federal tax code... to start with a blank piece of paper." Kemp promised that the commission will focus on "reforming our tax code, restoring incentives to entrepreneurial capitalism, lowering tax rates, helping create jobs, and assisting low-income persons escape the conditions of poverty and welfare dependency."
<p>
In this effort, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform will design, and push for the passage of, an alternative tax system that is fairer, flatter, and simpler. Speaker Gingrich noted that Kemp and the commission will "reach out to all of the presidential candidates, to all of the Republican governors, to all of the members of the House and Senate, to corporate America, and to the American people to put together the kind of reforms that are vital."
<p>
Both Dole and Gingrich asserted that naming Kemp to chair the commission carried both symbolic and practical significance. Speaker Gingrich asserted that "it is clear that there is a yearning in America for a very profound rethinking of the tax code, and Jack Kemp is the one to provide that type of leadership, having given President Reagan the Kemp-Roth tax cut of 1981." Dole added, "For over two decades Jack has been one of our most innovative thinkers on economic policy. No one can speak to these issues more creatively and more credibly."
<p>
The commission will issue a final report at the end of 1995--in time for the 1996 presidential primaries.

<H3>A Fairer, Simpler 21st Century Single Tax Rate System</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Recent polling shows almost twothirds of all Americans are interested in replacing the current income tax system with a single rate tax system which would require all American citizens and businesses to pay one, simple, low tax rate--around 17 percent.
<p>
Today, American economic policy is a mess. The tax code is now more than 5 million words long, understood by few, and oppressive to all. Washington's 60,000 pages of federal regulations further stifle entrepreneurial spirit while government spending remains out of control. The bottom line is lethargic economic growth and the loss of opportunity for millions of Americans.
<p>
The tax increases in the budget acts of 1990 and 1993 reversed the trend toward lower tax rates and fewer federal regulations that spurred the unprecedented growth and job creation of the 1980s. To put the tax code in perspective, it is worthwhile to look at how much the average family of four pays in taxes. In 1950, the typical middleincome family paid about 2 percent of its income in federal taxes. By 1993, that amount had increased to about 24 percent of income.
<p>
The only thing more costly to America than its tax system is its system of federal regulations. Experts estimate that these regulations cost Americans nearly $1 trillion a year.
<p>
The U.S. spends more money on its federal government than all other countries, except Japan, spend on their entire economies. In 1950, federal spending was about 16 percent of total gross domestic output. Today it has ballooned to 23 percent of GDP.
<p>
Taxes, regulations, and spending have produced an economy with anemic growth, slow job creation, and hindered entrepreneurship, and one in which the American Dream is not yet secure for enough of our people. Since the current economic recovery began, GDP growth has averaged just 2.4 percent in real terms, less than half the 5 percent growth rate usually associated with recoveries.
<p>
Job creation has lagged even further behind, increasing by only 3 percent instead of the average 9 percent recovery.
<p>
There is a straightforward way to deal with taxes, regulations, and spending-- the single rate tax system. The need to address all of these concerns is precisely what has piqued the American public's and Congress' interest in this revolutionary idea.

<H3>EA Brochure Lets You Make Federal Budget Cuts</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Washington, DC--Empower America Co-director Jack Kemp, along with Rep. Steve Largent (R-OK) and other members of the House Budget Committee, unveiled Empower America's new brochure on the budget process, entitled "Your Turn to Balance the Federal Budget."
<p>
Described by Largent as "a great way for people to become better informed about the budget process and to see for themselves what it is like to balance the budget," the brochure includes a worksheet which outlines current budgetary expenditures. Readers are also invited to enter their own numbers in an effort to develop a balanced budget reflecting their priorities.
<p>
Both the House and Senate have passed plans that would bring the federal budget into balance over a seven-year period, by slowing the rate of growth in many federal programss and targeting many others for elimination--those that are outdated or duplicative.
<p>
The share of the federal debt held by every man woman and child today totals over $18,500. Without fundamental change, children born today will pay nearly $200,000 over their lifetime in taxes to sustain the interest on the debt, and face a total tax rate (for all local, state, and federal spending) of 84 percent of their earnings over their lifetime, according to calculations in President Clinton's own budget.
<p>
Once the federal budget is balanced, for the first time since 1969, the government will be able to pay off its debt, which has grown over the 219 years of our history to nearly $5 trillion this year.
<p>
If you are interested in receiving your own copy of Empower America' s brochure, "Your Turn to Balance the Federal Budget," to discover how the process works, and make your own choices, then please send your request to Empower America at 1776 I Street, NW, Suite 890, Washington, DC 20006.

<H3>EA Leadership Council's Conference Forum</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America's Leadership Council held its second Conference Forum in early May. One hundred members attended the day and a half conference set against the backdrop of our nation's capitol. Focusing on the state of the 104th Congress, "The Contract with America," and the future of our government, the conference's main objectives were to inform, enlighten, and empower its participants.
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jeane Kirkpatrick kicked off the formal program with a dinner address titled, "Beyond the Contract: Foreign and Domestic." In her remarks, Ambassador Kirkpatrick outlined the position that the United States government has taken on several foreign policy issues, her thoughts on those policies, the future of our government, and the changes that are necessary to ensure maximum peace and protection for the world.
<p>
The next day was packed with various speeches and discussions. Breakfast keynote speaker Co-director Bill Bennett remarked on the cultural impact of "The Contract with America," as well as giving his thoughts on the upcoming presidential election. Following Dr. Bennett, Senators Connie Mack (R-FL) and John Ashcroft (R-MO), and Congressmen John Boehner (R-OH) and Chris Cox (R-CA) shared their experiences and insight on the phenomenal first one hundred days of the Senate and House. 
<p>Two freshmen members of the House, Sue Myrick (R-NC) and Sam Brownback (R-KS), spoke about being part of a freshman class which retains the same hope and enthusiasm that they had when the 104th session of Congress began. Perhaps the most anticipated speaker of the day was the Speaker of the House and Empower America Board Member, Newt Gingrich. Speaker Gingrich, introduced by Co-director Jack Kemp, eloquently argued that "our rendezvous with destiny is here at home." He illustrated this point with his three vision levels and nine strategies for Congress to follow up 'The Contract with America."
<p>
The sessions and speeches successfully wrapped up with an inside look at the work of pollsters and their influence on elections. As the day drew to a close, Council Members were invited for a private tour of the Capitol.

<H3>Empower America Pushes the Single Rate Tax System In New Hampshire</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America continued its ad campaign advocating a low, single rate tax system by running radio spots in New Hampshire. Since the 1996 presidential race begins in New Hampshire, Empower America wanted to produce a radio spot that would influence the debate on the single rate system. William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber have been strong proponents of a low single rate, and hope their efforts will influence the 104th Congress, and the presidential hopefuls.
<p>
William Bennett was the voice behind the message Empower America sent to the people of New Hampshire. The 60 second radio ad ran 88 times on five news and talk radio stations in New Hampshire.

<H3>Empower America Launches Campaign
Against Daytime TV Talk Shows</H3>
<i>Statement by William J. Bennett 
<br> October 26, 1995</i></CENTER>
<p>
First, I want to express my thanks to Senator Joe Lieberman. Senator Lieberman is the father of this idea. It was his suggestion that we continue to bring pressure--public pressure--on the perpetrators of cultural rot by calling attention to these shows.
<p>
Earlier this year, Senator Lieberman joined C. DeLores Tucker of the National Political Congress of Black Women and me in our campaign to urge Time Warner to sell their stake in Interscope Records, Inc. Today, we turn our attention to television. Now these days there is a lot of criticism directed at television--the casual cruelty, the rampant promiscuity, the mindlessness of sit-coms and soap operas. Most of the criticisms are justified. But this is not the worst of it. The worst of television is the day-time television talk shows we have identified. In these shows, indecent exposure is celebrated as a virtue.
<p>
It is hard to remember now, but there was once a time when personal or marital failure, subliminal desires, and perverse taste were accompanied by guilt or embarrassment. But today, these conditions are a ticket to appear as a guest on the Sally Jessy Raphael show, the Ricki Lake show, the Jerry Springer show, or one of the dozen or so like them.
<p>
I asked my staff to provide me with a list of some of the shows of some recent day-time talk-show topics. The list included "A Mother Who Ran Off with Her Daughter's Fiance," "Women Who Marry Their Rapists," "I'm Marrying a 14-year-old Boy," a woman who claims she got pregnant while making a pornographic movie; a 13-year-old guest who was urged to share her sexual experiences which began when she was 10; a woman eight months pregnant who boasted of having eight sexual partners during her first two trimesters; a 17-year-old girl who boasted of having slept with over a hundred men--well, you get the idea.

<p>
It is important here to point out who we are not talking about. We are not talking about shows like Oprah, or Regis and Kathie Lee. The shows which are the object of our criticisms are not close calls; they go way over the line of decency. They are at the bottom of the television barrel. Instead of simply lamenting the state of our popular culture, we think it's a good idea to try and do something about it. So here we are.
<p>
Our objectives are these: to raise a hue and cry across the land; to cast some light on what's being produced and distributed --"Sunlight is the best disinfectant," Justice Brandeis once wrote--and to petition men and women of good will--producers, sponsors, advertisers, and viewers --to rethink their support and sponsorship, participation and promotion of these programs.
<p>
What exactly is the harm being done by these programs? In his "Letter from Birmingham City Jail," Martin Luther King, Jr. instructed us that that which "uplifts human personality" is just and that which "degrades human personality" is unjust. Can anybody doubt that these shows degrade human personality? Do the sponsors think not? If so, why not?
<p>
Let me try and put this campaign in a broader context of the state of our popular culture, our country, and our civilization.
<p>
What is happening today is the pollution of the human environment, a kind of tropism toward the sordid. This nation desperately needs more opportunities for moral uplift. We believe that progress can be made through moral suasion and justifiable public discontent.
<p>
In a fundamental way, that is what this effort and efforts like it are all about. So today we declare ourselves to be part of a Resistance, a Resistance Operation to the giant popular culture sleaze machine. We welcome more volunteers to our ranks.<p>

Let me conclude with a personal note. Joe Lieberman is a Jew. I am a Catholic. Like most Americans, we believe in God; we both believe men and women are His creation, made in His image. And so we believe that men and women should not be celebrated when they debase themselves. <P>

<li>"Early deployment of an anti-ballistic missile defense system ... is the only way the U.S. government can fulfill its constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense. If we start now, immediately, and work as rapidly and well as possible, we may achieve an operationally effective missile defense in time to prevent a tragedy." 
<br><b>Jeane Kirkpatrick,<br>

Defense Policy Forum, May 24, 1995</b>
<p>
<li>"I'm here to defend the idea that the [tax] rates ought to come down, that it will be flatter, fairer, simpler; they've got to be lower across the board on labor and capital, the factors of production, and we ought to raise revenue for government and not try to redistribute the wealth of America. I don't think that is the purpose of the tax code--the tax code from time immemorial was to raise revenue and reduce the burden on those least able to bear that burden. And frankly, all of our plans--or all of 'the' plans are going to be judged on that basis. Does it raise revenue? Is it efficient for the economy and does it remove the burden on those least able to bear that burden?"
<br>
<b>Jack Kemp,<br> 
CNBC Inside Opinion, July 20,1995</b>
<p>

<li>"Bill Bennett, former Secretary of Education and White House Drug Czar, may have just won his biggest political victory: According to The New York Times, Time Warner is trying to sell its 50 percent stake in Interscope Records, the home of socalled gangsta rap...."
<p>
He and Mrs. Tucker both took their concerns directly to Time Warner, where they argued that distributing albums that glorify violence, murder and the abuse of women is fundamentally immoral. Instead of wielding political power against Time Warner, Mr. Bennett and Ms. Tucker brought moral authority to bear: They sharned Time Warner executives, both in private and in public....
<p>
This success should be a paradigm for culture warriors.... Culture cannot be dictated from Washington, it is a matter of millions of personal choices made by millions of people every day. Moral persuasion can affect those personal choices in a way that laws and regulations can't. Snoop Doggy Dogg may not be particularly open to suasion, but if the corporation that made millions off of him is able to rethink its place in the market, and maybe figure out how to make millions of a less noxious product, there is hope.<br>

<b>"Culture War Victory"<br>

Washington Times, August 14,1995</b>

<p>
<li>"It is significant that today nobody--nobody--is willing to defend the current welfare system. And for good reason; it is a complete wreck. After thirty years, we have finally reached a consensus that much of the anti-poverty strategy of the 60s arid 70s has failed--and failed horribly. Poverty today is more widespread, more deeply entrenched and more pathological than it was three decades, and $5 trillion, ago.... It is time to encourage poverty fighting-efforts that are both compassionate and effective, rather than maintaining a system that is neither."<br>

<H3>The Battle for School Choice in Milwaukee</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Milwaukee has long been the standardbearer for the school choice movement. In 1990, the nation's only government-funded school choice program was enacted in Milwaukee. And in early 1995, Governor Tommy Thompson submitted an expansion plan of the program, which allowed students to redeem vouchers at religious as well as non-religious schools. The plan was approved and passed by the legislature as part of the 1995-97 state budget bill. However, on August 25, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin issued an injunction barring the state from paying tuition for students attending private religious schools until the court rules on whether it is constitutional. Several hundred children had already begun classes as participants in the voucher program. As a result, Partners Advancing Values in Education (PAVE) set up an emergency fund to provide funds for children for the school year.
<p>
Empower America Co-director William J. Bennett traveled to Milwaukee to affirm his support for school choice, and for a program that allows parents to choose either religious or non-religious private schools for their children. Said Dr. Bennett, "This moment in Milwaukee is probably the breakthrough point. This is the beachhead." Bennett toured St. Matthew's, an elementary school participating in the choice program, and was a guest on Charles Sykes' radio program on WTMJ-AM (620). Bennett was joined by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson and by another former education secretary. They then held a press conference praising the expanded program at Messmer High School, an independent Catholic school. Dr. Bennett summed up the objective of the school choice movement: "This is not an anti-public school effort. This is a pro-good school effort ... Good public schools have nothing to fear from school choice."

<H3>Empower America Sets Conservative Agenda</H3>
<P>
<I>Baltimore Conference Launches 104th Congress</I>
<P>
BALTIMORE, MD: In this city, an hour's drive north of Washington,
DC, three&#171;busy days of seminars, workshops, discussion sessions
(and a bit of speechmaking) in early December brought home the
latest example of how the political landscape of America has changed.
<P>
Previously, under the control of the Democrat House leadership,
only one institution, the Kennedy School of Government in Boston,
had run freshman orientation for incoming members of Congress.
This monopoly had lasted for over
 twenty years. New members would 
have to travel to Massachusetts to actually I 
participate, and topics were often narrow 
and unambitious.
<P>
But in 1994, the Boston organization had to cancel its program
due to lack of interest, since the vast majority of newly-elected 
House freshmen chose to attend an orientation program organized
by Empower America and the Heritage Foundation.
<P>
Held December 811 at the Radisson Plaza in Baltimore, MD, the
conference drew 
a majority of the Republican members- elect, as well as a couple
of their Democrat counterparts. This high energy gathering demonstrated
that the incoming Republican majority plans to hit the ground
running to deliver the real change America endorsed on November
8.
<P>
The days were packed with programs and presentations designed
to supplement incoming members' knowledge of issues they'll face
in the 104th Congress, as well as highlighting dramatic, conservative
alternatives to 30 years of Great Society philosophy. Nearly 50
conservative experts in all major issues of domestic and foreign
policy attended.
<P>
New members took the lead in debating innovative alternatives
on issues such as welfare reform, crime, defense and farm policy.
They also worked to plan legislative strategy and tactics on reforming
Congress, strengthening America's health care system, tackling
the over regulation that the Federal government imposes on states
and individuals, and limiting congressional terms.
<P>
They discussed how to draw on the new conservative majority in
the country to construct coalitions necessary to effect change
in Washington. And how to balance their professional obligations
with the needs of their families, so that families will always
come first.
<P>
All five of Empower America's co-directors, Lamar Alexander, Bill
Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber spoke at the
conference and participated in smallgroup meetings, sharing advice
and insights which they hoped would be valuable to the attendees,
both personally and professionally.
<P>
One of the orientation's highlights came at its conclusion, with
an address by radio/TV talkshow host Rush Limbaugh- whom many
of the freshman credit, in part, with their victory. According
to Bill Bennett, Limbaugh is &quot;a symbol of encouragement.
He's a pretty reasonable read on what a lot of America thinks.
Rush is a way conservatives know that they're not idiosyncratic.&quot;
To express their appreciation, the freshmen voted to make Limbaugh
an honorary member of their incoming class.
<P>
Limbaugh was quick to return the compliment. 
 &quot;I am in awe of you,&quot; Limbaugh told them, &quot;You took the risks.
You are the ones who engaged the opposition ... You actually went
out and did the work.

<P>
<H3>Grassroots, With Message of Change, Made Difference at Ballot Box</H3>
<P>


Political observers are calling what happened on November 8th
a &quot;tsunami.&quot;
<P>
In Japan, that' s the word for tidal wave. In America, that's
the term for the overwhelming victory conservatives gained at
the federal, state, and local level in 1994's midterm elections.
<P>
Beginning in January, Republicans will control both Houses of
Congress for the first time since 1954. In the U.S. Senate, the
margin will be 5347, a gain of nine seats. All 11 Senate freshmen
will be Republicans. In the U.S. House, Republicans picked up
52 seats, for a 230-204 edge, with one independent. Of the 86-member
freshman class, 73 are Republicans.
<P>
For the first time since 1970, Republicans also have the lion's
share of governors' mansions. They'll control 30 governorships,
in states with 70 percent of the U.S. population.
<P>
But the victories weren't just wide, they were deep. Republicans
now control both houses of 19 state legislatures, while Democrats
control 18.
<P>
In the South, for the first time since Reconstruction, a state
legislative body will be led lay Republicans. The South Carolina
House, which went Republican, hasn't had a GOP majority since
1886. Down the ballot, at all levels, candidates
supporting a powerful and vigorous conservative message won election.
<P>
Keeping this in mind, Empower America Codirector Jack Kemp observes,
&quot;The 1994 elections rivaled Ronald Reagan's 1980 victory
in its importance to the conservative movement.&quot;
<P>
What made the difference in the 1994 election was the dedicated
effort of grassroots activists, who constructed a network of information
and support that bypassed both the media and, in many cases, the
established political parties. Compared to previous midterm elections,
turnout was up. Polling data indicates that many of those who
voted intended to send a message for conservative change. This
turnout was the key difference in many close races - the defeat
of House Speaker Tom Foley, House Judiciary Committee chairman
Jack Brooks, and Senate Budget Committee Chairman (and
likely next Senate Democrat leader) Jim Sasser.
<P>
So dramatic was the mandate for change voiced in November that
no less than the <I>Washington Post's </I>David Broder, dean of
the Washington pundits, saw in the results the evidence for a
massive political realignment - a return to the political landscape
as it looked before the New Deal.
<P>
However, to make re-alignment a reality requires even more effort
in 1995 and 1996, to make sure the 104th Congress delivers on
the change its leaders promised. According to a recent Times-Mirror
poll, 52 percent of Americans approve of the GOP's plans for the
future. Reducing crime, reforming welfare, cutting the deficit,
cutting middle class taxes, and a balanced budget amendment are
all supported by a majority of Americans.

<H3>A Letter from the President</H3>
<P>
<I>Dear Empower America Members: </I>
<P>
Our hard work during the last two years has definitely paid off!
Because of your dedication to ideals and policies that empower
individuals and families, our country has witnessed one of the
most historic elections of our time. As a result, we have elected
a new Congress committed to the empowerment agenda.
<P>
Through our candidate schools, issue briefs, radio actualities,
newspaper editorials and numerous other media opportunities, Empower
America has been pleased to play its role in the 1994 elections.
We look forward to the months and years ahead as a continuation
of our responsibility to help shape the conservative future of
America.
<P>
Therefore, this is not a time to rest. We must remain an active
voice in all the debates on policy that affect our daily lives.
This is an opportunity for us to propose progressive ideas for
the future of our country and our children. The days of the tax
and spend liberals controlling the agenda and our pocket books
are over!
<P>
It is because of concerned citizens like yourself, the ones that
only want a strong and stable country for our children, that this
Congress is like no other one before. It is
important that you remain in the fight. We will need you for every
battle that comes up on Capitol Hill. This new Congress must know
what the American people need and want from their government.
You are the only way they will know.
<P>
Thank you for your support of Empower America.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
<B>Bill Dal Col</B>
<P>
<I>President</I>

<H3>Kirkpatrick Unveils Foreign Policy Critique</H3>

<P>

WASHINGTON, D.C.: On the fifty-third anniversary of Pearl Harbor
Day, Dr. Jeane J. Kirkpatrick released a new Empower America publication
entitled <I>Security and Insecurity: A Critique of Clinton Policy
at MidTerm </I>at a crowded, well-attended press conference at
the Willard Hotel.
<P>
Dr. Kirkpatrick said that given the &quot;major events through
which we are living ... responses that would be required are much
stronger than have been given. And the leadership that is needed
is much stronger, more purposeful, serious leadership than has
been available. And the strength that is needed, both I think,
moral, political and strategic, of the United States is greater
than has been available.&quot;
<P>
In opening remarks, Empower America Chairman Malcolm S. Forbes,
Jr. said that &quot;We believe that the midpoint of this 
Administration - the
two year mark - is a good time to do a thorough examination
of its foreign and defense policies. A variety of experts were
brought together by Jeane to do this book.&quot;
<P>
But the volume is not just limited to criticism. In an article
entitled &quot;U.S. Security Policy for the Nineties&quot;, Dr.
Kirkpatrick outlines what Mr. Forbes described as &quot;Empower
America's foreign policy approach . . . pro-democracy, pro-growth,
pro-opportunity.&quot;
<P>
Calling Dr. Kirkpatrick &quot;perhaps the seminal thinker of America's
role in this emerging world,&quot; EA Codirector Jack Kemp said
that one of &quot;lessons of the 20th century is that weakness
is provocative,&quot; and while &quot;foreign policy, trade policy,
defense policy have been bipartisan in support .. . we at EA have
been quite moderate in our critique of the first two years of
the Clinton administration.&quot;
<P>
Twenty-one of the more than thirty experts who contributed essays
to <I>Security and Insecurity </I>attended the press conference.
The book offers a comprehensive analysis of the Clinton national
security record, including foreign, defense, intelligence, information,
international economic, regional and countryspecific analyses.
It is available by sending $3.00 to Empower America, 81776 I Street,
NW, Suite 890, Washington, DC 20006.

<H3>EA Ads Tout Flat Tax</H3>

<I>Radio and Television Campaign for Reform</I>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: Moving the empowerment agenda forward, Empower
America began airing a new radio ad the week of January 9th. The
60second spot advocates replacing the current variablerate tax
system with a flat tax.
<P>
The ad, the first in an advertising campaign supporting the flat
tax, will be heard on news and talk radio stations in Iowa, New
Hampshire and Arizona. Empower America Codirector Jack Kemp set
the stage for the flat tax with an advertisement, run last month,
calling for lower acrosstheboard taxes, cutting and indexing capital
gains taxes, and raising the personal exemption for all families.
This generated considerable support.
<P>
The ad's text is as follows:
<P>
<B>Announcer</B>
<P>
<I>
Two years ago, President Clinton raised
taxes by over 250 billion dollars.
Now Clinton says he wants to cut taxes by
just 60 billion dollars. It's not enough. 
Clinton's high taxes, big spending, and
soaring interest rates are a blueprint for 
recession. To get the economy going, we need 
a real tax cut. It' s called the flat tax - 
and it' s one low rate of 17 percent will 
really cut taxes, while needy and working 
families will pay even less. The flat tax will
eliminate taxes on interest, dividends, and 
capital gains - encouraging savings, invest-
ment, and new jobs. Tax cuts worked for 
President Kennedy; they worked for President 
Reagan. What' s more, Americans could file 
their income taxes on a post card. 

To tell Bill Clinton you want a real tax cut, 
join the fight for the flat tax by calling 
Empower America at 1-800-332-2000.
</I>
<P>
Striking these same themes, Kemp along with Co-director Bill Bennett
delivered a one minute message on national CNN just prior to President
Clinton's January 24 State of the Union address.
<P>
The time, purchased by Empower America, criticized the Clinton
tax proposals and offered an economic vision for America's future,
renewing the call for a flat tax that will bring jobs and tax
relief for America's families.
<P>
The television spot, promoted by radio spots on January 23 and
24, reached a large and politically diverse audience. Empower
America hopes that such widespread exposure to these views will
encourage national discussion.
<P>
Congress is receptive to dramatically changing the tax system,
and both the House and Senate will be holding hearings during
the next several months to examine ways to reform the system,
simplify tax collection, and reduce tax rates. Empower America
will work energetically over the next several months to keep its
members informed and involved, to organize grassroots efforts
supporting the flat tax, and to let Congress know that Americans
support a flat tax.

<H3>Empower America Interview: Michael Harrison</H3>

<P>
<I>Michael Harrison is the editor and publisher of </I><B>TALKERS
Magazine, </B><I>the major trade publication in the talk radio
industry. As such, he presides over the nation's largest data
base about the medium in addition to researching the opinions
expressed by hosts and callers. In this role, Mr. Harrison has
emerged as the leading spokesman for talk radio and what he refers
to as the &quot;new media&quot; and is one of the most sought
after analysts of American public opinion. Mr. Harrison is a regular
guest on radio talk shows and network television in addition to
being constantly quoted in most of the nation's major news publications.
He also hosts </I><B>TALKERS Magazine's </B><I>nationally syndicated
weekly program, &quot;The Talk Radio Countdown Show,&quot; which
overviews the hottest topics of theweek on talk radio, and continues
to guesthost local talk shows whenever he has the time regularly
filling in on WRC Radio during his many visits to the nation's
capital</I>
<P>
<I>EMPOWER AMERICA:</I> What impact did talk radio have on the 1994 elections?
<P>
<I>MICHAEL HARRISON: </I>First of all, talk radio proved to be
an accurate bellwether of American public opinion foretelling
the results of the election as early as two years ago. As a spokesman
for the field, I've had to defend the accuracy of talk radio to
the mainstream press more than a hundred times during the past
couple of years. TV news and many of the daily papers would downplay
the sentiment expressed by both hosts and callers on talk radio
as representing a &quot;small but vocal&quot; segment of the population
of reflecting a &quot;conservative Republican bias.&quot; Or worse,
they denigrated it as playing to a &quot;radical fringe.&quot;
The point is, talk radio did not cause the election to happen
the way it did. Talk radio forecasted it. As such, talk radio
has shown itself to be more in touch with the American people
than any other of today's mass media. In doing so, it provided
the people of this nation with the opportunity to discuss the
real issues of the day and exchange populist views. It is only
in that context that talk radio impacted the election. It provided
a vehicle for public opinion which
already existed to play itself out and reach some sort of collective
resolution.
<P>
<I>EA:</I> Will there be an increase in &quot;liberal&quot; talk
radio as a result of the 1994 election?
<P>
<I>MH:</I> Only if the newly elected politicians who call themselves
&quot;conservatives&quot; are ineffective, corrupt, arrogant and
elitist and besmirch the concept of popular conservatism. You
see, I don't believe that the ever-growing talk radio audience
is inherently Democrat or Republican in a partisan sense. Nor
are they unilaterally liberal or conservative. I think the average
thinking American here at the end of the Twentieth Century is
more prone to be an active Independent. At the moment, the conservatives
are more accurately addressing these concerns than the liberals.
But actions speak louder than words and more and more, the American
public is able to perceive the difference between talk and deed.
The biggest mistake politicians on both sides of the fence can
make is to think that the electorate is primarily composed of
party faithful. In the old days the term &quot;independent&quot;
was usually associated with &quot;apathetic.&quot; Today, however,
the independent voter is more likely the most active. That's today's
gigantic difference.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What will the state of the industry be two years from
now, during the 1996 elections? What role will talk radio have
on the next election cycle?
<P>
<I>MH:</I> Talk radio will set the pace for the entire mass media. Now
that the mainstream media, particularly the press, have caught
wind of talk radio's position in the political scheme of things,
its proclivity to play the leader, will insure this prediction
coming true. The 1996 election will be played out on talk radio
and that ensuing scenario will be amplified and cemented in the
mainstream media. As far as the details of the next election are
concerned, I'm not an astrologer&#151;but I can give you this
insight, this hint: Talk radio does not choose its good guys and
bad guys simply based on party line or academic political ideology.
It bases these things on personality, character and the handling
of &quot;people&quot; concerns on an issue to issue basis. Look
what's going on in Massachusetts. The same hosts who beat the
daylights out of Dukakis for his ultraliberalism have just turned
like vicious dogs on the conservative William Weld for supporting
a 55 percent legislative pay raise on the heels of the election.
<P>
EA: Do you consider talk radio to have more entertainment, news
or education value?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Ah, now that's the question talk radio programmers
are constantly wrestling with. Finding the perfect balance between
information and entertainment. This is not a media characteristic
peculiar to talk radio. Television news, newspapers, even Presidential
campaigns are preoccupied with capturing attention and developing
interest. Or to put it another way, to avoid being boring at all
costs&#151;even if it means leaving out important information
or glossing over serious, complex issues. Fortunately, we live
at a time when a growing portion of the American public finds
news and public affairs entertaining. The problem is when the
public expects and demands that it be entertaining first and foremost.
Remember during the Persian Gulf War when people talked about
going home at night to &quot;watch&quot; the war on CNN and began
to complain when it started to get &quot;boring?&quot; At least
half the audience viewed it as just another miniseries. So yes,
talk radio is entertainment. . . but so is Connie Chung. And so
are political debates. And so are political conventions. That's
why the networks no longer cover then gavel to gavel. Shakespeare
understood this hundreds of years ago.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What is the proper role for talk radio in the political
debate?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>To create an environment that will draw a large audience
while maintaining a fair and even playing field. That's the ideal.
Uq,fortunately, the fair and even playing field often suffers
in the process of drawing the large audience. I only hope that
the bean counters who ultimately control talk radio&#151; or at
least will gain more control over the medium as it continues to
show itself to be a potential moneymaker&#151;don't overresearch
and package it to the point that it loses the rough edges and
accessibility to the people that I believe is at the core of its
impact.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What new technologies can we expect from talk radio,
such as interaction with online computer services, etc.?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Fifty years from now, today's talk radio will be looked
back upon as the
<P>
primitive public address system of the emerging 21st century electric
age democracy. As far as the present is concerned, talk radio
makes maximum effective use of existing technologies to make twoway
mass communications fantastically accessible and immediate&#151;
telephony, satellites, and digital transmission technology make
talk radio amazingly flexible and ubiquitous. The next step is
universal interaction with online computer services. <I>TALKERS
Magazine is </I>about to go online with CompuServe. The relationship
between talk radio and online services, the Internet, will be
close.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Why has there been a recent resurgence in interest
in talk radio, and when did it begin to come into its own?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Talk radio's been around for ages, but I trace the
real beginning of the modern era of talk radio to the removal
of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 which opened
<P>
the door up to stations feeling free to tackle controversial issues.
Prior to that, the Fairness Doctrine actually had a chilling effect
on the discussion of public policy in the electric media. But
that's just one factor. In the late eighties, you had all these
AM stations being beaten up by FM music stations so they turned
to talk which sounds just fine on AM. Also, talk radio addressed
issues and reflected public opinion in a way that was largely
ignored by the mainstream press and media, so it filled a massive
void and garnered tremendous public support. Other factors that
contributed to talk radio's growth have been the changing demographics
of the nation&#151;boomers are extremely interested in public
policy&#151;as well as the fact that talk radio is great company.
People are lonely and talk radio provides a sense of community
that's missing in the modern world. Then there's the advertising
aspect of talk radio. It's a powerful advertising medium <B>because
</B>it has such an active and interested audience.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Are stations moving away from locally produced talk
shows to carry more nationally syndicated shows, or are they still
cultivating local talent?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Both! The average talk station in America is a blend
of the two - and both have proven to be a vital part of the
programming success of talk radio. The networks are providing
local stations with the chance to get into the talk radio business
and provide a solid, national product. That, in turn, creates
the need to supplement the network stuff with a local perspective.
For every job that Rush Limbaugh has taken away, he's created
the need for two.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Do you see any future Rush Limbaughs on the horizon?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Yes and no. Yes, I do see tons of new and exciting
talents up and coming in talk radio and I find that very exciting.
But no, I don't think we'll see another &quot;Rush Limbaugh,&quot;
per se. He's one of a kind phenomenon that is actually historical.
If talk radio were rock and roll, then Rush Limbaugh is Elvis
Presley. Of course, as we know, there was only one king of rock
and roll - but that didn't stop him from self-destructing, and
the medium was certainly able to thrive without him.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>How can the public and grassroots organizations best
utilize the power of talk radio?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>The key is to tap into its accessibility without abusing
it. The public, of course can always listen. Callers should avoid
overdoing it as &quot;regular&quot; callers. No one wants to hear
the same person whining on and on using talk radio as a personal
soap box. Organizations should maintain the same rule. Be in touch
with the stations and hosts. Give them information that they want
and believe the public will be interested in. Do not flood them
with self-serving hype and minutia. Remember, talk radio is a business.
Put yourself in its shoes and it'll respond much more readily.

VOL. 3 NO. 1 
<P>
<H3>The Republican Agenda in the 104th Congress</H3>

<P>
<I>Now in control of both the House and Senate for the first time
in four decades, Republicans face the challenge of legislative
leadership. Fortunately, preparation for this welcome challenge
began during the campaign season when Republicans gathered on
the steps of the Capitol to sign their </I>Contract With America.
<I>This contract lays out the blueprint for thefirst 100 days
of the 104th Congress. The ten points of the </I>Contract <I>are
as follows.</I>
<P>
<B>Fiscal Responsibility Act</B>
<P>
Under this Act, Congress will vote on a balanced budget amendment
and the line item veto. The aim of this legislation is to force
Congress to live within its means and to restore financial accountability
to the budget.
<P>
<B>Taking Back Our Streets Act</B>
<P>
This provision takes a get tough approach to crime fighting;
calling for stiffer punishment, placing more police on the street,
and implementing truthinsentencing legislation that requires convicted
criminals to serve their full sentences.
<P>
<B>Personal Responsibility Act (Welfare Reform)</B>
<P>
The focus of this Act is twofold: (1) to encourage people to work,
and (2) to discourage people from having children out of wedlock.
Most Americans agree that the welfare system is seriously flawed
and must be dramatically reformed. Dramatic reform is what the
Republican leadership hopes to achieve through this legislation.
<P>
<B>Family Reinforcement Act of 1995</B>
<P>
The federal government has, in the past two decades, intruded
upon the parent/child relationship. This provision seeks to reverse
that trend by placing control of a child back where it belongs - with
the parents. The Act would also strengthen penalties for child
pornographers, and create tax breaks for those who adopt a child.
<P>
<B>The American Dream Restoration Act</B>
<P>
This Act provides a tax credit for families, reforms the &quot;marriage
penalty,&quot; and improves the tax treatment of IRAs. Beginning
in 1996, the bill would allow a $500 per child tax credit for
families with annual incomes up to $200,000. In addition, Americans
would be allowed to contribute up to $2,000 a year into an American
Dream Savings Account (ADSA).
<P>
<B>The National Security Restoration Act</B>
<P>
This provision would reform the Department of Defense by placing
an emphasis on a strong national defense through ensured funding.
It would also ensure that U.S. troops are only deployed to support
missions in the U.S.'s national security interests.
<P>
<B>Senior Citizens' Equity Act</B>
<P>
The senior citizens' earning limit would be raised. This would
end age discrimination for those who choose to work after a certain
age.
<P>
<B>The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act</B>
<P>
Rolling back government regulation has long been a priority for
Republicans; this Act would slash many burdensome regulations
that strangle small businesses, thus making it easier for investment
and job creation.
<P>
<B>The Common Sense Legal Reforms Act</B>
<P>
This Act will curb excessive lawsuits and limit abuses of the
legal system by overzealous lawyers. This type of reform is crucial
to American competitiveness.
<P>
<B>Citizen Legislature Act</B>
<P>
This Act would force a vote on the issue of term limits for Senators
and House members. This would help put an end to career politicians
and give the American people a citizen legislature.
<P>
<I>These 10 points represent the backbone of the legislative agenda
for the 104th Congress. Empower America will work closely with
Congressional leaders to go forward with these initiatives endorsed
by the American peoples ' vote in November. Empower America 's
Codirector William J. Bennett is fond of telling audiences that
this is a </I>Contract With America, <I>it is not a handshake
with America. It is in this spirit that Empower America will continue
the fight for true reform in the days to come. </I>
<P>

<DL>
<DD>&quot;Bennett, the former education secretary who took to the
campaign trail this year for an array of candidates, said he was
utterly clear on the meaning of this election. 'It was about limited
government, about the end of the nanny state,' he says. It was
about beginning to reverse 'the discharge of responsibilities
from families and communities and local government onto the federal
government,' and reviving personal responsibility.&quot;
<DT><B><I>&#151;Middletown Press, </I>Middletown, CT, November 23, 1994</B>
<P><DD>
&quot;As opposed to Bill Clinton's effort to 'reinvent government,'
Alexander wants to dismantle it. One problem lies in making sure
someone else&#151;individuals, community groups or local entities&#151;does
the work that federal agencies have been doing for decades.
Alexander's first effort to deal with these and other questions
will come at a &quot;Send Washington Home&quot; conference November
14 sponsored by Empower America.&quot;

<H3>New York Gala Honors Innovative Governors</H3>

<I>Governors Tommy Thompson, Christine Todd Whitman and John Engler
accept Empower America 's first annual </I><B>Empowerment Awards.</B>
<P>
On November 17th, Empower America held its second annual New York
Gala Dinner aboard the historic USS Intrepid aircraft carrier.
The evening's dinner and discussion were particularly eventful
as Empower America honored Governor John Engler for his changes
in Michigan education policy, Governor Tommy Thompson for the
overhaul of Wisconsin's welfare system, and Governor Christine
Todd Whitman for her bold economic policies in New Jersey. These
governors were the recipients of Empower America's first annual
<I>Empowermerlt Awards&#151;</I>in recognition of their ingenious
and innovative policies benefitting the men and women, business
leaders, families, and children of their states.
<P>
The evening' s patriotic celebration was heightened with the presentation
of the colors by the USS Inchon Color Guard. Empower America Chairman
Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr. presided over the event and began the evening
with an introduction of New York Governorelect George Pataki.
The Empower America Board of Directors welcomed over 500 friends
and supporters as Lamar Alexander, William Bennett,
<P>

Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick presented the awards to the Governors.
The energized crowd and impressive lineup of state and local leaders
set the tone for the debate which will resume in the new congress.
<P>
The discussion shed light on the emerging discussion surrounding
illconceived policies at both the national and state levels, in
addition to addressing the federal government's stream of unfunded
mandates. The progressive agendas of Governors Engler, Thompson
and Whitman will be on the leading edge of change -- to restructure
the relationship between the federal government and the states,
and comprehensively change the way that our elected leaders do
business.

<H3>Issue Conference Campaign Tackles Gold Standard</H3>
<P>


<I>Bretton Woods</I>
<P>
On September 8th, Empower America hosted a conference on monetary
policy which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the historic
Bretton Woods Conference. The anniversary conference, which took
place in Washington, DC, featured reputable experts in the field
of economics including Lawrence Kudlow, Arthur Laffer, Lawrence
Lindsey, and Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr., in addition to Empower America
Co-directors Jack Kemp and Vin Weber. 
<P>
Communications Campaign Proves Effective
<P>
Over the past couple of months, Empower America has been waging
an intensive television and radio advertising campaign. Issueoriented
ads have been placed throughout the country opposing bad legislation,
like the Clinton health care plan, and promoting good proposals,
like tax cuts and the A to Z spending cut plan.
<P>
These ads often put Empower America squarely in the middle of
major issue debates. For instance, Department of Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala publicly attacked an ad that
called President Clinton's welfare reform plan &quot;cynical and
deceptive.&quot; The resulting debate brought to light many of
the Clinton plan's flaws, helping to defeat it.
<P>
Empower America produced one of the most critical television ads
that ran during
the health care reform debate. The ad pulled no punches in asserting
that &quot;President Clinton wants to socialize our health care.&quot;
This ad, with an intensive buy, helped put Empower America on
the front lines of the battle that eventually saw the Clinton
health care plan soundly defeated.
<P>
&quot;Because Empower America is a non-profit non-partisan organization,
our ads can also be run by TV and radio stations as public service
announcements, which many do. Also, stations can hear each ad
through a special digital phone line established to transmit radio
actualities. By absorbing the production cost, Empower America
thus is able to support friendly and conservative TV and radio
stations throughout the country by producing professional issue-oriented
messages. &quot;

<P>

<H3>Lamar Alexander Joins Empower America</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151;Lamar Alexander, former secretary of education
and governor of Tennessee, recently joined the leadership of Empower
America. He will serve as a codirector elong with Bill Bennett,
Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber.
<P>
Since leaving government, Mr. Alexander has remained active in
national politics. He launched a satellite TV network based in
Nashville, TN, which conducts a monthly public policy discussion
through nearly 3,000 town meetings across the country. Alexander's
satellite network will provide another vehicle for the organization
to advance its empowerment agenda among a broad coalition grassroots
activists.
<P>
&quot;Our neighborhood meetings and Empower America fit together
perfectly ' Mr. Alexander said. &quot;I'm delighted to be on the
same team as Bill, Jack, Jeane and Vin, who are constantly challenging
conservatives to say more clearly what we are for.&quot;
<P>
Lamar Alexander is also an advocate for congressional reform and
champions the idea of &quot;cut their pay and send them home.&quot;
His plan includes cutting a congressman's time in Washington and
pay in half.
<P>
Alexander explains, &quot;If members ate their breakfasts in hometown
diners instead of Capitol Hill restaurants such harebrained notions
as turning the health care system over to the government to run,
raising taxes to create jobs, 'reinventing
<P>
welfare' from Washington, DC for the 7th time, would never see
daylight.&quot;
<P>
The new codirector's colleagues, Bennett and Kemp, praised his
addition to the group.
<P>
&quot;I have always respected and admired Lamar's outspoken advocacy
of creative
<P>
solutions to our nation's problems:' Kemp said. I'm thrilled that
he's agreed to join our team and help advance the conservative
cause.&quot;
<P>
Bill Bennett added, &quot;I'm very glad to have Lamar join our
organization. His is another clear and experienced voice on the
cause of empowering Americans.&quot;

<P>

<H3>Making Ideas Matter in the Fall Elections</H3>
<P>
EmpowerAmerica plays key role in development of popular message
in the fall elections.
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: As the fall elections draw near, political
experts across the country are predicting big gains for proponents
of the principles of empowerment. In the House of Representatives,
most experts predict a shift of twenty five or more seats into
the conservative ranks. In the Senate, gains of four to seven
seats are not only possible, but likely. The same is true at the
state and local level. Several statehouses and several state legislatures
may move from the domination of liberal control to majority empowerment oriented
control.
<P>
One of the reasons for this success is the ability of conservative
candidates to define a coherent message of limited government
distinguished from that of President Clinton and his liberal allies.
Empower America has played an important role in the development
of this agenda.
<P>
We recently completed a series of successful Candidate Schools,
in which candidates from across the country learned about effective
and viable messages of family and community empowerment over massive
governmental bureaucracy. Now, Empower America has turned its
efforts to helping primary winners develop that same message.
<P>
While not endorsing or supporting any particular candidate, Empower
America has been actively involved with candidates in advancing
the message of empowerment.
<P>
As Congress struggles through the final weeks of the current session,
it is becoming increasingly clear that President Clinton is going
to be a huge millstone around the necks of big-spending, big-government
congressional candidates across the county. This stands in stark
contrast with Empower America's message.
<P>
Candidate School attendees and winners from across the country
are succeeding on the Empower America message. In Rhode Island,
Dr. Kevin Vigilante is running for Congress in the first congressional
district. Faced with strong opposition from Patrick Kennedy, son
of Senator Edward Kennedy, he has overcome huge Kennedy advantages
in name identification and fundraising to be within points of
Kennedy in the polls. Dr. Vigilante is utilizing the facts, theories
and vision advocated by Empower America. Crime, welfare, education
and economic growth define his campaign.
<P>
In Tennessee, attorney and former actor Fred Thompson is running
for the Senate against Congressman Jim Cooper.
<P>
Principal sponsor of the &quot;Clintonlite&quot; health care plan,
Cooper entered the race as the heavy favorite. Thompson, however,
has closed the gap significantly by running a campaign based on the 
principles of empowerment. Advocating a strong welfare reform package as well
as crime and real health care reform, Thompson has made this race
&quot;too close to call&quot; as the days count down to November.
<P>
Empower America also has been briefing candidates who did not
attend the Candidate Schools. Through weekly faxes on issues to
all primary winners and other periodic &quot;urgent updates&quot;
on breaking issues, Empower America is ensuring that all candidates
have access to the powerful message of empowerment.
<P>
When the November elections have come and gone, America will have
taken a step closer to returning power to citizens and local governments
and a step away from the big government control of the last thirty
years.

<H3>A Letter from the President</H3>
<P>
 
Dear Empower America Members:
<P>
These past few months have been very exciting at <B>Empower America</B>
 and we must thank you, our membership, for this. Your continual
interest and involvement in this organization makes it possible
for us to promote the empowerment agenda across the country and
play a leading role in the national debate.
<P>
We are pleased to welcome Lamar Alexander to our leadership as
a codirector. There is no doubt that his involvement with us will
bring vigorous new energy to the public policy debate.
<P>
Empower America has been actively involved in the fight against
the costly crime and health care bills using an aggressive television
and radio advertisement.campaign to deliver our message on
both. Our goal was to activate Americans to participate in the
political system by contacting their representative and senators
and persuading them to vote against these economically destructive
pieces of legislation.
<P>
As the debate over health care continues in the months ahead,
Empower America will lend its voice around the nation to promote
insurance availability, affordability and portability for everyone
without government mandates.
<P>
<B>Now, we are encouraging all of you </B>to become active
in the fall midterm elections. This is a cridcal time for all of
us. This election represents the opportunity to make changes that
will affect the policies governing all of our futures. This is
the time to elect individuals who support the advancement of freedom,
the promotion of
economic growth and the pursuit of solutions to cultural and social
problems.
<P>
The best way to do this is to vote! Research the candidates in
your state and district. Then cast your vote for those who will
support legislation that empowers people and not government bureacracies.
Let's elect individuals to office who represent the most important
special interest: the American people.
<P>
Once again, thank you very much for your support of Empower America.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
Bill Dal Col
<P>
President

<P>

<H3>Crime in America: A Nation Held Hostage</H3>

<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: Over the past three decades violent crime
has increased by more than 500 percent. America leads the industrialized
world in rates of murder, rape and violent crime. As these
disturbing numbers continue to grow, nearly three out of every
four convicted criminals remain on the street, and the American
public's faith in its government's ability to fulfill its first
priority, to protect its citizenry from enemies foreign and domestic,
steadily erodes. As a result, parents are afraid to let their
children freely roam the neighborhood with their friends; individuals
are afraid to walk the streets of many cities at night;
and law-abiding, hardworking citizens in the nation's inner cities
live with the constant fear of being the next victim of a random
act of violence while traveling to and from their home. In short,
the lawlessness of an incorrigible few has been allowed to alter
the lifestyles of law-abiding citizens throughout the nation. The
Democratic leadership, sensing the urgency of the problem, has
delivered a crime 
bill to the American people. This type of legislation will help,
right? Wrong.
<P>
The recently passed crime bill is being hailed by supporters as
a tough assault on crime, but the specifics of the legislation
betray their rhetoric. Instead of focusing on the principles of
apprehending criminals quickly and sentencing them to terms which
they will actually serve, the bill continues the liberal tradition
of fighting crime by pouring taxpayer money into more untested
social programs aimed at the &quot;root causes&quot; of crime
(e.g. poverty, boredom, low self-esteem). For example, in the recent
legislation one can find:
<UL>
<LI>A provision to teach arts and crafts and establish dance programs;
<LI>A provision designed to increase self-esteem;
<LI>A provision establishing Midnight Sports Leagues.
</UL>
Regardless of what one might think of these programs, it is ludicrous
to present them as answers to the very serious crime problem facing
our nation. Such an ivory tower approach by the social scientists
on 
Capitol Hill who drew up these provisions is an insult to the
average hardworking American who is looking to Washington for
some real help. Most Americans who pay their taxes and fear for
their personal safety would probably not agree that funds, desperately
needed by local law enforcement agencies, would be more wisely
spent by social workers (in the name of crime fighting) to establish
late night basketball leagues.
<P>
Even though there are some meritorious provisions such as the
community policing and prison provisions, these are so encumbered
with restrictive federal language that their beneficial effects
will be severely hampered. Overall, the bill simply possesses
too many untried provisions, is too complex and is too cost-inefficient
to be accepted by an American public under siege and seeking real
reform.
<P>
What can we do? Plenty. First, we must reform our criminal justice
system.
Punishment needs to be swifter, more certain and longer than it
is now. We need to build more prisons, hire more police officers
and prosecutors, implement truth-in-sentencing provisions and overhaul
the current juvenile justice system.
<P>
Numerous police officers and prosecutors around the country tell
of the frustration they face when they see the same offenders
arrested time after time as our 
revolving door justice system places these lifetime criminals
back on the street. Stories of a brutal attack by a criminal on
early release from his or her sentence are becoming all too common.
The system must be altered and it must be soon. The problem is
that legislation such as the crime bill will spend billions of
taxpayer dollars and do little to slow down the revolving door.
<P>
America also needs more police officers and more prisons (the
diluted provisions of the current bill are not sufficient) to
attack the rise in crime seriously. Each time a federal judge
orders a state to release prisoners because of overcrowding, justice
takes another blow and society comes face to face with criminals
who have not served their full sentence all because the state
could not house the offenders. If society expects criminals to
take its laws seriously, then society must be willing and able
to enforce those laws and the punishment that is given to those
who break the law.
<P>
America also faces the problem of juvenile crime. As John DiIulio
of Princeton University has stated, &quot;America is facing a
ticking youth crime bomb. We have burgeoning numbers of young
people who, from all the statistical profiles, are at risk of
becoming violent and repeat criminals.&quot; Once again, this
is a problem we must address by altering the justice system's
handling of young offenders; again, the crime bill presented by
the Democratic leadership does not. There is hope; however, it
is just not in Washington, DC.
<P>
In Richmond, Virginia, Governor George Allen is attempting to
reform a parole system that allows criminals to avoid 
large portions of their sentences. His administration is looking
past the failures of the last three decades and saying it is time
we apply basic principles in our fight against crime. The main
principles are age-old: justice must be swift and it must be sure.
If it is not both of these, it will not be justice. Criminals
seem to understand this very well. It is unfortunate that
President Clinton and those members of Congress who voted for
the most recent crime bill do not.

<H3>How To Cut Government Spending...From A To Z</H3>

<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151; A bipartisan coalition of representatives
has presented Congress with the opportunity to restore some measure
of fiscal sanity to the federal budget. Their initiative, known
as the A to Z Spending Cuts Plan after its primary co-sponsors,
Democrat Rob Andrews of New Jersey and Republican Bill Zeliff
of New Hampshire, would hold every member of Congress accountable
for wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary government spending.
<P>
Ever wonder why Congress can't just repeal the federal Helium
Act (started just after World War I to supply helium to our fleet
of military blimps) and save $1.7 billion? Or save $74 million
over five years by ending treeplanting grants offered by the Small
Business Administration? Or eliminate the $26 million the government
will spend this year to subsidize vacant public housing?
<P>
The answer is that these and hundreds of other federal boondoggles
costing billions are hidden deep inside huge pieces of legislation.
These omnibus spending bills are much more difficult to defeat
than individual examples of ridiculous government spending.
<P>
Liberals argue that the cuts outlined above won't make much of
a dent in the projected 1994 budget deficit of $220 billion. Maybe
so, but that's just a start. Citizens Against Government Waste,
a congressional watchdog organization has published a list of
556 &quot;Prime Cuts&quot; that would reduce federal spending
by nearly $187 billion this year and more than $1.3 trillion over
five years. People can argue the merits and demerits of these
and other spending programs. But supporters of these initiatives
don't want to encourage debate, they want to stifle it.
<P>
Until now, spending cuts which everyone purports to support, such
as the infamous Honey Bee and Mohair subsidies, have been allowed
to escape the budget ax. But for the first time, the A to Z plan
will force legislators to defend absurd special interest spending,
instead of denying responsibility .
<P>
The plan is simple and straightforward. Congress would set aside
an entire week &#151;56 hours of debate&#151;to consider nothing
but spending cuts. There would be no &quot;sacred cows.&quot;
Every government program would be on the table, vulnerable to
an amendment to reduce or eliminate its funding. Each individual
proposal would receive a recorded &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;
vote. It would only take a simple majority of House members to
eliminate once and for all hundreds of federal programs that serve
no legitimate public purpose. Outdated and wasteful programs will
no longer survive by clinging onto popular proposals. Each member
will be held accountable for his or her vote with no excuses.
<P>
But in Washington, there has to be a catch for any proposal that
makes this much sense. Despite the fact that a strong, bipartisan
majority in the House of Representatives supports the A to Z plan,
Democratic leaders will not allow the proposal to come to the
floor for a vote. If all of the bill's 230 cosponsors would sign
what's known as a &quot;discharge petition,&quot; the legislation
could be discharged from the committee, where it is being bottled
up, and brought to the floor. As of press time, only 204 members
have signed the petition, 14 short of the necessary number.
<P>
Why would someone cosponsor the bill but then refuse to allow
a vote on the plan? Members of Congress sometimes use this tactic
to safely demonstrate support for a popular proposal knowing all
along that they will never have to cast a vote. By doing so, they
are blocking an important deficit reduction tool and contributing
to the deepening level of public cynicism toward Congress as an
institution.
<P>
Pressure is building on A to Z cosponsors who refuse to sign the
discharge petition. The bill continues to inch forward as more
and more legislators feel the heat of public scrutiny. More and
more Americans are demanding responsibility and accountability
in the federal budget process. Constituents want to know exactIy
where their representatives stand on helium reserves, mohair subsidies,
and treeplanting grants.
<P>
The fate of A to Z will help determine the legacy of the 103rd
Congress. That legacy can either be one of missed opportunities,
or one where Congress helped restore the public's faith in America's
elected of ficials. For now, the choice is up to Congress. In
November, the voters will decide.

<H3>Kirkpatrick Speaks at Foreign Policy Forum</H3>
<P>
<I>Calls For Missile Defense Program; says no justification for invasion
of Haiti</I>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151; Empower America Codirector Jeane Kirkpatrick
called on the Clinton administration to develop a defense for
America against ballistic missile attack. The former U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations said, &quot;I believe that it is impossible
today for any president to fulfill his pledge to provide for the
defense of the United States without developing an effective missile
defense, period. That is just a fact. Like it; dislike it; it
is a fact of life in our times. And it is incredible to me that
the current Administration should continue its blindness in this
regard.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick pointed out that efforts to control
the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
of mass destruction and to stem the development of ballistic missiles
that can carry these weapons to targets long distances away have
reached a &quot;point of breakout&quot; that &quot;simply cannot
be tolerated.&quot; Ambassador Kirkpatrick said we need &quot;to
complete a missile defense program, a space-based missile defense
program which would enable us to defend ourselves and for
us to defend our friends and allies in the world against weapons
of mass destruction.&quot; She concluded by adding that &quot;the
problems are all of our making today in this regard. And this
president bears a heavy responsibility for his decisions in this
area.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick also stated that &quot;there should be
no use of force of Haiti.&quot; She
added that &quot;I do not believe that there is an
 American national interest that justifies an
 invasion of Haiti.&quot;
 Ambassador Kirkpatrick was one of
 four distinguished speakers at a recent
 Foreign Policy Forum held by the
 Republican National Committee at which
 she made these remarks. She was joined
by former Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney and former Secretaries
of State Henry Kissinger and James A. Baker III at the Forum to
address current international relations problems and to discuss
the Clinton administration's foreign policy.
<P>
Regarding the current government, Ambassador Kirkpatrick said
that she &quot;believes this administration underestimates the
danger in the world today, under
estimates the role of power and of force in the world, and, in
a curious kind of way, underestimates the force of American values
and institutions in the world.&quot; The countries of the former
Soviet Union are turning to America's values and institutions
as the model for their developing democratic and free market systems.
Therefore,
Ambassador Kirkpatrick said, &quot;It is as terrible a mistake
to underestimate the force of American values, as it is to underestimate
the value of American force.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick also evaluated various aspects of the Clinton
administration's foreign policy, pointing out that their actions
stemmed in part from conceptions about the limits of American
power and that &quot;multilateralism was to be at the center of
their foreign policy.&quot; Another key Clinton administration
belief is that America is, &quot;in some fundamental sense, in
a process of inexorable decline. Therefore, they think we should
not seek to act unilaterally in the world, but should act only
multilaterally. Moreover, they clearly believe that multilateral
action is more moral and more legitimate than unilateral action.&quot;
<P>
Further, the Clinton administra
tion has moved to &quot;dramatically
draw down American military
forces, to diminish American weapons and
weapons procurement, to downsize the mil
itary's industrial complex, to reduce
research and development and to concen
trate on producing enough weapons and
maintaining just enough military forces
only, as they always put it, to defend our
own country.&quot; The problem, Ambassador
Kirkpatrick asserted, is that &quot;we can only
do good in the world if we have the power
 to do good in the
 world.&quot; Under the
 Clinton administration, &quot;American
 Power is being 
neglected and dissipated.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick's address, 
&quot;U.S. Leadership: The Uses and Abuses of
Multilateralism,&quot; is available from
Empower America's <I>Speeches and 
Lectures</I> senies.

<H3>Empower America Interview: Public Opinion Pollsters 
Edward Goeas and John McLaughlin</H3>
<P>
<I>Mr. Edward Goeas is President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Tarrance Group, a survey and research company located in Alexandria,
Virginia. Mr. Goeas has served as the pollster for a number of
senate and congressional campaigns. He is also the pollster for</I>
U.S. News and World Report.
<P>
<I>Mr. John McLaughlin is a partner of Fabrizio, McLaughlin &amp; Associates,
a national public opinion polling and strategic consulting firm
in Alexandria, Virginia. Mr. McLaughlin has worked on hundreds
of campaigns, most recently as strategist and pollster on Governor
George Allen's campaign in Virginia.</I>
<P>
<B><I>Empower America:</I>What do you perceive to be the major issues
and concerns that will ultimately affect the 1994 elections? What
do you believe to be the &quot;mood&quot; of the nation and what
is on voters' minds?</B>
<P>
<I>Edward Goeas:</I> Issue concerns of the American public are being
voiced at two levels as we enter the final months of the 1994
election. One level is the actual problems voters are concerned
about, and on a second level they are judging incumbents and challengers
alike on their ability to address those concerns with common sense,
workable solutions.
<P>
As concerns over the economy (unemployment, taxes and the deficit)
have dissipatedeover the last year, the American electorate has
refocused on &quot;lifestyle&quot; issues. Crime has been the
major &quot;lifestyle&quot; concern that voters have focused on
for almost a year now, with nearly 41 percent of the electorate
mentioning crime as the number one problem facing the country.
Voter concern over health care, welfare reform, declining values
and education have rounded off these &quot;lifestyle&quot; concerns
now mentioned by six out of ten voters.
<P>
Candidates' ability to put forward credible solutions to these
problems has become much more difficult because of the skeptical
mood of the American elec
torate. After a brief period of optimism, voters have turned even
more cynical about government's ability to effectively address
the problems that they face on a daily basis. This cynicism has
increased as the voters have seen the solutions coming out of
Washington to be more government, more bureaucracy and the demand
for more of their hard earned money.
<P>
<I>John McLaughlin:</I> The Clinton administration appears to be better
able to run a campaign than a government. There is a large policy
gap between their rhetoric and the actual legislation they support.
This leads to three overall themes that appear to be undermining
Clinton's success among the voters. First, since Clinton's election,
American voters have repeatedly told us by a 2 to 1 margin that
they favor less government with fewer services as opposed to larger
government with more services. Clinton talks about less government,
but the facts reveal that all his policies point to larger government.
Americans are becoming more freedomoriented in a technological
age rather than the biggovernment orientation of the Industrial
Age.
<P>
Second, in June we asked voters if they were more concerned about
where a candidate stands on the issues, or about the candidate's
honesty. By a 7 to 3 ratio, the vast majority of Americans prefer
voting for someone who is honest. This is a direct
reflection upon President Clinton's character, or lack of it.
<P>
Finally, American voters are in the midst of a spending revolt.
In the late 1970's we saw America generate a tax revolt. From
our surveys of this year, the voters believe that the federal
government wastes $.42 cents out of every dollar it spends. By
margins of 7080 percent, they prefer cutting government spending
over any measures to raise taxes. Overall, it appears that the
1994 elections will be a state by state referendum for the Senate
and House on Bill Clinton.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> In your opinion, is there an empowerment agenda that voters
want?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Voters are looking for three things; accountability from their
elected officials, the opportunity for individuals and communities
to take more personal responsibility in both their daytoday lives
and their future, and the hope that a renewed emphasis on the
values of honesty, hard work, and a commitment to family and community
will once again put the American Dream within reach for middle
class Americans. The overwhelming majority of voters are certainly
not looking for government to do everything for them, nor are
they looking for an ineffectivc government that is always getting
in their way and hampers their ability to move forward. Proposals
like term limits and national initiatives and referenda receive
support from over 70 percent of the electorate because they are
searching for ways to have a greater say in their government.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> The voters are looking for new ideas. They want to turn away
from the old failed policies of the past and try creative solutions
to their current problems. Voters seem to be very receptive to
the idea of cutting taxes to create jobs. And on a local level,
voters who elected Republican mayors Tom Fetzer in Raleigh, and
Bret Schundler in Jersey City, are efljoying more police on their
streets while at the same time seeing their local taxes cut. Other
ideas to which voters are extremely receptive include: term
limits, workfare, common sense solutions to crime, school choice,
and tax credits for health care coverage. All these ideas would
give people greater control over their lives, and less control
to government. Finally, technology is driving voter beliefs that
they can have more direct democracy.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I>From your data, do you see a major shift on the horizon
in either the House of Representatives or the Senate for 1994?
Will 1994 be a vote on Bill Clinton's policies?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> As we enter the fall elections, it appears there will be a
substantial gain for Republic ns in both the House and the Senate.
In the Senate, it is likely that Republicans will pick up five
or six seats (with a chance of tak
ing control). In the House Republicans look to gain between
twenty-five to thirty seats (The last time GOP numbers in the House
were over 200 seats was 1954). The reality is that significant 
gains are likely for Republicans come November's elections.
 There is no question that significant gains will force Bill
Clinton to reevaluate the course of &quot;bigger government is
better&quot; that he has set for the country.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Since last year, it has been apparent from Clinton's lack
of success on the stimulus package and the budget that the Republicans
would have large midterm gains in both the Senate and the House.
In the House, there is a minimum gain of about 15 seats, which
are mainly seats the Republicans should have gained in 1992 after
reapportionment. Add to that the usual historical antiincumbent
setbacks in Congressional elections to the party that controls
the White House, and it's likely that the Republicans will gain
30 seats. A similar antiClinton trend in the Senate would find
the interesting outcome of a 5050 tie, where Vice President Gore
might have to cast deciding votes in the Senate the last two years
of Clinton's term. On the gubernatorial level, Republicans may
have 
the potential for even greater gains. The growing trend for Republicans
with new ideas to attract Perot voters and disenchanted Democrats
is one that appears to be wellfounded for this November's election.
Only the Republicans themselves could lose this opportunity if
they compromise on principle.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From what you see, what are the bellwether races in the
country that will show whether a shift is underway?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Without going into the numerous races that could be highlighted
as bellwether races, look for surprises in two areas&#151;the
South and West. The South is where resistance toward Bill Clinton's
overall philosophy of governance is
strongest. In the West, voters have increasingly felt that Clinton's
policies coming out of Washington are hostile to the West, and
they are looking to force Washington's policies to either help
or get out of the way.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> The bellwether races in the country certainly include high
profile Senate races, however, for the Republicans to make gains
in the Senate, they are going to have to win in states where Bill
Clinton may still be popular, and the trend towards Republicanism
is less strong. For example, in the Senate, wins by Republicans
that would point to a landslide would include Maine, Ohio, New
Jersey, California, Wisconsin and knocking off Ted Kennedy. A
more important trend regarding ideas could be the successful reelection
of innovative and pioneering governors that Republicans brought
to office four years ago. Voinovich of Ohio, Thompson of
Wisconsin, and Engler in Michigan have all experimented with ways
to keep taxes low, keep the size of government in check and find
creative solutions to problems. At the House level, there are
very interesting races which are absolute bellwethers of change
in the nation.
<P>
Mark Sharpe defeating Sam Gibbons, the House Ways and Means Chairman
of Florida, would be a strong sign that goodoldboy politics is
over with. Tom Davig' strong showing in Virginia's northern suburbs
would show that a successful progressive local executive would
be able to bring new solutions to Washington. And in Rhode Island,
Kevin Vigilante's victory over Patrick Kennedy would be another
setback for the failed liberal policies of the past. Across
the board, the message is change. Republican candidates are
running with the message of change, and all the previously 
mentioned contests will show whether that  message has a
very partisan edge, or whether American 
voters are still confused about who will give them the leadership
they need.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I>How much change do Americans really want in health care?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> After numerous delays and a year of debate, concern over government
control of health care, the threat of declining quality and increasing
costs, the possible loss of choice in the selection of their personal
doctor has left a bad taste in voters' mouths. Adding to these
negatives is the perception that, with the elections right around
the corner, it would be best to delay final action until the next
legislative year. In fact, the harder Congress pushes for a health
care bill this year, the more the voters are made to feel that
there is something to mistrust in Washington's motives. To many
Americans it looks like Congressional Democrats are rushing health
care reform only to improve their political health and not America's
health.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Americans want their health care system improved, however,
they don't want the quality of their health care reduced. An early
warning to the Clinton administration came in June when Governor
Lawton Chiles called a special session precisely to enact the
Florida Health Security Act. Republican legislators stood firm
in the state Senate and the House, and nothing passed. There was
very little outcry; in fact, there was a sigh of relief among
Florida voters. Our polls showed that the vast majority had health
care and did not want the government to take it over. Furthermore,
twothirds of the voters were not willing to pay more than $100
a year in higher premiums or tax increases for universalhealth
care. As the details about Clinton's health care plan surfaced,
the voters became extremely concerned that these changes will
reduce the quality of care while increasing the cost. With the
prospect of larger government intervention in health care, the
potential decrease in quality, and an increase in taxes or premiums,
Americans agree this is not the change they need.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From your information, how do you perceive the American
people's response to the Clinton administration's welfare
proposals? Do they find them dramatic or cosmetic?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> The President has lost his &quot;New Democrat&quot; effort
to take over the welfare system as his own. Last year voters felt
that
 Bill Clinton and the Democrats in Congress would do a better job
reforming welfare over Republicans in Congress by nineteen percentage
points. After delayed introduction, and then introduction of a
plan that clearly missed the mark of voter concerns, Republicans
are, once again, seen as best able to address welfare reform.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Americans responded very well to Clinton's rhetoric to end
welfare as we know it, but it's just rhetoric. Since his first
proposal, they have found out that among those people who currently
receive welfare, over 80 percent of them will continue to 'receive
it under Clinton's welfare proposal because he has exempted the
vast majority of them from work lre requirements. Also, 
the voters are underwhelmed by Clinton's promise of government
subsidized jobs for those who cannot find work in the private
sector. This sounds like merely a shell game rather than an actual
improvement in the system. This is why Clinton would increase
welfare spending by $9 billion dollars. In contrast, there is
a real vacuum in the media to present more popular alternatives.
The best piece of legislation, by Senator Lauch Faircloth and
Congressman Jim Talent, has gone unnoticed. Although endorsed
by Empower America, no one has yet drawn the direct contrast to
the Clinton bill. While Clinton would increase welfare spending
by $9 billion, FairclothTalent would cut it by $5060 billion dollars.
Clinton would only take 12 percent of the people off the rolls,
FairclothTalent would take 50 percent off the welfare rolls, and
FairclothTalent has more initiatives within it to keep families
together and end the destructive disincentives in the current
welfare system.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From your research, is America's
international standing an issue with the voters?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Traditionally foreign affairs does not play a major role in
nonpresidential elections. In this election cycle, however, background
noise from Bill Clinton's continual mishandling, and sometimes
total incompetence, in the international arena, has made nervous
voters, even more skittish about where our nation is really heading.
It is puzzling to the voters how, in two short years, international
respect for the United States can so quickly plummet with misdirected
foreign policy. The one issue that will play a major part in this
year's election is Bill Clinton's policy to place U.S. troops
under United Nations command. American voters reject this Clinton
policy in overwhelming numbers and want it reversed.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> At present there is very little immediate concern among the
voters with foreign policy, defense, or international issues.
This is primarily because there is no perceived threat to the
voters' freedom and international security. Nevertheless, Clinton
scores very low ratings compared to the previous Republicans.
It is paramount in the voters' minds that Presidents Reagan and
Bush collapsed the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; while Bill Clinton
withdrew in the face of embarrassing opposition from a warlord
in Mogadishu and a band of thugs in Haiti. If there is an intemational
crisis where the United States cannot succeed to preserve this
feeling of security among our voters, Bill Clinton would suffer
drastically in 1996. The last election was an aberration, in that
it was the first election since 1932 where the economy was the
dominant issue. Every other presidential election in between had
an international issue as the dominant or leading factor in deciding
who would win.
<P>
For Clinton, the true wildcard would be a foreign policy setback.
Just like the Panama Canal became a symbol of weak leadership
under Jimmy Carter, Clinton's legislation to force the military
to accept homosexuals, illustrated from the start that he was
more interested in social engineering than.in protecting national
security. The subsequent defense cuts have actually provided reasonable
grounds for voters to believe any foreign policy setbacks are
the direct result of Clinton's policies.

<H3>THE SATELLITE MEDIA TOUR: Empower America's venture into communications
technology</H3>
<P
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151;Reaching the public through earned media
opportunities poses a challenging task for any grassroots organization.
There are many methods for getting the message out, ranging from
the conventional news release, a static relic of oldstyle politics,
to building a new traditionl television or radio network, a costly
and cumbersome undertaking which ultimately reaches a minimal
audience.
<P>
Is there a better way?
<P>
New technology and the '90s information explosion have opened
the door to cheaper, more efficient, and more targeted means to
raise an organization's name and mission profile through the media.
<P>
One such method is the satellite media tour, which Empower America
has utilized with remarkable results.
<P>
Research shows that Americans are more likely to watch their local
news than network news. That means, in order to shape the debate
on current issues, it becomes critical to gain access to local
news broadcasts.
<P>
Using only a studio and uplinks to satellites, Empower America's

free of the &quot;insidethebeltway&quot; news filter.
<P>
Empower America has conducted four satellite media tours. In September
1993, Bill Bennett discussed the results of the American Legislative
Exchange Council and Empower America Report Card on American Education
with local news stations across the country. Through the use of
fiber optics, Empower America chairman Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr.,
and other Empower America leaders, conducted a remote satellite
media tour in December 1993, live from Empower America's national
summit on the Clinton economic record. On June 6, 1994, Jack Kemp
and Jeane Kirkpatrick reflected on the 50 years since DDay during
a one and onehalf hour satellite tour for local TV stations doing
original reporting marking the 50th anniversary of that historic
day. And on August 11, 1994, Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr. conducted
a tour on health care reform plans and the debate in Congress.
<P>
Satellite media tours have enabled 
Empower America's leaders to talk with 27 TV stations, in roughly
ten minute increments each, for live broadcast or livetotape for
later use.
<P>
And the cost? The D-Day anniversary satellite tour tells all. On
June 6, 1994, Empower America reached 2 million actual viewers
at a cost of onefifth of a penny 
per viewer.
<P>
Empower America used satellite communications to make available
its 60-second TV ad on the Clinton health care plan to 1,800 television
stations and cable carriers across the country, for their use
in original news coverage or as a public service announcement.
In this case, satellite technology enabled Empower America to
greatly expand coverage for an alreadyproduced product, at modest
additional cost.
<P>
Satellite communications technology is costeffective and highly
efficient for grassroots organizations to harness the same power
as tbe major television networks.
<P>
Empower America is helping lead the conservative movement through
this exciting information revolution.

<P>

<B>Remarks by George Gilder<BR>
<I>At EmpowerAmerica's
San Francisco Regional Conference</I></B>
<P>
...What's going on in electronics with this exponential upsurge
is not comrnodity competitioh, it's dynamic competition. It's
creative destruction. And what is optimal now in technological
competition, technology competition focuses on innovation, and
innovation is the pursuit of the temporary positions of monopoly&#151;that's
what innovation is. And innovation is an advance that nobody else
has for a while. It's a monopoly...That's what motivates high
levels of investment and risktaking in technology advance. But
if you begin a race by saying nobody can win, and nobody can make
any money, you essentially prohibit the creation of a real broadband
infrastructure in dynamic advances in electronics and communications...

<B>&quot;Building Bridges To Build
A Better Michigan&quot;
<BR><I>
By John Engler, Governor of Michigan Addressing the Greater Detroit
Chamber
of Commerce Mackinac Conference</I></B>
<P>
...How did we turbocharge Michigan's economy? By cutting taxes,
cutting red tape and holding the line on government spend
ing. We made tough decisions, built partnerships, and we worked
together. Just as Michigan companies are reengineering the way
they do business, we are reinventing state government&#151;from
top to bottom...
<P>
<B>&quot;Capitalism and Democracy
American Style: Can They Co-Exist?&quot;
<I>
By Theodore J. Forstmann,
Founding Chairman, Empower America Grants Political Conference</I></B>
<P>
..No political freedom, their words echo down to us, is secure
where the right to property, the fruit of one's own intellectual
or physical labor, is not strong. Government's job, our Founders
all believed, was basically to create a stable environment in
which free people could operate; to provide the permanent political
conditions in which economic changes would inevitably occur. This
was all basic noncontroversial stuff. And so, for example, in
Wilson's day, Americans paid no more than 10 percent of their
earnings to all levels of govemment. When the income tax was first
proposed in l909, one senator rose to suggest a constitutional
limit of ten percent. And it's staggering to reflect how this
suggestion was greeted. After further heated debate, the idea
was rejected on the 
grounds that if a ten percent maximum were set, the income tax
might inevitably rise to that ominous level...
<P>
<B>&quot;The Real War On Crime: 
States On The Front Lines&quot;
<I>
By George AUen, Governor of Virginia
Addressing The Governor's Forum</I></B>
<P>
...The surge in violent crime is more than a &quot;thief in the
night&quot; stealing some one's belongings. It is stealing something
much more precious: our freedom. It is denying our citizens their
unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;
their right to work, live and raise a family without being terrorized
and victimized by violent criminals and lawlessness...
<P>
...There is only one way to stop it [crime], and that is to take
the people who are committing the violence&#151;that small percentage
of criminals who commit the vast majority of crime&#151;and get
them out of the free society that they have declared war on. Because
one thing is certain: The one place a violent career criminal
won't harm more innocent people is in prison...
<P>
..But the last thing we need from Congress is more expensive social
spending designed to fight crime. If social welfare spending were
the answer to crime, the street corners of America would be far
and away the safest in the world. This approach has failed us
for the past 30 years, and will continue to fail. We in the states
need flexibility, we need to cover the costs of prison construction,
and we need the freedom to combat violent crime with the commonsense
methods our citizens demand.

VOL. 2 NO. 3 FALL 1994
<P>

<H3>Empower America Draws the Line on Health Care</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151; Empower America's goal in the health care
debate has been to defeat any health care reform plan that includes
individual or employer mandates, price caps or controls, standard
benefit packages, more government interference, or higher taxes.
<P>
Empower America advocates more sensible, targeted health care
reform and is promoting marketoriented reforms that include tax
breaks for individuals and the selfemployed; making insurance
affordable, accessible, and portable; instituting taxfree Medical
Savings Accounts; medical malpractice reform; and voluntary purchasing
pools.
<P>
Empower America has been advancing its health care goals on a
variety of fronts, including an aggressive advertising campaign,
an effort to mobilize members and numerous television and radio
appearances.
<P>
The advertising campaign consists of a widely shown television
commercial and a series of more targeted radio commercials. Using
an electrocardiogram on a black screen with audio of a normal
heartbeat, the television ad
states that President Clinton's plan would &quot;socialize our
health care&quot; system. The ad notes that small businesses will
be called upon to pay the bill for what amounts to &quot;the largest
government bureaucracy in history.&quot; As the text and the narrative
continue, the EKG and heartbeat steadily increase in speed and
severity, culminating in a flatline across the bottom of the screen
and a terminated heartbeat.
<P>
The impact of Empower America's television ad is best demonstrated
by the outcry from the White House and the Democratic party. The
administration and the Democratic National Committee have made
the following critical comments about Empower America's television
ad on health care.
<UL>
<LI>On May 21, White House advisor George Stephanopoulos appeared
on 
CNN's &quot;Capital Gang.&quot; A clip of Empower America's ad
was shown during this particular show. Stephanopoulos commented
that the ad was a &quot;scare tactic&quot; and that &quot;people
aren't going to buy it.&quot;
<LI>Democratic Media Consultant Mandy Grunwald called Empower
America's radio ads on health care &quot;partisan politics&quot;
in the Wall Street Journal on June 30. She went on to assert that
Empower America and The American Cause &quot;believe in doing
whatever they can to damage the president.&quot;
<LI>On a PBS panel discussion on July 18 addressing health
care advertising, Democratic National Committee
Communications Director Ed Lazarus called the Empower America
television ad the most irresponsible and offensive ad of the entire
health care debate. He characterized the ad as misleading and
called the use of the word &quot;socialize&quot; a scare tactic.
Lazarus went on to criticize Empower America for the negative
tone and the absence of an alternative solution to the health
care problem in the ad. At the same event, AARP Policy Director
John Rother and Health Care Reform Project's Bob Chlopak agreed
with Lazarus' assessment of Empower America's ad.
<LI>Also on July 18, Vin Weber appeared on PBS's &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer
News Hour&quot; along with the DNC's Ed Lazarus, the RNC's Chuck
Grecner,
 and Bob Chlopak of the Health Care Reform Project (a group closely
tied with and partially funded by the DNC) to discuss health care
advertising. Chlopak said the television ad was &quot;aimed at
inflaming public opinion...There are no facts, no documentation
in the ad.&quot;
<P>
In addition to the television ad, Empower America has run a series
of radio ads on health care reform. An ad advocating a delay on
health care legislation until after the November election aired
nationwide and two other ads, which quoted prominent Democrat
senators, played in targeted markets. One ad quoted Senator Jay
Rockefeller saying, &quot;We're going to push through health
care reform regardless of the views of the American people,&quot;
and the other quoted Senator Ted Kennedy speaking of health
care saying, &quot;We l want people to understand very quickly
what they are entitled to and what they're not entitled to.&quot;
<P>
Empower America began its first targeted  state ad campaign
in Nevada recently. Nevada was chosen because a 
majority of its Congressional delegation has expressed support
for the Clinton health care proposal. The television and radio
ads created a great deal of media attention in Nevada and nationwide.
The ads generated a significant grassroots campaign against the
health care position of Nevada ' s more liberal members of Congress.
Massachusetts soon followed and other states will be targeted
as the debate continues.
<P>
Empower America's ads have also been featured in news stories
by ABC News, CBS News, CNN's &quot;Inside Politics&quot; and &quot;Capital
Gang,&quot; PBS's &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour,&quot; <I>The Wall
Street Journal</I>, Associated Press, and dozens of other media outlets.

<H3>EMPOWER AMERICA IN THE NEWS</H3>
<P>
<I>In addition to coverage in the national media, Empower America
also generates substantial coverage in the local and regional
press. Here is a snapshot of recent news stories that discuss
Empower America:</I>
<P>
<DL>
<DT>&quot;Empower America, the conservative coalition founded by
Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber, has
hit the airwaves with their own ads, which warn that the
Clintons' plan would 'socialize our health care.' These ads reflect
the growlng opposition to anything that smacks of another entitlement
program. That is the last thing that our fragile economy and debt-ridden
government needs.&quot;
<DD><B><I>The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, </I>May 26, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;Empower America, a conservative political organization,
urged members of Congress to postpone final passage of any health
reforms until after the November elections. Its leaders, including
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Vin Weber, attacked the 'ttzggered'
requirement that employers pay for health insurance as 'merely
a rest stop on the road to socialized medicine.&quot;' 
<DD><B><I>The Ketchikan Daily News,</I>Ketchikan, AK, June 14, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;EMPOWER AMERICA CHOOSES NEVADA: Empower America (EA)
launched a TV and radio ad campaign in NV to oppose Clinton's
[health wcare] plan. The 60sec. ads are airing in Las Vegas and
Reno. 'Using an electrocardiogram on a black screen with audio
of a normal heartbeat,' the TV ad maintains Clinton's plan would
'socialize' the system. The radio ad 'urges Congress to postpone
health care legislation until next year.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>The Hotline; </I>American Political Network, July 13,
1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;Empower America criticized Mr. Clinton's plan as socialized
medicine and urged that the health care debate be delayed until
next year after the November election when Republicans stand a
good chance of making significant gains.&quot;

<DD><B><I>The New York Times, </I>July 12,1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;[William 1.] Bennett said that he prefers a [welfare] policy
that cuts off benefits for any illegitimate child born after a
certain date... 'If they know they will not get anything from
the government, people will have to change their behavior. The
real message is you should not have children...unless you are
able to support them.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>The Courier-Journal, </I>Louisville, KY, June 19, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;'This is classic Clinton [on welfare reform], except to
the nth degree: Overpromise, underdeliver, and then try to fudge
the difference, 'said William Bennett, former education secretary
and drug czar in Republican administrations who now heads an advocacy
group called Empower America. 'What we've got here is marginal
tinkering which will cost more money.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>Newsday,</I> New York, NY, June 15,1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;A leading spokesman for conservative ideas, Bennett thinks
the nation can still recover its triedandtrue social standards.
'This is America,' [William J.] Bennett says. 'You know the American
capacity for selfrenewal. Look at what we have overcome in 200
years: England, King George, slavery, the Great Depression, fascism,
communism. This country has a tremendous record of going up against
very tough things and prevailing. But this one's a little different
because it's internal. But you never count this country out.&quot;'
<DD><B><I>The Dispatch, </I>Cookeville, TN, April 24,1994</I>
<DT>Jack Kemp, Codirector of the think tank called Empower America,
and a hope for imbuing capitalism with compassion, reminds again
how the most vulnerable among us were hurt by a welfare system
that sent a destructive message that was indifferent to a moral
life. 'It is an exarnple of how the capital of the human spirit
can be squandered in the course of a few generations,' he said
in a recent call for cultural and spiritual renaissance.&quot;
<DD><B><I>The Morning Herald, </I>Hagerstown, MD, April 13,1994</B>

<P>

<H3>Empower America Continues the Fight for Real Welfare Reform</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151;At present, those pushing for welfare reform
in Washington must await the outcome of the health care debate,
and may have to wait until the next Congress to see any legislation
actually reach the House and Senate floors. Even so, the lines
of disagreement have been drawn during the 103rd Congress. The
benchmark for the debate was set by President Clinton during the
1992 campaign when he promised to &quot;end welfare as we know
it.&quot; Unfortunately, like many of his promises, this bold
statement has not been supported by any meaningful legislative
language from the White House.
<P>
Eighteen months into his administration, President Clinton introduced
his long awaited welfare reform plan. After capitu l lating to
the liberal special interests in the House of Representatives
(specifically the Congressional Black Caucus), Clinton unveiled
a plan draped in conservative rhetoric, but founded upon the proposition
that risking a rift between the White House and the liberal wing
in Congress would be too high of a price to pay in order to help
repair the societal damage being inflicted by the present welfare
system. The result of this capitulation is legislation that proposes
mere tinkering with the present system instead of true reform.
<P>
On the Republican side there is dis l agreement as well. As was
mentioned in the spring newsletter, Empower America
has helped lead the fight for legislation that will truly &quot;end
welfare as we know it.&quot; This means moving past the original
House Republican bill to a more ambitious bill. This approach
is embodied in the TalentFaircloth Welfare Reform Act of 1994.
The TalentFaircloth bill is based on three basic principles:
<UL>
<LI>Ending the subsidization of outofwedlock births;
<LI>Enhancing work requirements for individuals on welfare;
<LI>Controlling welfare spending.
</UL>
<P>
Although the Republican bill has some worthwhile provisions, it
does not take the bold steps found in the TalentFaircloth approach.
And while President Clinton gives lip service to the basic principles
found in the TalentFaircloth bill, his legislation violates all
of them.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Empower America effort on behalf of reform is continuing.
Empower America Codirector William Bennett has appeared at one
press conference on Capitol Hill to endorse the TalentFaircloth
bill, and at another press conference to decry the fraudulent
reform being proposed by the Clinton administration. In a USA
Today article, Bennett was quoted as saying &quot;the Clinton
proposal is a onehalf joke, onehalf fraud.&quot;
<P>
In addition to Dr. Bennett's many efforts, the policy division
of Empower America is lending its help to reformers 
such as Congressman James Talent and Senator Lauch Faircloth by
providing information to members of Congress as to the necessity
for dramatic reform. &quot;Many individuals on the Hill simply
don't understand the suffering being wrought by the current system,&quot;
says Peter Wehner, policy director for Empower America. &quot;We
are finding more members of Congress are willing to support the
TalentFaircloth bill once they are given all the facts.&quot;
<P>
Empower America will, according to Wehner, &quot;use all its resources
to help bring about real reform.&quot; The reason for Empower
America's tenacity is obvious&#151;the current welfare system
has wrought havoc on the American poor. After three decades of
welfare programs the nation is faced with an underclass that is
much larger, more violent, less educated and which consists of
an alarmingly high number of singleparent families. In short,
the system is destroying the American social fabric.
<P>
In addition to the TalentFaircloth legislation, Empower America
is supporting initiatives aimed at loosening the restrictions
on adoption (particuarly interracial adoptions), as well as initiatives
to bring economic development to the inner city through incentive
based programs. Hopefully, many in Congress will begin to see
the need for real reform and join in the fight to rescue our culture.
Until that happens, Empower America will stay on the front lines
of the fight.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA&#151;Empower America drew over 500 local activists
to its fifth regional conference, held in San Francisco, California,
on June 1, 1994. The regional conferences are designed to engage
conference participants in an open discussion with Empower America's
Codirectors William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and
Vin Weber.
<P>
The conference focused on the future of entitlements. Panel discussions
addressed different aspects of entitlement programs ranging from
the information superhighway, to welfare policy, to the current
debate over health care reform.
<P>
The first session covered America's newest entitlement, the information
superhighway and the direction of the current administration's
technology policy. Famed author and economist George Gilder advocated
free market alternatives to President Clinton's government managed
approach to developing information technologies. Other panelists
included Larry Ellison, Chairman of the Oracle Corporation and
Tom Hazlet, a professor at the University of California at Davis
who specializes in telecommunicadons policy. A lively discussion
followed panelists' presentations in which several conference
attendees shared frustrations with a governmentrun technology
policy.
<P>
Empower America Co director William Bennett led the discussion
on welfare reform from which several suggestions were offered
by both panelists and conference participants. Addressing the
status of the welfare system, BenneK told the grassroots activists,
&quot;The current system is a complete failure. We have spent
enormous sums over the past three decades on welfare programs
and what do we have to show for it?&quot;
<P>
Jack Kemp provided the luncheon 
address entitled, 'Yhe Assault on Personal Liberty: The Clinton
Administration and the Growth of Entitlement Programs.&quot; Addressing
the recent growth and creation of entitlement programs, Kemp said,
&quot;Government- not the entrepreneur- is the centerpiece
of the Clinton economic plan. The notion that government can guide
America to prosperity is the fundamental flaw that fuels Clinton's
belief that 'government must do more.' This is wrong- individuals
must do more. The future of American prosperity depends on whether
we can roll back government's interference in our lives and allow
the entrepreneurial spirit to flourish again.&quot;
<P>
The afternoon session, chaired by Empower America's Chairman of
the Board, Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., addressed health care reform.
Forbes opened the session by airing Empower America's latest health
care television commercial which criticizes President Clinton's
nationalized health care plan. Joining Mr. Forbes in the discussion
were health care policy experts Stuart Butler of the Heritage
Foundation, Merrill Matthews, Jr. of the National Center for Policy
Analysis and Sally Pipes of the Pacific Research Institute. Each
pol
icy expert stressed the need for free market health care reforms
as opposed to government managed proposals.
<P>
Forbes criticized the Clinton administration's assumption that
individuals can't be trusted to make sensible decisions about
health care and that the only solution is a government run system.
He advocated a new health care system based on private sector
decisions and reforms, such as tax incentives like medical taxfree
savings accounts. He emphasized that individual based plans have
eliminated health care inflation, and that individuals are very
capable of making free market decisions regarding their specific
coverage needs.
<P>
Empower America's regional conferences have served to unite grassroots
activists around the country in an effort to promote the conservative
agenda of limited government. The San Francisco conference received
national media attention which has helped Empower America deliver
its message to the American people. It is this message that; Empower
America will build upon as the'se issues are discussed during
the 1994 elections. For more information about Empower America's
upcoming events, call 1-800-4-EMPOWER.

<H3>Empower America Launches Candidate Schools</H3>
<i>Seminars in Atlanta, San Francisco, Detroit, New York and other
U.S. Cities To Teach 1000 Candidates How to Run and Win on the Empowerment
Agenda</i>
<P></CENTER>
ATLANTA, GA--More than 120 candidates and campaign managers gathered
in Atlanta, Georgia March 9, 1994 to attend Empower America's
Atlanta Candidate School, the third in a series of candidate training
seminars that the political advocacy group is holding this year
in cities across the United States. The schools are designed to
help teach candidates for local, state and national offices how
to run and win on the empowerment agenda.
<P>
Candidates for offices ranging from mayor and state legislator,
to Governor, Congressman and U.S. Senator, gathered at the Atlanta
Hilton and Towers to meet with Empower America's distinguished
faculty of policy experts, elected officials and campaign consultants.
Instead of discussing campaign management, fundraising and &quot;get-out-the-vote&quot;
techniques, they attended panels on the elements of effective
welfare, education, crime and health care reform policies, and
the importance of economic growth, free trade and lower taxes.
<P>
&quot;Our schools are unique,&quot; said Empower America Vice
Chairman Vin Weber, who is heading up the candidate schools program,
&quot;because unlike most traditional candidate schools, which
teach the 'nuts and bolts' of campaigning, Empower America's schools
are focused on ideas and issues. We are teaching candidates how
to campaign effectively on the empowerment message.&quot;
<P>
The Atlanta school followed two schools hid earlier this year,
in Washington, DC on January 11th, and at Stanford University
on February 17th. Empower America will be holding candidate seminars
in cities such as Detroit, Denver, New York and a second school
in Washington, D.C.
<P>
&quot;By the time the 1994 elections come around, we expect that
some 1000 candidates for local, state and national office will
have attended our schools,&quot; said Weber. &quot;We are essentially
working with the next generation of public officials, building
a cadre of new political leaders who share our belief in the empowerment
agenda, and who will help us turn those ideas into real public
policies at all levels of government.&quot;
<P>
The Atlanta school opened with a panel discussion on economic
growth and empowerment. Mayor Tom Fetzer of Raleigh, North Carolina
discussed the growing movement towards privatization and individual
empowerment in America's inner cities. &quot;From Raleigh to Jersey
City to Indianapolis, a whole new generation of leaders is rising,&quot;
Fetzer said. &quot;These leaders represent a political view that
emphasizes the empowerment of people over government and families
and communities over spending and programs.&quot;
<P>
At lunch, Empower America Co-Director Bill Bennett suggested that
candidates for all offices emphasize a message that focuses on
returning power to people and private institutions, not on government
solutions. Cultural renewal, Bennett said, &quot;has to do with
what comes out of TV and the radio, it has to do with the composition
of families, it has to do with the health and well-being of schools,
neighborhood institutions, communities, churches and the like.
If the country is to get better, to improve, it will depend much
more on the health of those institutions than it will on the things
that government does.&quot;
<P>
Ed Goeas, President of the Tarrance Group, a leading national
potting firm, told candidates that his recent studies indicate
that &quot;the American public wants change, and they want change
that is reasonable and rational. Policies which encourage real
welfare reform, real change in education, real economic growth,
and real reductions in crime comprise the real winning platform
for 1994, 1996, and beyond.&quot;
<P>
The earlier schools drew an equally stellar faculty and were also
heavily attended. At the Washington, DC school, for example, more
than 170 candidates and campaign workers from 31 states and American
Samoa participated in panel discussions featuring House Minority
Whip Newt Gingrich, Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City, New Jersey,
former Attorney General William Barr, former Chief of Staff to
Vice President Quayle, Bill Kristol, and Empower America's William
Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber. At the San Francisco
area school, more than 100 candidates participated in a program
highlighted by an address from Dr. Edward Tetter, former director
of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the &quot;father&quot;
of the H-Bomb.
<P>
During his luncheon speech, Teller urged the candidates not to
shy away from foreign policy as a campaign issue: &quot;I don't
think I need to tell you of President Clinton's mistakes in the
realm of foreign policy. In the former Soviet Union, in Yugoslavia,
in Somalia, in North Korea, in Haiti, in every continent with
the possible exception of Australia, there have been mistakes.
These mistakes should indeed be discussed because of the widespread
belief that people will vote on the economy, on family values,
and not on foreign affairs.&quot;
<P>
All candidates who attend the Candidate Schools receive Empower
America's &quot;Candidate Briefing Book,&quot; with detailed chapters
on each of the issue areas discussed at the schools. Throughout
the course of their campaigns, candidates will also receive, by
mail and fax, &quot;94 Issue Briefs,&quot; expanding on the chapters
in their briefing books, &quot;Urgent Updates&quot; giving them
information on breaking issues that might be of importance to
their campaigns, and packets of material giving them more information
on the hot issues of the 1994 campaign cycle.
<P>
Candidates or campaign managers interested in attending upcoming
candidate schools should write to: Candidate Schools (Attn: David
Kuo), Empower America, 17761 Street, NW, Suite 890, Washington,
DC 20006.

<P>
<H3>Kemp, Bennett, Weber Call GOP Welfare Bill &quot;Too Soft&quot;
Urge Republicans to Unite Behind More Aggressive Reforms</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--In a move that drew wide attention in the media
and on Capitol Hill, Empower America Co-Directors Jack Kemp, William
Bennett and Vin Weber issued a memorandum April 14th, in which
they criticized the welfare reform bill backed by House Republican
leaders, and urged them to scrap the current plan and replace
it with a &quot;bold, principled and fundamentally different alternative.&quot;
<P>
The Empower America memo, released to coincide with a meeting
of GOP lawmakers to discuss their welfare reform package, sparked
coverage in several major newspapers, including The New York Times,
The Washington Times and several dozen regional dailies. In it,
the Empower America Co-Directors argued that the House Republican
bill &quot;falls short in three important areas: It contains no
serious attempt to curtail out-of-wedlock births, its work requirements
are weak, (and) its hidden costs are exorbitant.&quot;
<P>
According to Kemp, Bennett and Weber, welfare is illegitimacy's
&quot;economic lifeline.&quot; They argue that &quot;direct welfare
payments that subsidize illegitimacy must cad,&quot; and recommend
that &quot;beginning a year after the enactment of legislation,
women under 21 who have children out-of-wedlock ... be ineligible
for direct welfare payments.&quot; They also called for ending
benefit increases to women who have more children while on welfare.
<P>
In an interview with The Washington Times, Kemp stated that Republican
leaders must &quot;recognize that there has to be a more dramatic
effort at welfare reform if we are to end welfare as we know it--a
socialist, Third World trap permanently subsidizing dependency.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It would be irresponsible and politically unwise for Republicans
to assist the President in perpetuating welfare reform that is
too costly and too soft on illegitimacy and work requirements,&quot;
he said.
<P>
&quot;The central issue is people having babies out of wedlock,&quot;
said Bennett, in an interview with the Associated Press. &quot;Babies
are coming into this world with no fathers and ill-prepared mothers.
It adds to the welfare rolls, education problems and criminal
problems. It adds to the social breakdown of this country. We
have seen enough of the carnage, the cruelty, the 19 kids living
in the (Chicago) tenement, the babies left in dumpsters.&quot;
<P>
Asked what the goal of the Republican alternative legislation
should be, Weber, a retired Member of Congress and former House
GOP Conference Secretary, said that Republicans should frame their
welfare reform plan in a way that &quot;stops President Clinton
from passing a phony welfare proposal that sounds tough, but really
does nothing to bring about fundamental reform.&quot; The GOP
leadership, Weber said, must &quot;prevent passage of a bad welfare
reform package by using their plan to show just how bad the Clinton
bill is, and to force improvement.

<H3>Empower America Economic Summit Findings: Jobs Deficit Is Nation's No. 1 Economic Problem</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--America's number one economic problem is not the
budget deficit, but the nation's 5.4 million jobs deficit, according
to testimony delivered at Empower America's recent national economic
summit. Held in Washington, DC, December 14, 1994 exactly one
year after President Clinton's Little Rock Economic Summit, the
Empower America meeting brought together some of the nation's
leading economists, entrepreneurs and business leaders to assess
the state of the economy one year into the Clinton Administration,
and to develop pro-growth alternatives to Clintonomics. The goal
of the economic conference was to assess past and present economic
policies, and to propose an alternative growth plan for the economy.
<P>
In his presentation, Lawrence Kudlow, a noted economist and Empower
America board member, argued that ever since Congress voted to
raise the tax on capital gains from 20 percent to 28 percent in
1986, our nation's economic growth has fallen dramatically below
historic trendlines. This has cost America 1.3 million new businesses,
and has created a 5.4 million jobs deficit--the difference between
the jobs that should have been created and those that actually
were.
<P>
This jobs deficit is being created, according to testimony given
during the conference, because the largest job creator in the
country--the American entrepreneur--has been under continual assault
in the 1990's from higher taxes, more government red tape, and
diminishing incentives to risk-taking.
<P>
Chief among the problems with &quot;Clintonomics&quot; identified
at the conference is the Clinton Administration's core belief
that government is the most important actor in the economy. The
risk-taking entrepreneur is the most important actor in the economy,
argued Kudlow, not government. &quot;Far more important is the
individual man or woman, driven by a dream or an idea--the person
who is willing to sacrifice everything, to mortgage the home or
borrow from the family, friends and neighbors to start a new business.
So any true economic growth model must place the individual, the
investor and the entrepreneur at the center of the economic equation.&quot;
Kudlow said.
<P>
Kudlow argued that a direct link exists between several critical
economic policy mistakes and the plunge in entrepreneurial activity
in the country over the past eight years. The policies that have
caused this decline in job creation, which he compiled into a
list called &quot;The Assault on Capital Formation &amp; Growth,&quot;
include:
<P>
<ul>
<li> 1986 Capital Gains Tax Hike (20% to 28%),
<P>
<li> 1986-90 Social Security Payroll Tax Hikes (14.1% to 15.3%)
<P>
<li> 1989-91 Regulatory Reign of Terror owl bank credit
<P>
<li> 1990 Tax Bill
<P>
- Income tax hike (28% to 31%) and temporary phaseout of itemized
deductions and personal exemptions
<P>
- Alternative Minimum Tax hike (to 24&#162;)
<P>
- Luxury and business tax hikes
<P>
<li> 1991-1992 Regulatory Mandates
<P>
- Clean Air, Americans with Disabilities, and Civil Rights Acts
<P>
<li> 1993 Tax Bill
<P>
- Income tax hike (31% to 39.6%) and permanent phaseout of itemized
deductions and personal exemptions - Medicare tax cap eliminated
(2.9% tax rate) - Corporate tax hike (34% to 35%) and other business
tax hikes including entertainment deduction limits from 80% to
50%) - Other tax hikes: Alternative Minimum I Tax (24% to 28%),
Gas Tax Hike, Taxation of Social Security income.
</ul>
<P>
As a result of these higher taxes, business start-ups since 1986
have dropped dramatically below the historic trend costing millions
of jobs (see accompanying chart). According to Kudlow, &quot;When
taxes were low in the 1980's, we surged above the (historic) trendline
for business startups. Since 1986, as capital was taxed and incentives
diminished, we've fallen sharply below the trend, creating a 1.6
million business start-up deficit&quot; and the 5.4 million new
jobs that should have been created, but never were. Kudlow argued
that if the U.S. continues to &quot;strangle entrepreneurial activity,
America will find itself with European-like economic stagnation
and rising unemployment.&quot;
<P>
Also addressing the conference were Empower America Co-Director
Jack Kemp, Empower America board member Malcolm S. Forbes, Ir.,
and House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-GA), who argued that
closing this jobs deficit required the creation of entrepreneurial
incentives through lower taxes on capital investments and income.
Gingrich took the Clinton health care plan to task, arguing that
the Clinton plan is an anti-capitalist proposal &quot;designed
to seize control of the health system and centralize power in
Washington.&quot;
<P>
The conference was aired live, gavel-to-gavel, by C-SPAN and covered
by both CNN and CBS, which broadcast Empower America's message
to millions of viewers across the nation. It was also covered
in 167 newspapers in 37 states, reaching well over 10 million
people. Since the conference, Empower America has been flooded
with requests for transcripts and videos of the event. To accommodate
this demand, Empower America has made available a 60 minute video
presentation covering the conference.

<H3>Simon &amp; Schuster Publishes Bennett's Index of Leading Cultural Indicators</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--With the tremendous response last year to Empower
America Co-Director William Bennett's release of his Index of
Leading Cultural Indicators, Simon &amp; Schuster has released
the ground breaking study of our culture in book form. The new
book, published under the Touchstone Books insignia, is a significantly
enhanced version of the original Index, with new and updated data
on a wide range of cultural indicators.
<P>
The new Index is the most comprehensive statistical portrait available
of social and behavioral trends over the last 30 years. It consists
of five chapters: Crime; Family and Children; Youth Pathologies
and Behavior, Education; Popular Culture and Religion; along with
appendices on social spending and various economic indicators.
The cultural index is based on the government's &quot;Index of
Leading Economic Indicators,&quot; a set of statistics which track
the health of the nation's economy. The Index of Leading Cultural
Indicators is designed to provide a similar window into the state
of our nation's cultural health.
<P>
Unlike the first edition of the Index, this edition contains extensive
factual analysis of our current cultural condition, with commentaries
by experts and commissions that interpret and provide perspective
on the raw data.
<P>
Among the key findings: Over the past three decades there has
been a 560 percent rise in violent crime, a 400-plus percent increase
in illegitimate births, a quadrupling of divorce rates, a tripling
of the percentage of teenagers living in poverty.

<H3>Recent Visitors to Empower America:  Dr. Edward Teller, Father of H-Bomb, Criticizes Clinton-Gore Defense, Technology Policies</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--Dr. Edward Teller, father of the H-Bomb and one
of this century's greatest minds, visited Empower America, March
29, 1994 to meet with Empower America's staff and offer his perspective
on the Clinton administration's defense and technology policies.
America, Teller warned, is in a critical state of transition,
and the current administration is making serious policy mistakes
that he-said &quot;could lead to-very great trouble ... (and)
must be corrected &quot;
<P>
Teller specifically criticized Vice President Gore, who has taken
the lead in the administration on technology issues. Teller said
that Gore has been moving America from being a &quot;progressive
country&quot; into a &quot;reactionary country&quot; in terms
of its receptivity to new technologies.
<P>
&quot;When I came to this country in 1935 everything new was good,&quot;
Teller remarked.
<P>
&quot;Now everything new is under suspicion.&quot; As an example,
Teller cited the Clinton administration's gutting of the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI). &quot;The Strategic Defense Initiative
is new and is good,&quot; Teller said. &quot;I don't see any argument
that would say otherwise. But in the book of Al Gore, SDI is a
form of aggression.&quot;
<P>
Teller argued that, with the rapid spread of technology throughout
the world, America's era of isolation and invulnerability is over.
&quot;America is no longer isolated. America today is as vulnerable
as Poland was at the outbreak of the Second World War, or even
more vulnerable.... Today Iran or Iraq could put a missile loaded
with biological material on a ship and deliver it from a distance
of ten miles to New York or Los Angles and actually kill 50 thousand
people,&quot; Teller said.
<P>
Teller further added that, while the danger of attack from small
hostile powers which are rapidly acquiring nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, is less awesome than that once posed by the
Soviet Union, it is also much more likely to occur. The danger
today, Teller said, is &quot;not as terrible as the danger (was)
from the threat of the Soviet Union during the Cold War --that
was a much bigger but much less probable danger. Now we have dangers
that are smaller but more probable.&quot;
<P>
But Teller argued that, despite the dangers posed by rapidly expanding
access to technology, government should not try to stop or interfere
with the progress of technology. &quot;We scientists are responsible
to find the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so far as we can; including potentialities, what can be done,
and how to use it,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not to be determined
by any elite, not by the religious community, not by the scientific
community and not by the political community, except to the extent
that the political community is an honest representative of the
people.&quot;
<P>
In fact, Teller expressed his support for the &quot;very widespread,
very thorough declassification of information&quot; which the
Clinton administration has recently proposed, because he said
that this declassification would encourage public understanding.
Public understanding, he said, is the only way to combat fear.
<P>
But he also emphasized the potential dangers of such declassification,
and cautioned that it not be misused. &quot;While general principles
and ideas can't be kept secret,&quot; he added, &quot;detailed
blue-prints and precise weapons procedures can be kept secret
and in some cases they should be.&quot; Limited access to this
information does not interfere with increasing public understanding,
he explained.
<P>
Teller said that instead of teaching people to fear technology,
or controlling technological advances, government should harness
technology to protect us. The United States, he insisted, must
use the technological know-how at its disposal to develop defenses
aimed at protecting the lives of its citizens.

<H3>Empower America Interview: David Kay Former Chief of U.N. Nuclear Inspection Team in Iraq Discusses North Korea,Emerging Threats to American Security</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

In 1991, following the United States' successful prosecution of
the Persian Gulf War, the United Nations sent a team of nuclear
arms inspectors to Iraq to enforce Saddam Hussein's compliance
with the terms of surrender and supervise the dismantling of Iraq's
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs. What the U.N.
team found was horrifying--unbeknownst to the West, Iraq was less
than 18 months away from &quot;going nuclear.&quot; For the next
several months, Iraq played a cat-and-mouse game with the U.N.,
trying to hide and preserve as much of its nuclear capability
as possible.
<P>
David Kay led the U.N. team that discovered Iraq's nuclear program,
and stood down Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard when they tried
to forcibly prevent him from bringing proof of that program to
international attention. An eminent authority on nuclear proliferation
and national security issues, David Kay recently spoke to Empower
America about the current nuclear stand-off with North Korea and
the new threats to American security emerging in the post-Cold
War world.
<P>
Empower America: The conventional wisdom today seems to be that,
with the Soviet threat gone, America will face no major threats
to its national security in me foreseeable future. Do you agree?
If not, what are the emerging threats to our security in the post-Cold
War world?
<P>
David Kay: No, I do not agree. While the Cold War held the potential
for the destruction of our society as we know it --and we are
clearly better for its end-- the Soviets and the U.S. also had
forty years to learn to manage the Cold War in ways that limited
the likelihood of direct nuclear conflict. Today we are witnessing
the emergence of states and groups that are quite unrestrained
in their hostility to the West and willing to run what to most
Americans must seem like irrational risks to advance their interests.
Saddam Hussein's massive miscalculation in the Gulf and North-Korea's
dash for nuclear arms are but two examples of this new development.
<P>
The United States now towers above all others as the only state
in the world with the power to restrain the lust for domination
of renegade states and radical ethnic movements. It is inevitable
that these states will seek to threaten us and diminish our willingness
to stand in the way of their ambitions. Further, even under the
best of circumstances, the vast Soviet nuclear arsenal will take
more than twenty years to dismantle. In the worst of circumstances
some of the former Soviet nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
could well leak into the hands of states and groups hostile to
the U.S. or become the tools of a resurgent Russian dictatorship.
<P>
EA: How soon do you believe it will be before hostile states like
Iran and North Korea are able to directly threaten the continental
U.S. with nuclear or biological weapons?
<P>
DK: North Korea probably already has the capability to threaten
the U.S. with the terrorist use of biological weapons. Biological
weapons have undergone a largely unpublicized revolution in their
lethality and ease of production, and the Director of the CIA
has recently testified that two dozen states have active biological
weapons programs. North Korea's long range missile program is
surging ahead at a rate well ahead of estimates of only two years
ago. I would not be surprised to see North Korea, particularly
if its missile program is assisted by unemployed Russian experts,
able to field an intercontinental missile that could strike the
United States during the mid-part of the next decade. Well before
then it will be able to threaten U.S. bases in Japan and Guam.
Cruise missile technology provides an even easier path than intercontinental
missiles to reach the continental U.S. from ships off our coast,
and this threat will almost certainly be with us by the end of
this decade. The Iranians have already benefited from North Korean
military expertise, and it is reasonable to assume that North
Korea will continue to sell weapons and technology to all bidders.
<P>
EA: What can the U S. do to prepare for this eventuality? Where
should we be directing our resources today, in terms of defense
and intelligence spending?
<P>
DK: First, every effort should be made to slow and disrupt the
advanced weapons programs and cooperation between states such
as North Korea and Iran. While general export controls of the
type that were applied against the Soviet Union during the height
of the Cold War are no longer practical, it is possible to maintain
highly targeted controls on exports and technology assistance
against rogue states such as these. We should do this and be sure
that our allies and states such as China and Russia that want
to benefit from Western trade and assistance do so as well.
<P>
Second, we must develop the capability and political will to destroy
their leadership and political society if they threaten their
neighbors. While we are rightfully proud of the accomplishments
of the coalition military forces in the Gulf, the fact is that
poor intelligence and the lack of suitable weapons for penetrating
deep underground bunkers allowed much of Iraq's military might
to escape attack.
<P>
And finally, we must develop a credible defense capacity able
to handle the most likely threats to American forces abroad and
our people at home. By the end of the decade, we must either have
a workable cruise missile defense and the ability to intercept
a small number of long range missiles aimed at the continental
U.S. or be prepared to accept intimidating military threats to
our society.
<P>
EA: What is at stake with the crisis In North Korea today? Why
should Americans be concerned about North Korea's nuclear program,
and why is it In our national interest to stop it?
<P>
DK: Without a doubt the most dangerous place in the world today
is the Korean peninsula. Within 60 miles on each side of the Demilitarized
Zone (DMZ) that marked the end of the Korean War, approximately
37,000 American troops, 600,000 South Korean and upwards of one
million North Korea troops face each other. The North Korean regime
of aging Kim Il-Sung and his son, Kim Jong-II, rule over an impoverished,
isolated relic of Communism which, if it were not for its military
might and its craftily constructed Image of unpredictability and
irrationality could be ignored until it collapsed into the footnotes
of history.
<P>
But the military might of North Korea is real. Its army is equipped
with Russian, Chinese and Korean-improved armaments that make
up in sheer numbers what they may lack in Gulf War-type quality
and precision. It also fields a battlefield rocket force capable
of reigning, with almost no warning, terror on the South's capital
of Seoul and U.S. bases in the South. Its recent testing of the
Rodong I missile with a range of at least 600 miles now brings
large areas of Japan into range. And most frightening of all,
the U.S. intelligence community is widely reported to have concluded that North Korea has deployed one or two nuclear devices from plutonium
illegally diverted from its IAEA safeguarded reactors. So nuclear
arms must now be added to the regime's armory of chemical and
biological weapons of mass destruction.
<P>
Beyond the fate of South Korea lies the reaction of other Asian
states who have grown used to leaving to the U.S. the management
of regional security concerns. The Japanese may well view the
outcome of a U.S. policy that leaves them to live with a North
Korean bomb as just the opening move in the inevitable retreat
of U.S. power and political influence from Asia. Allowing North
Korea to cheat its way into possession of nuclear weapons could
easily bring an end to this stability and open the way to a less
safe, less open Asia. In this case, foreign policy does matter
even if you believe, &quot;it's the economy, stupid.&quot;
<P>
EA: What is your assessment of the Clinton Administration's approach
to the crisis in North Korea thus far? Is the U.S. approach today
making a conflict more, or less likely' What should the Administration
be doing differently?
<P>
DK: North Korea's nuclear bomb program has faced this Administration
with a set of circumstances that must seem to them depressingly
familiar:
<ul>
<li> Presidential rhetoric has set out a policy that on reflection
the Administration has neither the will nor the ability to implement
and now must find a way to abandon.
<P>
<li> US allies are unwilling to support the announced position of
the President.
<P>
<li> The existing intelligence committee and military capabilities
inherited from the Cold War are inadequate to either implement
the President's policy or to cope with the failure to implement
it.
<P>
<li> Even the best of what are now viewed as possible outcomes, leaves
the US hostage to the actions of irrational, unpredictable leaders
of a regime that has demonstrated implacable hostility to our
ally, South Korea, and to the U.S.
</ul>
<P>
But the allocation of blame should be the least of our concerns
now. There are three important steps that must be taken soon to
ensure that the least possible damage results from the situation:
<P>
First, the U.S. decision must clearly convey to North Korea that
any use by them of weapons of mass destruction, whether they be
chemical, biological or nuclear, would immediately result in the
annihilation of their society. If this is not to be dismissed
as just more overheated U.S. rhetoric then the forces that would
implement this policy must be visibly put in place. If we are
going to have to learn to live with a North Korean bomb, then
we must make it clear to the North Koreans that the use of any
of their arsenal-of weapons of mass destruction would mean the
end of the history of their political leadership. To live with
a North Korean bomb is to live with a regime that has cheated
and won. We will discover that the task of ensuring that victory
does not feed the North Korean appetite requires a toughness of
policy and resolution that has not yet been seen in Washington.
<P>
Second, the inadequacies in U.S. intelligence and military posture
which left the Administration with only a series of bad options
for eliminating the North Korean program must be put right. Proliferation
has already occurred, and North Korea will not be the last case.
The highest priority must be finding effective defensive measures.
As the Administration has discovered, it is impossible to build
a coalition in favor of standing up to a nuclear cheat when the
cost of doing so involves the destruction of one's own country.
Unless we can provide our forces and our allies with meaningful
defenses against missiles and aircraft, the prospect of controlling
proliferation will become much more difficult.
<P>
Third, we must make it clear that North Korea will not be allowed
to export its military technology to others. If North Korea will
not accept effective international inspection and controls on
its nuclear program (and this seems clearly unlikely), and if
the Administration is unwilling to run the risk of a war on the
Korean peninsula to eliminate the North's nuclear capability (and
this seems clear despite occasional Presidential rhetoric to the
contrary), then it is incumbent that we and our allies use our
individual and collective rights to ensure that all of the North's
attempts to export this capability are interdicted.
<P>
EA: You led the weapons inspection effort in Iraq after the Gulf
war which uncovered Saddam Hussein's advanced nuclear program.
What lessons can you draw from your experience in Iraq for how
the Administration should approach North Korea?
<P>
DK: The clearest lesson from Iraq is that the world is better
off to intervene before a rogue state acquires a nuclear capability
than to deal with such a state after it has acquired even a crude
nuclear capability. Korea is in many ways a tougher case than
Iraq. The North is capable of inflicting truly horrible damage
on South Korea with little or no warning. Our closest ally in
the region, Japan, can now be reached by missiles from the North.
While our ability to make the North pay a high price for any such
attack remains, we have little if any ability to truly defend
against such a blow and prevent massive damage to allies and significant
American casualties. Korea, like Saddam's Iraq is a revolutionary
state bent upon overturning the regional order. It is wrong to
assume that we share common objectives with such states and that
more or better negotiations will lead to an acceptable solution
that will provide long-term stability. North Korea under its present
leadership will not play a constructive part in a stable and prosperous
Asia. Our policy should be directed toward containing the destructive
forces of North Korea while waiting for the inherent destructive
forces of the failed regime to bring about its own collapse.
<P>
EA: Can the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
be stopped, or is their proliferation inevitable?
<P>
DK: Every effort should be made to limit the further spread of
these weapons. But regardless of how vigorous such efforts are,
I believe that further significant proliferation is inevitable.
It is therefore vitally important to ensure that U.S. forces and
our allies are able to defend themselves against the use of such
weapons. We must make clear to any rogue state that the United
States cannot be intimidated from protecting its vital interests
by their possession or use of such weapons. If these states come
to believe --and this is the long-range danger of the situation
in North Korea--that nuclear, chemical or biological weapons would
stop the U.S. from protecting our allies and our own interests,
then the forces of proliferation would become unstoppable. The
most effective nonproliferation policy would be rooted in a vigorous
U.S. military capability to operate and advance our foreign policy
objectives in the face of such weapons.

<H3>Kudlow, Shelton, Coulter Join Empower America Board</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--Empower America announced that two of the nation's
most respected economists, Lawrence Kudlow and Judy Shelton, and
one of America's leading entrepreneurs, Jamie Coulter, have joined
the organization's Board of Directors.
<P>
Mr. Kudlow, former Chief Economist with Bear Stearns, served as
Associate Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
in President Reagan's first term, and was one of the principal
architects of the Reagan Administration's economic and budget
policy. Most recently, Mr. Kudlow served as Co-Chairman of the
Economic Recovery Council in New Jersey Governor Christine Todd
Whitman's election campaign, where he co-developed the tax cut
plan that helped Whitman win the 1993 race against incumbent Governor
Jim Florio.
<P>
Dr. Shelton is currently a Senior Research Fellow at the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University, and is one of the nation's
foremost experts on international monetary, financial and economic
policy. She is the author of several highly-acclaimed books, including
1989's prophetic The Coming Soviet Crash (which was translated
into German and Italian), and the forthcoming Money Meltdown,
to be published by the Free Press in April of 1994.
<P>
Mr. Coulter, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of
Lonestar Steakhouse and Saloon, Inc. since 1992, is one of the
nation's most successful entrepreneurs.
<P>
He has been responsible for developing and operating more than
250 restaurants throughout the United States. And, under the umbrella
of companies he controls, more than 8,000 people are employed
in 30 states. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors
of the Young Presidents Organization, Chairman of the Venice International
University of Leadership, and as a Member of the Board of Advisors
of the Wichita State University Center for Entrepreneurship.
<P>
&quot;Larry Kudlow, Judy Shelton and Jamie Coulter bring a wealth
of experience to Empower America,&quot; said Chairman Malcolm
S. Forbes, Jr. &quot;They will play a crucial role in helping
us develop progrowth alternatives to the Clinton economic agenda,
and to champion policies that encourage entrepreneurship, create
jobs and expand opportunity for all Americans.&quot;

<H3>Following Washington State Vote, &quot;Three Strikes, You're
Out&quot; Initiatives Gaining National Attention</H3>
<i>Empower America Was Early Supporter of the Innovative Anti-Crime Proposal</i>
</CENTER>
<p>


WASHINGTON, D C - Last November, when voters in Washington state
passed Prop. 593, the &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; and-crime
initiative, they had no idea they were starting a national movement.
But since the historic vote, in which the ground-breaking initiative
won by a margin of more than 3-to-1, versions of the Washington
state &quot;Three Strikes&quot; law have been proposed across
the country, at both the federal and state level, drawing support
from both Democrats and Republicans alike.
<P>
Empower America was one of the earliest active supporters of the
Three Strikes idea, which would place criminals convicted of their
third violent felony in jail for life, no chance of parole. Co-Director
William Bennett -- campaigned in Washington state on behalf of
the initiative, making public appearances, publishing op-eds in
favor of the proposal, conducting interviews with local media
and preparing taped radio &quot;actualities&quot; supporting the
initiative. &quot;When this thing passes,&quot; Bennett argued
during the campaign, &quot;a lot of other states are going to
do the same thing. We do not have a health crisis in this country.
We do have a violent crime crisis.&quot;
<P>
Bennett's prediction has come to pass. Since Washington state
passed Three Strikes in November, legislation has been introduced
in Washington, DC, and as many as thirty states are considering
Three Strikes proposals. An initiative process is underway in
California to place a Three Strikes measure on the 1994 ballot;
legislation was passed last March in California to require a life
prison term with no chance of parole for 25 years for third-time
felons convicted of two violent crimes. Governor Mario Cuomo (D-NY)
has indicated support for legislation involving Three Strikes-type
provisions, and even President Clinton stated his support for
Three Strikes measures for federal crimes during his State of
the Union address this January. Some leaders, such as Gov. Zell
Miller (D-GA), have even claimed that three strikes are too many.
Miller has called for a two strikes and life law.
<P>
The Three Strikes law is intended to target the small group of
repeat offenders who commit the vast majority of violent crimes.
Studies indicate that less than 10 percent of all criminals commit
some two-thirds of all crimes.
<P>
The popularity of the Three Strikes proposal stems from the growing
concern many Americans have about the safety of their communities.
Recent national polls have shown that Americans consider crime
the number one issue facing the country, and politicians have
responded to this sentiment by proposing a number of &quot;tough
on crime&quot; initiatives, both in Washington, DC and in the
states. In addition to the various Three Strikes proposals, both
Florida and Oregon are gathering signatures to put initiatives
on the 1994 ballot which have truth in sentencing provisions prohibiting
the early release of prisoners. The Florida initiative would ensure
that prisoners serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.
<P>
Critics of Three Strikes proposals raise the cost of incarceration
as an issue. But while the average annual cost to incarcerate
an inmate is $25,000, the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates
that the average annual cost to society of allowing a career criminal
to roam free is $430,000. Thus, the costs of keeping criminals
on the streets and out of prison is much more significant than
the cost of keeping them in prison.
<P>
Critics also cite the discrepancy in the severity of crimes covered
by the law. The initiative passed in Washington state includes
40 crimes as violent crimes, a list which some view as too long.
Critics also argue that the Washington law does not provide rules
to prove Three Strikes, an omission which is likely to set off
a Constitutional challenge.
<P>
Whatever the outcome, the Three Strikes idea has gained significant
popular support in the current and-crime climate. Three Strikes
proposals signify a tough, realistic approach to crime and get
multiple offenders off the streets and into prison where they
belong.

<H3>Issue Briefing</H3>

<p>
<b>The Clinton Health Care Plan: The Making of a Crisis</b>
<P>
There is an emerging consensus that the current health care debate
is perhaps the most consequential domestic public policy debate
in recent American history. The stakes are so high because of
what the 1,364 page Health Security Act, reduced to its essence,
represents: a power-grab by the federal government that is unprecedented
in its scope, its dimensions and its political ambition.
<P>
As the health care debate proceeds, it is important that we establish
a clear concept of what constitutes (and what does not constitute)
real victory by advocates of responsible health care reform. We
believe, for example, that the defeat of the Clinton health care
plan would be an unambiguously good thing. But we also believe
that the passage of a modified version of the plan or an &quot;alternative&quot;
plan which accepts many of the flawed premises of the Clinton
plan--the Chafee plan and the Cooper-Grandy proposal come immediately
to mind--is unacceptable because they, too, would inflict real
long-term damage on the country. In sum: many of the &quot;alternatives&quot;
to the Administration's health care proposals are merely distinctions
without essential philosophical differences. Their passage would
result in a ratcheting leftward--a steady, incremental march toward
statism and collectivism. And so they, too, need to be opposed.
<P>
The good news is that a thoughtful, humane, and essentially conservative
reform of the health care system is now within the realm of legislative
possibility. Opponents of the Clinton plan should therefore resist
the calls for premature capitulation or accommodation and build
on the momentum for intelligent reform. At the same time, we need
to provide a coherent philosophical framework by which to judge
various proposals--to better establish in the public mind what
we believe should be central, and what we believe is unacceptable,
to any health care reform. . .
<P>
<b>Crime and Punishment in America</b><P>
...Crime is one of the most important issues facing America. Government's
first responsibility is the protection of its citizens from &quot;all
enemies, foreign and domestic.&quot; Those who terrorize the lives
of law abiding citizens are, by any measure, enemies; citizens
deserve protection against them. Unfortunately, under our current
system, crime often pays; high crime rates reflect this. The odds
need to be changed back in society's favor.
<P>
The Solution: Incarcerate prisoners, build more prisons and correctional
institutions, enforce prison sentences, increase the police force,
focus on juvenile crime, reduce illegitimacy...
<P>
<b>School Choice</b>
<P>
...The current system is harmful to students and undermines parental
authority. The American people sense this: more than 70 percent
of Americans support school voucher systems, and as of 1992, thirty-four
states had some form of choice legislation pending or introduced.
Increasingly, even teachers and education bureaucrats lack faith
in the system they defend--22 percent send their children to private
schools, for example, and the number is far higher in urban school
districts. The widespread support for school choice is part of
the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
School vouchers would provide all parents--regardless of income
level--with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child. If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher will
simply stay with that school. If they are not, parents now have
a choice --they can send their child elsewhere, to another public
school, or to a private or religious school. This is the same
concept we use in higher education; students can use government
grants and loans to attend the University of Indiana, or Notre
Dame, or Yeshiva University...
<P>
<b>Clinton's SDI Cuts imperil America</b>
<P>
(Prepared exclusively for Empower America by Henry F. Cooper,
former Chief Negotiator at the Geneva Defense and Space Talks
and the first civilian SDI Director)
<P>
...In 10 years with $30 billion, the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) made dramatic technical advances enabling the deployment
of systems to protect the United States, our troops abroad, and
our friends and allies from ballistic missile attack. The 1991
Gulf War demonstrated the importance of defending civilians against
missile attack, and Congress directed that advanced defenses be
developed for deployment as soon as technology permitted. The
Bush administration left a fully funded plan, approved by a comprehensive
Pentagon acquisition review, with options to deploy advanced defenses
for our troops, friends and allies as early as 1996 and for the
American homeland as early as 1999. After Clinton's first year,
what remains is barely a shadow of the Reagan-Bush SDI legacy.
<P>
The Bush plan to protect the American homeland against limited
missile attack by as early as 1999 called for 5-times the Clinton
budget, which aspires only to support a &quot;technology readiness
program.&quot; The Bush plan included 60 percent more for advanced
technology to assure that America excels at the very competitive
edge of the technology frontier. The Clinton cuts severely constrain
efforts to respond to reactive threats that will follow from the
inevitable measure-countermeasure competition--and will stop development
of new technologies...
<P>
<b>Goals 2000</b>
<P>
...President Clinton's $420 million education bill, Goals 2000,
falls far short of the mark of qualifying as education reform,
and provides for no real change such as more choices, greater
accountability, more
<P>
local control and flexibility to teachers. Instead, the bill contains
a number of &quot;business as usual&quot; options as well as a
number of potentially harmful provisions. Unfortunately, the Clinton
Education Department receives its marching orders from the education
establishment, which has opposed every meaningful education reform
proposal during the past 20 years. The establishment is largely
responsible for engineering the worst decline in the history of
American education. And they are now in the posit ~~n of defending
one of the worst-performing systems in the world.
<P>
Our education system needs entrepreneurial reform. Here's what
that might look like: reform measures providing for accountability,
decentralization, national standards in the core subjects, merit
pay, alternative certification, and allowing parents to choose
the public, private or religious school to
<P>
which they send their children. These proposals, if implemented,
would dramatically improve American education. . .

<H3>Bennett's <I>Book of Virtues Reaches</I> Nation's Best Seller
List</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett's
<I>The Book of Virtues</I> has reached number one on the national
best-seller lists, including those complied by The New York Times,
The Los Angles Times, and The Washington Post. The book, an anthology
of great moral stones, focuses on ten virtues: self-discipline,
compassion, responsibility, friendship, work, courage, perseverance,
honesty, loyalty and faith. The purpose of the collection, Bennett
writes in his introduction, is &quot;to aid in the time-honored
task of the moral education of the young.&quot;
<P>
The book has proved not only a popular success, but a critical
success as well. It has received rave reviews in both the general
press and opinion journals from across the political spectrum,
including <I>Newsweek, Time, People, The Washington Post, The
Wall Street Journal, The New Republic, National Review</I>, and
<I>Commentary</I>.
<P>
However, despite the wide attention it has received, Bennett is
quick to emphasize that <I>The Book of Virtues</I>, was in no
way animated by politics. &quot;I commit a lot of political acts,&quot;
he recently told the Associated Press. &quot;This book was not
a political act.&quot; In a recent essay, Time magazine columnist
Lance Morrow echoed this sentiment, writing: &quot;Bennett is
not demagoguing the verities. He anthologies the old republic
and the old virtues, but he addresses virtue at a level of commonality
that is deeper than politics or nostalgia.&quot;
<P>
Perhaps what is most encouraging about the success of <I>The Book
of Virtues</I> is what it may say about changes in our culture.
The book's popularity seems an expression of the American people'
s desire to hear again --and to read again --about time honored
virtues. As U.S. News &amp; World Report put it in a recent article,
&quot;the Public longing for moral anchors helps to explain how
William Bennett's anthology ... was able to push shock-jock Howard
Stern's autobiography from the top of the bestseller list earlier
this year.&quot; Asked why he feels these moral tales have struck
a chord with the American public, Bennett answers simply: &quot;Unless
you're a criminal, these are your values.&quot;

<H3>EMPOWER AMERICA IN THE NEWS</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

In addition to coverage in the national media, Empower America
also generates a great deal of coverage in the local and regional
press. Here is a sample of recent news stories that discuss Empower
America.
<P>
&quot;Empower America, a conservative organization, said Clinton's
(State of the Union) speech had one purpose: 'to resuscitate his
faltering health care plan,' which it said 'has steadily been
losing support with the American people.' 'He has manufactured
a phony health care 'crisis' to scare people into accepting his
plan to nationalize the health care industry,' said the group,
led by former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and other conservatives.&quot;
<P>
--<I>San Jose Mercury News</I>, January 26, 1994
<P>
&quot;Many conservatives say Clinton's (health reform) plan is
a liberal power grab based on the illusion that there is a health
care crisis. 'The crisis will come only if the Clinton plan becomes
law,' said a press release Tuesday from Empower America The White
House responded to such criticism with offers to back off some
of its more ambitious goals...&quot;
<P>
--<I>Orlando Sentinel</I>, January 26, 1994
<P>
&quot;William Bennett--the former education secretary and drug
czar under the Reagan and Bush administrations--called for an
end to welfare, saying it fosters the dissolution of low-income
families. He advocated instead programs to strengthen the family.
He said polling data shows a change in values in America that
has worsened the crime crisis, with few modern parents looking
at their children as their most important priority. 'We have conducted
a social experiment in the last 30 years in this country along
these lines--what happens if we have lots of children and don't
raise them?' said Bennett. 'The results of that experiment are
now in.&quot;'
<P>
--<I>Pensacola News-Journal</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick ... took Clinton
to task, saying his just-concluded trip to Russia and Eastern
Europe was a pullback of the historic U.S. commitment. 'The U.S.
performance was largely interpreted as a retreat,' said Kirkpatrick.
Kirkpatrick ... (was) in Miami for the third regional meeting
of the new organization, Empower America.&quot;
<P>
--<I>Palm Beach Post</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;During his visit to Miami Wednesday ... Kemp says his organization
(Empower America) is reshaping the party. He called Clinton's
foreign policy in general 'a disaster' and U.S. policies in both
Bosnia and North Korea 'an empty shell.' As for the problem of
ending the cycle of poverty in American cities, 'President Clinton
doesn't have a clue.' 'We've turned our cities into socialized,
almost Third World economies,' he said. Kemp shared the podium
with Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick,
and former Education Secretary and war-on-drugs czar William Bennett
....&quot;
<P>
-- <I>The Miami Herald</I>, January 16, 1994
<P>
&quot;Jack Kemp ... blasted the Administration's first year as
a failure in foreign policy .... 'The President's administration
has been close to a disaster in terms of credibility,&quot; Kemp
said Wednesday. Kemp ... Ridiculed Clinton for allowing 'a bunch
of thugs with AK47 submachineguns' to force a U.S. Navy warship
to leave Haiti. He criticized Clinton for being too soft on North
Korea's nuclear threat, and said the administration has fumbled
the Bosnia crisis with its inaction.&quot;
<P>
--<I>Marietta Daily Journal</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;Vin Weber, Co-Director of Empower America ... (noted) that
the version of the (balanced budget) amendment sponsored by Senator
Paul Simon, D-Ill., that is being debated on the Senate floor
would make tax cuts designed to stimulate economic growth unlikely,
largely because any tax cut would be seen as adding to the deficit.
<P>
--<I>Investor's Business Daily</I>, February 25, 1994

<B>&quot;A Cultural Renaissance&quot;</B> 
<P>
By Jack Kemp, Co-Director, Empower America, delivered at Hillsdale College
<P>
...A government conceived in liberty has none of the tools of
tyranny. It depends, instead, on other institutions-- structures
between the individual and the state--that instill character,
purpose, and virtue. Churches and synagogues that raise a moral
standard. Parents who provide a moral and spiritual example to
their children. Schools that teach, not only the basics of math
and history, but the basics of citizenship and character that
come from an understanding of the Decalogue as well as the Declaration
of Independence.
<P>
Can we separate economics and values? The choice is not necessary.
The achievements of capitalism depend on the achievements of the
human spirit, nurtured in families. I am a believer in the power
and promise of free markets, free minds, and free nations. I am
also a believer in fostering the values that make them possible.
And I will admit no conflict between them. . .
<P>
<B>Commencement Remarks at Pepperdine University's School of Business
and Management</B> 
<P>
By Theodore J. Forstmann, Founding
<P>
Chairman, Empower America
<P>
...Basically, there are just two ways to organize society. The
first is the statist society, in which inequalities are reconciled,
resources are redistributed, and interaction is regulated through
the machinery of the state. The other is the civil society, in
which people organize themselves through voluntary association.
It's an old argument, filled with a lot of ideological 'isms'
and intellectual pretensions, but it basically comes down to a
question of who has the power to make some of the most important
decisions in your life. Do you invest your money, or does someone
else invest it for you? Do you choose your children's schools,
or are they assigned? Can you give to the charity of your choice,
or is the money funneled to state welfare programs? When you get
sick, can you pick your doctor or is your health-care plan prescribed.
<P>
The irony of the politicization of American life is that no country
on the face of the earth could be more ill-fitted for statism
than the United States of America. This is not a value judgment.
It is a simple statement of fact. For better or for worse, the
American spirit is not a bureaucratic spirit. It's a risk-taking,
rulebreaking, establishment-shaking spirit. While Western Europe
was groomed for statism in its centuries of monarchical rule,
America was born of revolution. For 60 years now, we have been
subjected to the materialist wisdom of the state as it imposed
ever increasing levels of social engineering. Today, sadly, we
all reap its non-spiritual devastating rewards...
<P>
<B>Closing Remarks at Empower America's National Economic Conference</B>

<P>
By Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr., Chairman of the Board, Empower America
<P>
...We're living in a world where, more and more, capital is intangible.
It's in the mind. And if people don't have an education, don't
have that tool, they're never going to get ahead. They're never
going to fulfill their potential. This new age is symbolized by
the microchip which is extending the reach of the human brain
the way machines extended the reach of human muscle in the last
century. The microchip, which is doubling in power every 18 months,
will dramatically expand our standard of living.
<P>
Our nation must take the lead to create and preserve not only
a national environment but an international environment where
democracy, pluralism, tolerance and free markets can take root
and flourish. Only we can guarantee that this will happen. If
we don't take the lead in making sure that there is a benign world
order, an environment where freedom can flourish, no one else
will. . .
<P>
<B>&quot;An Agenda for Economic Growth&quot;</B> 
<P>
By Lawrence Kudlow, Economist and Member of Empower America's
Board of Directors, Delivered at Empower America's National Economic
Conference
<P>
...During the Bush Administration some Republicans became ashamed
of their support for a lower capital gains tax. They cowered before
anyone who cried 'fairness' and abandoned the effort to reduce
it further and index it for inflation. By doing so, they surrendered
a core principle of successful economic policy: the idea that
growth comes from dynamism, risk-taking, and entrepreneurship
and that we cannot punish productive capital with a confiscatory,
unindexed tax on capital gains.
<P>
The entrepreneur suffers the most from bloated government spending
because he or she looks to government for little, but pays the
most every time taxes go up. Government &quot;investment&quot;--the
latest euphemism for more spending--may help a special interest
group, but the rest of society will suffer as incentives are blunted
and risk-taking is punished. Our economic and cultural policies
should nourish and support the family and the family-owned business,
not undermine them. We must pass an end to economic and social
policies which obstruct risk-taking in the marketplace and traditional
values at home. We need a vision that offers people maximum incentive
to succeed and a complementary vision that offers them maximum
faith and hope when they go home to their families...

<i>Regional Meeting Draws 400 Local Activists</i>
<P>
MIAMI, FL - Empower America drew over 400 local activists to its
fourth regional conference, held in Miami, Florida, January 19,
1994. The regional conferences are designed to engage participants
in open discussion with Empower America's Co-Directors William
Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Vin Weber and other political
leaders, in an effort to promote conservative grassroots activism
throughout the nation.
<P>
Participants in the Miami meeting discussed issues such as crime,
foreign policy and the economy at the one-day meeting. The morning
session, led by Empower America Co-Director William Bennett, focused
on national and community crime issues. Looking back on his tenure
as Drug Czar in the Bush Administration, Bennett told the grassroots
activists, &quot;I traveled to more than 100 communities in America,
most of which were poor communities. And whenever I visited these
communities I never heard people say 'let's deal with the root
causes of crime.'
<P>
What they kept asking me is, 'why can't you keep criminals off
the streets?' Our poor communities deserve the same protection
that society provides its more affluent communities.&quot; Joining
Dr. Bennett in the discussion were local experts who addressed
issues such as local law enforcement and community policing.
<P>
Among the highlights was a presentation by U.S. Senator Connie
Mack (R-FL), who addressed the conference on the Clinton administration's
domestic policy. Mack told the audience that since taking office,
President Clinton had largely backed away from his conservative
campaign promises. &quot;I'm very disappointed,&quot; Mack said,
'I'd give him a 'D' for his first year.&quot;
<P>
Jack Kemp chaired the afternoon discussion on community empowerment
and conservative prescriptions for economic renewal. As for the
problem of ending the cycle of poverty in American cities and
promoting economic growth for all, Kemp said, &quot;we've turned
our inner cities into socialized, almost Third World economies.
President Clinton is moving in the wrong direction. Instead of
easing government's burden on the American taxpayer and entrepreneur,
he's raised taxes, discouraged entrepreneurship and now he's trying
to nationalize health care, all under the disguise of a recovering
economy he has inherited.&quot;
<P>
Empower America will be hosting its next regional conferences
in Houston on May l9th and San Francisco on June 1st. For more
details on how you can participate in upcoming regional meetings,

<H3>Kirkpatrick Assails Clinton Policy in Europe</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>


MIAMI, FL--At Empower America's recent regional conference in
Miarni, former UN Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick gave an assessment
of the Clinton administration's policy in Europe, arguing that
President Clinton's recent statements, and the U.S. performance
at the recent NATO Summit, were viewed by the Europeans as &quot;a
broad policy of withdrawal, (and) a weakening of America's NATO
role in Europe.&quot; According to Kirkpatrick, the Europeans
believe foreign policy is more concerned with power than democratic
ideals, and the Clinton administration's fitful responses to the
reemergence of Europe's historical balance of power concerns has
produced an unnecessary and growing ambiguity about U.S. purposes
in Europe and in NATO.
<P>
By its failure to exercise U.S. Leadership in Europe and in NATO,
and by delegating too much authority to the United Nations Secretary
General, the Administration, Kirkpatrick asserted, has permitted
collective security to be weakened and &quot;has had a difficult
time finding common ground with our European allies.&quot;

WASHINGTON, DC &#151; On December 1, 1993, three of the most powerful
voices in the conservative community joined forces with Empower
America. House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.) and Senator
Trent Lott (R., Miss.) have joined the Board of Directors, and
Malcolm S. (Steve) Forbes, Jr., EditorinChief of Forbes magazine,
has been elected Chairman of the Board. All three are expected
to play key roles in shaping Empower America's agenda in 1994.
<P>
Mr. Lott is a member of the Republican leadership in the Senate,
serving as the Republican Conference Secretary. Mr. Gingrich is
expected to become Republican leader in the House of Representatives
next year. Mr. Forbes, editor of <I>Forbes </I>Magazine, recently
played a key role in the election campaign of New Jersey Governor
Christine Todd Whitman, coauthoring the widelypraised taxcut plan
which helped Whitman defeat Jim Florio.
<P>
      Ted Forstrnann, Empower America's Chairman for its first
year, will assume the position of Founding Chairman. Also joining
the Board will be: Thom Weisel, Chairman &amp; CEO of Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco; Nick Forstmann, Partner, Forstmann
Little &amp; Co.; and Joe Cannon, Chairman &amp; CEO of Geneva
Steel in Salt Lake City.
<P>
&quot;I am delighted and honored to be working so closely with
a unique organization that effectively combines ideas with activism,&quot;
said Forbes. &quot;This organization has grown to nearly 400,000
members in less than one year, and has an ambitious agenda for
1994. I look forward to building on this record of success.&quot;
<P>
In other organizational changes, Vin Weber will move up from President
to become ViceChairman of the Board. Weber will also join Kemp,
Bennett and Kirkpatrick as a CoDirector of Empower America, and
will continue to serve as chief spokesman for the organization.
Bill Dal Col, former Chief of Staff to Kemp, will replace Weber
as President.

<H3>What's Ahead for 1994</H3>
<P>
1993 has been a very successtul year for EmpowerAmerica. 
We created and built a brand new organization from the ground 
up, and with your support has forged it
into a powerful political voice for promoting
innovative ideas in the public arena. 
<P>
Now, as 1994 approaches, we have kicked off a number of exiting
projects for our second  year:
<UL>
<LI>To make sure that the campaigns of 1994 are tough on the
issues you and I care about, next year Empower America will be
hosting candidate training schools across the United States.
<LI>On Decomber 14, 1993, the one year anniversary of  President
Clinton's economic summit in Little Rock, Empower  America will
be hosting an economic summit of its own to assess the Clinton
Administration's perforrnance and to begin developing alternatives
to Clinton's economic agenda. <A HREF="/empower/aehigh21_2.html">
(see article)</A>.
<LI>In 1993, Empower America worked hard to promote Proposition
174, the California school choice initiative, and Proposition
593 the anticrime initiative  in Washington State, which places
repeat offenders convicted of their third felony in jail for life,
with no chance of parole, probation or work release. In 1994,
we will be backing more of these kinds of grassroots campaigns
in states across the country.
<LI>As the Clinton team continues to grope for a coherent foreign
policy we believe it is time for a serious dialogue on preserving
America 's leading role on the world stage. To this end, Empower<B>
</B>America plans<B> </B>to host its first major conference on
international issues.
<LI>And finally we will continue to expand Empower America's
efforts to bring our message of empowerment, opportunity and entrepreneurial
capitalism to new groups of citizens by establishing Empower America's
&quot;Community Empowerment Project.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
As you can see, 1994 will be an important year for us. We look
forward to working with you, and to seeing you at our 1994 regional
conferences. Please keep us informed about your ideas on how we
can make EA more effective in fighting for the ideas we believe
in.
<P>

<H3>NAFTA Approved by Congress</H3>
<P>
<I>Empower America Campaign Credited as Central to Securlng NAFTA
Victory</I>
<P>
<B>Washington, DC  </B>On November 17, the House of Representatives
voted 234 200 to approve The <B>North American Free Trade
Agreement</B> (NAFTA), the historic accord which will now link the
economies of the United States, Mexico and Canada into the world's
largest and most powerful free trading bloc. Days later the accord
easily passed the Senate, and will now be implemented beginning
January 1,1994.
<P>
The battle for NAFTA was hard fought, and Empower America's efforts
to help pass the trade pact were described by many as central
to the victory in Congress. In an article published before the
House vote, columnist Morton Kondracke praised Empower America's
efforts on behalf of NAFTA, calling them a model for other conservative
leaders to emulate. Empower America and its CoDirector Jack Kemp,
Kondracke wrote, &quot;are doing what the entire GOP leadership
should be doing: making passage of NAFTA one of its top priorities
for 1993... Kemp boosts NAFTA in every speech, blankets the nation's
oped pages with proNAFTA columns and is circulating a...proNAFTA
(open letter to America) among the nation's governors. Now other
GOP leaders need to take up the cause in an equally public way.&quot;
<P>
Indeed, Empower America was one of the earliest vocal supporters
of NAFTA. Early on, Kemp published proNAFTA opeds that ran in
newspapers in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois,
Missouri, North Carolina, New York, Texas, Georgia, Arizona and
Massachusetts, spreading the NAFTA message to some 4.17 million
Americans. And, as the House vote neared, Kemp played a key role
delivering the GOP vote for NAFTA and winning over undecided House
Republicans
<P>
Empower America concentrated its efforts on bringing in the votes
of undecided Republicans, many of whom supported NAFTA in principle
but were hesitant to &quot;deliver a big victory for Bill Clinton.&quot;
Just one week before the vote, Kemp held a private, closed door
meeting on Capitol Hill with some 40 undecided GOP House Members
to discuss their concerns about the vote. Paraphrasing Lincoln,
Kemp told the Republicans to vote on their convictions on NAFTA
because &quot;you serve your party by serving your country.&quot;
Immediately following the meeting, Kemp held a Capitol Hill press
conference, at which several previously undecided Members announced
their support for NAFTA.
<P>
The following Sunday, Kemp appeared on &quot;This Week With David
Brinkley&quot; to argue the case for NAFTA. The next night, just
two days before the vote, Kemp took on conservative NAFTA
opponent Pat Buchanan in a oneonone debate, broadcast on CNN's
&quot;Larry King Live&quot;. The day before the vote, Kemp published
an editorial in the Washington Post, cowritten with Rep. Dick
Armey (TX), laying out the reasons why conservatives should support
NAF TA. And Kemp worked the phones lobbying Members who were still
wavering.
<P>
In the end, all these efforts paid off, as Republicans came through
for NAFTA, voting in favor by an overwhelming 132-43. The solid
GOP support provided the margin of victory for NAFTA&#151; as
the final tally showed, Clinton would never have succeeded in
passing the accord had he depended solely on his party's vote
in Congress.
<P>
With NAFTA now signed into law, Empower America is now calling
on the Clinton Administration to use the momentum the GOP has
provided him on free trade, and move quickly to expand NAFTA to
other Latin American countries. In a Wall Street Journal oped
published just after the House vote, Empower America President
Vin Weber called on the President to immediately &quot;pursue
the next step in building a hemispheric free trade zone: negotiations
to incorporate Chile, Argentina and Venezuela into the NAFTA trading
bloc.&quot;
<P>
Whether Clinton heeds this advice and continues to support free
trade policies, or seeks to heal his Administrations wounds
with organized labor by moving left again, remains to be seen.
But one thing is certain: thanks to the support of Congressional
Republicans, Ronald Reagan's vision of a North American free
trade zone has finally become a reality. Empower America is proud
to have played a major role in this historic effort.
<P>

<H3>The Forced Collectivization of Medicine</H3>
<P>
By Jack Kemp
<P>
After a Clinton Administration official let slip that 40% of Americans
will pay more under its health care plan, the President's media
rapid response team went immediately into action...to change the
subject.
<P>
The diversion they chose was a frontal assault on insurance companies.
&quot;It is time,&quot; Hillary Clinton told an audience of doctors,
&quot;for...every American to stand up and say to the insurance
industry, 'Enough is enough. We want our health care system back.'...It
is time we stood up and said, 'We are tired of insurance companies
running our health care system.'&quot;
<P>
The First Lady's attack would have been more credible if not for
this ironic fact: The centerpiece of the Clinton health plan is
a dramatic increase in the power of insurance companies over the
health of Americans&#151;the power to ration medical care.
<P>
Remember, first, how the Clinton proposal is designed to cut health
costs. It would create regional &quot;Health Alliances&quot; that
would enforce a health care budget by placing legal limits on
what insurance companies could charge. Insurers could be fined
if their premiums don't meet these caps on health costs.
<P>
The result? Only those insurance companies that place the most
effective, restrictive controls on what they are charged by doctors
and hospitals will survive. By some estimates, only 5 or 6 insurers
will remain, and each of these companies will provide &quot;managed
care&quot;&#151; programs to cut costs and meet a budget set by
government.
<P>
How is that budget met? Insurance companies will dictate how doctors
and hospitals reduce expenses. Insurance reviewers, or &quot;gatekeepers,&quot;
will micromanage medical treatments to cut costs, secondguessing
doctors and nurses. These bureaucrats with little direct knowledge
of a patient, will effectively have the final say on what specialists
that patient can see, or what tests and technology they deserve.
<P>
This, in essence, is the Clinton plan: Big government would require
a few big insurance companies to meet smaller health budgets.
Those companies, to cut costs, would do the dirty work of rationing.
<P>
Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute recently described how this
rationing process works in other nations with nationalized health
care. In Canada, hundreds of medical procedures and drugs that
once were covered by national insurance have been declared too
expensive and are no longer paid for&#151;a process Canadians
call &quot;delisting.&quot;
<P>
In Germany, a 1989 reform reduced the range of medical services
covered by that nation's &quot;social insurance&quot; program.
The story is similar in Britain, Spain, Sweden&#151; and Oregon.
Yes, Oregon.
<P>
That state's Medicaid program lists 709 medical services in order
of urgency. The list is then matched against the amount of government
funding available in the health budget. Only 535 medical procedures
made the cut this year, while the remainder will not be paid.
So, for example, the treatment of swelling of the esophagus&#151;
numbered 538&#151;is covered. Disk surgery&#151;number 536 --is
not.
<P>
The Clinton plan's national budget for health care would make
this kind of rationing inevitable for every American.
<P>
&quot;When individuals pay for their own health care,&quot; Michael
Tanner concludes, &quot;they decide what services to buy. When
government pays for health care, it decides what services it will
pay for. The availability of health care services becomes subject
to the whims of majority rule.&quot;
<P>
Even Stanford University's Alain Enthoven, one of the original
designers of &quot;managed competition,&quot; has opposed the
Clinton plan because it uses health alliances to impose price
controls.
<P>
Nationalized health care always puts bureaucrats in the business
of choosing who deserves care, and who does not. In the Clinton
plan, those bureaucrats would work for insurance companies, enforcing
a health budget set by the government. In other countries, those
bureaucrats work for the government directly. The effect, in
either case, is precisely the same: a decline in the quality
and accessibility of medicine.
<P>
<B>Bad Medicine: The Clinton Health Care Plan</B>
<P>
Despite the hours of television time and millions of dollars spent
by the Clinton Administration to drum up support for its health
care reform plan, the public isn't being told much about the details.
A close look at these details reveals why:<B> </B>the President's
health care plan masks the largest power grab by the federal government
in recent history.
<P>
Here's what the Clinton administration won't tell you about their
health care plan:
<P>
I. <B>Government bureaucracies will be granted massive new powers
to ration care, set price controls, and eliminate competition.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Price Controls: Central to the President's plan is the
creation of a new bureaucracy, the National Health Board (NHB)
which would set &quot;global budgets,&quot; or limits on the total
amount of public and private spending on health care. It would
also set price controls on insurance premiums and prescription
drug prices.
<LI>Rationed Care: If total health care spending exceeds the
governmentset &quot;global budget,&quot; rationing must follow.
Managedcare &quot;gatekeepers&quot; will have systemic incentives
to ration care to comply with the spending caps imposed on them
by governmental health bureaucracies.
<LI>Tyrannical Enforcement: The National Health Board would
also have bigbrotherish enforcement powers. If a state fails to
fully comply with its edicts, the NHB can cut off all health care
funds to the state or direct the Secretary of the Treasury to
impose a payroll tax on every employer in the state.
<LI>Outlawing Traditional Medicine: Everyone will be required
to purchase insurance through governmental &quot;health alliances&quot;
in each region. Health alliances choose which insurance plans
consumers can choose among; they can shut out any plan whose premium
is 20% above the average,
thereby eliminating feeforservice (traditional) medicine and forcing
all residents of a particular region into HMOs. Clinton's plan
could take away citizens' ability to choose their doctor.
</UL>

<B>II. The President's plan cannot be
 paid for without drastic tax or deficit increases.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Underestimated Costs: Clinton originally estimated the
cost of his plan to be $30 billion; now, most economists place
that figure at least $120 billion higher. Harvard Economist Martin
Feldstein estimated that the plan would require an additional
$120 billion in taxes in the first year alone.
<LI>Unrealistic Expectasions: The President plans to expand
Medicare to include prescription drug and longterm care coverage
(price tag: $152 billion) while realizing a net savings of $124
billion:cutting &quot;waste and fraud.&quot; He relies on a steep new
cigarette tax to finance the bulk of government subsidies, even
though many studies have shown that his tax will bring in less
than half of the revenues he is counting on.
</UL>
<B>III. Economic downturn and job destruction will result.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Employer Mandates: Small companies will face a payroll
tax of 3.5%&#151;an estimated $29 billion in new costs to those
small companies which now account for around 80% of new job creation.
Larger companies would have to pay 7.9% of their payroll.
<LI>Job Loss: The Employment Policies Institute estimates that
Clinton's employer mandates will eliminate 3.1 million jobs.
<LI>Dislocation: The health care industry accounts for 14%
of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs 10 million people.
Huge changes in the structure and delivery of health care will
lead to significant dislocation and further job loss.
<LI>Stunted Innovations: Price controls on premium caps and
drug prices will stunt pharmaceutical and biomedical research
and development, which in turn, will postpone or eliminate the
opportunity to develop new drugs, prevention medicines, and disease
cures.
</UL>
<B>IV. Clinton's health plan strips individuals of choice,
autonomy, and privacy.</B>
<UL>
<LI>No Choice of Benefits: The Clinton Administration will
draw up a &quot;standardized benefits package;'9 that every American
is required to purchase. The content of this package will inevitably
be politicized.
<LI>Loss of Medical Privacy: Clinton would require every American
to carry with them at all times a &quot;National Health Care Card&quot;
which would contain one's entire medical history on a computerized strip. 
Anyone who can gain
electronic access (legally or illegally) to the computer system
could access an individual's medical records.
</UL>

<P>
President Clinton's health care plan begins with a wrong assumption
and ends with the wrong treatment. The President seeks to convince
us that our health care system&#151;which has consistently delivered
the best, most technologically advanced care in the world&#151;is
so broken that it must be replaced by bureaucracies and governmental
oversight. The flaws of our current health care system are real
and demand redress; changes in malpractice, tax, and insurance
laws are all necessary. But President Clinton's plan to disempower
Americans by placing the government in charge of health care will
ultimately result in higher prices, greater inefficiency, and
poorer health care.

national levels a coherent and comprehensive empowerment agenda.
These schools, to be held early next year in Washington, D.C.,
San Francisco, Denver, Detroit, Atlanta, and New York will focus
on economic competitiveness, growth, and entrepreneurship, free
trade, international leadership, health care, as well as education,
welfare, and crime.
<P>
Currently there are a number of political schools that address
the nuts-and-bolts of campaigns: fundraising, electoral strategies,
opposition research, and direct mail. What is missing, however,
are schools that present candidates with the <I>substantial </I>elements
of a political agenda and how best to campaign on such issues.
<P>
Candidates will be given a briefing book and a series of papers
authored by policy experts explaining the elements of the empowerment
agenda. Each candidate school will then be led by policy experts
who will explain the issues in detail, and political analysts
and pollsters who will instruct candidates on how to translate
the agenda into a winning campaign. Empower America's principals,
Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber will
offer insights based on their political experience in governmental
leadership.
<P>
Interested candidates or campaign managers should contact Empower
America at 1-800-332-2000.

<H3>From the Grassroots....</H3>
<P>
Empower America held three successful grassroots events during the fall.
In Los Angeles, California, William Bennett, Vin Weber and Jack
Kemp greeted over 700 Empower America associates and supporters
at a highenergy reception honoring several of that city's noteworthy
citizen! who are devoted to the ideals of empowering individuals.
Also, it was our pleasure to be joined by Robert Woodson, Sr.
of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, Orson Swindle
of Empower America, and Leon Watkins of the Family Help Line,
all of whom played essential roles in the evening's success.
<P>
In Dallas, Texas, our members gathered for a daylong conference
led by Jack Kemp and Vin Weber to address topics of vital interest
to southwest America. The eloquent conservative insight of former
Chief of Staff to Vice President Quayle, Bill Kristol, and the hardhitting
pragmatism of Dallas' own, Mayor Steve Bartlett were major attractions.
We were also joined by local area experts for panel discussions
on the economy and NAFTA.
<P>
In New York City, Empower America held a dinner and panel discussion
with some notable conservative leaders. Joining Jack Kemp, Bill
Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber, was radio talk show
host Rush Limbaugh. Also in attendance was National Review founder
and Editor-at-Large William F. Buckley, Jr.
<P>
We are currently scheduling 1994 conferences for Miami, Houston,
San Francisco, and New York.

<H3>Empower America and GrassRoot state Initiatives</H3>
<P>
By William J. Bennett
<P>
On November 2,1993, citizens of the C November 2,1993, citizens
of state of Washington passed two important referenda that should
serve as models to other states, and will hopefully be a harbinger
of things to come. Their success reflects a growing (and healthy)
citizen conviction that government's primary duty is to protect
its people, rather than confiscate and redistribute their income.
<P>
Proposition 593, also known as &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out,&quot;
will place criminals convicted of their third violent felony in
prison for life, with no chance for parole, probation, or work
release. The simple logic of ensuring the incarceration of the
most dangerous and violent criminals made plenty of sense to the
citizens of Washington state; &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot;
garnered the support of 75% of the voters.
<P>
The reasons for Proposition 593's landslide victory are straightforward:
violent crime is destroying our social and civic order. And despite
evidence that the crime problem is largely caused by a small group
of hardcore criminals (studies indicate that two thirds of all violent
crimes are committed by less than 10 percent of criminals), government
has done little to protect law abiding citizens from these predators.
While the modern state has expanded its reach into virtually every
aspect of citizens' lives, it has increasingly abdicated its first
responsibility: to ensure public safety. Citizens are afraid and
they want to fight back; the passage of &quot;Three Strikes, You're
Out&quot; is a very good start. It may well serve as a blueprint
for other states, and has already been passed as an amendment
to a comprehensive crime bill awaiting passage in the U.S. Senate.
<P>
Voters also registered their opposition to an ever expanding &quot;nanny
state&quot; that takes too much from us in order to do too much
for us.
<P>
Proposition 601 restrains future state spending growth and tax
increases by limiting the growth of the state budget to the population
and inflation growth rate and mandates that any new tax increase
must be approved by the voters. Proposition 601's success heralds
a rising tide of public support for job creation over social service
expansion, and economic opportunity over higher spending. Today
there is an enormous gap between what people believe government
can do and what it actually can do. The passage of Proposition
601 is a first step toward narrowing the gap and securing a progrowth,
fiscally responsible economic program.
<P>
Conservatives need to lead a national conversation that examines
anew the relationship between government and the governed. What
happened on the first Tuesday in November was a good place to
begin. And events in Washington state should remind people to
look less to the nation's capital and more to the states and localities,
those &quot;laboratories of democracy,&quot; where the most innovative
reforms are taking place.

<H3>President's Message...</H3>

This has been a very busy three months. We launched our grassroots
citizens' action campaign to defeat the Clinton tax increases.
The Clinton plan wilI~ raise taxes, destroy jobs and increase&#151;not
lower&#151;the federal budget deficit. We worked hard to defeat
it. Many of you received your Tax Action Packet, which explained
what you could do in your own state to help defeat the Clinton
plan. Jack Kemp, WilL; am Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and I gave
literally hundreds of radio and TV interviews, attacking the plan
and explaining why it will be so destructive to our economy. We
also launched an eightstate grassroots lobbying campaign to put
voter pressure on speciallytargeted, key &quot;swing vote&quot;
Senators. We appreciate the thousands of petition signatures that
you gathered and returned to us. And thanks to your generous support,
we were able to produce and place antitax radio ads on the Rush
Limbaugh show.
<P>
We're also working to promote positive change in America. We've
gotten behind the &quot;A Better Choice&quot; school choice ballot
initiative in California. It's the kind of innovative empowerment
idea America needs. It's a tough fight&#151;the antichoice forces
are spending millions of dollars to defeat us. But we're fightina
to win.
<P>
School choice will be one of the central themes at Empower America's
reception in Los Angeles September 23rd. The evening will feature
speeches by both William Bennett and Jack Kemp.
<P>
Our first conference in Milwaukee was a huge hit&#151;we sold
out all 700 spots. We'll also be holding regional conferences
this year in Dallas, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona. To get a copy
of our special video of the Milwaukee conference, send in the
form on the last page of this newsletter.
<P>
We look forward to seeing many of you in LA, and appreciate all
your hard work in the antitax effort. Together, we can make a
difference.
<P>
<B>Vin Weber, President</B>

<H3>Warning: Tax Hikes Ahead</H3>
<I>Clinton Budget is mined with more taxes, new spending</I>
<P>
<B>By Jack Kemp</B>
<P>
Three years ago, Americans were hit with the highest tax increase
in history because of the disastrous 1990 Budget Deal that was
sold on the promise to reduce the deficit by $500 billion. Sound
familiar? The result: the deficit exploded to over $300 billion,
taxes were raised on the &quot;rich,&quot; while revenues were
reduced and the economy suffered from anemic growth.
<P>
History demonstrates that economic growth and deficit reduction
cannot be achieved through higher taxes and promises of future
spending cuts. The parallels between the 1990 Budget Deal and
President Clinton's 1993 Budget Deal are remarkable. Both packages
rely heavily on &quot;soaktherich taxes,&quot; a regressive gas
tax, and the hope that a future Congress will cut spending. Specifically,
the 1990 Budget Deal raised taxes by $158 billion. Clinton's package
will nearly double that tax increase. Moreover, 80% of all spending
cuts in the 1993 Budget Deal are not scheduled to take effect
until after 1996.
<P>
One would think that somewhere along the way to constructing and
selling a budget package that is a mirror image of the deal struck
less than three years ago, someone would check whether the desired
results were achieved. Apparently, it is not in President Clinton's
nature to do so. Now that data from the 1990 Budget Deal is in,
we can compare the promises with the results. According to the
IRS, in 1991 the rich paid 6.1 % less in taxes even though their
tax rates were raised in 1990. Can Clinton blame this on the
slow economy? No, he cannot. The middle class paid more in
taxes (1% more)
even though their tax rates stayed the same. According to projections
of the 1990 Budget Deal, the deficit this year should be $142
billion. In fact, it is over $300 billion.
<P>
There is nothing new in the President's tax and spend asoroach;
it has been tried again and again, not once achiev
ing lower deficits and higher growth. The reason why people are
buying into the President's call for sacrifice (through higher
taxes on Americans as the only alternative to smaller deficits)
is that there has been no complete explanation of the ramifications
of the Clinton plan. However, the blame can be extended across
party lines. Unf ortunately, many Republicans, along with the
Democrats, have paid zero atten
tion to the real alternative - GROWTH.
<P>
Americans, after reading the fine print, will come to realize
what is in store for them. Will higher taxes, massive cuts in
defense spending and a growing dependency on government services
lead to longterm prosperity? Or will a broader tax base through
lower rates and the responsible scalingback of government free
up the resources that individuals and families can use to control
their own destinies? The real defining issue is whether we allow
our Tiation to cure its economic ills through growth or taxation.
I side with growth and the American people.

<H3>American Leadership or Disengagement?</H3>


<B>By Jeane Kirkpatrick</B>
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Bill Clinton promised a middle class
tax cut, while President Bill Clinton has increased the taxes
on the middle class.
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Bill Clinton promised American armed
forces second to none, while President Bill Clinton has cut the
defense budget so deeply that the Secretary of Defense was forced
to change U.S. strategy and Clinton has also demoralized the armed
forces by imposing, without consultation, decisions that violate
basic American standards and values.
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Clinton promised American air strikes,
if necessary, to save Bosnian civilians from Serbian aggression.
President Clinton has only followed the European lead in doing
nothing for too long.
<P>
Candidate Clinton promised to preserve U.S. leadership, but President
Clinton has retreated from a policy of leadership to a point of
acquiescent multilateralism. &quot;We have taken the lead,&quot;
said Secretary of State Warren Christopher, &quot;in passing to
multilateral bodies decisions and action on threats to peace.&quot;
They call it leadership. These policies variously called assertive
multilateralism, or cooperative security are, in fact, policies
of progressive AmeAcan disengagement and abdication.
<P>
The policy of &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; is applied far
beyond the issue of gays in the military to other important questions
of preparedness, morale and AmeAcan power.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell how robust or hollow our military forces
will be after the scheduled cuts have been carried out.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell what President Clinton will do when it becomes
even clearer that Iraq and North Korea are developing nuclear
weapons in spite of promises to the contrary.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell what the Clinton Administration will do
when it is undeniably clear that China is selling missile technology
to Pakistan and nuclear technology to Iran - in spite of promises
to the contrary.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell how the Clinton Administration proposes
to protect the continental United States from missiles launched
by the world's most violent dictators now that they have eliminated
funding for a strategic missile defense.
<P>
The President and Secretary of State have shown signs of improved
clarity and effectiveness in Lebanon and Bosnia, but not enough.
Further evidence of American disengagement can be perceived in
a variety of Clinton Administration decisions to date: the unconditional
extension of Most Favored Nation status to China, the unconditional
diplomatic recognition of the MPLA government of Angola, the uncon
ditional release of financial assistance to Nicaragua, the Administration's
continuing inaction on the North American Free Trade Agreement
and related hemispheric matters.
<P>
Some see in the U.S. insistence on multilateralism in economic
relations with Russia yet another example of a deliberate nonleadership
style in foreign policy.
<P>
Is the Clinton Administration renouncing the global leadership
the United States has excercised since World War II? Secretary
of State Warren ChAstopher has suggested that is the case, and
other State Department officials have recently emphasized the
Administration's determination to reduce U.S. commitments abroad.
<P>
One can only hope that our new president will heed the emerging
warning signs of the large price we, and the world, could pay
for abdication of U.S. leadership. The worldwide increase of terrorism
that has spread to the United States is a dramatic wakeup call.
A disengaged and unprepared America courts the very problems it
seeks to avoid.

<H3>The Politics of School Choice</H3>
<P>
<B>By William J. Bennett</B>
<P>
Over the last 30 years, we have witnessed a sharp decline in the
quality of public education. Today, low test scores, consistently
high dropout rates, drug use and increasing violence characterize
many of our public schools. Even as per student expenditures have
jumped (in constant 199192 dollars) from $2,035 in 1960 to $5,247
in 1990, student performance has continued to decline. Median
SAT scores have fallen almost 80 points over the last three decades,
and a recent international comparison of math and science skills
scored Americans at the bottom of the list of industrialized countries.
We need real reform, and we need it now.
<P>
The problem with our public schools is not a lack of money. Indeed,
both teacher salaries and overall educational expenditures have
increased dramaticallv. The failure of our schools is systemic:
despite the poor record of many schools,
unionization has strengthened the education establishment's power
over students and parents. Teachers' unions have made it virtually
impossible to fire even the most inept educator, and have freed
administrators from accountability. Parents, particularly lowerincome
parents, have few recourses, since they often lack the financial
means to send their child elsewhere.
<P>
The current system is a wreck; it hurts students, it undermines
parents and it perpetuates a social injustice. The American people
sense this: more than 70% of Americans support school voucher
systems, and as of 1992, 34 states were considering various school
choice initiatives. Increasingly, even teachers and education
bureaucrats lack faith in the system they defend&#151;22% send
their children to private schools, for example, and that number
is far higher in urban school districts. The widespread support
for school choice is part of
the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
School vouchers would provide all parents - regardless of income
level - with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child. If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher
will simply stay with that school. If they are not, parents would
now have a choice - they could send their child elsewhere,
to another public school, or to a private or religious school.
This is the same concept we use in higher education; students
can use government grants and loans to attend the University of
Indiana, Notre Dame or Yeshiva University. Higher education performs
better because of the competition.
<P>
The intellectual debate about school choice is just about over.
It will increase competition, accountability and parental involvement.
It will save taxpayers money. Indeed, school choice is the most
important and farreaching education reform in America.
<P>
The only people to benefit from the public schools' lock on educational
resources are those who hold the key&#151;the teachers' unions
and the educational bureaucracy they represent. The National Education
Association (the nation's largest union with 2.1 million
members) has a
vested interest in ensuring public schools' monopoly over taxpayer
money, which is why they are raising teachers' dues for the express
purpose of funneling more than $15 million into a campaign to
defeat school choice in California. That is why we at Empower
America are taking a leading role in the fight for school choice
in California. As a recent <I>Forbes </I>article noted, &quot;The
public may be only dimly aware of it, but the union's growing
power has exactly coincided with the dismal spectacle of rising
spending on education producing deteriorating results.&quot; 
<P>
The timehonored task of education is to provide children with
sound intellectual and moral instruction. School choice empowers
parents to select schools that reflect the values and the academic
goals that they hold for their children.

<H3>Success in Milwaukee</H3>

<I>Standing Room Only at Conference</I>
<P>
&quot;...more than 700 regional political activists gathered
here. . .to celebrate. . .ideas. Conservative ideas such as public
school choice, welfare limits, free enterprise-style economic incentives
and things as basic as good oldfashioned tax cutting.&quot;
<P>
<RIGHT><I>-Wisconsin State Journal, </I>June 26, 1993</RIGHT>
<P>
&quot;President Clinton's economic, foreign and social policy
initiatives were found lacking by three prominent conservatives
who were in Milwaukee for the first meeting of a new national
organization called Ernpower America.&quot;
<P>
<RIGHT><I>-Milwaukee Sentinel, </I>June 25, 1993</RIGHT>
<P>
Well over 700 enthusiastic supporters crowded into Milwaukee's
Italian Community Center on June 25th to hear Empower America's
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick as they launched
their series of regional conferences. With more than twenty events
scheduled over the next 18 months, these conferences are designed
to integrate national policies with state and local initiatives
and programs.
<P>
The Milwaukee event featured a morning session of comments by
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick, followed by
energetic question and answer sessions.
<P>
The lunch session featured two prominent conservative leaders.
Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, a member of Empower America's
Gubernatorial Advisory Board, listed his state's numerous innovations
in the areas of education and welfare reform. Bob Woodson, president
of The National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, focused on
reviving our nation's inner cities through economic growth and
policies which encourage home ownership and &quot;workfare&quot;,
not welfare.
<P>
The afternoon panels emphasized school choice and economic growth,
and provided an indepth look at efforts in these areas on the
local and state levels.

<H3>Battling for School Choice:EA Joins the
Grassroots Effort in Calif. </H3>

<P>
On November 2, the people of California will vote on Proposition
174, a revolutionary school choice initiative tesignet to empower
parents, reform education and save taxpayers money. The initiative
would give parents the opportunity to choose where their children
will be educated&#151;at a public, private or religious school.
If parents choose a public school, that school receives full funding,
about $5,200 per child. If parents choose a private or religious
school, they will receive a voucher worth half that amount, about
$2,600, to be used to pay the tuition (62 percent of California's
private schools cost $2,600 or less.)
<P>
Empower America is playing a leading role in the battle for school
choice in California. CoDirector William 1. Bennett signed the
ballot argument supporting Proposition 174 that will be sent to
all of the state's registered voters and he plans to participate
in numerous school choice events. CoDirector Jack Kemp has raised
$600,000 for the effort thus far. For a School Choice Action Packet,
please call 1-800-332-2000.

<H3>Free Trade and NAFTA</H3>

<P>
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is scheduled to
be considered this fall by Congress. This agreement will make
history&#151;either as the missed opportunity that cost the U.S.
jobs, increased trade and a more competitive economy; or as the
creator of the world's largest free trade zone which expanded
exports to Canada and Mexico and created a growing supply of higher
paying jobs. Despite support by President Clinton, NAFTA might
not make it thtnilah Concrrecc Tf those onnosed to NAFTA would
only
look at the facts, they would find consensus among economists
who has seriously studied the documents and realize that it will
increase U.S. exports and create American jobs.
<P>
Before Mexico's 1986 decision to join the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs (GATT), tariffs on U.S. exports
were as high as lOOSo; Now they are down to an average of 10%.
The average tariff placed on Mexican products being sold in the
U.S. is 3%. The arithmetic is straightforward. The U.S. clearly
has more to gain by the elimination of tariffs. But let the facts
tell the story: since 1986 these declining tariffs produced a
windfall of export activity (see chart), shifting our trade status
with Mexico from a deficit of $4 billion to a surplus of $9 billion.
Mexico has become the fastest growing export market, purchasing
73% of its imports from the U.S. It has now established itself
as our second largest market; Canada being the first. Consequently,
as the Mexican economy grows, so do U.S. exports.
<P>
These increased exports have already created 300,000 new
jobs, doubling the number of jobs supported by exports to Mexico
(see chart). In fact, the Department of Commerce estimates that
each extra $1 billion in exports creates over 19,000 net new jobs.
The Institute for International Economics projects that by 1995,
over 1 million U.S. jobs will be supported by U.S. exports to
Mexico alone.
<P>
The answer to the question, &quot;what kind of American jobs will
be produced by the NAFTA agreement?&quot; is key. According to
the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, exportrelated jobs
pay 17% more than the average U.S. wage. This applies to workers
in both the service and manufacturing industries.
<P>
Our borders and trading patterns have a finite capacity; but our
potential to expand trade and grow the economy, is infinite&#151;provided
we pursue free trade. The evidence is dear. If PresidentClinton
truly wants a stimulus package that creates longterm, private
sector jobs, he would seize the moment and urge passage of this
agreement now.

<H3>President's Message...</H3>
<P>
This is a critical time for our country as we are finally getting
a good look at President Clinton's economic plan. It's tax and
spend all over again.
<P>
The bottom line for individuals, families, and businesses: the
biggest tax increase in American history, $328 billion over five
years; an effective acrosstheboard tax increase on every taxpayer
of up to 20 percent; a tax on individuals earning as little as
$30,000; and more government spending. Whatever happened to President
Clinton's campaign promise to cut taxes for the middle class?
<P>
Every time you turn around, the Clinton team is talking about
another new tax on American families and workers. But they never
talk about cutting taxes.
<P>
Empower Arnerica thinks that's wrong and we've launched a campaign
to defeat the Clinton tax hikes. By energizing activists like
yourself, we're convinced <B>that the Clinton tax bill </B>can
be defeated. America needs economic policies that promote growth,
create jobs, and provide opportunity for entrepreneurs.
<P>
President Clinton says that his policies reflect the &quot;new&quot;
Democrat. Frankly, I can't tell the difference between his tax
hikes and tax hikes of the old Democrats. We need to get the economy
moving up the growth curve again. The Clinton tax increases will
only hurt our economy and increase the deficit.
<P>
Bill Clinton thinks you're not paying enough taxes. Empower America
thinks Americans are overtaxed, and we need your help in defeating
these tax increases and promoting an agenda for economic growth.
<P>
At a grassroots level, thousands of concerned citizens are helping
us to promote conservativeoriented empowerment strategies at all
levels of government. So, if you're concerned about Bill Clinton's
tax and spend policies, stay involved with Empower America. We
know there's a better way. 
<P>
Vin Weber

<H3>Clinton's First 100 Days</H3>
Bill Clinton now concedes that his presidency is off to a rough
start. The problem, the White House would have us believe, has
to do with a lack of &quot;agenda discipline,&quot; trying to
do too much too soon. Mr. Clinton's problems, however, run much
deeper. <I>His Administration is not working because his liberal
philosophy is not taking.</I>
<P>
At an April 28th press conference, Empower America released its
analysis, &quot;The Credibility Gap: The First 100 Days of the
Clinton Administration.&quot; Among the key points:
<P>
  1. The idea heavily marketed during the campaign that Mr. Clinton
was a &quot;New Democrat&quot; has been disproved.The gap between
candidate Clinton and President Clinton is rapidly becoming a
gulf. He has reversed himself on middle class tax cuts, free trade,
Haitian refugees, home ownership for lowincome Americans, and
tax funding for abortions, among other issues. This is part of
the reason why his opinion ratings are the lowest in history of
any president at a comparable point.
<P>
 2. The presupposition that guides the Clinton Administration's
policies is, as the President told a joint session of Congress,
&quot;government must do more.&quot; In Bill Clinton's America,
the federal government will tax more, spend more, regulate more&#151;and
the American people will depend on government more. The public's
increasing frustration and alienation toward government does not
square with President Clinton's vision of an everexpanding government.
<P>
  3. During the campaign Bill Clinton invoked the word &quot;change&quot;
like an incantation. He made a compelling case for &quot;reinventing
government.&quot; But he seems far less interested in reinventing
government than in reinflating it. President Clinton's budget
will increase spending almost $300 billion over the next five
years.
<P>
4. Bill Clinton's political career has been characterized by an
easy abandonment of commitments. Rather than allaying these concerns,
President Clinton has confirmed them through a series of welldocumented
policy reversals. Bill Clinton is coming dangerously close to
forfeiting a president's most precious political asset -- his
credibility with the American electorate.
<P>
5. President Clinton has failed to create a government that can
govern. Many agencies still lack key appointments. Meanwhile,
President Clinton's policies and tactics have galvanized the Republican
party to a remarkable degree while key Democrats are backing away
from many of the President's proposals.
<P>
The Clinton presidency is way off stride and on the defensive.
His Administration appears overwhelmed. Public skepticism is rising.
It is in the nation's best interest for Bill Clinton to purposefully
steer his presidency to the responsible center --  which after
all is how he got elected.
<P>

<H3>The American Scene: Leading Cultural Indicators</H3>
by William J. Bennett
<P>
The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, the most comprehensive
statistical portrait available of behavioral trends over the last
30 years, was released on March I 5th. The Index provides an empirical
analysis of the condition of modern American society.
<P>
The findings are troubling. Over the last three decades we have
experienced substantial social regression. Since 1960 there has
been a 560 percent increase in violent crime; more than a 400
percent increase in illegitimate births; a quadrupling in divorce
rates; a tripling of the percentage of children living in singleparent
homes; more than a 200 percent increase in the teenage suicide
rate; and a drop of almost 80 points in the average S.A.T. scores.

<P>
The Index does more than document cultural decline; it points
to some solutions. Cultural renewal depends above all on strengthening
and revitalizing our social and civic institutions -- families,
churches, schools, and neighborhoods. But government has a role to play. 
First, government should heed
the old injunction, &quot;Do no harm.&quot; The longterm impact
programs have on strengthening families, discouraging dependency
and criminal behavior, and encouraging educational achievement
should inform debate on social policy. Second, political leaders
should make use of their ability to shape attitudes through discourse
and legislation. Third, a legislative social agenda should emphasize
a tough and intelligent criminal justice system; radical education
reform (including school choice for public, private, and religious
schools); reversal of the destructive incentives of the welfare
system; removal of economic barriers to those living in poverty;
support of families by increasing the personal dependent exemption;
rescinding nofault divorce laws; removal of major obstacles to
adoption; improving child support collection; and encouraging
responsible fatherhood.
<P>
The Index struck a responsive chord with the public.  More than
70,000 people called to request copies of it. The Index also received
extensive media coverage, including 130 newspapers each with a
circulation over 100,000 and more than 500 newspapers overall;
and television, radio, and magazine coverage. It received favorable
coverage from the <I>Washington Post's </I>David Broder, the <I>Wall
Street Journal's</I> Paul Gigot, and nationally syndicated columnists
Mona Charen, Cal Thomas, Georgie Anne Geyer, Morton Kondracke,
Ben Wattenberg, and Richard Grenier.
<P>
Perhaps the most encouraging news is that there is a rough consensus
emerging about the nature of the cultural debate. Gerald Seib
wrote in the <I>Wall Street Journal </I>that recent writings on
social issues, including the Index, are &quot;starting to cause
ripples inside Washington, and in time are likely to transform
the standard liberalconservative debate over social policy.&quot;

<H3>It's the Economy, Stupid Not A Stupid Economy</H3>
by Jack Kemp
<P>
Conservative activists now have an opportunity to defeat President
Clinton's tax increases and to go to the American people with
a superior agenda for real jobs, real economic growth and renewed
American leadership in the global economy.
<P>
First, we must debunk Clinton's notion that higher taxes will
lead to a more prosperous America. In reality, higher taxes will
weaken the economy, reduce revenues and increase the deficit.
Never in American history have tax increases created jobs or economic
growth. 
<P>
<B>A ProGrowth Agenda</B>
<P>
Empower America believes we can reduce the size of government
and lower the deficit without raising taxes. At the same time,
we support a progrowth agenda that really puts people first, not
government.
<P>
Here are some ideas for a growth agenda:
<P>
 <I>&#149; </I><B>Encourage en&#166;repreneurship, saving, investment</B>
<P>
The best way to rekindle the job creating power of America's entrepreneurs
is to expand the supply of risk capital available to finance creative
new ideas and develop new products. All provisions in the tax
code affecting saving and investing should be immediately indexed
to stop the corrosive effect of inflation. This includes indexing
capital gains taxes, depreciation allowances, corporate tax rates,
and retirement plans, such as IRAs and 401Ks.
<P>
Ultimately, we should phase out the capital gains tax altogether
on longterm investments and eliminate it for anyone who works,
saves, or invests in America's lowincome communities.
<P>
<I>&#149; </I><B>Tax relief for families and working Americans</B>
<P>
We should advocate a flat, fair, and simple tax system that rewards
success instead of punishing it.
<P>
To spur job creation, the payroll tax, currently the greatest
burden on middle class families and small businesses, should be
reduced. Since the mid1960s, the payroll tax has more than doubled
from 7.25 percent to 15.3 percent today. Middle income families
now face an effective marginal tax rate on all income of over
30 percent, compared with less than 20 percent 30 years ago. Reducing
this tax would expand employment by lowering the cost of hiring
additional workers and increasing the reward for working for unemployed
Americans.
<P>
 We must also champion tax reform, such as raising the dependent
exemption, that recognizes the family as America's paramount valueshaping
institution. The moral, spiritual, and cultural health of our
nation is inextricably linked with the strength of the Amencan
family. That strength is being undermined by government policies,
both economic and social, which are biased against marriage and
famiiies with children.
<P>
<I>&#149; </I><B>Spending restraint</B>
<P>
Spending restraint and regulatory relief is a key part of our
philosophy of limited government. Government spending absorbs
valuable resources, often for inefficient and wasteful purposes.
<P>
While cutting wasteful spending, there must also be strong budget
caps to restrain the growth of government spending. Capping the
rate of entitlement growth, except Social Security, at inflation
plus population growth,would save more than $250 billion over
five years.
<P>
However, real spending control requires institutional changes
to enforce accountability in the federal budget process, including
a lineitem veto to help balance the budget without raising taxes.
<P>
<B>* Free Trade</B>
<P>
Opentrading policies helped expand the global export market to
$3.1 trillion by 1989. Mr. Clinton is dangerously reversing course
by threatening trade wars with Europe and Japan.
<P>
The key to U.S. and global economic growth lies in opening new
markets to goods and services. Passing a clean, mutually beneficial
North American Free Trade Agreement and completing the floundering
Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is
a top priority.
<P>
The next step is to negotiate marketopening trade agreements culminating
in a hemispheric freetrade zone. Our ultimate goal should be to
incorporate the Pacific Rim nations, Russia and other former communist
states into an open global trading system.
<P>
Clinton's farleft liberal policies must be stopped to prevent
them from hurting America.  Now is the time for us to once again
raise the banner of economic growth, low taxes, limited government,
strong families and equality of opportunity for all. Nothing could
produce a sharper contrast with the policies of the Clinton administration.
<P>

<H3>NATIONAL SECURITY FOR THE '90s</H3>
By Jeane Kirkpatrick
<P>
There have been three great watersheds in the twentieth century&#151;moments
when the world came apart and recreated itself.
<P>
The first occured in the wake of World War I, and like today,
the optimistic trend in Europe was to a continent of democratic
governments. But in the decades that followed, Lenin in Russia,
Hitler in Germany, and Mussolini in Italy were able to seize power.
In each case, resurgent nationalism and a tradition of authoritarianism
played a role. In each case, the world stood by as democracy floundered.
And in each case, the cost of failed democracy proved incredibly
high. World War II, the Holocaust, and the Cold War were only
part of the price. The replacement of new democracies with Bolsheviks,
Fascists, and Nazis was wholly unexpected. It should prompt us
to ask ourselves now: what could happen that we do not expect?
<P>
The second watershed of the century occurred following World War
II. After Eastem Europe was conquered by the Soviets, the democracies
<I>did </I>act to prevent Westem Europe from the incorporation
into the Soviet bloc. U.S. resistance &#151; in the form of the
Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan and NATO&#151;stopped the Soviet's
westward drive. NATO succeeded in providing a framework for democracy,
development, and stability because it was an organization of democracies
around the principle of collective security. Each time a former
dictatorship&#151;Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece&#151;was
incorporated into NATO after they established democratic institutions,
the belief that membership in NATO reinforced democracy was reiterated.
<P>
Now, in the wake of the collapse of Communism and the end of the
period of Soviet military threat, we have arrived at the third
great watershed. It is a moment of possibility when the world
is creating itself again. The transition of the former communist
states from totalitarianism to democracy, and from command to
market economies has already proved more complex and difficult
than was generally anticipated. The consequences of failure could
be catastrophic, yet no innovative Westem response comparable
to the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, NATO, or the Common
Market has been forthcoming. <I>It is critically important that
we make room for the new democracies in Western institutions.</I>
<P>
Now is the time to think about collective security. The U.S. and
the democracies helped create the context for the defeat of Communist
governments by providing an altemative model of more successful
societies and by maintaining military strength. But the peoples
of Central and Eastem Europe were not liberated by foreign armies,
but by their own efforts. They are already our allies in SpiIit.
We should make them allies and trading partners in fact.
<P>
After World War II, we believed that institutionalized association
with other democracies would reinforce habits of constitutional
rule and peaceful cooperation. We were right. It is time to apply
the lessons.
<P>

TAXING FAMILIES FIRST
<P>
<B>Bill Clinton wants the largest tax increase in American history.</B>
<P>
Bill Clinton plans to hike taxes $328 billion between 1994 and
1998.
<P>
This means Bill Clinton wants the American taxpayers to send an
extra $7,488,584 an hour to Washington,D.C. --  that's $124,809
a minute!
<P>
The average family of four will pay $904 more in taxes per year.
The average New Jersey family will pay $1,276 more. (source: The
Tax Foundation, February 24, 1993)
<P>
<B>Energy taxes will hit the middle class first.</B>
<P>
A typical middle income family will pay about $500 more a year
in energy taxes under the Clinton proposal.
<P>
Gasoline taxes will go up 8 to 12 cents a gallon.
<P>
The Clinton energy tax will cost $50 billion and 600,000 jobs.(source:
Institute for Research on the Economics of 
<P>
Taxation, March 19, 1993; the National Association of Manufactures,
New York Times, May 6, 1993) 
<P>
<B>Taxes on Social Security benefits for middle class retired
Americans will skyrocket 70%.</B>
<P>
Bill Clinton wants to raise the maximum taxabte amount of Social
Security benefits from 50% to 85% for those individuals making
over $25,000; and for couples making over $32,000.
<P>
For some retirees, this could amount to $2,700 a year&#151;or
$225 per month. (source: U.S. Sentate Republican Policy Committee,
March 17, 1993)
<P>
<B>Small businesses and farmers will be plowed under. </B>
<P>
Small business owners will be the victims of Bill Clinton's new
36% tax bracket, not the rich. 
<P>
Of all income tax returns reporting earninl s over $100,000, 52%
are smail businesses. 
<P>
American farmers will owe about $1 billion more a year in taxes.

<P>
Taxes on the typical mediumsized farm will increase by $1,600.(source:
&quot;A Vision for Stagnation&quot;, Joint EconomicCommittee,
April 1993)
<P>
<B>Jobs will be lost and gone.</B>
<P>
Over the next five years, 1.4 million fewer jobs will be created,
and total wages in the economy 
<P>
will be $483 billion lower.(source: National Center for policy
Analysis, March 11, 1993)
<P>
An estimated 1.1 million jobs will be lost by 1996.<B> </B>(source:DRI/McGraw-Hill,
New York Times, March 18, 1993)
<P>
<B>After all this, the nation will go deeper in debt.</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>New technologies will continue to be powerful agents of growth

<BR>
Led by Senior Fellow <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A>, the program
examines how new technologies are transforming business, education, government,
and society. Among other issues the program explores government telecommunications
policy and the role of technology in reforming institutions such as the
legal profession. Other Discovery Fellows working in the program include
Frank Gregorsky, <A HREF="gidari.html">Albert Gidari</A>, <A HREF="katz.html">Roberta

<A HREF="perelman.html">Lewis Perelman</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Properly enabled, new technology is a still unimagined boon. In books such
as <I><A HREF="books.html">MICROCOSM</A>, <A HREF="schlsout.html">SCHOOL'S
OUT</A>, <A HREF="life-tv.html">LIFE AFTER TELEVISION</A></I>, and, soon,
<I>TELECOSM</I>, Gilder and other Discovery Fellows are defining the issues,
as well as the opportunities, arising in this increasingly influential field.

<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>Rising distrust of government threatens to demoralize our system of representative
democracy. Headeded by Discovery Institute president <A HREF="chapman.html">Bruce
Chapman,</A> the program identifies the origins of this threat in the decline
of civics instruction, diminished rewards for virtue in public life, the
unintended consequences of the political reform movement, and the over-reaching
ambition of government itself.<BR>
<BR>
The program aims to restaste the purposes of robust and effective representative
democracy, advocating a &quot;reform of the reforms,&quot; strengthened
political parties, and revived commitment to public service. Discovery Fellows
involved in the program include <A HREF="gold.html">Dr. Philip Gold</A>,

<B>How to protect the natural environment without sacrificing the human
environment is one of the most difficult, and divisive, issues of recent
times. Bureaucratic approahces to environmental protectiona have failed,
and the program seeks new solutions that heed economic and social consequences
while providing positive incentives to engage in environmentally sound behavior.

<BR>
Among the Discovery Fellows working on environmental subjects is <A HREF="plummer.html">Dr.
Mark L. Plummer,</A> co-author of </B><A HREF="bookordr.html"><B><I>Noah's
Choice</I>,</B></A><B> and the author of a forthcoming book on biodiversity,
<A HREF="gidari.html">Albert Gidari</A>, and <A HREF="larson.html">Edward
Larson</A>. This project, and those of other Discovery Fellows, should help
us bring people together to search for environmental goals and methods that
stand a chance of finding broad agreement. </B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>The Discovery Institute invites a number of distinguished
visitors to meet with Discovery Fellows and members over dinners and luncheons
during the course of the year. These events allow an easy but structured
conversation among community leaders, Discovery Fellows, Discovery members
and our guests -- usually prominent writers, political figures, scholars,
or media representatives. Past speakers have included Jack Kemp, Dick Cheney,
and Thomas Sowell.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><CENTER>WILL THE INTERNET COLLAPSE? NO WAY!</CENTER>
</H3>
What is all this commotion in Massachusetts? The very source of the Arpanet
at Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman--the cradle of the Internet--Massachusetts
is falling to the forces of Auntie Spiker and Aunt Sponge.<BR>
<BR>
These are the mingy ladies in the Roald Dahl story who rejoiced in James's
Giant Peach as long as it didn't take flight. Now Massachusetts--the state
that once barred Apple shares as a likely West Coast levitation scam--looks
askance at the Giant Peach of the Internet, aloft in Silicon Valley and
around the globe, with James Clark, James Gosling, Netscape and a series
of thin-air IPOs.<BR>
<BR>
Howard Anderson of Boston's Yankee Group, long an Internet tout, thinks
those wired yahoos on Wall Street and Sand Hill Road are blind to the inevitable
sine waves of advance: What goes up must come down, he sternly avers, trying
to bring some simple physics to the scene, as if the Internet has to obey
the law of gravity.<BR>
<BR>
And now Bob Metcalfe--Metcalfe himself!--inventor of Ethernet, pioneer of
Arpanet and the founding father of the networking era. Here he is, prophesying
lugubriously into every megaphone he can grasp, from the New York Times
Magazine and PBS to U.S. News &amp; World Report and InfoWorld, that the
Internet will collapse in 1996. Metcalfe now predicts a general retreat
to Intranets, shielded from the public system and unavailable to it.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe was striking a blow against the very solar plexus of my prophecies.
I had founded my confidence in the Internet on the continuing power of the
law of the telecosm, an edict adapted from Metcalfe's very own law of networks.
Metcalfe's Law ordains that the value of a network rises by the square of
the number of terminals attached to it.<BR>
<BR>
In its most basic form, this law merely captures the exponential rise in
the value of any network device, such as a telephone, with the rise in the
number of other such devices reachable by it. Metcalfe, however, shrewdly
added in the declining cost of Ethernet adapters and other network gear
as the Net expanded. In the law of the telecosm, I summed up these and other
learning-curve factors by incorporating into Metcalfe's Law the law of the
microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the power-delay product in semiconductors, the law of the microcosm
ordains that the cost-effectiveness of the terminals will rise by the square
of the number of additional transistors integrated on a single chip. Amplified
by the law of the microcosm, the law of the telecosm signifies the rise
in the cost-effectiveness of a network in proportion to the resources deployed
on it and the number of potential nodes and routers available to it.<BR>
<BR>
As the network expands, each new computer both uses it as a resource and
contributes resources to it. This is the secret of the stability of the
Internet. The very process of growth that releases avalanches of new traffic
onto the Net precipitates a cascade of new capacity at Internet service
providers (ISPs). They supply new servers and routers, open new routes and
pathways for data across the Web, and buy new terminals and edge switches
to upgrade their connections to the Network Access Points (NAPs), the Internet
supernodes that in turn exert pressure on the backbone vendors to expand
their own bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Because all these routes and resources are interlinked, they are available
to absorb excess traffic caused by outages, crashes or congestion elsewhere
on the Net. Because all these resources are growing in cost-effectiveness
at the exponential pace of the law of the microcosm, and total available
bandwidth on the Net is rising at the still-faster pace of the law of the
telecosm, the Internet has been able to double in size annually since 1970
and increase its traffic two times faster still, without suffering any crippling
crashes beyond the Morris worm of 1988.<BR>
<BR>
Impelling the growth of the largest interconnected network, the law of the
telecosm means that the most open computer networks will prevail. Proprietary
networks lose to a worldwide web.<BR>
<BR>
<B>LOADED FOR BEAR </B><BR>
<BR>
I wanted to answer Metcalfe's challenge. As the apparent winner of a previous
argument over ATM and Ethernet [see Forbes ASAP, &quot;Metcalfe's Law and
Legacy,&quot; Sept. 13, 1993], I thought I might have an edge (after all,
Fast Ethernet outsells ATM at least 20 to 1). But when he met me on a rainy
day late in May at his Boston townhouse on Beacon Street, where he looks
benevolently across the Charles at the mit campus, Metcalfe was loaded for
Internet bear. At the peak of his influence, this smiling cover boy of June's
ieee Spectrum, winner of the 1996 ieee Medal of Honor, was ready to explain.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I am way out on a limb here,&quot; he says over sushi and wasabi at
a restaurant near his house. &quot;I actually told a World Wide Web conference
I would eat my column if the Internet didn't collapse....<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do I mean by a collapse? Well, the FCC requires telcos to report
all outages that affect more than 50,000 lines for more than an hour. I
mean something much bigger than that.&quot; I suggested that with enough
raw tuna and wasabi, his column would go down well. But Metcalfe was dead
serious.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet will collapse and it will be good for us, and for the Net.
&quot;The collapse has a purpose. The Internet is currently in the clutches
of superstition, promoted by a bio-anarchic intelligentsia, which holds
that the Net is wonderfully chaotic and brilliantly biological, and homeopathically
self-healing by processes of natural selection and osmosis. The purpose
of the collapse will be to discredit this ideology.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What the Internet is--surprise, surprise--is a network of computers.
It needs to be managed, engineered and financed as a network of computers
rather than as an unfathomable biological organism.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's intellectual targets are not hard to find. He dubs them the &quot;Wired
intelligentsia, epitomized by Nicholas Negroponte,&quot; and, one supposes,
author/editor Kevin Kelly and hippie mystic seer John Perry Barlow, celebrating
a &quot;neo-biological civilization out of control.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For example, at a recent meeting of NANOG (North American Network Operations
Group), whenever Metcalfe brought up the problems of Internet management--the
need for a settlements-and-payments process so that people who invest in
the Net backbone can get their money back--&quot;they kept telling me to
get lost.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They'd tell me, 'You just don't get it, do you?' This is the worst
possible charge of the politically correct: 'You just don't get it.' The
implication is that I am a clueless newbie.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But I am not a newbie and I do get it: an accelerating pattern of
wild behavior on the Internet [caused by] a breakdown of any relationship
between supply and demand for Internet services, any way of metering usage,
any method of paying back people who invest in the backbone. One thing is
sure: They will not be paid by biofeedback loops.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The result is bad--the deterioration of the public Internet and the
rise of private Intranets. These are not really part of the Internet at
all. Many of them use 'hot potato routing,' throwing any messages from nonsubscribers
back into the pot. It is a tragedy of the commons, a shrinkage of the public
network on which we all ultimately depend.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Since I had frequently cited Metcalfe's Law as an answer to &quot;The Tragedy
of the Commons&quot; argument, this charge hit home.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe warns that &quot;back when Internet backbones carried 15 terabytes
of traffic per month, the world's Ethernet capacity was 15 exabytes per
month, a million times higher.&quot; (Exabytes, if you wonder, add up. While
a terabyte is a 1 with 12 zeros after it, an exabyte commands 18 zeros.)
But those were last year's numbers. Carrier of some 40% of backbone traffic,
MCI now reports 250 terabytes per month. Just a small shift in local traffic
onto the public Net can create catastrophic cascades of congestion.<BR>
<BR>
With private networks increasingly becoming TCP/IP Intranets that can use
the Internet but shield their resources from it by &quot;firewalls,&quot;
the likelihood of a crippling cascade from private to public Nets grows
more acute every day. According to Metcalfe, one way or another, such a
disaster is now at hand.<BR>
<BR>
His primary evidence is data from the Routing Arbiter at Merit (the Michigan
group that commands routing servers at every NAP and collects Internet statistics
by &quot;pinging&quot; routers across the Net every few minutes). Merit's
pings yield an echo of chaos: &quot;a dramatic, accelerating rise of packet
losses, delays and routing instability. This data is available on the Net.
But the Merit people are afraid of making waves, offending the big carriers,
so they don't really tell anyone how bad it is.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I ask my readers [at InfoWorld], and they tell me they think the Net
has already collapsed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As the North American guild of network operators, what does NANOG need?
I asked. &quot;One thing NANOG definitely needs,&quot; sums up Metcalfe,
&quot;is more people in suits.&quot; The trouble with NANOG is that it is
full of biomystics with big beards and Birkenstocks who look like Bob Metcalfe
did when he finally got his Ph.D. from Harvard after a dramatic setback
the year before, when his thesis board flunked him at the last minute.<BR>
<BR>
(Perhaps it was because he &quot;hated Harvard&quot; and spent all his time
at mit and Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman, laying the foundations for the Internet
with Larry Roberts rather than sitting humbly at the feet of Crimson computer
scientists refining their professorial perks and queues. Republished in
June under the title Packet Communication, with a new introduction from
the author, Metcalfe's thesis is now recognized as a classic text on networking
that anticipated most of the evolution from the Arpanet to the Internet.
In the front of the new edition is a picture of Metcalfe as a newbie at
the Harvard commencement, with a big beard and a weird shirt and jacket,
looking kind of like a bio-anarchic, Harvard-hating Hawaiian homeopath himself,
ready to help start the Internet movement back in 1973.)<BR>
<BR>
What does this all mean? The conversion of Bill Gates into an Internet obsessive.
The jeremiads of Metcalfe, one of my favorite people in the industry, both
as a technical seer and conservative economic voice in a webby-minded wilderness.
What do I make of the descent into vapor of several of my favored technologies
and the admitted biodegradation of the Net?<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEW SCARCITY, NEW ABUNDANCE</B><BR>
<BR>
Rather than debating this apparent jumble of conjectures--and for a second
time jousting with the Olympian Metcalfe--I would instead transcend the
details in a larger theme: Marking every industrial and economic transformation
are new forms of scarcity and new forms of abundance.<BR>
<BR>
Economics has been termed the dismal science of scarcity. Indeed, scarcity
is at the heart of most economic models; many of my critics still live in
the grip of the dismal scarcities and zero sums of pre-Netic economics.
But what is the controlling scarcity of an information age? In the Industrial
Age, natural resources and real estate were scarce. But Julian Simon of
the University of Maryland has shown that, as manifested by falling real
prices, all natural resources, such as foodstuffs, minerals, clean air and
available water and energy, have been increasing in abundance over the last
century.<BR>
<BR>
If conventional resources are becoming more abundant, what is the ruling
scarcity of the information era? Is it information? Hardly. The information
glut has become a ruling clich&Egrave;. As all resources--from energy to
information--become more abundant, the pressure of economic scarcity falls
ever more heavily on one key residual, and that single shortage looms ever
more stringent and controlling. The governing scarcity of the information
economy is time: the shards of a second, the hours in a day, the years in
a life, the latency of memory, the delay in aluminum wires, the time to
market, the time to metastasis, the time to retirement.<BR>
<BR>
The ruling scarcities in the economy of time, however, can be distilled
to two commanding limits: the speed of light and the span of life. They
form the boundaries of all enterprise.<BR>
<BR>
The speed of light is the most basic constraint in information technology.
As a key limit, the speed of light shapes the future architectures and topologies
of computers and communications. For example, the light-speed limit dictates
that the fastest computers will tend to be the smallest computers. Electrons
move nine inches a nanosecond (a billionth of a second). As computers move
toward gigahertz clock rates--a billion cycles a second--the longest data
path must be decisively smaller than nine inches. Pulses of electromagnetic
energy--photons--take some 20 milliseconds to cross the country and one-quarter
second to reach a satellite in geostationary orbit (as you notice in a satellite
phone call). At a gigabit per second, this means that as many as 250 megabits
of data--many thousands of IP packets, for example--can be latent (or lost)
in transit at any time, thus playing havoc with most prevalent network protocols,
such as TCP.<BR>
<BR>
Thus light speed is a centrifuge. It abhors concentration in one place,
ordains that these small supercomputers will be distributed across the globe
and will always be near to a network node. Although the networks will be
global in reach, they will depend on the principle of locality: the tendency
of memory or network accesses to focus on clusters of contiguous addresses
at any one time. Light speed imposes limits on the pace of any one processor
or conduit, and pushes both computer and communications technologies into
increasingly parallel and redundant architectures.<BR>
<BR>
As a governing scarcity in the new economy, no less important than the speed
of light is the span of life. Just as light speed represents the essential
limits of information technology, lifespan defines the essential shortage
of human time. Although medical and other health-related advances have increased
the span of life in the United States some 5 years in the last 25--while
the media focused on aids and cancer, and zero-sum pundits declared that
our descendants, the scions of our science, will live less well than we
do--the ultimate lifespan remains limited. Indeed, the modal economic activity
of the information economy is exploitation of the technologies of the speed
of light to increase the effective span of life by increasing efficiency
in the use of time.<BR>
<BR>
GDP and other economic numbers from the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) totally miss the minting of new time through innovation: the opening
of parallel universes of choice in ideas, courses, arts, letters, entertainments,
therapies and communities. Finding stagnation and poverty and agonizing
over new wealth, Morgan Stanley gapologist Stephen Roach plumbs the shallows
of NIPA for all the world like the CIA economists who found the Soviets
exceeding the United States in growth for 17 years. Video teleconferencing,
telecommuting, teleputing, digital wireless telephony, Internet mail, cybercommerce,
telemedicine and teleducation all are in the process of compressing the
span of life toward the increasingly thronged channels of the speed of light.<BR>
<BR>
If time is scarce, what is the growing and defining source of abundance
among all the material abundances in the information economy? Signifying
the definitive abundance in any economic era is the plummeting price of
a key factor of production. In order to grow fast, every new-era company
must exploit the drop in the cost of the newly abundant resource. Companies
that use the resource that is plummeting in cost will gain market share
against all other companies and will come increasingly to dominate the economy.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FROM WATTS TO MIPS AND BITS</B><BR>
<BR>
Over the last hundred years, there have been three such economic eras. The
industrial era fed on the plummeting price of physical force or energy,
best measured in watts. Some 30 years ago, with the regulatory sclerosis
of the nuclear and natural gas industries, the price of watts began to plateau,
dropping less than 0.7% per year for the last 35 years. The last 30 years
brought the reign of the microcosm, which fed on the plummeting price of
transistors, manifested in the exponential drop in the cost of computer
MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and memory bits. For the last
30 years, the price of a bit of semiconductor memory has dropped 68% per
year. With this year's decline in DRAM prices, the trend line is being resumed
after a four-year hiatus. The likely result is a sharp upside surprise in
PC sales--and thus in chips--through 1997.<BR>
<BR>
As fast as the price of MIPS and bits continues to drop, however, this Moore's
Law trend line will no longer dominate the economy. Like a great river headed
for a falls, a new factor of production is racing toward a historic cliff
of costs. Over the next 30 years, the spearhead of wealth creation will
be the telecosm, marked by the plummeting cost of bandwidth--communications
power--measured in gigabits per second.<BR>
<BR>
This result means that the growth of bandwidth will outpace the growth of
processor power. After an entire career keyed on Moore's Law, Bill Gates
remains skeptical, foreseeing an era of middleband nets, with shared cables
bogging down in gigabytes from tomcruise. com/vrml and fiber gushing into
twisted copper cul-de-sacs. The usually savvy Network Computing columnist
Bill Frezza believes that bandwidth is inherently a slower-moving technology
than processing, because bandwidth has to be delivered at once to an entire
area while processors can be sold one at a time. Robert Lucky, Bell system
laureate, and Paul Green of IBM debated these points two decades ago. Stressing
the dependence of bandwidth on the labor-intensive digging of trenches and
stretching of wires across continents and under seabeds, Lucky doubted that
communications could ever be truly cheap. Paul Green, a computer network
man, thought that digital computer communications could join the Moore's
Law learning curve.<BR>
<BR>
The evidence mounts that Green was more than right. Impressed by Green's
own achievements in fiber optics, Lucky now acknowledges that communications
power will grow at least tenfold more than computing power over the next
decade. Using the rough metric of Moore's Law, computer power doubles every
18 months. Bandwidth is now doubling at least every year. Over a 10-year
period, this means a hundredfold rise in computer power and at least a thousandfold
rise in bandwidth, measured at any point in the network from the home to
the backbone.<BR>
<BR>
The reason communications power has lagged behind computer power is not
the difference in technology but in regulation. Moore's Law in bandwidth
has given way to what venture capitalist Roger McNamee calls Moron's Law,
the labyrinthine tangle of tariffs and rulings and FCC dockets that frustrate
the implementation of communications advances. With an acceleration of technology
and a tsunami of new Internet demand for bandwidth, this bottleneck is breaking
at last.<BR>
<BR>
Backbone capacity is leaping upward today. As TCP/IP coinventor Vinton Cerf
of MCI told Forbes ASAP in December, his company correctly predicted its
backbone bandwidth would increase from 45 megabits per second to 155 megabits
per second this year, or by a factor of nearly four. But on March 11, MCI
Vice-President of Enterprise Marketing Stephen VonRump told Gordon Cook
of the Cook Report on the Internet that MCI will jack up the speeds to 622
megabits per second before the end of the year, or nearly fifteenfold in
one year. Meanwhile, cable modems, telco Digital Subscriber Line technologies
(from HDSL to ADSL and SDSL) and digital wireless advances promise even
larger factors of expansion in the bandwidth to homes, though unlike the
backbone expansion, the impact will be incremental.<BR>
<BR>
Shaping the future, however, will be breakthroughs in laboratories. As &quot;Into
the Fibersphere&quot; maintained, the ultimate source of bandwidth expansion
is the immense capacity of optical fiber. Now comprising a global installed
base of 40 million miles (some 25 million miles in North America), each
optical fiber, as Paul Green of IBM estimated to Forbes ASAP four years
ago, commands an intrinsic available bandwidth of 25,000 gigahertz. At the
time, the world record transmission over a significant distance was still
approximately 20 gigabits per second, and the highest deployed capacity
was just 2.5 gigabits per second. Moreover, the light pulses had to be converted
to electronic pulses every 50 to 70 kilometers to amplify and regenerate
the signal. This electronic bottleneck restricted the speed of long-distance
transmission to the maximum speed of the optoelectronics, or some 10 gigahertz.
So Green's projections provoked incredulity in many quarters.<BR>
<BR>
Early this year, however, Green's visions were becoming more plausible.
On Feb. 26, 1996, at the conference on Optical Fiber Communication (OFC
'96) in San Jose, Calif., papers from Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs, Fujitsu
and NTT Labs all reported successful transmissions at a landmark rate of
a terabit per second, one twenty-fifth of Green's limit. For these terabit
rates, Fujitsu and Bell Labs used between 50 and 55 separate bitstreams
or wavelengths, each some 20 gigabits per second. NTT, which employed 10
separate bitstreams, also reported diffraction grating receivers that could
resolve 64 different wavelengths at once.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, erbium-doped fiber amplifiers were smashing the electronic
bottleneck. Impelled by a pump laser (light amplification by stimulated
emission of radiation), these all-optical amplifiers are now being deployed
in networks around the world. They open a new era. Simple broadband amplifiers
made of a coiled fiber thread, they replace optoelectronic repeaters comprising
nine custom bipolar microchips that must be duplicated for every frequency
or modulation scheme used in the fiber. Thus the new amplifiers make possible
the creation of vast broadband fiber networks bearing hundreds or even thousands
of separate carriers, and permit the sending of thousands of separate messages
around the globe or under the seas entirely on wings of light. The bandwidth
of these all-optical amplifiers is now up to 4.5 terahertz, or close to
20% of Green's estimated limit.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate capacity of fiber is not a merely academic issue. At a rate
of 4,000 miles a day, fiber deployment is beginning to make a dent in neighborhoods.
David Charlton of Corning estimates that over the past five years, the top
10% of U.S. households, comprising most of the early technology adopters,
have drastically improved their access to fiber. Five years ago these homes
were, on average, 1,000 households away from a fiber node; this year, they
are just 100 households away. Milo Medin of @Home estimates that 15% of
U.S. cable TV subscribers had systems directly connected to fiber nodes
at the beginning of 1996. By the end of the year, that number will be close
to one-third.<BR>
<BR>
Hostility to cable TV remains high and politically useful; many city governments
subsist on cable TV franchise fees and regulate these companies into a stupor.
Eerily mimicking computer experts of the 1960s who attested that telephone
wires were too beset with noise and interference to carry digital data,
telco experts today pronounce cable plant entirely unsuited for Internet
bits. But the fact remains that cable TV coax is the only truly broadband
link already in most U.S. homes.<BR>
<BR>
Flaws in the transmission of analog video, in which every glitch of interference
is visible on the screen, fall away in digital systems that can deliver
flawless images at a signal-to-noise ratio more than 1,000 times lower.
Directv, for example, does not outperform cable TV because it is harder
to send a signal a few thousand feet down a coaxial cable than to zap it
to a satellite 23,600 miles away, beam it to an 18-inch dish on a roof,
then send it down a coaxial cable to your TV. The superiority of Directv
derives from its digital nature. Essentially, the picture is created in
the set rather than at the station. Using a variety of new cable modems,
possibly including Cisco and Terayon's CDMA for upstream signals (CDMA finesses
interfering frequencies by spreading codes through them all), cable TV plant
will prove to be entirely adequate for digital transmissions, both upstream
and downstream.<BR>
<BR>
But what about switching, ask the critics of cable? Claude Shannon of mit
and Bell Labs, the inventor of information theory, had the answer in 1948:
Bandwidth is a replacement for switching. Rather than performing the processing
at some central point, you use routers in the Net and filters in the terminals.
If you have adequate bandwidth, you can emulate any switching topology you
want. Cable commands a potential of some 8 gigabits per second of two-way
bandwidth. Linked to the potential terabits of fiber bandwidth, cable plant
has as much chance of accommodating the explosive growth of the Internet
as the telcos do. <BR>
<BR>
The two essential models for the distribution of information are select
and switch or broadcast and select. Select and switch is based on intelligence
in central servers that search databases for desired material, and on intelligence
in switches that channel the material to the desired address. Select and
switch uses computer power at the servers and switches to compensate for
the lack of bandwidth on the network and the lack of storage and processing
power in the terminals. By contrast, broadcast and select is based on bandwidth
in the network and on intelligence and storage in the terminals. <BR>
<BR>
Envisaging video servers, information warehouses and other centralized schemes,
select and switch is the model pursued by much of the industry today. In
some schemes, agents from networked terminals search through large banks
of data looking for specified items, which are switched through the network
to the terminals. Computers reach out and grab data they need from servers
with large storage facilities.<BR>
<BR>
Epitomized by the World Wide Web today, the marvels of this select-and-switch
model are evident to us all. It is far superior for personal two-way communications
and one-to-one file transfers. But it is not superior for everything, as
companies trying to send movies point-to-point over ATM switches discovered
in Orlando and elsewhere. The success of select and switch, using the storage
of servers, has been too total for the health of the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
In its extreme form, select and switch contravenes the laws of the microcosm
and telecosm. These laws will increase storage at the terminals far faster
than at the centralized server and will expand the network's bandwidth faster
than its switching capability. For many uses, the broadcast-and-select method
is appropriate--indeed, inevitable--and its spread will relieve many of
the pressures on Internet capacity.<BR>
<BR>
Broadcast and select is the system used in wavelength division multiplexing
systems in the new multi-bitstream terabit-per-second fiber tests. Broadcast
and select conforms closely with the strengths of the cable system. In late
April, for example, Wave Systems (where I serve as a director) launched
its Cablepc project in the heart of Silicon Valley with the Palo Alto Cable
Co-op. Supporting the test are 26 other companies with equipment and services,
including cable modems from Com21 and En Technology; a merchandising engine
from Zero.one; the Destination PC/TV from Gateway 2000; game machines from
mak Technologies; and content from Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive, Network
News, William Morris Agency, Microsoft's interactive software arm and an
array of CD-ROM publishers. <BR>
<BR>
This system uses cable bandwidth to broadcast huge amounts of digital information
and entertainment. Originating anywhere from the World Wide Web and Directv
satellites to CD-ROMs on a PC, the rush of bits will be filtered and downloaded
by the PC at the programmable specifications of the viewer. Customers pay
for material by the piece and only when they choose to decrypt it through
an onboard &quot;credit chip&quot; or WaveMeter that may be periodically
tapped over telephone lines from a transaction center. Rather than millions
of people downloading new versions of Netscape one at a time over 28.8 modems,
for example, you can program your machine to download all new Netscape browser
releases to your hard drive when they are broadcast, probably late at night.
The next day you can decide whether to buy, save or delete the program.
Explains new Wave Systems president Steven Sprague, &quot;This system creates
a new channel where the customer pays only for what is used, when it is
used, and the owner of intellectual property benefits from each use.&quot;<BR>

Together with systems of mirroring, replicating and local buffering being
pioneered by @Home, the Cablepc project is one of many ways to use cable
bandwidth to relieve pressure on the Net and to exploit the ever-rising
intelligence and storage in the terminals. Other broadcast-and-select systems
include PointCast for the PC, which uses the screensaver as a way to display
programmably filtered news and other information. Another large contribution
of broadcast-and-select bandwidth for the WWW will come from digital satellite
systems, such as Directv, that devote channels to Internet services.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, coming to the rescue of the Net backbone are an array of technologies
incorporating asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), an elaborate set of standards
for broadband switching. Supported by some 800 companies in the ATM Forum,
ATM resembles RISC (reduced instruction set computer), which accelerates
speeds by making all instructions the same length and processing them in
silicon. Similarly, ATM breaks all data into 53 byte cells, small enough
to be processed in a semiconductor chip at speeds fast enough to accept
voice, video or data at once. Conceived as an end-to-end system from your
phone or PC through the &quot;cloud&quot; to your Internet service provider
and beyond, ATM seems a panacea for the protocol zoo emerging in data communications.<BR>
<BR>
ATM to the desktop faces dire challenges, however. Paul Green noticed that
the most popular booth at the early May ATM Year '96 conference in San Jose
was by a company called Ipsilon. Now partnering with Hitachi, Ipsilon makes
an IP switch that dispenses with all ATM software and uses ATM cells only
for fast hardware switching. Similarly, NetStar [see Forbes ASAP, &quot;Angst
and Awe on the Internet,&quot; Dec. 4, 1995], now being purchased by Ascend
Communications for $300 million in stock, offers an IP crossbar switch in
gallium arsenide with a backplane throughput of 16 gigabits per second.
Meanwhile, vendors of Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet attracted increasing
attention. Why transform your network when you can get most of the advantages
of ATM through new forms of Ethernet and TCP/IP? But in one form or another,
ATM switches are still the fastest switches and use their advantage in silicon
integration to dominate the top-of-the-line slots in the backbone of the
Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>REVENGE OF BEARDS AND BIRKENSTOCKS</B><BR>
<BR>
The readers of Forbes ASAP will recall Gordon Jacobson and Avi Freedman,
East Coast ISPs who have graced these pages contemplating a national network.
Tonight, in New York, they are debating the future of the Net with each
other and with two executives from a San Diego company called AtmNet who
have similar ambitions. I am there to get a view from the pits of the Internet
on Metcalfe's lament. Jacobson has a problem, though. He wants to take us
to Le Colonial on East 57th Street, which he describes as the hottest bar
and best French-Vietnamese restaurant in the city. But the bearded Avi Freedman
has shown up in a green T-shirt and Birkenstock sandals, which won't cut
it at Le Colonial.<BR>
<BR>
A second-floor hideaway, Le Colonial looks like Rick's place in Casablanca,
so they say, and it sounds like a bar on the Champs-Elysees. More important
to guru Gordon, it allows him to flaunt a tycoon's cigar, unlike P.J. Clarke's,
his other favored haunt, which has succumbed to nicotine correctness since
Dan Jenkins's novel on the Giants, Semi-Tough, celebrated its smoke and
grit. Unlike P.J. Clarke's with its elderly Irish trolls, Gordon tells us,
Le Colonial offers &quot;the most beautiful bartender in all New York. You
got to see her.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Avi, though, has more important things on his mind. Polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
They're a dilemma, those polynomials. But Gordon decides to act anyway.
We will start out with dinner at Clarke's and then move on to Le Colonial
for after-dinner drinks. At the bar, Le Colonial will tolerate the T-shirt,
and perhaps, with adequate lubrication, we will be able to relieve the pressure
of the polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet is in the process of a horizontal explosion, with new network
exchange points popping up everywhere--two in L.A., one each in Tucson,
Phoenix, Atlanta, Cincinnati--you name it, a hundred or more network exchange
facilities coming online. AtmNet is beginning one in San Diego and has plans
to participate in those in L.A.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the P.J. Clarke's waiter, delivering salad with home fries well
done and a Diet Pepsi, is struggling with the demands of serving different
meals to five customers (that's 25 different possibilities). With mental
buffers overflowing and packet losses mounting, he resolves on a polling
algorithm, offering the plate to each of us around the table before settling
on Avi. Gordon is looking worried; Avi is questioning his confidence that
ATM switching can resolve most of the complexity problems on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SEX AND POLYNOMIALS AT LE COLONIAL</B><BR>
<BR>
I ask whether the problem arises from scanty RAM buffers in the Cisco routers.
Avi says no. An entire global routing table still takes just 14 megabytes
and virtually everyone on the Net can now handle that. Soon they will be
able to handle a gigabyte of routes, no sweat, enough to deal with any foreseeable
growth of the Net. Yes, I observe, it's exponential; I talk about it all
the time. No, Avi corrects me, complexity growth is not exponential. It
is polynomial.<BR>
<BR>
This problem will have to wait, however, says Gordon, hailing the waiter.
It's time to leave for Le Colonial. Gordon wants Jim Browning and John Mevi
of AtmNet to explain how their ATM systems can transcend all these complexities.<BR>
<BR>
AtmNet is visiting New York to consult with Gordon and Avi about AtmNet's
plans to create a new national 155-megabit backbone across the country.
AtmNet already has a 155-megabit-per-second backbone on the West Coast connecting
San Diego, L.A. and San Francisco. But they are dependent on the caprices
of long-distance carriers to cross the country. Gordon pays the waiter and
we're off to Le Colonial.<BR>
<BR>
After dinner, Avi's T-shirt and sandals pass. But upon arrival, Gordon is
crestfallen: The exponential bartender is off for the night. When Gordon
recovers, we all troop to a table in the corner. Thronging the room are
models in miniskirts--tall, lithe and pneumatic. Across the table, in front
of a large framed photograph with a wraithlike image of Ho Chi Minh in a
Huey Newton chair, a sleek young couple in black hungrily writhes through
hot kisses. A sultry Asian waitress in a red kimono blouse emerges from
behind palm leaves to take orders of port, Courvoisier and Diet Pepsi. Avi
is worried that we still don't get his point about the polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
He wants to correct me: Strictly speaking it is not exponential (that's
when the exponent rises), it is polynomial (the variable n rises). In this
case, the complexity of the network rises by n nodes times n-1, which is
not even quite the square of n. I got it. The growth of Internet complexity
is polynomial. But the growth curve still rises toward the sky, okay?<BR>
<BR>
Avi ignores my comment and cruises on. Cisco is selling 60,000 routers a
month. It's the low end of the Net that is exploding. Hierarchical segmentation
through routers is the answer, reducing the n squared factor to the logarithm
of n. &quot;Log n is wonderful,&quot; Avi says. &quot;It shears off complexity.&quot;
The curves are relatively flat. But what about Metcalfe's prediction of
a whopping Internet crash in 1996? Avi will get to that. And what is the
role of AtmNet's ATM switches?<BR>
<BR>
Indeed. Apparently joining Avi in ignoring these tantalizing questions,
the girl across the table raises her legs and hooks them sinuously around
the body of the sleek young man. The waitress leans forward to deliver the
drinks, suffusing the table with exotic perfumes. The two AtmNet promoters
insist that the router problem can be overcome through the interposition
of ATM switches.<BR>
<BR>
Avi dismisses the ATM argument. The complexity curve is still polynomial,
he says. Whether routed or switched, the messages have to follow the same
physical routes. The complexity is the same. Moreover, Avi's cell phone
is on the blink and he has been out of reach for three hours. Gordon offers
a show-off Audiovox the size of a pack of cards, only lighter. Avi manages
to put through a call.<BR>
<BR>
The girl across the table shudders with pleasure as the man reaches out
and cups her breasts in his hands. &quot;The FIX is down,&quot; Avi sighs.
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; I ask. That means, so I learn, a 45-megabit
line is out of service and the Federal Internet Exchange, a Washington NAP,
cannot trade routes or data with MAE East, Metropolitan Fiber Systems's
Fiber Distributed Data Interface exchange point in Vienna, Virginia. This
glitch ramifies, creating certain problems for some of Avi's new customers
in Washington. The young man whispers something in the ear of the girl.
She balks. &quot;No, I'm getting embarrassed,&quot; she says. &quot;Let's
leave.&quot; &quot;I'll call back in 10 minutes,&quot; says Avi. The pair
unwrap their entangled limbs and staggers up from the table. Avi and the
rest of us get up to go.<BR>
<BR>
Thus ends the visit to the palmy domain of Le Colonial. Before I can pry
in a question about Metcalfe, Avi is on the road back home to his wife and
an Internet crisis at 11 p.m., enjoying life as a Diet Pepsi bon vivant
polynomial ISP. Anyway, it was time for fresh air. John Mevi of AtmNet needs
a break. &quot;Avi talks so fast it makes my ears ring,&quot; he explains.
&quot;You've got to understand. I'm from a telco environment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So it was that on a steamy evening in New York, on June 17, I returned to
consult Avi again on Metcalfe's predictions of a network crash. We met with
Gordon Jacobson at Martini's, an Italian restaurant near the Sheraton Hotel
on the west side of Manhattan. While Avi and Gordon consume a lox pizza
and several orders of pasta, I question these men who live on the Net from
minute to minute, day to day, who live in a world of routing tables, TCP/IP
address resolutions, and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and Gate Daemons,
about what they make of the doom scenario.<BR>
<BR>
Avi believes that Metcalfe has ascended to an elevation in the industry
that takes him out of the loop. He really doesn't get it. The Merit data
is mostly irrelevant. Pings from the Routing Arbiter are weighted as lowest-priority
packets. It is predictable and unimportant that many are dropped and re-sent.
&quot;That's the way the Internet works. Like Ethernet, it is tolerant of
failure. Undelivered packets are re-sent; they show up as a few milliseconds
of delay.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe makes much of Merit's index of router instability, measured by
the number of routes announced and withdrawn. In the extreme, instability
brings &quot;route flaps,&quot; in which waves of announcements and withdrawals
spread across the Net in positive feedback loops that congest the system.
Avi dismisses this effect. &quot;There have been no significant route flaps
in the last six months or more.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A large portion of the instability problems is attributable to a bug in
Cisco router software that is in the process of being fixed. He confirms
the findings of Ken Ehrhart of Gilder Technology Group that shows little
correlation between the router instability number and performance of the
Net measured by throughput at NAP switches. While all this &quot;wild statistical
behavior&quot; went on, the Net continued to perform stably by using other
routes, circumventing the congested paths. &quot;That's how the Internet
works.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Avi sums it up: &quot;Metcalfe has become an elder statesman and now he
is doing more harm than good, spreading fear and doubt while the rest of
us solve the problems.&quot; As Ehrhart puts it, &quot;These Merit numbers
bear bad names like 'instability,' 'packet loss' and 'delay.' Metcalfe says
these bad things are growing wildly. But in back of these numbers what is
really growing wildly is the Internet and that is a good thing.&quot; Richard
Shaffer's ComputerLetter, for example, reports that MCI's backbone traffic
has risen fivefold in the last year. MCI reports that its traffic has grown
a total of 5,000% since it opened the backbone in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
Like Howard Anderson, Bill Gates, Andy Grove and other bandwidth skeptics,
Metcalfe seems to find the explosive growth of his intellectual progeny--Ethernets
and Internets--too good to be true. All the sages and titans seem to seek
obsessively the worms in the Giant Peach as it hurtles through the air.
The message from Avi, Gordon and the AtmNet crew is &quot;Let them eat worms.
We'll feast on the peach.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's economics arguments are largely true. As Michael Rothschild's
Bionomics shows, growth in natural and economic systems depends on running
a surplus in every cell. But the cells of the Internet are thriving today.
From the creators of the backbone who lease their facilities, to the ISPs
who are madly multiplying their points of presence, the leading companies
are attracting so much investment and support that laggard behemoths such
as AT&amp;T, TCI and the RBOCs are rushing in.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm depends on the principle that new computers and
routers on the Net not only use its resources but also contribute new resources
to it. If the recent upsurge in Intranets is parasitical to some degree
(because these newcomers use the resources of the Net without contributing
resources of their own), the ultimate parasite on the scene may be AT&amp;T,
which commands perhaps the world's largest Intranet.<BR>
<BR>
AT&amp;T has attracted some 6 million orders from newcomers for Net service,
with plans to have 20 million by the end of the year, while lagging far
behind MCI and Sprint in contributing to the Internet system. Until recently,
AT&amp;T's vast fiber backbones carried just 2% of Internet traffic. AT&amp;T
preens as the largest and lowest-cost ISP, but its traffic mostly travels
the backbones of MCI, Sprint and other national Internet carriers. A key
to clearing the current bogs and bit pits of the Internet and preventing
a Metcalfe collapse is the enlisting of the full-fiber and switching resources
of AT&amp;T to relieve the pressure on the existing NAPs and backbones and
to accommodate the Internet's growth. AT&amp;T is currently moving to supply
such support.<BR>
<BR>
The Intranets criticized by Metcalfe are crucial to the Internet's growth.
Like the corporate PCs that spearheaded the advance of PC technology, Intranets
spread Internet technology through business, expand the market for high-powered
gear, lower component prices, enlarge bandwidth, and bring new users and
buyers onto the Net.<BR>
<BR>
As for Metcalfe's prediction of Internet crashes from private network overflows,
the fact is that no computer memory system could work without the principle
of locality--the tendency of memory accesses to focus on a contiguous region
of addresses. The Internet is similar. Internal corporate e-mail, for example,
is about 10 times as voluminous as remote e-mail. Metcalfe's private Net
overflow cascade is mostly a theoretical chimera. Like Ethernets, &quot;the
Internet works in practice but not in theory.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A second key fact of the Internet is that nothing in modern computer systems
could survive the combinatorial explosions of multimillion-line software
programs and multimillion-node circuitry without the magic of the microcosm.
Semiconductors sink the complexity into silicon, where it gives way to the
exponential boon of the power-delay product. The performance of the circuit--measured
by its speed and low power--improves roughly by the square of the number
of transistors on the chip.<BR>
<BR>
A microprocessor using separate components would be taller than the Empire
State Building and cover most of New York state. Most of the problems of
Internet complexity must be solved the same way that the microprocessor
solves its complexity explosion, sucking the complexity into semiconductors
and taming it on the chip. This means that Internet nodes would ideally
be single-chip systems. Avi is correct; it makes little difference whether
these systems are routers or switches. Today the backbone is being renewed
by ATM switches because these devices integrate more of the process onto
silicon than any other switches. In the future, broadband optics will likely
prevail by integrating entire communications systems onto seamless webs
of glass.<BR>
<BR>
<B>THE INTERNET AS LIFE EXTENDER</B><BR>
<BR>
The internet is a human contrivance requiring finance and physical renewal.
In practice, this means capital from phone companies and other large institutions.
In the real world, self-organizing systems rely on market incentives rather
than bio-analogies. Metcalfe is right that these incentives must be protected
and extended in order for the law of the telecosm to conquer the laws of
entropy.<BR>
<BR>
The key remaining obstacle to the fulfillment of the promise of the Internet
is government regulation. This obstacle is being overcome at last by the
brute force of bandwidth abundance, stemming from breakthroughs in fiber
optics, smart radios, satellites and cable modems.<BR>
<BR>
In every industrial transformation, businesses prosper by using the defining
abundance of their era to alleviate the defining scarcity. Today this challenge
implies a commanding moral imperative: to use Internet bandwidth in order
to stop wasting the customer's time. Stop the callous cost of queues, the
insolence of cold calls, the wanton eyeball pokes and splashes of billboards
and unwanted ads, the constant drag of lowest-common-denominator entertainments,
the lethal tedium of unneeded travel, the plangent buffeting of TV news
and political prattle, the endless temporal dissipation in classrooms, waiting
rooms, anterooms, traffic jams, toll booths and assembly lines, through
the impertinent tyranny of unneeded and afterwards ignored submission of
forms, audits, polls, waivers, warnings, legal pettifoggery.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
PB: In the recent past, your ideas and writings have enraged feminists and
political liberals. Today, those ideas seem to be among the guiding principles
of a changed political climate in Washington. We're going to ask you to
summarize the major themes of your books. But, for starters, just what is
it you believe in?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I believe in a free capitalist sys-tem in a larger cosmic order,
founded on absolute truth. I believe there are such things as absolute truths
and that society will necessarily reflect those truths, over time, in its
organization and behavior.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Tell us an absolute truth.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: An absolute truth I pro-pound in Wealth And Poverty is &quot;Give
and you will be given unto.&quot; To the extent people are willing to give
of themselves, to devote themselves to pursuits beyond their own immediate
cal-culations of self-interest, they tend to be more successful, to contribute
more to society and to receive more benefits themselves.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Then you don't see self-interest as the basis of economic progress?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. I don't think &quot;rational self-interest&quot; is the foundation
of capitalism or of economic growth under any circumstances. I think economic
growth is the result of human creativ-ity -- and creativity always comes
as a surprise to us. <BR>
<BR>
To the extent you plan for progress or growth, you will tend to exclude
the creative surprises on which growth and achievement depend. Surprises
mainly derive from the willingness of people to devote themselves to causes
beyond themselves -- to give of their work and wealth to create busi-nesses
or art, to project their energies beyond their own personal needs and perceptions.
This is a generous impulse. It leads to ever-widening circles of human sympathy.
<BR>
<BR>
A new project -- any new economic activity -- will succeed only to the extent
that it responds to the needs of others. The effort to fulfill the needs
of others is essential to important achievement.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Your altruistic notion of capi-talism certainly doesn't conform to the
conventional leftist view of the capital-ist as a predatory, money-grubbing,
self-interested individual.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That is a caricature of capitalism. Of course, in any society, there
are going to be self-interested, predatory, rapacious people -- and such
people have a lot of room to display their wares in a free society. But
this doesn't mean the essence of capitalism -- that part of it that accounts
for its unique success in creat-ing wealth -- is rapacious, predatory, or
self-interested. <BR>
<BR>
One of the themes of my book -- I'm talking about Wealth And Poverty --
is that this image doesn't work very well. When the leftist says that capitalists
are a bunch of creeps and predators, and the defender of capital-ism says,
&quot;Yes, but look what marvelous effects their freedom produces,&quot;
the left-ist has won the argument. The average per-son just won't believe
that, by giving maximum freedom to a bunch of creeps and predators, you
are going to produce a steadily improving human condition.<BR>
<BR>
And, as a result, the argument for moral-ity in human affairs has increasingly
shifted to the left. You find the Pope assuming, as a matter of course,
that socialism is a more generous and com-passionate way of organizing human
affairs.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I think that individuals who pur-sue only their narrow self-interest
are led, &quot;as by an invisible hand,&quot; toward an ever greater welfare
state. The truth is that people pursuing rational self-interest demand comfort
and security; they don't take the risks that result in growth and achievement.
And, without the risk-derived surprises of human creativity, the human race
is doomed. <BR>
<BR>
You need a willingness to give of your time and wealth and effort without
a predetermined reward. You hope for a reward in the future but, in capitalism,
that reward is not specified beforehand. You make your investment without
any assurance you will be commensurately repaid, let alone heavily rewarded.
<BR>
<BR>
This willing-ness to take risks is crucial to master the unpredictable and
unknown future.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And you believe that relates to how men perform in society, don't you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes, because in a free society, men will be inclined to take such
risks. This is what men do when they're al-lowed to -- it's part of the
masculine character. Boys grow up and they want to perform. Their performances
are appraised by others. They fight to per-form well. And I think this desire
to perform, which has to some extent a sexual foundation, leads to the creative
activities so dramatically shown in capi-talist societies.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is that sexual foundation? <BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Men have to perform in order to please women in a way that women
don't have to perform in order to please men. When you ask the average man
why he works, he'll pull out his wallet and show you a picture of his wife
and kids.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But don't men also work to impress other men -- their peers?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, but that makes my point as well. Young men have to undergo
all kinds of initiation rites among their peers, in the outside world, in
order to qualify for manhood. Young girls don't have those rites. The changes
in their bodies qualify them for the crucial role of motherhood and the
survival of the tribe. There is a consistent differ-ence between this male
need for exter-nal performance to qualify for manhood and the degree to
which biological changes qualify women for their roles.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That was the controversial theme of one of your earlier books, wasn't
it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Partly. The main thesis of Sexual Suicide is that sex roles are
the founda-tion of civilized society and any society that attempts to repress
them will at the same time subvert civilization. <BR>
I maintain that sex roles are founded on evolutionary experience, on the
mil-lions of years humans spent in hunter-gatherer societies; [and] that
they are further reaffirmed by the biological differences between the sexes,
which it takes a Ph.D. in physiology to ignore and which are evident to
all of us when we examine them. Further, I believe those differences are
affirmed by the dra-matically differing sexual experiences in men and women.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Namely?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Male experience revolves around copulation as the one purely sexual
activity. Women experience copulation as only one of a long series of sexual
experiences running from pregnancy to childbirth to breast-feeding and nurtur-ing
small children. Because women have this extended pattern of sexual experi-ences
that affirm them as women, they have great difficulty comprehending the
much more compulsive, aggressive and anxious male attitude toward the sex
act itself and toward sexual identity. Men have to earn their sexual identity
while, for women, it's part of their very being. <BR>
<BR>
As Margaret Mead wrote, ''Motherhood is a biological fact, while fatherhood
is a social invention.&quot; The father doesn't even have to be around when
the baby is born. He will be around, and be acknowledged as the fa-ther,
only to the extent the woman is willing to affirm his paternity -- to the
extent, in fact, that the woman is willing to forgo other sexual liaisons.
<BR>
This may be less true today than it was in the past. But certainly, through
the entire evolutionary experience of the race, fatherhood could be maintained
as a real institution only to the extent the woman was prevented from sleeping
around.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Sometimes called the double standard?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Right. I don't particularly want to defend the double standard as
a far-reaching moral principle, but it certainly does derive from the very
differing consequences of promiscuity for men and for women.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We'll get down to cases on that topic but, for now, what was your purpose
in writing Sexual Suicide?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I wrote that book because I saw that, until you understood the difference
between the sexes, you couldn't under-stand the effects of government welfare
policy on the poor. It was obvious to me how, to the extent that welfare
programs usurped the male role of provider, it would be impossible to maintain
intact families. And, as long as intact families were not maintained, it
would be impos-sible for the wide range of welfare recipients ever to escape
from the wel-fare society.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What was the theme of your subsequent book?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The concept for my subsequent book, Naked Nomads, came to me dur-ing
a debate, when my opponent was talking about how women earn less money,
how they have all these signs of oppression and victimization -- where-upon
it occurred to me that single men could be presented in exactly the same
terms. Single men earn about the same amount of money as single women of
the same age and qualifications. They are enormously more prone to every
sort of disease and affliction than any other large group in the society.
And they commit something like 90% of all the violent crimes. It seemed
to me the statistics about single men had real significance for an appraisal
of the dif-ferent roles of the sexes.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Single women didn't manifest those tendencies?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's right. Single women are virtually as healthy and as well
paid as married women, by most indices, while married men earn almost twice
as much money as single men of the same age and qualifications. The obvious
question that arose about this data was whether it was merely that single
men were losers, and therefore couldn't get married, or whether failure
to get married led to a pattern of behavior that fostered disease and criminality.
<BR>
<BR>
I pored through lots of evidence on this point and discovered that widowed
men and divorced men showed a pattern of problems almost identical to those
displayed by single men of the same age and qualifications. Widowed men
didn't choose to be wid-owed, and divorced men may or may not have chosen
to be divorced, but my thesis was that single men are less civi-lized, if
you will. They have more short-term perspectives, because they lack the
links to women and children that lend them a sense of the future -- a kind
of physical embodiment of the future in their lives. Single men, lacking
these long-term dimensions, are left in the very short-term compulsive circuits
of male sexuality. They follow the same patterns of tension and release
that are characteristic of the male sexual experi-ence. Man's link to the
future passes through the woman's womb. Men be-come more stable and less
compulsive to the extent that they have links to chil-dren that carry them
into the future. I thought the statistics about single men -- whether bachelors,
widowers or divorced -- confirmed that proposition.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You seem to be saying that the success of the human race depends on
men's becoming what used to be called -- mostly in bars and locker rooms
-- &quot;pussy-whipped.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: This is one of the great ironies of male chauvinism. Men always
use such terms to the extent they are ex-cluded from the long-term patterns
of family life that women tend to foster. Men asserting male superiority
feel compelled to put down women. The sort of male-chauvinist idiom you
find at bars or in all-male groups, particu-larly in the military, really
reflects an inner sense of the profound dependency of men on women for the
most important of human experiences: Procreation and nurture.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What was your book Visible Man about?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Visible Man began with the title Sam Beau. It was based on two years
of interviews with ghetto blacks. My thesis was that the old &quot;Sambo&quot;
image -- the Stepin Fetchit character that was the previous destructive
clich&eacute; about black life -- had been supplanted on the streets by
a new &quot;Sam Beau&quot; image -- of the swashbuckling street stud, who
didn't work and who spent all his time pursuing a succession of welfare
mothers and engaging in criminal activity. <BR>
<BR>
The pimp image was strikingly manifest in ghetto culture, and my observation
was that this image is just as destructive to people who succumb to it as
the previous, self-indulgent Sambo image. This conduct also resembled the
male behavior in various societies I studied in anthropology, in which the
constructive male role of provider is not pursued for one reason or another.
In the ghetto, the chief reason the male-provider role is unavailable is
that it's performed so much better by the gov-ernment through the welfare
state. <BR>
<BR>
Those were the ideas that underlay the narrative of Visible Man -- which
is, in fact, a nonfiction novel, examining the welfare culture and what
it does to men: How it destroys men and drives them into increasingly futile
virility rites -- fighting and crime and drugs.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're not suggesting that this is exclusively a black problem, are
you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not at all. It s not a special black problem. It's only a black
problem because the welfare culture has been propagated most successfully
in the in-ner cities, through the War on Poverty, which focused on blacks
in the ghetto. The same sort of patterns can also be found in hippie culture,
where you have the violent flower-child phenomenon in a social order that
was just as corrupting as the street culture of blacks in the ghetto itself.
<BR>
<BR>
Middle-class black society is very much like middle-class white society.
Black families are no more prone to breakdown than are white families. And
white families break down just as much when subjected to this kind of welfare
state as black families do. <BR>
<BR>
It just happens that, through the Outreach programs of the War on Poverty,
a much higher proportion of the black poor was induced to accept the welfare
culture.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you find no redeeming features in the War on Poverty? You seem to
indict the program totally.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Pretty much. It just didn't do any good. The various well-intentioned
programs might have done some good, if they hadn't been accompanied by a
vast increase in welfare benefits that just ravaged the families of the
sup-posed beneficiaries. The crucial thing that happened during that period
-- that overwhelmed every positive initiative of the War on Poverty -- was
the doubling of the number of female-headed families among blacks. This
meant almost a complete breakdown of the black family in the ghetto itself,
to the extent that 95% of black welfare families lack fathers.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is the theme of your latest book?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Wealth And Poverty brings all these social themes together with
an economic vision. Present in Wealth And Poverty is the idea that the competitive
activity of men, attempting to support their families, is a crucial impulse
of economic growth. <BR>
<BR>
I also stress the criti-cal importance of freedom as a practical necessity
for economic progress in an uncertain and unpredictable world. The creative
breakthroughs I talked about earlier -- the surprises that throughout human
history have been most important in creating wealth and solving the problems
of scarcity -- have never been predicted. They tend to emerge in defiance
of the assumptions of the experts. <BR>
<BR>
Creativity is always unexpected. After all, if you could predict it, you
could prescribe it. If it were predictable, you wouldn't need it. And, because
existing knowledge and ex-isting resources are always inadequate to an extended
future, human success is necessarily dependent on novelty, on surprise,
on creativity. You have to have a huge outpouring of human creativity in
order to launch the few unpredict-able inventions that can transform all
human life. <BR>
<BR>
Consider the vast number of small businesses that are conceived against
the relatively tiny number that are actually launched. When you realize
that two-thirds of these will fail within five years, you understand how
the process is not a matter of very profound rational planning.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What specific message in Wealth And Poverty do you think the Reagan
Administration finds so compelling?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, one of them is that the fun-damental problem of American society
today is that more than half the people in the country now face marginal
tax rates above 50% on an additional dollar of earnings.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Explain what you mean by the marginal tax rate.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The marginal tax rate is the tax you pay on the next dollar you
earn, beyond your current earnings. It's what you don't take home from your
next dol-lar of income. That's the marginal tax rate and, as I say, it has
now reached a level over 50% for most Americans, which includes all the
most productive Americans, who really determine the directions of our economic
activity.<BR>
<BR>
It also includes welfare recipients. They have very high marginal tax rates.
If a welfare mother goes out and earns an additional dollar, she'll have
to forgo a dollar of her current income -- plus some leisure time. In effect,
she faces a margin-al tax rate of more than 100%. The same is true for people
who are much better off, who face preposterous rates on interest earned
from savings -- which the government quaintly calls &quot;unearned income.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The tax rates on such income are ostensibly 70%, but they end up, after
adjusting for inflation, attaining real levels much over 100% -- often 200%
or even 300%.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you elaborate on that?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: If you put $100 into a savings account, you'll be lucky to get 10%
interest over a year's time. But, during that year, your principal has been
reduced by 10% inflation; so, at the end of the year, you break even. The
government doesn't see it that way. It says you've made $10 just by leav-ing
your money in the bank -- and it wants seven of them. So you started with
$100 and wind up, in effect, with $93. Here you're being taxed on losses.
<BR>
<BR>
Whether you're a welfare mother or a capitalist, this situation means you
have a greater incentive to hide a dollar of existing income than to earn
an addi-tional dollar. And that is the perfect formula for a tax system
that, on the margin, loses more revenue than it col-lects. It loses partly
by driving people into the underground economy, which consists of cash exchanges
and barter -- you know, where the accountant does the lawyer's taxes and
the lawyer does the accountant's divorce. Barter arrange-ments like that
are emerging increasingly in today's highly taxed economy. <BR>
<BR>
Tax revenue is also lost because people are driven into overseas tax havens,
or out of productive forms of investment and into postage stamps or boxcars
or rare coins or Rembrandts -- [and] all other non--financial assets whose
sole advantage is that they escape taxation most of the time.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But tax cuts at the margin will primarily benefit the rich. That used
to be called the &quot;trickle-down&quot; school of economics: Give money
to the rich and some of it will eventually trickle down to the poor. Is
that what supply-side eco-nomics is all about?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. Supply-side economics is the opposite of the trickle-down theory.
We believe that wealth is created by production -- at any level. That's
why you don't find supply-side theorists advocating tax cuts chiefly for
business. We focus on personal income tax cuts, because we be-lieve wealth
begins with individuals, not with institutions. Wealth is the product of
individual creativity.<BR>
<BR>
PB: There are certainly other visions of how economies are structured.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: To be sure. An alternate approach to taxation, which has dominated
in the United States in recent years and which still dominates in Sweden
and England, is the idea that you can have flourishing capitalism by subsidizing
big corporations while bitterly punishing anybody who tries to make money
outside the existing corporate structure. You subsidize institutional savings
that are channeled back into major corporations or into govern-ment bonds,
but you strongly prevent anyone from accumulating savings on his own that
he can dispose of as he wishes.<BR>
 <BR>
The problem with this approach is that, overwhelmingly, it is disposable
personal savings that make the economy go -- by financing the proliferation
of small busi-nesses, which are the source of ferment and growth. Supply-siders
focus on personal activity as the source of wealth. <BR>
<BR>
As an example, we believe immi-grants are one of the most important forces
in economic growth. They come to the country with no wealth, they generate
wealth and stimulate the lower middle class to greater efforts. This causes
wealth not to trickle down but really to surge up through the whole system.
It starts as much at the bottom as at the top. There's no trickle-down notion
at all in our ideal.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You talk about stimulating small businesses, but isn't most of the wealth
in this country in -- and there-fore aren't most jobs dependent on -- large
corporations?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Since the mid-fifties, the num-ber of small-business starts [annually]
has risen from 93,000 to nearly 500,000. There are a total of 15,000,000
small businesses in this country that create about 80% of new jobs. In fact,
during the '70s, companies with fewer than 250 employees created more than
90% of new jobs, while corporations in the Fortune top 1000 created no new
net employment at all.<BR>
 <BR>
There's no evidence that innovations come from big bureaucracies. Perhaps
the most impor-tant innovation of our time -- the micro-processor, the computer
on a chip -- was developed by a firm with 12 employees.<BR>
<BR>
PB: No innovations from bureauc-racies? NASA, so we hear repeatedly, gave
us Teflon. Bell Labs gave us the transistor.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, but when you talk about Bell Labs, you find they're not prepared
to exploit the developments -- William Shockley left Bell Labs alter inventing
the transistor to start his own firm, when it became clear &quot;Ma Bell&quot;
didn't know how to use it. Similarly, Shockley didn't see how the transistor
could be transformed into a microprocessor, so some of his employees split
off from him to form yet another small business. <BR>
<BR>
As to NASA, that was primarily a case of mobilizing existing technology,
and the payoff was hardly worth the huge ex-pense. Statistics show the yield
of innovations from small businesses is about 20 times greater than that
from large corporations or subsidized research and development.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Is the Kemp/Roth tax bill -- which would reduce rates 30% over three
years -- a direct attempt to resolve the problem of excessive taxes at the
margin?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. The Kemp/Roth bill was the original supply-side proposal.<BR>
<BR>
PB: The objection one hears most frequently is that the Kemp/Roth tax cuts
are certain to be inflationary, be-cause they would create a situation in
which too much money is chasing too few goods.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: But we don't focus on money. We focus on the creation of goods.
And we think that the problem of too much money is best addressed by enhancing
incentive to create more goods. There-fore, the way to respond to inflation
is not to diminish the amount of money people have but, rather, to enhance
the number of goods and services they produce. The best way to enhance their
incentives to create more goods and services is to reduce the tax rates
on traditional income. This is an excellent reason for supporting the Kemp/Roth
concept. <BR>
<BR>
PB: Would Kemp/Roth also stim-ulate savings?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It would greatly stimulate savings, because a high marginal tax
rate deters savings twice: It first deters you from earning those additional
dollars you're most likely to save, and it then deters you from saving them
by taxing the interest return from savings at the highest possible rates.
So, when you cut marginal tax rates, you impart a double stimulus to savings
but only a single stimulus to consumption. <BR>
<BR>
Increased sav-ings don't enhance aggregate demand, even in the Keynesian
scheme. So, to the degree that a cut in marginal tax rates stimulates savings,
it has an anti-inflationary effect. If we expand savings by a greater amount
than we increase the federal deficit, we will actually reduce inflationary
pressures.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Has that been proved?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Absolutely. This is why the Japa-nese and Germans and Swiss have
been able to run deficits two or three times as large as ours -- as a proportion
of gross national product -- without having inflationary results nearly
as serious. <BR>
<BR>
PB: How did the ideas of supply--side economics develop?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The essential ideas of supply-side economics arose in response to
the tri-umph of Keynesian economics, which is essentially based on the proposition
that purchasing power drives the economy. In the Keynesian view, it's dollars
in people's pockets -- aggregate demand -- that make the economy go. It
doesn't really matter very much how the dollars get into people's pockets.
<BR>
As a matter of fact, over the years, the Keynesian theory has reached the
conclusion that the best way to put dollars into people's pockets is through
government spending. As individuals in the economy, we're pretty good aggregate-demanders,
but sometimes we like to save money rather than spend it. In Keynesian terms,
savings is a &quot;leakage&quot; from the flow of aggregate demand that
makes the economy run.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That's the demand side of the equation.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. The demand-siders are really interested in monetary aggregates
-- that's their central concern. Aggregate demand consists of money in consumers'
pockets, money available for investment in the pockets of businessmen and
money in the government's pocket.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Are there other areas in which you think our national priorities are
wrong?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. We do not adequately re-ward human creativity and initiative,
which is really the most valuable force in the economy. The Democrats increasingly,
by focusing on investment tax credits and benefits for buildings and machines,
have ignored the most valuable capital in the system -- human capital. Even
when they acknowledge the value of human capital, they see it as manufac-tured
in schools, rather than as a product of individual incentives, creativity
and effort.<BR>
<BR>
PB: At what tax rate do you think diminishing returns set in?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I believe that any tax rate over 35% costs more than it's worth.
In other words, it damages total economic activity by a greater extent than
it in-creases government revenues.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Can that be proved, or is it just your feeling?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It s a feeling, but it's an observa-tion that I think most people
will affirm. I think your own observations will con-firm that when the government
has taken more than 35% of addition-al revenues, your activity changes.
To an increasing degree, people begin to consider ways of avoiding taxation,
and they place less stress on earning more money. I would be willing to
defend that proposition. Asian countries that have lower marginal rates
of taxation have been growing much more rapidly than any other countries
in the world. Japan, in particular, has rates of margin-al taxation less
than half as high as ours, on comparable incomes.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But aren't Japan's tax rates supposed to be just as high and just as
steep as ours?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: They are, but the top rate, which is about 70%, like ours, applies
only to incomes over $396,000 in Japan. The top German rate of 56% applies
only to incomes over $50,000. In the United States, any ''unearned in-come&quot;
earned by those whose salary is over $50,000 is taxed at the 70% rate. We
have vastly more punishing marginal rates of taxation than any of the Asian
countries that have been grow-ing faster than any other countries in the
world since the Second World War.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Some observers attribute those rates of growth to cultural or societal
differences.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's ridiculous. The Chinese in Hong Kong and Singapore and Taiwan
have very low rates of taxation. The highest rate in Hong Kong is 15%. People
there work terribly hard and ter-ribly productively. As I say, they have
the fastest growing economies in the world. Put those same Chinese in a
Communist system and you have an extraordinarily stagnant and ineffective
economic ar-rangement, even though the people prob-ably work just as hard
in mainland China -- maybe harder.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the analyses -- done at Harvard and MIT among other places
-- that show that people won't work hard enough to produce the increased
revenues that supply-siders predict?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: They miss the point entirely. Supply-siders don't predict that people
will work 30% harder as a result of a 30% reduction in tax rates. They merely
predict that people will work 30% more efficiently. They'll tend to focus
their efforts more on taxable activity and less on untaxed activity. These
changes are not directly measurable at all by the kinds of analysis that
all those learned economists have been sponsoring.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do most other Western nations have payroll withholding taxes as we do?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. Most nations deduct social-security taxes at the paycheck level.
We have a greater stress on income taxation. A higher proportion of our
revenue comes from income-taxation than in other countries, except England,
Sweden and Denmark. The other countries large-ly focus on value-added taxes,
which are a kind of national sales taxes. They're collected on the &quot;value
added&quot; at each stage of manufacturing and marketing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Isn't the VAT widely alleged to be a very regressive tax, meaning that
it falls more heavily on the poor than on the rich?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It's alleged to be a regressive tax, but it can be adjusted, as
it is in most countries, so that it's greater on luxury goods than it is
on necessities. Most real necessities, such as food, are excluded from value-added
taxation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you support it as an alternative to an income tax?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I think it's preferable to an in-come tax, but I wouldn't support
it unless it were accompanied by a much more drastic reduction in the income
tax. In other words, I don't support it as a supplement to existing forms
of taxa-tion, and so far this is the only way it has been advocated. <BR>
Recall that the in-come tax was initially enacted as a tem-porary expedient
because it was such an efficient and affirmative way to raise funds. Somebody
suggested a 10% ceiling on the income tax, and the argu-ment was made that
if you impose a 10% ceiling, the tax would tend to rise all the way up to
10%. So it was decided not to have such a high ceiling, lest we achieve
this confiscatory rate of taxation. <BR>
<BR>
I would want to be sure that the value-added tax weren't just piled on top
of all the other kinds of taxation in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Is there any condition under which people will willingly pay taxes?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure. People are willing to pay taxes when they get something in
return. You'll pay taxes to support the police, roads, libraries, hospitals
-- all legitimate services that governments offer in various constituencies.
It's only when people begin believing that the government is taking more
than it provides that tax revolts occur. <BR>
<BR>
Jude Wanniski, one of the founders of the new school of supply-side economics
-- as opposed to the classical school, which was started by Jean Baptiste
Say and Adam Smith -- points out that in Stalingrad, during World War Two,
people were happily taxed at more than 100% in order to hold off the enemy.
They allowed themselves nearly to starve, in order to provide food to continue
the defense effort. If people really believe that government services are
worth what they cost, they'll forgo income to support them. <BR>
<BR>
But, under cur-rent circumstances, most people think the government charges
more than it delivers, so they reasonably reduce their activity and try
to avoid taxation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: If you were President and you had an amenable Congress, what sort of
tax program would you put through?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I'd like income taxation at a flat rate of 20% or so, depending
on the revenue needs.<BR>
PB: No progressive rates?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not for me. I don't think pro-gressivity does any good. It hurts
the poor.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Please explain.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Progressive tax rates don't redis-tribute income; they redistribute
tax-payers. They move wealthy people out of the productive economy into
offshore tax havens and unproductive tax shel-ters. Progressive tax rates
have had this effect most dramatically where they are steepest, in Sweden
and England, where anybody who makes any money immedi-ately leaves.<BR>
 <BR>
Bjorn Borg lives in Monte Carlo. The Beatles spread to the four corners
of the earth. All sorts of wealthy British have emigrated to the U. S. to
avoid the preposterous British tax rates. For many years, they had a 98%
rate on unearned income. The cream of the British economy was redistributed
by ill-conceived taxes to Beverly Hills and Bermuda and Malta and Spain
-- any-where but in productive work to contrib-ute to the wealth and welfare
of the poorer British citizen who stayed home.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you advocate an across-the-board flat tax rate on incomes.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That is the ideal system. To get there, my general focus is on cutting
personal-income-tax rates, abolishing the distinction between earned and
un-earned income, and then cutting the remaining tax rates regularly.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That is more or less what Ron-ald Reagan has advocated. Do you see Reagan
as an effective President?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. He's just been quite re-markable. Take, for example, his ap-proach
to the Office of Management and Budget. The usual idea is to appoint a banker
friend or somebody who has a lot of experience in accounting. It's always
been regarded as a neutral office, to which are appointed people who are
adept at managing numbers -- as if gov-ernment really consists of the mobiliza-tion
of competing armies of statistics. <BR>
<BR>
And Reagan didn't. In designating Da-vid Stockman, he appointed not only
a brilliant policy analyst but one who had supported John Connally during
the campaign, who was regarded as alto-gether too bumptious and aggressive
by many of his congressional associates and who was opposed by many other
people on Reagan's staff at the time. <BR>
<BR>
Also, Stockman was a leader in a very controversial movement in economics,
and Reagan gave him the central role in his Administration. That's a bold
act by a President.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is your vision of the future of our economy?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I am very bullish, very optimistic about the future of the American
econ-omy. I think that the gloom that has beset us in recent years originates
from three chief assumptions: That we are running out of energy, that we
have some basic productivity problems that can't be resolved and that capitalism
was somehow maladjusted to the modern age, so that the various totalitarian
systems would necessarily prevail.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you dissent from those assumptions?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. In all three cases, I see major new developments of the highest
prom-ise. I see huge new finds of natural gas, which, even though they haven't
all been proved to date, nonetheless, collec-tively suggest that today we
have a wider variety of energy sources available or in view than ever before
in human history. <BR>
<BR>
I see that the productivity problem is rapidly being resolved by the applica-tion
of new technology in the service industries. All these word-processors,
computer terminals and telecommunica-tions devices are being installed and
adopted by ever more offices, but they have yet to be mastered and fully
integrated into efficient systems. As we move into the '80s, I think the
result will be major and dramatic advances in productivity. <BR>
<BR>
The third point is the astonishing triumph of capitalism in the past decade.
When I went to Harvard, and later worked on the Council on Foreign Re-lations,
the general consensus was that the Maoist experiment in China was exerting
this potent magnetism on the overseas Chinese on the edge of the mainland.
Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and even Japan would slowly be induced to adopt
Communist approaches and techniques. <BR>
<BR>
Well, today, all the magnetism has flowed in the other direction. Who would
believe that lit-tle outposts like Hong Kong and Singapore and Taiwan would
be shap-ing the future of mainland China? That the leaders on the mainland
are consult-ing the overseas Chinese on how to adopt capitalist techniques
and regen-erate the economy? This is an incredible change, a development
that has the greatest portent for the future.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Given the supply-siders' con-cern for individual freedom, do they take
issue with government regulation?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Most supply-siders emerged from a system in which Government had
a huge role already. Contemporary supply--side economics is a post-welfare-state
phenomenon. We accept the existence of government and the need for regula-tion
in many areas. We don't oppose regulation except where costs are much greater
than benefits.<BR>
 <BR>
I like the example of rules for a basketball game. You need a certain number
of rules in order to have a basketball game at all. Without rules about
dribbling and shooting, without boundaries, you wouldn't have a basketball
game that was fun to play or entertaining to watch. However, if you begin
to prescribe rules about the exact inflection at which players are allowed
to release their shots, or how high they can jump from different loca-tions
on the floor, or just how fast they can run under prescribed circumstances,
at a certain point the rules tend to become counterproductive. <BR>
<BR>
I think our current problem is that we've gone be-yond the point where rules
promote order and productivity to a point where they are a new form of disorder.
We earlier discovered that soap was a form of pollution; now we're finding
that rules are a new form of unruliness.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're not talking about a re-turn to the 19th century, then?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not at all. We believe de-regulation is eminently desirable, not
because we oppose a clean environment or a safe workplace or support the
desirability of poisoning people with un-tested new pharmaceuticals, but
because we believe the current laws are far more complex than understood,
and that the bureaucracies they've spawned are too large and too poorly
organized to achieve any beneficial effect.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you give us an example?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: An obvious example is the enor-mous effort to eliminate auto-pollutants,
requiring catalytic converters and other expensive devices. No one has yet
shown a relationship between auto-pollutants and any disease. It has yet
to be demon-strated that the catalytic converters eliminate pollutants any
more damaging than the ones they emit. [EPA disputes this, claiming that
a relationship be-tween certain types of respiratory and cardiovascular
diseases and auto-pollut-ants has, in fact, been demonstrated. Sim-ilarly,
the EPA claims that emittants from catalytic converters are not harmful.]
<BR>
<BR>
Enormous new expense was imposed on our auto industry without any evidence
of beneficial results. One of the obvious effects was the willingness of
people to buy vans and pickups and retain old automobiles much longer than
they did in the past. People are using more in-efficient, more pollutant
vehicles to an increasing degree.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you would not restrict tech-nological progress at the expense of
environmental concerns?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's rarely the choice. Throughout history, tech-nological progress
has entailed the replacement of heavy and potentially damaging machinery
with more efficient and less environmentally destructive means of production.
The obvious development is from the steam engine to the silicon chip. Current
microprocessors the size of a fly have more computing power than the early
computers that would fill up a gym-nasium with tubes and wires. <BR>
<BR>
In gen-eral, economic progress has tended to result in smaller, lighter,
more efficient, less pollutant equipment. To hold back economic progress
in the name of re-ducing environmental damage is entire-ly counterproductive.
This does not mean that intelligent regulation should not be promulgated
in order to transmit to businesses knowledge that's not trans-mitted by
the marketplace.<BR>
<BR>
PB: For example, the marketplace wouldn't resolve the problem of Amer-ican
industrial pollution that descends on Canada as acid rain, would it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. The marketplace doesn't ordinarily place a value on air, or
on water, or on land beyond its borders. In cases such as acid rain, there
may be times when simple Government regula-tions are preferable to some
purer form of market action.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Why do so many well-inten-tioned government programs wind up achieving
precisely the opposite of their planned results?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: This is the phenomenon that I call moral hazards of liberalism.
Moral hazards is an insurance term. It refers to the potentially negative
results of an insurance policy. The moral hazard of fire insurance is arson.
When the insur-ance on a building exceeds its value, spontaneous combustion
often results. There's nothing the insurance company can do about it except
to reduce the payoff.<BR>
<BR>
PB: How does that relate to public policy?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The moral hazard of unemploy-ment insurance is unemployment. When
government-paid unemployment bene-fits -- plus leisure time -- become greater
than the benefits of work, unemploy-ment increases. The moral hazard of
welfare tends to be broken families and increased poverty -- because, when
welfare benefits become greater than the bene-fits of maintaining an intact
family with an employed breadwinner, then more and more families will tend
to break up and the breadwinner will go to the streets -- into crime and
the underground economy. <BR>
<BR>
And, when the man is gone, the chances of that family's escaping poverty
plummet. Even though its income in-creases, the only way to escape poverty
ultimately is to work. If the government provides the income and the father
leaves the family, the family is still im-poverished, even if its income
exceeds the official government poverty level. With no real hope for the
future, with great difficulty disciplining its children, particularly its
boys, the family will live a slovenly and disorganized existence that will
shock any social worker who ex-amines it. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, the welfare benefits this family receives, combined with the
food stamps, the housing sub-sidies and all the other programs that have
been enacted for the poor, are far greater than the total incomes of middle-class
people 20 years ago.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're saying that the real income of welfare families today is higher
than the middle-class wage was in 1960. Is that accounting for inflation?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That includes inflation. Welfare benefits today are worth on the
average between $15,000 and $20,000 a year. That would be equivalent to
an income of about $7,000 a year in 1960, which was the median income then.
We mustn't forget that welfare is, in a sense, an insurance scheme. It's
insurance for people who, presumably, through no fault of their own or through
some con-catenation of events, fail to earn enough money to support themselves.
The con-cept is of insurance. <BR>
But when the bene-fits rise beyond the insurance level, they foster the
very disasters that are being insured against. In other words, they create
incentives for unemployment and family breakdown. And that's wily the Reagan
concept of welfare reform, at least as it applied in California, is misconceived.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Why?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In California, they seem to think you can raise the benefits to
any level. Reagan raised them by 43% for the alleged &quot;truly needy,&quot;
while, at the same time, he increased the welfare po-lice to investigate
fraud and abuse. Once again, this is a case of ignoring the supply-side
rule, which is that people change their behavior to re-spond to incentives.
<BR>
<BR>
You can't increase welfare benefits 43% without rad-ically changing the
pattern of incentives confronting poor people. You can kick a lot of people
off the rolls for a few years, as Reagan did in California, but soon enough
they readjust their lives to do what the government prescribes. If government
projects a concept of true neediness, the poor will quickly convert themselves
to the &quot;truly needy.&quot; You want disability? All right, I'll give
you disability. You want a mother with three kids who doesn't know who the
father is? Fine, I forget Daddy's name. Right now it just totally escaped
my mind. I don't know who the hell he is.<BR>
<BR>
The point is, welfare applicants don't even have to adjust their lives,
they just have to adjust their behavior in the welfare office. My book Visible
Man documents that proposition fully. I went to the welfare office many
times with various of the characters in the book. They would all ask the
clerks, &quot;How do you want these forms filled out?&quot; The forms are
something totally alien to them. They can't find any correspond-ence between
their lives and those forms, so they simply find out what they're supposed
to say. &quot;What do you want me to say? What am I supposed to say?&quot;
And then they say it.<BR>
<BR>
PB: It seems reasonably certain that Reagan as President has no intention
of increasing welfare benefits nationally. Do you think it's a reasonable
prospect to consider reducing them?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not really. The Reagan program is not significantly reducing welfare
benefits. There are some changes in eligibility, but in essence they are
leav-ing these programs intact. I think the Reagan Administration will be
resistant to further expansion in these programs, while at the same time
heavily devoted to expanding opportunities in the real economy. The result
will be that as time passes, the attractions of work in the productive economy
will rise, while the attractions of the welfare culture will decline. Welfare
benefits will di-minish, not in absolute terms or in real purchasing power
but in relation to the steadily increasing wages in a growing economy.<BR>
<BR>
PLAYBOY: On what basis do you make that projection?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In California, after Proposition 13, which essentially reduced marginal
taxation at the state level, everybody predicted unemployment and stagna-tion.
Of all the leading economists, only Arthur Laffer accurately predicted the
outcome. He predicted that the California economy would greatly expand and
that people would voluntarily leave government service to take advantage
of improving opportunities in the private sector. And that's just what happened.
There was no great need to fire govern-ment workers, because they left voluntarily.
<BR>
<BR>
Just about every prediction made by aggregate analysis on the basis of the
California tax cut was wrong. Invari-ably, the supply-side analysis was
vindi-cated. On balance, the impact on the incentives of individuals easily
overrode the impact on the aggregate movements of funds.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But California is a special case.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. It's a special case. It s just one example. Another example
is Puerto Rico, where Governor Carlos Romero Barcelo finally decided to
dismantle an egregiously ineffective tax system that a deputation of eminent
economists from Yale had recommended as the only way to increase its equality
of income dis-tribution. As a result, Puerto Rico had preposterously high
income-tax rates, about 20% higher than our rates in the United States.
Barcelo, after con-sulting with Laffer and Wanniski, started cutting these
taxes and removing the surcharges. Every year, after each tax cut, income
expanded across the whole island by a far greater margin than the tax cut,
and revenues to the government increased. <BR>
<BR>
It's the same story: Increase individual incentive, and you promote economic
growth.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Let's talk about economic in-centives for young people. Would you advocate
loosening minimum-wage re-strictions to promote teenage employment?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The minimum-wage law is one of thousands of laws that don't do any
good. But it's so frequently ignored that it's not as significant as many
people imagine. The problem in the ghetto is not the minimum wage. The problem
is welfare benefits that are collectively worth more than twice the minimum
wage.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Nonetheless, conventional con-servative wisdom holds that teenage unemployment
is largely caused by minimum-wage barriers.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I don't believe that. I think that teenage unemployment is
ex-acerbated by the minimum wage -- and I don't support the minimum wage.
But I do not accept the idea that our current problems of teenage unemploy-ment
in the inner cities are caused by the minimum-wage requirements. They're
caused by the breakdown of the black family and the demoralization of teenage
boys who have never seen what it means to work to earn a living.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Are you saying the minimum wage is ineffective?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In the ghetto, it certainly is. No-body goes into ghetto communities
to enforce the minimum wage. Nobody pays taxes in those areas. Half the
retail transactions in ghetto establishments are off the books. I dissent
from the whole idea that we have a rigorously enforced small-business economy
in the ghetto in which rules like the minimum wage have any substantial
effect. <BR>
Don't mis-understand me. It's a negative factor -- one more obstacle to
youth employment. <BR>
<BR>
PB: You seem to speak with some authority.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I spent two years researching Visible Man, which concerns
young people in the ghetto.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Did you live in the ghetto?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: On the edge of it, in Albany. Also, I did hundreds of interviews
with black teenagers in New York City through my association on the board
of the Vocational Foundation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And on the basis of all that, do you feel that you're better able to
make observations about how a ghetto economy works?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, honestly, more than the vast majority of sociological experts
on black poverty, I really did spend three years examining very little else.
I inter-viewed literally hundreds of people at great length in all sorts
of contexts in Albany. Then I spent some weeks in Greenville, South Carolina,
interview-ing the same people and their families down there. And I also
did a lot in New York City. So I really did have a good perspective on the
whole problem.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What did you learn?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I confirmed all my preconcep-tions. I had read all the previous
anthropological literature on the subject, so that my prejudices weren't
entirely groundless. And, on the basis of thisprevious literature, I developed
the themes of Sexual Suicide, which really originated with my ghetto analysis.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're talking about the work for which the National Organization for
Women awarded you its Pig of the Year award. How did it begin?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Before I answer, I have to tell you that I succeeded Norman Mailer
in receiving that award and, since it hasn't been awarded since, I think
I've retired the trophy.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We're impressed.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It began with my support of President Nixon's veto of the Javits-/Mondale
child-development bill, which would have created a vast system of federal
day-care centers all across the country. I was editor of The Ripon Forum,
the magazine of the Ripon Soci-ety, a liberal Republican group. I wrote
an editorial opposing these day-care centers, and a bunch of leading Ripon
ladies went on the Today Show to pro-test my vicious polemics and to try
to get me fired. <BR>
<BR>
Then I went on the TV program The Advocates. This particular program was
a debate on day care, and I was brought in to speak for the oppo-sition.
The other people on the show were all Congressmen and professors and experts
on the subject. After I was through, a mass of women in the audi-ence rushed
forward to attack me. Since for decades I'd been seeking a way to arouse
the passionate interests of wom-en, I realized that I'd found my tech-nique,
and it worked for years afterward. And it was then, as I stood there reveling
in my good fortune, that I conceived the idea of writing Sexual Suicide.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We were wondering when you'd explain how you came to write about both
money and sex.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: When I was single, I was pre-occupied with sex. Now that I'm an
elder statesman, I've moved on to a more dignified concern: Preoccupation
with money.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Staying with the former pre-occupation, wasn't it your statement that
you didn't believe in equal pay for equal work that first truly enraged
feminists?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's not what I said. I do believe in equal pay for equal work.
But I don't believe any government program is more likely to encourage this
than the workings of the marketplace. I've seen no evidence that quotas
or gov-ernment programs have fostered it in the slightest degree. The usual
victims of quotas or affirmative-action programs are men with few credentials,
little ed-ucation and large families to support. Upper-class feminists all
believe that any man who makes it just by working harder than a college-educated
feminist must be an evil oppressor.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Hold it. In the first place, you're generalizing about feminists by
depicting them as upper-class elitists. <BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Most feminists are upper-class women. They may call themselves mid-dle
class, but, in fact, a great many of them are in the top 10% of earners.
or they're graduate students or other exalted figures in our system. And
a woman who is a Radcliffe graduate, a relative dilettante in the work force,
often resents the fact that lower-class men can earn more money than she
does by working hard -- often at two jobs -- by putting in overtime and
organizing their lives well.<BR>
<BR>
When you look at the evidence that's available on earnings of the two sexes,
you find that the only group that earns far more than its education and
creden-tials would justify is married men with large families and a high-school
educa-tion or less. My point is that if you know any of these men, you know
they earn every dollar. They deserve more money for the work they do. At
least they deserve it more than some graduate student who wants a &quot;fulfilling&quot;
job in a foundation-sponsored cultural-uplift program. <BR>
<BR>
To the extent the gov-ernment enacts equal pay for equal work, it will mean
more stress on such factors as race and sex, and even more on credentials
and qualifications, while relying less on work effort and ingenuity and
drive and ambition -- those very fac-tors that every close analysis shows
are most important in increasing economic productivity. What many feminists
think will be a fairer system will actually be most unfair: It will favor
the upper classes, who can buy credentials, over the lower classes, who
must compete by working harder and more aggressively.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You re certainly overlooking the Norma Raes of this country, the millions
of working-class women who would agree with some of the aims of the feminist
movement.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, the leaders are all upper--class, and I think many of their
argu-ments apply only to that class -- in other words, that women should
be freer to enter the work force to broaden their horizons and do something
more &quot;ful-filling.&quot; For those women who have to work out of economic
necessity, the op-portunities are there.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So, to you, the political aims of the women's movement are merely an
expression of upper-class lobbying.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's the real clash -- between lower-class, hard-working men without
a lot of elegant refinements and upper-class women who want their credentials
instantly converted into high salaries. And when I talk about &quot;high
salaries,&quot; I mean the upper 10%. Remem-ber that, in this country, anyone
who earns more than $35,000 is in the top 10%, and when you inquire of these
oppressed feminists, you often find they are earning salaries at that level
-- or believe they should be -- when, in fact, such salaries are the object
of the most intense competition. Very few men -- only the most aggressive,
excep-tional and lucky men -- can achieve that kind of income.<BR>
<BR>
I just think the whole women's move-ment is economically illiterate. It
wants to increase government power in a most arbitrary, destructive way,
in the most sensitive area of the nation's econ-omy -- personnel policy.
That's the area where the most subjective and human of factors are involved,
hundreds of them, and they cannot possibly be re-duced to the sorts of statistical
findings a federal judge or a panel of equal-rights advocates would deem
relevant. To have these decisions made by judges and panelists is ridiculous.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Still, wouldn't you acknowl-edge the fact that many of the inequities
the feminist movement battled against were real?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Actually, it was the feminist movement that was never real. It was
all based on fantasy. Women will never pursue careers with the same determina-tion
and drive that men do. Some will, and those some will rise to very high
levels, as indeed they do now. <BR>
<BR>
But, as to the notion that the women's movement has liberated women from
their &quot;traditional&quot; roles, there's just no evidence that women
are working any harder. Women are 11 times as likely to leave the work force
as men are. [According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. by 1980, women
were only five times as likely to leave the work force.] A couple of years
ago, there was great outrage that female doctors were earning less than
male doctors -- until it was determined that female doctors saw 40% few-er
patients than male doctors.<BR>
<BR>
Wherever you look, if you examine the facts, you discover that women do
not engage themselves in the work force with the same ambition and drive
that men exhibit. Until they do, they won't earn equal money. And they never
will, because they have more options than men -- namely, they can withdraw
from the workforce when they wish to, in order to raise children, a fully
respect-able role.<BR>
The idea that large numbers of women are going to make earning money their
top priority misunderstands the difference between the sexes. Men have to
earn money to be sexual beings -- providers, husbands, fathers. Women have
a full range of choices. You can say that, actually, the woman is superior
because her sexuality ranges through pregnancy, the nurture of children
and all sorts of events of vast importance to society. Men have to do only
one thing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Wasn't the whole idea behind women's liberation a freeing of both sexes
-- for women to be able to compete equally in the marketplace and for men
to share in the nurturing of children?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Obviously, the men can't share fully in the nurturing process, and
if you go back to Margaret Mead's quote about motherhood's being a biological
fact and fatherhood a cultural inven-tion, comparing the two is crazy. It's
just plain quixotic to have a society depend on the cultural invention of
a father's &quot;sharing&quot; in the same way it depends or the biological
fact of bear-ing a child in one's body and nurturing it at one's breast.<BR>
Regardless of how desirable it may be for men to participate deeply in the
experience of child-raising, these are not characteristic male roles. Masculinity
is not defined through relations with chil-dren: By bottle-feeding a baby,
you don't affirm your sense of yourself as a man. That's why it's the men
who are already secure in their masculinity who are best able to adapt to
the feminist program. Men who aren't fulfilling themselves as providers
have to fund their masculinity in some other ways. <BR>
<BR>
Among the most conspicuous ways, in these years of liberation, are violence
and drinking and other vicarious macho experiences. In other words, what
the feminists attack as male callousness is a product of masculine insecurity
rather than confidence. Feminists increase this insecurity, and thus increase
the pro-pensity of men to assert their masculin-ity in violent and destructive
ways -- and to disparage women as well. <BR>
<BR>
I mean, if you're confident of your own masculin-ity, you can acknowledge
that woman in m any ways are superior to men and are indispensable to male
happiness and fulfillment.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But if what you say is true, aren't you having it both ways? You say
that men who aren't successful at being men are the ones who resist the
women's movement, who disparage women and that men who are successful at
be-ing good providers, at being men, are the ones who can best adapt to
it. If the aims of the women's movement were based on &quot;fantasy,&quot;
why would the most successful men support it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER Not all do. But those who do are doing so out of chivalry. It's fascinating
to me that so many men who come from traditional backgrounds, who went to
all-male prep schools, through an all-male military, who probably never
worked for a women or gave much thought to female liberation, suddenly find
themselves mouthing feminist clich&eacute;s -- mainly because their wives
were captivated by an essay by Gloria Steinhem. It's just chivalry; they
don't take it seriously. <BR>
<BR>
Ronald Reagan opposes the ERA, but he felt he should give equal time to
his daughter Maureen on the issue. So she uses radio time that he, Ronald
Reagan, earned to attack his position. He wouldn't have done this on any
other issue. It shows he isn't serious about it. It's typical male-chauvinist
behavior: In-dulge the little lady and allow her to be a feminist.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That's interesting. You've ef-fectively called your friend Ronald Reagan
a male chauvinist.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well -- yes. These are the real male chauvinists. The man who is
a suc-cessful lawyer, or the president of a corporation, or the President
of the United States is secure in his manhood, so he allows the little woman
her frivolous ideologies. He may even say he's a feminist himself, because
he doesn't take these concerns very seriously. This shows disdain for women,
not respect. <BR>
Male in-dulgence of feminism is the new male chauvinism. It says, &quot;I
can't be worried by anything these women do; let them do it. I can't be
threatened.&quot; Well, a man who's serious understands he can be threatened
by women. That, in fact, he is more dependent on women than women are on
him. And that a movement like the women's movement can threaten him -- and
society. <BR>
Because what does feminism liberate? It chiefly liber-ates men. It liberates
men from the responsibilities of monogamous marriage, which is the foundation
of civilized life.<BR>
<BR>
PB: How do you square monogamy with your earlier explanation of the double
standard of sexuality?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I said that male sexuality is com-pulsive and short-lived, in contrast
to the women's sexuality, but I feel it needs to be domesticated, in a sense,
by women. Otherwise, as statistics show, it impels a very difficult life
for the single male. <BR>
<BR>
Marriage leads to the subordina-tion of compulsive -- and promiscuous --
male sexual experience to the long-term maternal horizons of female sexuality.
It links men to the future through chil-dren. So when the feminists insist
that female sexuality is the same as that of men, it's just erroneous, as
any man could testify, and fundamentally hostile to women.<BR>
<BR>
The idea that women have the same kind of compulsive, single-minded sexual
potential that men have simply isn't borne out by any of the evidence. They're
superior sexually, because they<BR>
have more options and a broader range of sexuality, but it's not the same.
They can have as much copulatory sexual ex-perience as men, but they can
also forgo it more easily.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you wouldn't admit that the pill and other contraception have had
any effect in changing women's sexual behavior? Plenty of studies indicate
they have.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Oh, sure, the pill has had an ef-fect, but the argument that forgoing
motherhood in favor of a promiscuous sex life has enriched women is a very
dubious proposition. <BR>
<BR>
In any case, the pill would have increased only the very narrow activity
of copulation, and the notion that all of sex can be defined as copulation
is a male-chauvinist idea. To the extent that women accommodate themselves
to that idea, they deny them-selves a far greater sexual potential. You
find a lot of women who have accepted this now expressing their unhappiness,
which the feminists then take as further proof of their oppression. Female
sex-uality is much more extensive and ful-filling than the male version,
because it's linked to other things more important -- continuity and nurturing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Much of your argument is based on women's childbearing role. But what
about women who (A) choose not to have children or (B) want to enter the
work force before or after rais-ing children?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The vast majority of women still do bear children. Of the women
who enter the work force, some will succeed extraordinarily. But, in general,
women won't enter the work force in the same spirit as men. Motherhood is
still the central role for women in all societies, and it certainly is central
to those young, dynamic years when families are formed and careers are launched.
<BR>
<BR>
Women have a more important role altogether in the human race, but there
is one area where men will tend to excel -- and that's in the workplace.
Men will tend to com-pete harder at earning money, because that's what determines
their relationship to family and their access to children. Because they
always have other options, women won't work as hard as men -- they generally
don't take outdoor work, for example, where the money can be better. And,
far from accepting the fact that there's been this vast change, I think
that women don't work as hard today as they did in the past. I grew up in
a farming community, and when America was dominated by farming, women bore
children and worked long-er hours at their chores and in the fields -- contributing
greatly to the econ-omy -- than many do today at careers.<BR>
<BR>
The reason that women don't general-ly win the &quot;rat race&quot; is that
they have more enriching experiences to choose from centered on the family.
Men have to perform outside the family to re-ceive the benefits from it
-- even to per-form sexually. The sex act itself depends on male confidence,
and that's why all societies ascribe special importance to male achievements,
even if, objectively, they're not as important as women's achievements.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But you still haven't addressed our question. If the pill has liberated
women from the automatic fear of preg-nancy, and if women want to compete
in the work force outside of that relatively short childbearing period,
why shouldn't the opportunities and poten-tial be the same as for men?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, first, I think the pill mainly liberated men, allowing them
to find more opportunities for their short-term, compulsive sexuality. I
don't see that it enriched women's lives. <BR>
But, as to the work opportunities, they're there -- for men and women alike.
Women aren't held back. My argument is that to the extent we encourage,
by legislation or otherwise, forced equality in the work-place, we undermine
the strength of so-ciety. <BR>
<BR>
Incidentally, on the question of postponing motherhood, I've been in-volved
with some groups of older Ameri-cans, and overwhelmingly, the response of
those who waited until their 30s to have kids was that they missed having
grandchildren. Those who had children earlier said that one of the single
most enriching experiences of their lives was the enjoyment of their grandchildren.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You surely have more compli-cated thoughts about contraception. Where
do you stand on abortion?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It's a bad form of birth control. When it's made freely available,
it tends to become the dominant form of birth control, as it has in many
East European countries and in Sweden. Half of all Swedish pregnancies end
in abortion, and one third of all births are illegitimate. [According to
U.N. statistics, fewer than one quarter of Swedish pregnancies end in abortion.]
Abortion also can in-crease problems of sterility. <BR>
<BR>
But I know there are all sorts of tragic problems associated with the issue,
and I frankly have no easy solution or response. I certainly don't oppose
other forms of birth control.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you find many intelligent women agreeing with your views?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Antifeminist women tend to be more intelligent and interesting than
feminist women, because they aren't con-formists. Feminists in general succumb
to the fashion that prevails among the American intelligentsia, while it
takes real intellectual courage and conviction to resist this juggernaut,
which most of the media have fueled and supported. <BR>
<BR>
Women like Phyllis Schlafly and her supporters understand the crucial role
of women in society and the impor-tance of maintaining sex roles in order
to have a happy and stable society. They know that it's the differences
between the sexes that lead to love and fulfill-ment and that attempts to
overcome those differences lead to impotence, ste-rility and a tedious kind
of sensuality.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Let's pursue this topic of sex-ual differences a bit more. You've re-peatedly
singled out aggressiveness in males as one of the factors that make them
better competitors in the work force. And in Sexual Suicide, you wrote,
&quot;Boys are more aggressive because of how they are born, not how they
are raised.&quot; Where's your proof of that?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Biology isn't the only factor, but it's certainly true that men
are more aggressive in every society known to anthropology. As a matter
of fact, two leading feminist scholars, Carol Jacklin and Eleanor Maccoby
of Stanford, wrote a voluminous study called Psychology Of Sex Differences.
In it, they concluded<BR>
that the greater aggressiveness of men is biologically determined -- in
all societies and in animal studies. The studies were made in infancy, before
socialization could be a factor. <BR>
I also maintained in Sexual Suicide that, beyond being a biological fact,
it was also a psychological reality, because the sex act itself requires
greater aggres-siveness by the man. Finally, it's an evolutionary experience
-- because if most of our history has been in hunting societies -- males
have depended for their very survival on aggressive kinds of hunting activities,
while women have always been responsible for nurturing small children, which
is a less aggressive responsibility.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Haven't there been societies in which the women have done not only the
raising of children but most of thehunting and food gathering as well?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, there have been societies where men strutted around and pre-tended
that killing a giraffe every six months was the key to the survival of the
tribe, while the women did all the work. But those were irrational soci-eties
that didn't do very well. You can channel natural male aggressiveness into
roles that are unproductive for the community, and even exalt those roles,
but ordinarily the community won't survive.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the evidence of matriarchal societies?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: There is no such evidence. Steven Goldberg wrote a book, The Inevitabili-ty
Of Patriarchy, which Margaret Mead described as &quot;flawless in its presentation
of the data&quot; and which refuted every claim ever made that there had
been a matriarchic society. [Margaret Mead actually wrote, &quot;The reporting
of his sources cannot be faulted... It is when he puts his pieces together...to
form his 'theory,' that he ceases to be persua-sive.&quot;] In each case
that a feminist had described a matriarchy, Goldberg would go back to the
original studies cited by the feminist and show that authority in that particular
society was, in fact, vested with the men. <BR>
<BR>
PB: You're saying that there has never been a successful society in which
equality of the sexes has been achieved. What about Israel and China?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Good examples. A lot has been written about both countries and most
of the evidence bears out my position. <BR>
<BR>
In Israel, there was a real attempt at reversing the sexual roles within
the kibbutzim, and it was found that the women themselves took the lead
in re-fusing the powers ascribed to them un-der that system. Over time,
they refused to go out into the fields and cultivate if it meant having
to pack their kids off to the day-care center. Interestingly, never in the
history of the kibbutz experi-ments did men actually take on child-rearing
roles, nor did women ever take positions of authority, as the political
ideology had prescribed. As a result, today the kibbutz has the most strongly
differentiated sex roles in all of Israeli society. [Other studies on the
Israeli kibbutz dispute the fact that no women took positions of authority.]<BR>
<BR>
China was devoted to some kind of anthill egalitarianism, but when a study
was made of 12,000 people listed by the Communist Party as leaders, only
two -- Mrs. Mao and Mrs. Chou -- were women. And both of those, of course,
made it as a result of being married to their husbands. There just isn't
any evidence that the Chinese overcame sexual-role differ-ences except insofar
as they abolished individuality altogether.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You don't think very much of the women's movement, do you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I don't think it's done us any good, but I wouldn't exaggerate
the impact of it. In general, I am not a sexual liberationist. As I've said,
I think marriage and family are the foundations of civilized life, and anything
that tends to be hostile to the formation of fami-lies -- or receptive to
their breakup -- tends to increase social problems and decrease productivity.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, I think the feminist movement probably hurts young boys. In
the cases I've cited in which the man leaves home, families headed by females
tend to make it more difficult for boys to grow up into responsible and
loving adults. That leads to increasing distress among women about the quality
and attitudes of men they know -- and the circle closes in on itself. Yet
the response of some of these women is to advo-cate yet more women's liberation,
when this process is the cause of the problem rather than the solution to
it.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You'd better explain what you mean when you say that the feminist movement
harms young boys.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It goes back to what I said first got me involved in my critique
of femi-nism -- my studies of welfare programs that had the effect of usurping
the father's provider role in the ghetto. The response of feminism to this
miscon-ceived government policy was to pro-pose that welfare mothers be
provided with work and that their children be provided with a massive system
of day--care centers. It struck me that having deprived black families of
fathers, the feminists were proceeding to take away the mothers as well.
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes I would get the impression, after reading about the proposed solutions,
that to a fem-inist, the only truly liberated individual would be an orphan
at a government-funded day-care center. It just seemed crazy to me.<BR>
<BR>
The real problem, obviously, was to get the fathers back into their homes
as providers. The women just couldn't cope alone with their sons. The boys
were out on the street, finding their masculinity in gangs and various macho
displays, while the mothers were struggling to maintain some kind of order
in the home. <BR>
<BR>
Then the feminists came along with their grand solution: Take the kids away
and stash them in day-care centers and dispatch the mothers to jobs of various
kinds, such as sweeping offices or scrubbing toilets or whatever kinds of
work are available to welfare mothers in America's big cities. And this
was liberation! <BR>
<BR>
The feminists could write won-derful poetry about the stimulating environments
ingenious civil servants could create for the children, but the re-ality
of most day-care programs is a lot less attractive, especially when the
child goes home to a parent exhausted after a nine-hour job. There has been
a lot written by feminists about how good a job can be for both child and
mother, how she goes home invigorated and can be a better parent to the
child. This shows a complete incomprehension of how tiring and difficult
most jobs are.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the case of women who, very simply, want to work?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Of course, there are many women in the market place doing terribly
valua-ble work who are making major con-tributions to society. That's one
of the options those women have. But many women are working chiefly because
they have to, because the economy isn't offer-ing sufficient opportunities
for their husbands, and they're certainly not ex-periencing any kind of
liberation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We think we sense a closing of your particular circle here, from wom-en's
liberation to men's predicament to your prescription for economic solutions.
<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Right. Liberation for many wom-en would be the right to return to
the home and devote themselves fully to domestic life. If things go as I
hope, I foresee a booming economy, and one that will be very favorable for
the American family. <BR>
<BR>
In the end, you can't separate economics from sex or faith or love or any
of the other wellsprings of human behavior. The mathematical models of conventional
economic the-ory -- like the unisex models of femi-nism -- leave out everything
that makes life interesting and makes the economy go. Again, you have to
get back to what's in people's heads -- and that's things like love and
ambition, desire and faith, sex and money -- not aggregate demand or undifferentiated
&quot;human beings.&quot; I nev-er met a human being. The people I know
are men and women, and that's the way I like it.<BR>

TOGETHER AGAIN</CENTER>

</H3>
<BR>
<H3>My friends, it would behoove you to study everything you can get your
hands on by <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A>, a true American genius.
Here is the second interview he was kind enough to grant me for my newsletter.
Learn it, love it, live it. -- Rush Limbaugh<BR>
<BR>
<HR></H3>
	RUSH: You are very gracious, sir, to consent to undergoing another grilling.
What I primarily want to talk to you about is your December 18th op-ed in
The Wall Street Journal. You made the case that American progress and innovation
have depended heavily on genius. But the thing that puts you at odds with
much of populist thought in America today is that you say this genius would
not flourish in this country without immigration. For people who didn't
read the piece, could you basically recap your theory?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: All of America's great achievements have come from immigration.
We initially were a nation of immigrants, of course. That was the initial
genius of America -- that we received people fleeing persecution and oppression
in Europe and elsewhere, who found a land of opportunities, new frontiers,
in the United States.<BR>
	This has been true throughout our history. New waves of immigrants have
resulted in new upsurges of income, productivity, innovation and achievement.
The spearheads of this achievement have always been this &quot;genius class,&quot;
as I roughly describe it. I do believe that genius is 90% perspiration.
But it does have a genetic content as well. This is a class of people who
are just enormously more productive than others, and they tend to go where
they're welcomed, and stay where they're well-treated.<BR>
	America has been their land of opportunity for most of the past century.
Receiving these immigrants during the Second World War made possible the
Manhattan Project, which produced the atomic bomb, which ended the war successfully
and then allowed us to continue in the lead in the arms race. This was critical,
because it was almost entirely immigrants who created the atomic bomb, the
hydrogen bomb, the intercontinental-missile program, the space program.
All were heavily fueled by immigration and the geniuses who emigrated to
our shores.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Is it safe to say that the development of all these projects would
not have occurred at all, were it not for immigration?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes. I don't think we could have had the Manhattan Project. The
Manhattan Project was an achievement of European immigrants, a lot of them
Jewish, who brought their genius to the United States and put together the
bomb. There were some Americans, but mostly in relatively lesser roles.
<BR>
	Then, later, all our technologies fed on this input from outsiders -- particularly
the microchip, which is really the heart of the present, American global
leadership. <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: George, longer than anyone I can recall (aside from those in the
business directly), you have been touting the relevance and importance of
the computer to America's future. In your piece in the Journal you cite
some of the key inventors of the microchip, developers of that technology,
as also being immigrants.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: The company that really founded the microchip industry in the United
States, as the microprocessor industry evolved into the personal-computer
industry, was Fairchild Semiconductor. When the parent company tried to
control it too closely, the key people spun off and became Intel Corporation.
The group at Fairchild and Intel were led by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce,
both of whom were American geniuses and inventors. But most of the other
people at Intel, or at least half of the other major contributors, were
immigrants. Andrew Grove fled through a field across the Hungarian border
in 1956, barely escaping the Russian tanks. <BR>
	RUSH: Grove runs Intel now.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes. Earlier on in his career, he ran a couple of crucial projects
at Intel that made them dominant in MOS technology, Metal Oxide Semiconductor
technology, which is really the foundation of the whole industry. In every
major semiconductor company, and every major semiconductor project, between
a third and two-thirds of key contributors are immigrants. Americans have
just not focused on these hard-core engineering skills.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But is that a lack of genius indigenous to America?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I think it's the result of a variety of things. In software, which
entails similar degrees of genius, the numbers are not so high: Probably
10 to 15% of the major contributors to America's software predominance an
immigrants. But they are critical contributors. It's not this overwhelming
phenomenon that one discovers in microchips. But both of them were absolutely
critical to the personal-computer industry, which, in turn, is the driving
force of American economic growth and the spearhead of world economic growth
today.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: A lot of readers -- many of them who might not even have computers
-- are going to argue: &quot;How can you say that? What about all these
jobs we're losing to Japan, jobs we're losing to Mexico, jobs we're losing
across the seas -- the manufacturing jobs that everybody thinks are the
heart and soul of this country?&quot; Here you've just said it is the microchip
and its derivatives which are leading the world today in growth and expansion.<BR>
<BR>
	 GILDER: Since the ascendancy of the microchip, beginning<BR>
around 1970, the U.S. has outperformed all the other economies in the world,
overwhelmingly, in job-creation. You just can't make the argument that we've
been losing jobs to other countries. We've created some 35 million net new
jobs in the last 30 years -- while the Europeans, for example, have created
almost no net new jobs outside of government consumption. The Japanese have
created new employment, but substantially less than we have. <BR>
	How can we be losing jobs to countries that are creating jobs radically
more slowly than we are?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But the manufacturing sector is what many people look to and say,
&quot;Hey! You can't be a unionized worker anymore and afford a house. You
used to be able to in America in the '50s. You can't do it anymore.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Anybody whose livelihood depends on examining union jobs and the
performance of unions, or collecting statistics for unions, or mobilizing
campaigns for unions, has a great incentive to disparage all this new employment
and opportunity in America, because it does largely arise outside the unionized
sectors. That is true. The unions have all flocked to the dinosaurs. They
all attempt to preserve jobs in old industries that are declining. <BR>
	And the new employment has been emerging in semiconductors, software, computer
manufacturing, as well as services in software. Manufacturing has continued
to grow. We're the dominant computer manufacturer in the world. We also
lead telecommunications and networks. And the Internet, which is entirely
an American creation, is now the dominant force in the world economy.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Yet you still have, in the American political scene, this anti-immigration
sentiment. And many of the people who are showing some moderate signs of
success [by] attacking this loss of manufacturing sector jobs are conservatives.
Perot's slightly conservative on balance, you'd have to say, although he's
made his money in computers. Buchanan is turning into a David Bonior in
this area, when it comes to industrialized job-loss. <BR>
	And people believe it. When they read you saying this, they're going to
scratch their heads, because there are a tremendous number of citizens who
believe we're losing jobs left and right; that the country is going south
fast; and that we've got to build a wall around America. Yet here you are
saying the worst thing we could possibly do is limit immigration.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Illegal aliens who come in and are prohibited from having employment,
but mandated to receive welfare, are a problem -- it's the welfare state
that's the problem [in that case]. We have a welfare state mandated to reach
out to immigrants and induce them to take advantage of all the benefits.
You've been talking about this on your program. The welfare state is now
an enterprise, and it's &quot;reaching out&quot; to immigrants. The result
is that today's illegal aliens and immigrants are being captured by the
welfare state more rapidly than previous immigrant groups. And this is very
destructive, because welfare destroys everybody it touches.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: There's a rising tide of people who believe that the only way to
fix this is to stop all immigration.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Rush, it makes no sense. I don't think it's very valuable to stop
Mexicans from coming to the United States and doing the jobs they do mostly.
National Review magazine, on the basis of alarms about illegal immigration,
advocates a moratorium on all immigration, which would be incredibly destructive.
It would mean that lots of high-technology companies just couldn't operate
in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Let's construct a hypothesis here. There's a wall built around America
-- no immigration. We have embarked on a course of acculturating those who
are here, who have not yet learned Americanism. That's the strategy: Until
we can acculturate those who are here, we need to shut down. Are you suggesting
that, if this situation occurred, there is not somehow an ability here toproduce
the genius amongst those who live in the contiguous 48 plus Alaska and Hawaii
to continue this high-tech revolution?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: For certain key jobs and key inventive roles, there are just a
very few people in the world capable of performing them. The numbers are
small, and that small number tends to be distributed all around the world.
So any company that wants to be absolutely on the leading edge, to get the
best people in every field working together to produce some new product
-- whether it's a new kind of fiber-optic application for a broad-band Internet,
or whether it's a new kind of digital disk, or a new Internet computer,
or whatever it is -- those people have to command the best in all these
fields. If they can't get the best people to come to the United States,
they have to go to the best people. That's just a fact of life.<BR>
	And it's not new. It was true about Henry Ford, when he was starting Ford
Motor Company. Ford was the leading-edge company in the world economy, and
he &quot;imported&quot; a whole bunch of people from Scotland, England and
Germany to help him build his cars. Key advances in Ford Motor Company were
attributable to immigrants. When you are leading-edge, you are effectively
the spearhead for the entire planetary economy -- [so] you've got to get
the best, wherever they are. That's true about a lot of companies in the
United States.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Isn't it also true that America is one of the few places where genius
can flourish?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That is right. So it would be horrendous, not just for the U.S.
but for the world, if you stopped the geniuses from coming. But there's
another point: For the last decade or so American culture -- the public
culture, the TV culture, the mass culture -- has been kind of hostile to
genius.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: They're hostile to all achievement.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Correct. You, of course, have been the leader in making the case
against this hostility in our culture. But the schools are amazingly hostile
to genius. The result has been that American culture does not produce as
many of these people as it did in the past. Asians who come over and can
hardly read the language are thus immune to most of the seductions of the
welfare state and to the seductions of the imperial National Education Association
establishment. These newcomers dominate the schools [and ignore] all these
distractions -- while Americans are so attuned to the anti-achievement culture
that they regard these activities as beneath them.<BR>
	So the immigrants, ultimately, will help. You get these people in high
schools winning the valedictorian awards and going to the best colleges.
It creates a competitive counterforce that I think will regenerate American
culture.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Back to this resentment of achievement. We have these high-achieving
immigrants now being aced out of entry into various colleges, because we're
trying to not &quot;humiliate&quot; people. We are limiting the number of
high-achievers so as to spread the opportunity around to others. The goal
now is that everybody will pretty much be the same, in terms of equality
of outcome.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That is, of course, a menace. If you really want to have equality,
you can have everybody equally poor.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: There are those striving for it, even as we speak.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Exactly. And if you have a moratorium on immigrants, you'll be
making a major contribution to it. Because a lot of these immigrants are
very aggressive and creative and innovative and some of them are geniuses
who can revitalize an entire economy. <BR>
	Pat Buchanan -- who is correct about many things -- has, I think, been
somewhat twisted by this aspiration to cut into the unionized lower-middle-class
Democrats Perot is alleged to have attracted. It is chiefly a political
appeal he's making; he's trying to expand the Republican parry. I think
he's very smart. But they've stumbled on a bad one when they seriously talk
about a moratorium on immigration. Not just a slight little error, but a
truly deadly mistake.<BR>
	RUSH: It resonates, though, because there's a new nationalist fervor among
people who believe their jobs and livelihoods are being taken away from
them. I think they are largely union people who've grown up in unionized
homes; that's been the culture that they've been familiar with, and that's
what America always was to them, and now it's vanishing. Union membership
is down below 15%. And those who still survive are having to &quot;give
back&quot; wage gains and benefit gains. <BR>
	They think that anybody who wants to save their livelihood and their tradition
is a great American, because that's what America was. &quot;America was
not the computer. It wasn't the microprocessor, the microchip, or Microsoft.
It wasn't the Internet. America was steel. It was coal. It was the Teamsters
and truck-drivers.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: We had the Korean War. There were bodies coming back in bags, and
three recessions, and people lived eight or nine years less.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: And you had to have a bomb-shelter in the back yard. You had to get
civil-defense instructions, and to see that the drinking water changed every
three weeks in case they nuked us.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: And, in many of these same union families, their parents came here
on a boat and struggled in some appalling jobs, by anybody's standards today.
I mean, to celebrate coal miners' jobs! One of the great triumphs is to
get beyond this kind of work, where people died years younger. It just is
a false nostalgia. Here we had, during this early period toward which people
are nostalgic, two World Wars, the Great Depression, the Korean War.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: It's an economic nostalgia. They remember the days where you, on
a salary of $12,000 a year, could buy a house, and could afford to send
your kid to college, and there were no credit cards, so you didn't go into
debt. And now the average cost for a house is 10 times what anybody makes
a year.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: But the average house is 20% bigger than it was, and 79% of new
houses have air-conditioning.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: So you would agree with the premise that every day in America is
a better day.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes, absolutely! And my grandchildren are going to live phenomenally,
incomparably better than we do.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Despite what happened to Don Shula, let me go to one more thing in
your column, because this really intrigued me. You know, if I didn't have
my mind, I would like to have yours. In fact, I'd probably rather have yours
anyway. But you say the current Republican fervor to balance the budget
is &quot;Hooverian.&quot; And that they've wasted a year on this premise.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: When you [make] a balanced budget your goal, you play into the
hands of the Democrats. You immediately put the focus on cutting government
spending. So your whole campaign is perceived by the people -- who get their
information largely from the media megaphones -- as negative. The Republicans
are somehow going to cut spending drastically, and this terrifies the 33%
of Americans who are dependent one way or another on government jobs and
subsidies.<BR>
	So you end up terrorizing millions of people, but you don't achieve anything
of value. Because Democrats succeed: As a result of this threat, they succeed
in mobilizing sufficient political force to stop major cuts. Meanwhile,
the things worth doing, the things people will really enjoy -- tax-rate
reductions, privatization, deregulation, all these positive programs Republicans
should push and  you've been pushing for years -- get lost. <BR>
	So we end up just talking about balanced budgets seven years from now.
Who the hell cares?<BR>
	The last time we had a balanced budget was 1979. It was an all-governmental
balanced budget, and we [also] had a trade surplus. Yet the whole private
economy was in the red. With the Reagan years, America's assets have risen,
since then, from about $17 trillion to $40 trillion. Yet we're speaking
as if the Reagan Administration was some kind of orgy of debt.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Bit is it an error of substance they've made? Or an error of strategy?
Because obviously what they're trying to do is nor just balance the budget.
They're trying to end the welfare stare. They're trying to reduce the size
of government so as to make more prosperous the individual. You would agree
with that, wouldn't you?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I agree with their visions. I don't agree with their tactics --
and their tactics have now, in my judgment, largely subsumed their vision.
So they end up essentially attempting to achieve something called &quot;balanced
budget&quot; by cutting various government programs. That is a completely
negative formula, and it's political poison. Moreover, it doesn't achieve
any good results<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But I am in favor of ending a lot of government programs. I'm also
in favor of the American people understanding why. I don't want to have
come up with a strategy to fool the American people -- perhaps, to win,
you must. But I would love to be able to educate the American people, to
say: &quot;This program is worthless. It's wasteful. It doesn't need to
exist. We don't need to be paying you to conduct sleigh-rides around herds
of elk in Jellystone National Park. And I'm not going to sit here and take
your job away from you without telling you why. I'm going to make sure you
understand this is not a function of government.&quot;<BR>
	Is that strategy a guaranteed loser, because so many people have now been
indoctrinated to the degree that they depend on government, and panic if
they think it's not going to be there?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I think you have to start by cutting tax rates. Big tax- rate reductions
would be entirely positive. They would pay for themselves. They would enrich
the country. They would make Republicans popular -- despite what the polls
happen to say.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: The Democrats would do the same thing, though. They would call them
tax cuts for the rich, and you'd still have the same arguments that are
taking place now. Because Democrats are not going to lay down and let happen
what the true objective is, which is to reduce government, regardless of
how the Republicans characterize it.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: To the extent the goal is defined as cutting back government programs,
the Democrats win. To the extent the goal is defined as unleashing the American
economy, creating huge numbers of new jobs and opportunities, reducing tax
rates, deregulating bureaucracy, we win. The focus on the balanced budget
is a mistake, and this mistake was imposed on the party by a pollster. Politicians
who follow public-opinion polls earn the contempt of the public. And that
is the big danger today, because Republicans on television most of the time
are saying something about a balanced budget that isn't true.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Such as?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Such as, that it will greatly lower interest rates and produce
all these marvelous benefits. This could be achieved by tax cuts, but [not]
by the balanced-budget process -- because you have to begin by saying tax
cuts cost revenue, which is nonsense. Republicans from the beginning agreed
to accept the static budgeting method, that tax cuts don't affect economic
behavior. Tax cuts increase revenue, as you've explained endlessly, but
this still hasn't penetrated beyond your audience.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Well, they're even afraid to defend the Reagan years on that. But,
if you get rid of the deficit, haven't you freed up a pool of anywhere from
$150 billion to $300 billion that doesn't have to be borrowed by government
and, as such, won't money be in greater supply? Therefore, supply-and-demand
would dictate interest rates would come down?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That's an accounting view of the economy. There's another view,
which focuses on asset values. As John Rutledge at the Claremont Institute
in California explains, we have something like $40 trillion of assets in
the American economy. Those numbers  you're using, relating to the flow
of funds into the federal government, are picayune compared to the immense
changes in asset-values that go on in response to different government policies.
If you cut tax rates, asset-values in general increase. And they increase
not by a few hundred billion dollars, but by trillions of dollars. <BR>
	Money is relevant only as a symbol of productive services that somebody
has offered. This idea that somehow you can I unleash new money which will
automatically expand the economy is the fallacy of demand-side economics
-- and I know you oppose that. Bur the balanced-budget illusion is largely
based on demand-side calculations.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: What about the theories, as advanced by Pete Peterson and others,
that if we don't get a handle on it now, the national tax rate is going
to be 84% for a child born in 1990? That Social Security and all of these
things that actually should be calculated as part of the deficit but aren't
[will] bleed the economy dry, with taxation on fewer numbers of productive
people? They say balancing the budget and paying for what you spend is crucial
to keeping solvent all these various contracts we've made with generations.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Several analysts have questioned the basic accounting functions
Peterson and Rudman and that group have been adducing. But, to Peterson,
the whole Reagan Administration was an absolutely catastrophic failure.
He's one of these one-hand economists. On the one hand, he can see liabilities.
But he can't count assets -- the other hand. So he sees the liabilities
of the federal government growing. But he can't see the tens of trillions
of dollars of new assets emerging from these new industries that have been
generated and are now the spearheads of global economic growth.<BR>
	American companies now earn some 47% of all the profits in world economy.
American dominance today, industrially, is probably as great as ever before,
except immediately surrounding a war triumph. This is much more important
than these numbers Peterson talks about.<BR>
	The Gingrich error was to start by cutting -- by threatening -- existing
programs, rather than by starting with the flat tax. That should have been
what they came into office with. Let Clinton make all the arguments about
why we shouldn't have a tax return on a post card. <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Can the Republicans win in November?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Sure, they can. I think Steve Forbes is really defining the issues
on which we can win. To the extent the winning candidate really follows
that theme, he can win. What's your impression of Steve?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I love what Steve's doing. I absolutely do.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Do you think he's beginning to show some real political aptitude?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I think he's learning. I don't know if it's soon enough to overcome
Dole's insurmountable lead. It's not over till it's over but, boy, it looks
awfully doubtful for anybody buy Dole.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: A lot of people must tell you this, but you essentially did it
in '94. And you really could greatly change things in '96. I think you could
shape the situation and force Dole to respond to your position, because
you really are the foundation of the Republican Party now. It's a hell of
a responsibility, Rush!<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Well, somebody has to do it.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Why don't you run? <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I don't want the pay cut.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That's right! But you could make these guys face this issue. They
believe that Reagan's tax cuts were a mistake.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: They do, because to them it's a zero-sum game. They have no understanding
of the expansion capabilities of people keeping what they earn. George,
let's talk again.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Obviously, any time.<BR>

From the automobile to the television set, technological breakthroughs often
have demanded legislative breakthroughs. This is an era of profound and
far reaching breakthroughs in wireless communications. I congratulate Senator
Pressler for rising to this technological challenge by providing the necessary
legislative breakthrough: a set of proposals for spectrum reform that will
go far toward opening the way to dramatic advances in spectrum technology.
I fervently support his five major initiatives--spectrum privatization,
spectrum management cooperatives, spectrum bloc grants to states, federal
spectrum convergence under the FCC, and most important of all, flexible
frequency sharing, as opposed to exclusive frequency assignments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A crucial complement to the Pressler proposals is is the conversion of broadcasters--now
endowed as spectrum hoarders and analog polluters--into more efficient and
profitable users of cable coax and the limitless infrared spectrum of fiber
optics. As Nicholas Negroponte has been pointing out for the last six years
or more, in his famous proposal for a &quot;Negroponte Switch,&quot; broadcasters
should moue onto wires and voice telephony into the air<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Paul Baran formerly at IBM and now at Sun observed in his keynote speech
to the Marconi Centennial Symposium in Italy, &quot;The major spectrum hog
[and spectrum problems is analog broadcast TV transmission.&quot; Senator
Dole also targeted this problem in a bold speech tow months ago. Congress
could give every existing broadcaster free access to cable at a cost at
least $70 billion lower than the cost of letting broadcast tycoons have
exclusive control of 485 megahertz of prime microwave frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, Congress should bring to a screaming halt the oppressive new
telecom tax of federal spectrum auctions. If you subsidize something, you
get more ot it. If you tax it, you get less. The US government is now punitively
taxing telecom innovation. As Eli Noam of Columbia puts it, &quot;We can
agree that governments should not subsidize telecommunications under an
industrial policy. We also should agree that government should not extract
huge new taxes from innovative telecom companies.' As Noam points out, this
policy will surely backfire when other countries around the world begin
taxing American telecom companies for their use <I>of </I>the so called
&quot;natural resource&quot; <I>of </I>spectrum. Sure enough, the UN is
now contemplating this global &quot;resource&quot; recently discovered and
sanctified by the taxers and spenders of the US government.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Senators, the air is not a &quot;resource.&quot; It is the environment.
The value of electromagnetic frequencies is entirely created out of thin
air by the inventors of new radio and computer technology. Your job is to
prevent it from being polluted by obsolete high powered smokestack emissions
from analog<BR>
transmitters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All existing spectrum policies have become obsolete as a result of radical
new technological breakthroughs in wireless telecopy Converging with advances
in cheap and powerful computer technology, radio is now returning to a pivotal
role in technological progress. At the very moment of a fa W ish fixation
with the radio frequency spectrum--aroused by the FCC's auctions of some
200 megahertz worth of licenses for new cellular Personal Communications
Services (PCS) plus an amazing proposed giveaway to the world's leading
analog polluters--new radio technologies are devastating all the most basic
assumptions of spectrum regulation. At a time when the world is about to
take to information superhighways in the sky, plied by pollution free data-planes,
the FCC is in danger of building a legal infrastructure and protectionist
program for information smokestack industries and diesel locomotives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the language used in describing the auction betrays its misconceptions.
Spectrum is described as &quot;beachfront property&quot; and the auction
as a &quot;land rush.&quot; The basic assumption is that spectrum is like
real estate; many people cannot use the same frequencies at once. Radios
are assumed to be infectious, high powered, and blind; each needs to be
quarantined in its own spectrum slot.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
New technologies from companies such as Steinbrecher Inc. in Burlington,
Massachusetts, Airnet in Melbourne, Florida, Motorola in Schaumberg, Ill.,
Arraycomm in San Jose, and Qualcomm Inc. in San Diego overthrow this paradigm.
Not only can multiple radios operate at non-interfering levels below the
threshold of noise but they can also see the signals of other users and
moue to avoid them. If appropriately handled, these technologies can render
spectrum not scarce but abundant. These developments make it retrograde
to assign exclusive spectrum rights to anyone or to foster technologies
that require exclusivity. Except for the nearly infinite expanse of contiguous
waves, spectrum no longer shows any of the features of beachfront property.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Think of it this way. In the field of spectrum technology, we are in the
midst of a transition resembling the moue from railroads to cars early this
century. A railroad is hard wired and circuit switched; only one train can
use a particular stretch of tracks at one time. Railroads have to be run
and governed by a centralized authority, overseeing use of a particular
network of connected tracks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A highway, by contrast can accommodate thousands of automobiles, trucks,
campers, bikes, motorbikes, and vans at one time, each under its own power
and control. What makes the superhighway function without top down control?
Essentially, it's smart antenna technology: human eyes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Human eyes are smart antennas with a bandwidth of some 300 trillion hertz
or cycles per second of spectrum. Human eyes scan the road and assure that
cars do not collide with other vehicles, interfere with them, or drive them
off the road. With every car responsible for its own domain, a superhighway
can accommodate scores of thousands of vehicles at once, each going to its
own destination.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A receiving antenna is like a pair of human eyes: it converts photons into
electrons, electromagnetic waves into electrical energy. The difference
until recently is that eyes are smart: they have 10 billion neurons integrating
and interpreting their electromagnetic signals. Until recently , radios
were dumb and blind. Thus you needed a separate radio for every frequency
channel or road, and you needed to keep the way completely clear of other
vehicles. Broadcasters for example, use obsolete analog signals that require
megawatts of power yet cannot endure the slightest interference; they require
a 50 decibel signal to noise ratio, or 100 thousand to one. Thus these blind
analog radios have to control exclusively their spectrum. Similarly cellular
phones today in the US usually need exclusive use of wide spans of spectrum
and can only reuse frequencies in one out of seven cells.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies using obsolete blind radio technology--and experts in the old
analog systems--haue persuaded the government to sell them exclusive licenses
to spectrum. Think of them as railroad magnates prohibiting the use of cars.
You can t have cars on the road, they say, cars will crash into each other,
drive each other off the road. They will speed; it will be chaos. Sound
familiar? I have spent hours at the FCC listening to government spectrum
experts make similar arguments about the chaos and collisions that could
result from a new spectrum regime that follows the inspiration of Senator
Pressler's proposals: his flexible frequency, frequency overlay, unlicensed
frequency, and cooperative frequency management plans. All imply the sharing
of spectrum like the sharing of superhighways or even the sharing of the
air.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm sure that if the FCC had to assign an exclusive span of air for each
person to breathe, we would all be gagging and wheezing today. We would
be holding urgent Senatorial sessions to contemplate the crisis of scarce
oxygen. People talk about spectrum as beachfront property., If the FCC controlled
beach sand, we would all be running out of silicon for our microchips.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a different model, contemplate the 40 million cordless phones in the
US, all sharing the same tiny sliver of spectrum with burglar alarms and
other appliances without significant interference. Consider the scores of
thousands of unlicensed user of the ISM bands (Industrial, Scientific, and
Medical), using spread spectrum technology to share frequencies. Then consider
the rapidly advancing technology of smart radios--radios with antennas like
eyes that can scan broad ranges of frequencies and use whatever lanes or
slots are open on the highway.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Digital radios can function with a signal to noise ratio under 10 to one--ten
thousand times lower than analog broadcasts. These smart digital radios
change wireless from a radio business to a computer business, and that makes
all the difference. With smart radios, it makes no more sense to award exclusive
frequencies than to award exclusive rights to the air.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Smart radios--often called software radios or broadband digital radios--are
the hottest single technology in wireless. The leading technical publication
in the field, EEE Communications magazine, recently devoted an entire issue
to them, noting in the editor's introduction that several articles had been
withdrawn at the last minute because they contained crucial business secrets.
Donald Cox of Stanford University--formerly Bellcore's inventor of PCS technology--predicts
that over the next five years these technologies will reduce the average
capital cost of a cellular customer from $5555 to $14. Last month the pioneering
smart radio company--Steinbrecher Corporation of Burlington, Mass.--was
bought for $93 million by the fastest growing major telecommunications equipment
supplier, Tellabs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the next five years, smart radio equipment will completely obsolete
all the assumptions that currently govern spectrum policy. Broadband basestations
that can handle a large variety of frequencies, protocols, and modulation
schemes will proliferate around the world, allowing bandwidth on demand
for internet access anywhere and for cheap new wireless local loops.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the technical difference between wires and air will largely disappear
with the emergence of space division multiple access technology which can
isolate a single call in a cell. Both wires and air will be seen as channels
for photons. Some photons will run at infrared frequencies down fibers with
limitless bandwidth over long distances, and some photons will link through
the air to local base stations at microwave frequencies for mobility. Senator
Pressler's visionary proposals are a crucial first step to this new of digital
wireless communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, the FCC is fostering a real estate paradigm for the spectrum.
You buy or lease spectrum as you lease a spread of land. Once you have your
licence, you can use it anyway you want as long as you don't unduly disturb
the neighbors. You rent a stretch of beach and build a wall.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With these technologies available, however, the FCC should not be giving
exclusive rights to anyone who makes the highest bid. Instead, it should
be imposing a heavy burden of proof on any service provider with blind or
high powered systems who maintains that he cannot operate without an exclusive
license, who wants to build on the beach and keep everyone else out of the
surf. In coming years, it may even be appropriate for the FCC to make all
the proponents of Time Division Multiple Access, whether in the American
or European GSM systems, explain why the government should wall off spectrum
for them at a time when exclusivity is no longer needed or desirable. The
wireless systems of the future will offer bandwidth on demand and send their
packets wherever there is room.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time that new technologies make hash of the need to auction
off exclusive licenses, Qualcomm, Arraycomm, Steinbrecher, and other companies
also radically attack the very notion of spectrum scarcity on which the
auction is based. Smart radios make it possible to manufacture new spectrum
nearly at will. By putting a multiprotocol-basestation on every telephone
pole and down every alley and in every elevator shaft, the cellular industry
can exponentially multiply the total number of calls that can be handled.
Dropping in price at the pace of Moore's Law, these minicells can operate
at 900 megahertz or six gigahertz just as well as at the 2 gigahertz range
being auctioned by the government. It is as if Reed Hundt is auctioning
off beachfront property, with a long list of codicils and regulations and
restrictive covenants, while the tide pours in around him and creates new
surf everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still more important in view of the coming auction, this capability of smart
radios joins spread spectrum in allowing the use of huge spans of spectrum
that are ostensibly occupied by other users. The smart radio can range through
the gigahertz reserves of the military and intelligence services, UHF television
and microwave, and direct usage to the many fallow regions. Together with
spread spectrum, which allows as many as 32 users in a particular frequency
band and cell at once, and which permits 100 percent frequency reuse (all
frequencies can be used in every cell), the broadband digital radio system
changes the very nature of spectrum &quot;ownership&quot; or renal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unrestricted to a single band or range of frequencies, smart radios can
reach from the kilohertz to the high gigahertz and go to any unoccupied
territory. As such radios become the dominant technology, the notion of
spectrum assignments allotted in 4887 specific shards becomes a technological
absurdity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In his speech at the radio centennial, Paul Baran summed it up: &quot;There
really is no fundamental reason for a shortage of UHF spectrum...the frequency
shortage is caused by thinking solely in terms of dumb transmitters and
dumb receivers. With today's smart electronics, even occupied frequencies
could be used...The present regulatory mentality tends to think in terms
of a centralized control structure, reminiscent of the old Soviet economy,&quot;
where everything was scarce.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We should instead adopt the Internet model that is currently reshaping the
entire landscape of information technology. The Internet accomodated a 1600
percent rise in traffic in 1995 without breaking down. In the Internet,
there is no central node, no hierarchy of control, only a heterarchical
system with minimal housekeeping functions at the center. A similar system
for spectrum could emerge under Senator Pressler's visionary proposals for
a new world of wireless progress.<BR>

Congress' Two Trillion Dollar Opportunity</CENTER>
</H1>
<IMG SRC="aredblue.gif" WIDTH="800" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<BR>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Senate Commerce Committee, thank you for
inviting me here today during what is a golden, though probably brief, moment
of opportunity for the American economy and civilization. Thanks to the
nature of new technologies and a dawning political awareness that these
technologies have overturned the logic of regulation, Congress has the chance
to free American industry to lead the world into what I have called the
&quot;telecosm.&quot; Ahead is forming an environment of unprecedented hospitality
for individual creativity, family authority and economic growth. What this
telecosm requires from the government now is bold deregulation -- a freedom
model -- of telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Should Congress fail to adopt a freedom model and persist in the illusory
hope that government can shape the future through regulation, America will
lose up to two trillion dollars of new economic activity -- stock market
values, incomes and job growth. Specifically, unless telephone and cable
companies are allowed to merge or directly collaborate with one another
to create fiber optic systems and digital services in the phone companies'
existing territories, and unless entitlement subsidies and other artificial
regulatory requirements are ended quickly and decisively, financial obstacles
to investment will delay introduction of the pending communications revolution
by five to seven years. Not only will our languid economy lose the massive
two trillion dollars stimulus I am predicting, but America also will lose
its worldwide leadership in telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I arrive at the two trillion dollar estimate by comparing opportunities
for high technology advances in the 1990's with those of the 1980's, as
illuminated by research conducted by Michael Jensen, recent president of
the American Financial Association, and his students at the Harvard Business
School. Jensen's research reveals how a de-regulated environment aided in
the industrial revitalization that produced such new or reorganized companies
as McCaw, TCI, MCI, Time-Warner, Disney, Turner, and Viacom, and gave a
one and a half trillion dollar boost to the US economy. An even stronger
opportunity awaits the field of telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In several books and articles I have described the &quot;law of the microcosm&quot;
which ordains that the price-performance of microchips rises by the square
of the increase in the number of transistors on a single chip. Thus, distributed
single-chip systems grow exponentially more efficient than centralized multi-chip
machines, epitomized by the mainframe computer. It is this law of the microcosm
that has revolutionized technological change in the past fifteen years,
and through it, our economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the law of the microcosm is converging with the &quot;law of the telecosm.&quot;
This law ordains that the value and performance of a network of computers
rises apace with the square of the increase in the number of computers linked
to it. As these forces fuse, the world of computers and communications rides
an exponential rocket.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Among the wonders awaiting us in the telecosm is, for example, a &quot;teleputer&quot;
that combines, in one unit, interactive video and telecommunications. It
will replace today's televisions and telephones and lend the users access
to a vast world-wide network of other teleputers: mass communication when
desired, but, more often, highly personalized entry to libraries of texts,
libraries of films, Internet-style forums, teleconferencing from home to
home or home to office, interactive distance learning, virtual family gatherings,
telemedicine and huge new business markets -- all brought within the reach
of ordinary Americans, not just the rich. By making the choices we want,
moreover, rather than the choices someone in a studio or bureaucracy wish
to impose upon us, the frustrated American citizen will gain new authority
and enthusiasm about his ability to affect his work, entertainment, education
and even his government. For merely one small example: just as C-Span circumvents
broadcast producers and brings certain events in Congress directly to viewers,
in the telecosm the viewer will decide on his own which floor action and
which of many committees to &quot;attend&quot; via his teleputer -- including
hearings like this one.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Participation in the telecosm will be affordable for ordinary citizens.
But the initial structural investments will be large for the system developers.
The most expensive part of the conversion to the telecosm is establishing
broadband connections to millions and millions of homes, where, not coincidentally,
the bulk of the new personal computers are to be found. Fortunately, the
United States, almost alone in the world, already has these connections
in place in the form of cable TV.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But cable TV is not likely to survive long in its present state. New technology
-- DBS (Direct Broadcast Satellite), in this case -- is going to blow away
the existing cable companies unless Congress permits them to operate freely.
Currently, cable is a classic example of outdated government regulation
wrongly premised on the danger of monopoly. Cable's hope is to find a new
use. And that new use, in fact, is available, thanks to the needs of telephone
companies -- whose own monopoly of local service is already disappearing,
also in the face of new technologies. Telephone companies require a way
to enter the home to provide broadband connections to the teleputer and
other services, but duplicating cable's connections is an obvious waste
of years of time and hundreds of billions of dollars. New technology thus
closes off old monopoly advantages and opens opportunities for free market
collaboration.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bringing broadband digitally switched services over cable wires to the home
will still require investments of $l00-300 billion, but these can be and
should be provided by the private sector, without government subsidies or
guarantees. There is no knowing in advance which companies will succeed
in the telecosm and it is futile and counterproductive for government to
guess. The once-legitimate concern about communications monopolies has been
silenced by the centrifugal force of the computer chip. Bigness no longer
assures success in telecommunications, and trying to protect one industry
or company against another when no one can tell which one will survive,
in any case, will only make the needed investments unpromising financially
and set back the movement into the telecosm by five to seven years, well
into the 21st century. On the other hand, if Congress will stop focusing
on how to fine tune regulations and focus instead on eliminating them more
completely, we can have the teleputer and similar revolutionary devices
within the next three years, which -- I might mention -- is within the terms
of many of you in this room. The secret, as Cal Tech Professor Carver Mead
says, is to &quot;listen to the technology.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The futility of regulation is further underscored by the likely creation
of new companies outside any presently foreseen regulatory framework. Either
these information service newcomers will have a government-sanctioned advantage
over regulated companies or the government will find a way to draw the newcomers
into its regulatory grasp -- and perhaps with them, whole previously unregulated
areas of the economy, such as computers and software.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Government regulation supposedly claims to protect competition, of course,
but it is the kind of competition where nobody wins and nobody loses. Such
guarded competition will prevent the restructuring and profit incentives
that must be available to make large investments possible. Only competition
that permits robust rivalries will bring the teleputer and other inventions
on-line swiftly.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Chairman, last year I was concerned that the Congress was still trying
to develop a regulatory regime based on an outdated belief in natural monopolies
in telecommunications. But, this year I am more hopeful, particularly after
production of the discussion draft advanced recently by Republicans members
of this Committee. Now, indeed, it seems that almost the whole federal government,
including the Executive Branch, is beginning to hum the music of telecom's
de-regulation. But it is not altogether obvious that all of them have bothered
to learn the words. One test of whether claims of de-regulation are valid
is to see whether a proposed law has been adjusted to acknowledge emerging
technologies or whether it still tries to force new technologies to fit
old government regulations. Even the admirable discussion draft the committee
majority produced, I think, should be examined in this light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For example, consider the issue of universal service. The basic problem
of universal service is that with current wireline telephony and cable TV,
it costs many times as much to serve rural customers as urban customers.
But, new wireless digital technologies have overthrown this problem. At
a time when all voice telephony is rapidly moving to wireless, new digital
cellular systems will soon lower the price of wireless telephony tenfold
and totally close the cost gap between rural and urban customers. This removes
the need for either cross subsidies or universal service requirements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, as I mentioned, Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) already delivers
service superior to cable TV with supreme universality across the entire
continent and completely discredits the idea that cable TV is a monopoly
or that hundreds of channels of video will be restricted to favorite areas.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All these examples of technology rendering regulations obsolete should lead
us to the conclusion, then, that the only sound telecommunications policy
is the freedom model. A freedom model would allow all existing companies
-- and new ones yet to be created -- to buy and sell and enter each others'
businesses without undue government interference or delay, granting only
common carrier status in return. It would remove restrictions to cross-ownership
of cable and telephone lines. It would not force companies to separate their
functions unnaturally -- and unprofitably -- into subsidiaries. It would
not impose delayed entry schedules and other invidious tests upon competition.
And, of course, it would not demand universal service or other hidden entitlements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A freedom model, however, would restrict the powers of state public utility
commissions to regulate investment and depreciation rules, to ensure rate
re-balancing and pricing flexibility. Both cable and telephone companies
should be free of pricing restrictions to encourage investment and to eliminate
the current cross subsidies that discourage competition and the introduction
of new services.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Chairman, the freedom model of de-regulation is not likely to be any
company's or industry's first choice. Each, of course, would like to preside
over a government-protected monopoly and to enjoy government restrictions
on its competition. That is human nature. But since you cannot possibly
grant special advantages to everybody, it would seem logical that free and
open competition should be accepted as each lobby's second choice. But for
the public interest, I would suggest, the freedom model should be acclaimed
as the logical first choice -- and adopted, accordingly, by this Committee
and the Congress.

<B>George Gilder is a Senior Fellow at Discovery Institute</B> where he
directs Discovery's program on <A HREF="hightech.html">high technology and
public policy</A>. <BR>
<BR>
Born in 1939 in New York City, Mr. Gilder attended Exeter Academy and Harvard
University. At Harvard he studied under Henry Kissinger and helped found
Advance, a journal of political thought, which he edited and helped to re-establish
in Washington, D.C. after his graduation in 1962. During this period he
co-authored (with Bruce Chapman) a political history, <I>The Party That
Lost its Head.</I> He later returned to Harvard as a fellow at the Kennedy
Institute of Politics and editor of the Ripon Forum. In the 1960's Mr. Gilder
also served a speech writer for several prominent officials and candidates,
including Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Richard Nixon. <BR>
<BR>
In the 1970's, as an independent researcher and writer, Mr. Gilder began
an excursion into the causes of poverty, which resulted in his books <I>Men
and Marriage</I> (original version, 1972) and <I>Visible Man </I>(1978);
and, hence, of wealth, which led to <B><I>his bestselling Wealth and Poverty
</I></B>(1981). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mr. Gilder pioneered the formulation of supply-side economics</B> when
he served as Chairman of the Lehrman Institute's Economics Roundtable, as
Program Director for the Manhattan Institute, and as a frequent contributor
to A.B. Laffer's economic reports and the editorial page of the <I>Wall
Street Journal</I>. In the 1980's he also consulted leaders of America's
high technology businesses. <B>According to a recent study of speeches,
Mr. Gilder was President Reagan's most frequently quoted living author.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The investigation into wealth creation led Mr. Gilder into deeper examination
of the lives of present-day entrepreneurs, culminating in many articles
and a book, <I>The Spirit of Enterprise </I>(1986). The book was recently
revised and expanded for publication in 1992. That many of the most interesting
current entrepreneurs were to be found in high technology fields also led
Mr. Gilder, over several years, to examine these fields in depth. In his
bestselling work, <I>Microcosm</I> (1989), he explored the quantum roots
of the new electronic technologies. A subsequent best selling book, <I>Life
After Television</I>, published first as a Whittle Communications monograph
and then republished by W.W. Norton (1992), is a prophecy of the future
of computers and telecommunications. <B><I>Life After Television</I> was
recently updated and a new forward included when it was republished in 1994</B>.
This book, in turn, is a prelude to his forthcoming book on the future of
telecommunications, <I>Telecosm</I> (expected in early 1996). <BR>
<BR>
<B>In 1986, President Reagan gave George Gilder the White House Award for
Entrepreneurial Excellence</B>. Mr. Gilder participates in national and
international conferences and is<A HREF="ggindex.html"> a contributing editor
of Forbes ASAP, and a writer of articles on high technology for Forbes magazine</A>
and other journals and newspapers. In addition, he is often requested to
testify before the U.S. Senate and U.S. House on various telecommunications
issues. <BR>
<BR>
He operates jointly from the Seattle headquarters of Discovery Institute
and his home at Tyringham, Massachusetts, in the Berkshire Mountains where
he is an active churchman, sometime runner, and, with his wife, Nini, parent
of four children. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>THE proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is
one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built. Its
influence can be detected in most, if not all, of the West's greatest achievements,
including representative democracy, human rights, free enterprise, and progress
in the arts and sciences.<BR>
<BR>
Yet a little over a century ago, this cardinal idea came under wholesale
attack by intellectuals drawing on the discoveries of modern science. Debunking
the traditional conceptions of both God and man, thinkers such as Charles
Darwin, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud portrayed human beings not as eternal
and accountable beings, but as animals or machines who inhabited a universe
ruled by chance and whose behavior and very thoughts were dictated by the
unbending forces of biology, chemistry, and environment. This materialistic
conception of reality eventually infected virtually every area of our culture,
from politics and economics to literature and music.<BR>
<BR>
The cultural consequences of this triumph of materialism were devastating.
Materialists denied the existence of objective standards binding on all
cultures, claiming that environment dictates our moral beliefs. Such moral
relativism was uncritically adopted by much of the social sciences, and
it still undergirds much of modern economics, political science, psychology
and sociology. <BR>
<BR>
Materialists also undermined personal responsibility by asserting that human
thoughts and behaviors are dictated by our biology and environment. The
results can be seen in modern approaches to criminal justice, product liability,
and welfare. In the materialist scheme of things, everyone is a victim and
no one can be held accountable for his or her actions.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, materialism spawned a virulent strain of utopianism. Thinking they
could engineer the perfect society through the application of scientific
knowledge, materialist reformers advocated coercive government programs
that falsely promised to create heaven on earth.<BR>
<BR>
Discovery Institute's <A HREF="crsc.html">Center for the Renewal of Science
and Culture</A> seeks nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and
its damning cultural legacies. Bringing together <A HREF="crscfellows.html">leading
scholars from the natural sciences </A>and those from the humanities and
social sciences, <A HREF="crscarts.html">the Center explores how new developments
in biology, physics and cognitive science</A> raise serious doubts about
scientific materialism and have re-opened the case for the supernatural.
The Center awards fellowships for original research, holds conferences,
and briefs policymakers about the opportunities for life after materialism.
<BR>
<BR>
The Center is directed by Discovery Senior Fellow Dr. <A HREF="meyer.html">Stephen
Meyer</A>. An Associate Professor of Philosophy at Whitworth College, Dr.
Meyer holds a Ph.D. in the History and Philosophy of Science from Cambridge
University. He formerly worked as a geophysicist for the Atlantic Richfield
Company.</H4>

Discovery Institute Press Release August 10, 1996</H5>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Major grants help establish <A HREF="crsc.html">Center for Renewal of Science
and Culture</A><BR>
<IMG SRC="trubluln.gif" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

</H1>
<B>For over a century, Western science has been influenced by the idea that
God is either dead or irrelevant. Two foundations recently awarded Discovery
Institute nearly a million dollars in grants to examine and confront this
materialistic bias in science, law, and the humanities. The grants will
be used to establish the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture at
Discovery, which will award research fellowships to scholars, hold conferences,
and disseminate research findings among opinionmakers and the general public.
</B><BR>
<BR>
Heading the Center will be <A HREF="meyer.html">Discovery Senior Fellow
Stephen Meyer</A>. An associate professor of philosophy at Whitworth College,
Meyer did his doctoral studies in origin-of-life biology at Cambridge University
and is an associate editor of the scientific journal Origins and Design
. The Center's co-director will be <A HREF="jwestbio.html">Discovery Senior
Fellow John West</A>, asst. professor of political science at Seattle Pacific
University. West oversees Discovery's <A HREF="religion.html">Religion,
Liberty &amp; Civic Life</A> program. <BR>
<BR>
Working with Meyer and West will be an array of scholars and advisors from
around the world, including Phillip Johnson, professor of law at the University
of California, Berkeley, and author of <I>Darwin on Trial</I> (1992) and
<I>Reason in the Balance</I> (1995), and chemistry professor Michael Behe,
author of the much-anticipated <I>Darwin's Black Box</I>, on sale now at
major bookstores.<BR>
<BR>
Ina addition, the Center will award several full-time research fellowships
each year. For 1996-97, the full-time Discovery research fellows will be
William Dembski, Paul Nelson and Jonathan Wells. Dr. Dembski has a long
history of mathematical study at University of Chicago, Cornell and MIT
and is a fundamental contributor in the fields of chance, chaos, probability
and randomness theory. Currently, Dembski is completing a second doctorate
in philosophy. Nelson is in the final weeks of his Ph.D. program in philosophy
of science, also at the University of Chicago, and is the editor of the
scientific journal Origins and Design. Dr. Wells holds doctorates in molecular
and cell biology from UC Berkeley and religious studies from Yale University.
He is the author of the book Charles Hodge's Critique of Darwinism.<BR>
<BR>
The new Center grew out of last summer's <B>&quot;Death of Materialism&quot;</B>
conference that Discovery organized and which has gathered increased attention
since the four keynote addresses were published by the Intercollegiate Review
earlier this year.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The conference pointed the way,&quot; Discovery President Bruce Chapman
says, &quot;and helped us mobilize support to attack the scientific argument
for the 20th century's ideology of materialism and the host of social 'isms'
that attend it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Crucial, start-up funding has come from Fieldstead &amp; Company, and the
Stewardship Foundation which also awarded a grant. <BR>
<BR>
The Center for Renewal of Science and Culture fits well with Discovery's
existing programs in high technology and religion. <A HREF="gilder.html">George
Gilder</A>, who heads Discovery's technology program, has a long-standing
interest in the interaction of science and culture. The end of his book
<I>Microcosm</I> explores the social and spiritual implications of contemporary
physics, another one of his works-in-process deals with the cultural necessity
of faith.

The idea behind the Internet Law Task Force (ILTF)</CENTER>
</H1>
The idea for creating a legal analog to the <A HREF="http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/home.html">Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF)</A> occured to Peter Harter while writing
an essay criticising Senator Exon's &quot;Communications Decency Act of
1995&quot; (S.314). <A HREF="harter.html">Click here</A> to see this unpublished
essay.) The following is a brief idea outline for the Internet Law Task
Force , written prior to the launch of the task force in October of 1995
at Discovery Institute's Internet Law Symposium 95. This idea was the genesis
for what has become The Forum for Internet Law and Policy with further revisions
coming from mebers and interested parties across the Interent community
and around the world.<BR>

<P><B>The Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) Project</B> <BR>
<BR>
The idea for an Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) came from a solution proposed
by Peter F. Harter in an essay he wrote and submitted to The New York Times
for publication in their Op-Ed page. Although this submission is, as of
the date of this presentation, still under consideration and despite the
youth of this ILTF idea (less than two weeks old), it has gained support.
The idea for an ILTF was unveiled publicly on 12 April 1995 at the Internet
Society Summit, in San Diego, California. In addition to the initial sponsors
listed in this memorandum, additional supporters have agreed to work together
as part of an ad hoc &quot;ILTF formation and steering committee&quot;:
Prof. Hank Perritt of the Villanova Center for Information Law and Policy;
David Johnson, Chairman, Electronic Frontier Foundation; Bob Collett and
Ron Plesser of the Commercial Internet Xchange; Jeffrey Ritter, Executive
Director of OARNet and founder of the Electronic Commerce, Law, and Information
Policy Strategies project; Jerry Berman, Executive Director, The Center
for Democracy and Technology; Lance Rose, Esq.; Jan Constantine, VP and
General Counsel, Delphi Internet Services; David Maher, Esq., and Co-Chair
of the Internet Task Force of the International Trademarks Association;
Prof. David Post. In addition, David Johnson has agreed to co-chair the
steering committee with Peter Harter in order to determine what shape ILTF
should take.

<BR>
Q. Can interoperable designs negate need for outside regulation? <BR>
<BR>
A. Yes, if an ILTF exists. <BR>
<BR>
____________________________________________________________________ <BR>
<BR>
<B>I. Introduction.</B> <BR>
<BR>
An Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) can be the legal policy and norms forum
for the Internet. An ILTF must be a large, open, international body consisting
of practicing lawyers, in-house corporate counsel, legislative professionals,
academics, business professionals, technologists, researches, network operators,
publishers, system administrators, and other interested parties. All involved
should be concerned with the evolution and growth of the Internet as a global
electronic community that balances terrestrially bound and geographically
defined interests with the decentralized and transborder nature of internetworked
computer communications that is the Net. <BR>
<BR>
The ILTF shall be an analog to the IETF (the Internet Engineering Task Force)
so that constituents of the Internet and its related industries and communities
can remain self-regulating by determining and promoting legal policies that
reduce risk and liability. If effective, an ILTF can reduce the need for
governmental entities to regulate the use and operation of the Internet.
Like the IETF, the ILTF can succeed by attracting the active and regular
participation of professionals from around the world and by reaching out
to as many cultures and nations in the world as possible in order to avert
conflicts of law and to attain comity amongst disparate electronic communities
and various computer networks rooted in different and distant countries.
<BR>
<BR>
An ILTF can be begun formally and publicly at the Internet Society's upcoming
Summit in San Diego, California, on April 12, during and or after the legal
panel presentation. At that time an acting advisory committee may be formed
so that an ILTF can be properly constructed. This memorandum is only a sketch
-- a starting point from which the idea for an ILTF can be launched. <BR>
<BR>
The National Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN) wishes to work with other
organizations and individuals to promote and further develop self-regulation
and accountability within the collection of users and operators of the Internet.
The Internet Society has agreed to help launch this idea with NPTN and has
offered to form a secretariat and to seek funding. Ameritech Advanced Data
Services and America Online have agreed to be the initial sponsors of the
concept of an ILTF. Other organizations are invited to become initial sponsors.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>II. Why Create an ILTF?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Due to increasing scrutiny by mass media and by legislators and government
officials in the U.S., Canada, and other countries, as well as in states,
provinces, and other terrestrially based jurisdictions, the Internet is
at risk of being Balkanized by inconsistent and ill-thought attempts at
rule making and control. Recently, a Bill introduced in the U.S. Senate
known as the Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S.314) and now likely to
gain passage in that legislative chamber, threatens to impose liability
on those least able to control indecent communications; it ignores the fact
that users are held accountable for their actions already in varying formats
by their system administrators and or network service providers. Users self-regulate
their electronic communities and work with network operators to sustain
the vitality of their networks. S.314 is also embarrassing: It blindly attempts
to regulate a medium that is inherently international in design and destiny.
For S.314 to try and control communications on the Internet assumes that
the U.S. can impose its values on others from around the world and strips
citizens of electronic communities of their right by contract to define
what the acceptable uses of their communities shall be. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, there are possible alternatives to S.314. On April 7, 1995,
Senator Leahy introduced the &quot;Child Protection, User Empowerment, and
Free Expression in Interactive Media Study Bill&quot; (S. 714). Leahy's
Bill directs the Department of Justice, in consultation with the Commerce
Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA), to conduct a study to address technical means for empowering users
to control information they receive over interactive communications systems
such as the Internet, commercial online services, independent BBSs, and
future interactive media. <BR>
<BR>
S.314, however, is not the first nor will be the last attempt at regulating
the Internet; however, it drove one Internet lawyer to start pamphleteering
about the issue. In an essay submitted on 29 March 1995 to The New York
Times for publication in their Op-Ed page, Peter Harter of NPTN reasoned
that if standardization and regulation of the Internet is to occur, it should
come from the bottom-up -- just as the technical standards for the Internet
evolve via the IETF. After some online consultation with Tony Rutkowski
of the Internet Society, it was agreed that an ILTF was an idea worth considering
-- a concept whose time has come. <BR>
<BR>
It is the desire of the creator and founding members of an ILTF that it
form not to impose rules as a super-legislature. Instead, an ILTF must endeavor
to educate elected officials and governmental entities so that they may
better understand the technical and cultural nature and diversity of the
networks that make up the Internet. ILTF must serve as a coordinator to
and communicator between existing Internet law and policy efforts; ILTF
must not aim to duplicate or displace such existing efforts. In doing so
the ILTF can look to the IETF for structure and lessons as the IETF has
had over thirty productive and substantive working meetings since 1986.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>III. Modeling the ILTF After the IETF.</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>A. Meetings.</B> The ILTF should meet at least twice a year initially
and perhaps more frequently (i.e., the IETF meets three times a year). It
is proposed that the first public meeting of the ILTF be held, perhaps,
on or near Bastille Day, and outside the U.S., so that the inaugural meeting
may be inspired by the relevant symbolism and history as well as the international
component that is integral to building an effective ILTF. By holding regular
meetings the ILTF shall provide an open arena for working groups (see below)
to coordinate development of legal and policy findings and, recommendations.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>B. Mission.</B> The ILTF mission includes but is not limited to: <BR>
<BR>
* Identifying and proposing solutions and or alternatives to legislative
initiatives arising from any terrestrially based and or electronic governing
body; <BR>
<BR>
* Specifying the development of alternative forms of rules that electronic
communities can opt to use in order to diffuse any conflicts; <BR>
<BR>
* Facilitating the exchange of information between professionals in different
countries so that there may be a better informed and more active legal and
policy community; <BR>
<BR>
* Providing a forum for the exchange of relevant information within the
Internet community between system administrators, users, network operators,
publishers, intellectual property holders, government agencies, businesses,
academics, educators, and concerned citizens; and, <BR>
<BR>
* Publishing online tools and information resources to be used by citizens
of electronic communities, governmental agencies, businesses, and other
interested parties. <BR>
<BR>
<B>C. Working Groups.</B> Leading up to the first meeting and in the time
between meetings thereafter, the actual substantive work of the ILTF shall
be done by working groups. Like the working groups that sustain the efforts
of the IETF, workings groups for the ILTF shall be organized by topic into
several areas. The following areas are suggested and additions and modifications
are requested: <BR>

[Nota Bene: The foregoing list of lawyers is subject to change and non-exhaustive.
No contact has been made to any of the above with the exception of Ellen
Kirsh and George Clapp. It is recommended that the acting advisory committee
ask individuals to join the initial slate of working groups.] <BR>
<BR>
Each working group area would have a director that would be a member of
the Internet Law Steering Group (ILSG) (see below). Under each director
would be a collection of one or more working groups breaking out to tear
through various issues that make up the larger area. As necessary, each
working group within an area could have its own director who would be a
part of an area directorate which reports its findings to the area director
which are then to be communicated to the ILSG. While a very large pyramid
of people can be created here, it is important to have small and focused
efforts in order to cut through issues and not get bogged down in larger
and somewhat alienating meetings. Rough consensus and not strict voting
shall be the proactive rule. <BR>
<BR>
Also, it would be wise to have liaisons set up between ILTF and the IETF,
W3, the U.N. Internet Project, and other organizations and programs as deemed
necessary so that the ILTF may maintain open and interactive communications
links between other organizations to which the ILTF should work in concert
with either intermittently and or regularly. <BR>
<BR>
<B>D. Management.</B> Management of the ILTF shall be handled by individuals
who volunteer to lead a particular topic area and or who represent a particular
region or interest group at large. Together, these volunteers shall form
the Internet Law Steering Group (ILSG). The acting advisory committee to
be formed at the Internet Society Summit in San Diego after the unveiling
of the ILTF concept shall act as the ILSG until a proper ILSG can be formed.
This is likely to occur after the first successful meeting of the ILTF.
The operational management of the ILTF may be handled by the ILSG under
the auspices of NPTN and the Internet Society. In addition, the ILTF may
decide, at future time, to create an Internet Law Arbitration Board (ILAB)
for the specific purpose of having an independent body to adjudicate disputes
in the working processes of the ILTF. <BR>
<BR>
<B>IV. Policy Development </B>&amp; <B>Dissemination.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Neither the ILTF, nor any voluntary, international body can or should have
the right to somehow claim that its de facto rules can be imposed upon other
bodies. However, the ILTF can draft and adopt high quality policies and
then let the marketplace decide if they want to join in and support them
as norms. <BR>
<BR>
<B>V. International Outreach &amp; Character of ILTF.</B> <BR>
<BR>
To be successful the ILTF must focus on attracting active international
participants and directions. Those volunteers involved in the early stages
of the effort to build an ILTF must not be limited in their thinking; while
the &quot;likely suspects&quot; shall be integral, new and unusual members
must be sought out and asked to adopt the concept of an ILTF as their own
and become an ILTF evangelist. <BR>
<BR>
<B>VI. Path Forward.</B> <BR>
<BR>
First, a broad and internationally diverse endorsement of ILTF must be sought.
Second, a plan of action must be drawn up for those leading ILTF. Third,
input must be solicited and integrated. Fourth, a revised memorandum or
formal proposal green paper should be produced and released for comment
and revision. Fifth, plans for a first meeting should b made. Sixth, a formal
white paper should be produced and disseminated for consideration and if
possible adoption and endorsement. Seventh, the processes involved in the
Sixth stage should occur at a live meeting held some time in the summer
of 1995, perhaps around the time of Bastille Day. Eighth, a host for a second
meeting should be sought out in advance and be announced at the conclusion
of the first meeting. <BR>
<BR>
<B>VII. Appendix A: &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.</B> <BR>
<BR>
The following is an unordered, unpreferential, unrevised listing of those
individuals and organizations that should be contacted and asked to be involved
in the creation of an ILTF. They are in no particular order. This list is
not exhaustive. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Internet Law Task Force Organizing to Achieve Consensus on Internet
Legal Issues</CENTER>
</H1>
<B>OCTOBER 31, 1995</B> -- <B>Seattle,WA</B> -- The first international
conference on the law of the Internet served as the platform for the announcement
of an effort to establish the Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) to facilitate
the progressive development of law and public policy in the global information
age.<BR>
<BR>
The ILTF will provide an international forum for issues related to the use
and growth of the Internet including: evolution of the business practices
and legal instruments to assure the validity and acceptance of digital transactions;
property rights; privacy; and the elimination of legal barriers to Internet
commerce and electronic transactions.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We need to accelerate at the global level the development of solutions
borne of consensus,&quot; stated Peter Harter, former executive director
and general counsel of <A HREF="http://www.nptn.org/">National Public Telecomputing
Network</A>, and now public policy counsel of <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape
Communications</A>, who first advanced the ILTF concept.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Developing standards and practices to protect digital information
and promote the integrity of electronic markets is essential for extending
the Internet to developing countries and nations in transition,&quot; said
Jeffrey Ritter, a legal advisor to the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/">United
Nations</A> on the automation of international trade. &quot;Quite simply,
without an established framework, the Internet faces a confusing, and potentially
disabling, assortment of national laws seeking to govern a global environment,&quot;
Ritter added.<BR>
<BR>
Seattle-based <A HREF="index.html">Discovery Institute</A>, will provide
organizatinal support for the ILTF. The organizing committee will be jointly
chaired by Albert Gidari, a partner with the Seattle-based law firm Perkins
Coie and senior fellow of Discover Institute; Harter; and Ritter, program
director for <A HREF="/Eclips/eclips.html">ECLIPS</A>, a research program
of the Ohio Supercomputer Center.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our goal is to mature the ILTF into an operating non-governmental
organization as soon as practicable, but ILTF must be a collaborative operation.
We look forward to seeking and obtaining broad-based support for moving
ahead.&quot; the organizers said.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet Law Symposium '95, hosted by the Discovery Institute, was the
first conference devoted to analyzing the legal aspects of an evolving global
space. Bruce Chapman, President of Discovery Institute, announced that most
of those attending added their names to the global listserv--an electronic
discussion group--established for continuing dialogue on the structure and
direction of the ILTF.<BR>
<BR>
The concept has attracted widespread interest from industry, which has grown
increasingly concerned by the growing efforts of governments to attempt
to regulate the Internet. According to Harter, since the early dialogue
on the need for an ILTF, over one hundred interested organizations and professionals
from four continents have urged establishment of the ILTF.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For commerce to succeed in cyberspace greater certainty, not inconsistent
regulatory regimes around the globe, is needed,&quot; Gidari said.

<title> THE FORGOTTEN CRISIS: S. 1120, WELFARE REFORM, AND ILLEGITIMACY -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>THE FORGOTTEN CRISIS: S. 1120, WELFARE REFORM, AND ILLEGITIMACY</h3></i>
<p>
By Robert Rector <br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
Committee Brief No. 18<br>	
August 18, 1995<br></center>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<p>
	The Work, Family and Community Welfare Replacement Act, a legislative proposal by Senators Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), Phil Gramm (R-TX), and John Ashcroft (R-MO), contained eight provisions to address the crisis of rising illegitimacy. President Clinton and the Democratic leadership in the Senate are silent on addressing this issue. S. 1120, the Republican leadership bill, contains only one of these provisions:  findings about the ill effects of illegitimacy on society. (1) The remaining seven provisions to reduce illegitimacy which, though part of the Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal, should be included in S. 1120 are:
<P><ol>
<li><b>Voluntary State Goals and Plans.</b> The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal required states to set numerical goals for their illegitimacy ratios for the next ten years. (The illegitimacy ratio is the ratio of out-of-wedlock births to total births within the state.) States also were required to develop plans to reduce illegitimacy, setting their own goals with no penalty if the goals were not met.
<p>
	The intention of the goals and state plans was to focus public attention on the explosive growth in illegitimacy. Liberal Republicans and Democrats in Congress have rejected this approach.
<p>
<li><b>The Illegitimacy Ratio Bonus Mechanism.</b> This provision would increase the amount of a state's Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) block grant if the state reduced its illegitimate birth ratio without an increase in its abortion rate.
<p>
	The National Right to Life Committee accepted this provision, while pro-abortion groups objected to it. It was excluded from S. 1120.
<p>
<li><b>Abstinence Education.</b> The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal set aside additional funds for abstinence education. 
<p>
	 S. 1120 is silent on this subject.
<p>
<li><b>Pro-Marriage Tax Credit.</b> Welfare punishes marriage and rewards illegitimacy. The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal attempted to offset partially the anti-marriage effects of welfare by creating a refundable pro-marriage tax credit. The credit would be available only to married couples with children where at least one spouse was employed. It would have a maximum value of $500 and would be available to families with earned income between $8,000 and $26,000.
<p>
	S. 1120 contains no pro-marriage provisions.
<p>
<li><b>Paternity Requirement.</b> The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal required that mothers establish paternity in order to obtain future AFDC benefits. The bill stipulated that to obtain federal cash assistance for a child born after January 1996, the mother would have to establish paternity. States would be free to exempt 25 percent of the relevant mothers from this requirement. In addition, mothers of newborn children who have not yet established paternity but were cooperating by providing father's name, address, and other identifying information could receive cash aid for the first six months of the child's life while the paternity process was being completed.
<p>
	S. 1120 is silent on this issue.
<p>
<li><b>No Cash to Unwed Teenagers.</b> The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal prohibited federal funds from being used for cash aid to girls under 18 who had children out of wedlock. States would be free to use their own funds to give cash aid to this group if they wished. 
<p>
	 S. 1120 merely permits states to restrict cash benefits to unwed teenage mothers; this provision is, at best, redundant since under a block grant a state has full authority to set eligibility. Thus, the bill offers little or nothing specifically to combat illegitimacy and actually may limit state efforts (see below).
<p>
<li><B>Family Cap.</B> The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal prohibited the use of federal funds to give increased cash aid to women who have additional children while already enrolled in AFDC. States would be able to use their own funds to increase benefits if they chose. 
<p>
	 By contrast, S. 1120 permits, but does not require, states to establish a family cap. Like the leadership's family cap on teenage mothers, this is redundant under a block grant. Moreover, states can obtain a waiver to implement the family cap under current law, so S. 1120 offers no real change from the status quo.
</ul><p>


<b>Provisions on Teenagers Residing at Home</b>
<p>
	S. 1120 states that for an unmarried teen mother to receive cash aid, she must reside in a supervised setting or with her parents or with an adult relative. This provision is virtually copied from the Clinton plan. The problem with it is that some 60 percent to 70 percent of teenage mothers on AFDC already reside with adult relatives. The bill simply replicates the status quo and calls it reform. Even worse, in many cases, the adult parent is the problem:  the adult parent of the teenage mother herself is most likely a single mother who had a child out of wedlock and became dependent on AFDC. Now the teenage daughter is repeating her mother's pattern by having a child out of wedlock and applying for welfare.
<p>
	This provision of S. 1120 would perpetuate and intensify multi-generational welfare dependence. To have any positive impact, it at least should be amended to provide that teenage mothers can receive cash aid only if they reside with adult relatives who themselves do not have a history of AFDC dependence. Otherwise the teenage mother should receive only non-cash aid or should be required to reside in a closely supervised group setting.
<p>

<b>Excluding Marriage From the State Performance Standards</b>
<p>
	There is a pervasive anti-marriage tone to the entire Senate leadership bill when compared with the House-passed H.R. 4. 
<p>
	 For example, H.R. 4 allows states full credit for reductions in caseload which occur because AFDC mothers have married and left the welfare rolls. Both H.R. 4 and the Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal create a broad performance criterion to measure a state's success by its "caseload reduction."  States receive credit for caseload reductions that occur because of a decrease in out-of-wedlock births, because of an increase in marriage, or because of an increase employment of single mothers.
<p>
	This broad pro-marriage emphasis in H.R. 4 has been replaced with a narrow focus on employing single mothers under S. 1120. For example, under H.R. 4 a state is given equal credit if an AFDC mother gets off welfare through marriage or by getting a job. But under the leadership bill, the state receives credit only if the single mother obtains a job. The anti-marriage bias of S. 1120 can be corrected, in part, by replacing the narrow performance measure, with its emphasis on exits through employment, (2) with the broader measure of caseload reduction used in the House bill.
<p>

<b>Leadership Bill May Limit State Actions to Reduce Illegitimacy</b>
<p>
	Under the leadership bill, states have the authority, if they wish, to establish a family cap or to restrict cash aid to unmarried mothers under age 18. As noted, these provisions are redundant since, under the block grant, the states can set their own standards of eligibility. In fact, inserting these provisions into the block grant easily could be interpreted by the courts as a restriction barring a state from taking more forceful action against illegitimacy. For example, the S. 1120 provision allowing states to restrict cash aid to unwed mothers under age 18 might be interpreted as barring a state government from restricting aid to never-married mothers aged 18 and 19. The leadership provision, as worded, may create an entitlement to aid for never-married mothers over age 18. Legal aid offices certainly will argue that it does. To avoid this problem, the provision at least should be clarified to assert that no restriction on stronger state policies to reduce illegitimacy is intended.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
	The Clinton and Senate leadership positions on marriage and illegitimacy currently are virtually identical. Both would have the effect of preserving a welfare system that actually promotes illegitimacy and destroys marriage, while making reforms that only tinker around the edges of current law.

<title> The Meaning of "Justice" - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<CENTER><H3><I>THE MEANING OF "JUSTICE"</I></H3>
by Russell Kirk<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Lecture #457<br>
March 4, 1993<br>
</CENTER>
<p>

     The word "justice" is on everyone's lips nowadays, and may
signify almost anything.  We hear the cry "Peace and Justice!"  from
folk who would destroy existing societies with fire and sword.  Other
folk fancy that perfect justice might readily be obtained by certain
financial rearrangements -- as if anything in this world ever could be
perfected.  One thinks of the observation of William James:  "So long
as one poor cockroach suffers the pangs of unrequited love, this world
will not be a moral world."  At the end of the twentieth century, the
liberal mentality demands justice for roaches, too.
<P>
     All confusion about the meaning of the word "justice"
notwithstanding, the latest edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica
contains no article under the heading "Justice."  Yet there is a
succinct article about justices of the peace, of whose number I once
was one, before the state of Michigan swept away that high office.  My
lecture today may be regarded as the attempt of a fool, rushing in
where the angelic Britannica fears to tread.  Yet possibly the nature
of justice may be apprehended by a mere quondam justice of the peace: 
for the fundamental purpose of law is to keep the peace.  "Justice is
the ligament which holds civilized beings and civilized nations
together," said Daniel Webster at the funeral of Justice Joseph Story,
in 1845; and so say I today.
<P>
     I propose in this series of four lectures to discuss first the
signification of this word "justice"; in my second lecture, to examine
natural law; in my third, to deal with criminal justice; in my
concluding lecture, to quarrel with certain notions of justice that
have been much puffed up during recent years.  In the twenty-first
century of the Christian era, will justice signify anything more than
the state's rigorous enforcement of its edicts?  Such questions I hope
to raise in your minds. 
<P>
<P>
      Nowadays, near the close of the twentieth century, moral and
political disorders bring grave confusion about the meanings of old
words.  As T.  S.  Eliot wrote in "Burnt Norton" -- 
Words strain,
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Crack and sometimes break, under the burden, Under the
     tension, slip, slide, perish, Decay with imprecision, will
     not stay in place, Will not stay still.  Shrieking voices
     Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering, Always assail them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     Conspicuous among such venerable words, in our era often abused
and misrepresented, is this necessary word justice.  Today I am
attempting to purify the dialect of the tribe -- to borrow another
phrase from my old friend Eliot, who endeavored lifelong to rescue
words from the clutch of the vulgarizer or of the ideologue.
<P>
     Permit me first to offer preliminary descriptions or definitions
of this word justice.  Jeremy Taylor, in the middle of the seventeenth
century, wrote that there exist two kinds of justice.  The one is
commutative justice, or reciprocal justice, expressed in Scripture
thus:  "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, even so do to
them."  In Taylor's words, "This is the measure...  of that justice
which supposes exchange of things profitable for things profitable,
that as I supply your need, you may supply mine; as I do a benefit to
you, I may receive one by you....  "
<P>
     The other kind is distributive justice, expressed in this passage
from Romans:  "Render to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is
due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor;
owe no man anything but to love one another."  Upon this Taylor
comments, "This justice is distinguished from the first, because the
obligation depends not upon contract or express bargain, but passes
upon us by some command of God, or of our superior, by nature or by
grace, by piety or religion, by trust or by office, according to that
commandment, 'As every man hath received the gift, so let him minister
the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of
God.'"
<P>
     But perhaps, ladies and gentlemen, I proceed too fast; I shall
have more to say a little later about the Christian concept of
justice.  Just now a little about the classical idea of justice.  The
classical definition, which comes to us through Plato, Aristotle,
Saint Ambrose, and Saint Augustine of Hippo, is expressed in a single
phrase:  suum cuique, or "to each his own."  As this is put in
Justinian's Corpus Juris Civilis, "Justice is a habit whereby a man
renders to each one his due with constant and perpetual will." 
Aristotle instructs us that the prevalence of injustice makes clear
the meaning of justice.  Also Aristotle remarks that it is unjust to
treat unequal things equally -- a principle to which I shall return in
my later lectures.  Of the virtue called justice, Saint Augustine
declares, "Justice is that ordering of the soul by virtue of which it
comes to pass that we are no man's servant, but servants of God
alone."
<P>
     Upon such ancient postulates, classical or Christian, rests our
whole elaborate edifice of law here in these United States -- even
though few Americans know anything about the science of jurisprudence. 
For public order is founded upon moral order, and moral order arises
from religion -- a point upon which I mean to touch later in this talk
of mine.  If these venerable postulates are flouted or denied -- as
they have been denied by the Marxists in the present century, and were
denied by sophists in Plato's time -- then arbitrary power thrusts
justice aside, and "they shall take who have the power, and they shall
keep who can."
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
     All these brief definitions require explanation.  But for the
moment I pass on to the common understanding, the common sense, of the
meaning of justice.  All of us here present, I suppose, entertain some
notion of what justice signifies.  From what source do we obtain such
a concept?  Why, very commonly, from observation of a just man or a
just woman.  We begin by admiring someone -- he may be some famous
judge, or he may be an obscure neighbor -- who accords to every person
he encounters that person's due.  Just men, in short, establish the
norm of justice.  When I began to write my book The Conservative Mind,
I discovered that the abstraction "conservatism" amounts to a general
term descriptive of the beliefs and actions of certain eminent men and
women whom we call "conservative" because they have endeavored to
protect and nurture the Permanent Things in human existence.  So it is
with justice:  in large part, we learn the meaning of justice by
acquaintance with just persons.
<P>
     In the ancient world, the most just of men was Solon, Athens'
lawgiver, poet, and hero.  As Solon wrote of his reform of the
Athenian constitution -- 
<P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> Such power I gave the people as might do, Abridged not what
     they had, nor lavished new; Those that were great in wealth
     and high in place My counsel likewise kept from all
     disgrace.  Before them both I kept my shield of might, And
     let not either touch the other's right.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     To each class, that is, Solon gave its due, and so preserved the
peace:  that is social justice. 
<P>
     But we need not turn to the pages of Plutarch to discover just
men:  they are not an extinct species, though perhaps an endangered
one.  I think of my grandfather, Frank Pierce, a bank-manager in
Plymouth, twenty miles north of Detroit.  He was the leading man of
Lower Town (now called Old Town), near the railroad yards -- not
because he was either rich or charismatic, but because he was just. 
Justice, of course, is one of the cardinal virtues; and like the other
virtues, justice is said to be its own reward -- which is well, the
virtue of justice seldom earning material rewards.  When a member of
the town council, my grandfather refused to supply water free of
charge to the town's principal industrial plant, on the grounds that
if the factory couldn't pay water bills, who could?  For that offense,
the firm's president swore he would have Pierce discharged by the
bank; but the bank's president happening also to be a just man, my
grandfather's livelihood was not swept away.  My grandfather's counsel
was sought by everyone in the Lower Town who needed advice; and his
kindliness even moved him, on occasion, to extend interest-free
personal loans, from his own pocket, to young married couples who
could not meet the requirements for loans from the bank.  (His salary
was two hundred dollars a month.) I do not mean that he was
indiscriminately sentimental; not at all.  On the several occasions
when robbers invaded his branch bank, he successfully repelled them,
at great risk:  for the just man defends vigorously whatever is
entrusted to his charge, and sets his face against the lawless.  He
was just to children, too:  taking me on long walks, during which we
talked of everything under the sun, but rapping sharply on the dining-
room table when I waxed impudent at meals -- I immediately abashed and
repentant.  By watching this kindly paterfamilias, and listening to
what he said, I came to apprehend justice quite early.  For Frank
Pierce gave every man his due, without fear or favor.
<P>
     In every society, from the most primitive to the most decadent,
there are found some persons, like my grandfather, whom everyone
recognizes as just.  (Even bank-robbers and kidnappers -- for he was
kidnapped once by desperados -- remarked that Frank Pierce was a just
man.) From what source do such just men and women derive their habits
or principles of justice?
<P>
     Are they familiar with jurisprudential theories?  Only rarely: 
even most judges on the bench nowadays are not well grounded in the
philosophy of law.  My grandfather, who possessed a substantial
library -- perhaps the only library in Plymouth's Lower Town -- read
history, but not philosophy or law.
<P>
     Are their concepts of justice learnt in church?  Not so,
ordinarily.  My grandfather never attended church:  he came from a
family that began as Pilgrims to Massachusetts and gradually moved
through all the American stages of the dissidence of dissent.  He
never read the Bible at home.  He inherited Christian morals, but not
Christian faith in the transcendent.
<P>
     Do they create for themselves a rough-and-ready utilitarian
scheme for the administering of justice, founded principally upon
their private experience of the human condition?  Only infrequently, I
think; for most of them would subscribe to the maxim of Benjamin
Franklin, "Experience is a hard master, but fools will have no other."
<P>
     Well, then, how do just men and women apprehend the meaning of
justice?  From tradition, I maintain:  from habits and beliefs that
have long persisted within family and within local community. 
Aristophanes, contradicting Socrates, argued that virtue cannot be
taught in schools or by tutors:  rather, virtue inheres in old
families.  I believe that to be especially true of the cardinal virtue
called justice.  Or this tradition of justice, families and
communities aside, may become known through private reading, perhaps: 
anyone who attentively reads the great Victorian novelists, say,
cannot well escape absorbing, even if unaware of his acquisition,
principles of personal and social justice.  More obvious, if more rare
nowadays, is the influence of the Greek and Roman classics toward
forming an affection for justice.  Until well into the nineteenth
century, Cicero was studied in every decent school; and this passage
from that statesman-philosopher implanted an apprehension of the
nature of justice:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Law is the highest reason, implanted in nature, which
     commands what ought to be done and forbids the opposite. 
     This reason, when firmly fixed and fully developed in the
     human mind, is law.  And so they believe that law is
     intelligence, whose natural function it is to command right
     conduct and forbid wrongdoing.  They think that this quality
     has derived its name in Greek from the idea of granting to
     every man his own, and in our language I believe it has been
     named from the idea of choosing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
     In short, there exists a literary tradition expounding the idea
of justice.  The most recent popular example of this tradition is to
be found in an appendix to C.  S.  Lewis's little book The Abolition
of Man.  Therein Lewis sets side by side, drawn from various cultures,
illustrations of the Tao, or Natural Law.  He groups these precepts or
injunctions under eight headings:  the law of general beneficence; the
law of special beneficence; duties to parents, elders, ancestors;
duties to children and posterity; the law of justice; the law of good
faith and veracity; the law of mercy; the law of magnanimity. 
Everywhere in the world, in every age, Lewis is saying, wise men and
women have perceived the nature of justice and expressed that nature
in proverb, maxim, and injunction.
<P>
     At this point one may inquire, "Are you implying that just men
and women find in religious doctrines -- Hebraic, Christian, Moslem,
Hindu, Buddhist -- the fountains of justice?"  Yes, I am so reasoning. 
The sanction for justice will be found, ultimately, in religious
insights as to the human condition, and particularly in Revelation. 
Our so-called "Western" concepts of justice are derived from the
Decalogue, Platonic religious philosophy, and the teachings of the
Christ.  Somewhere there must exist an authority for beliefs about
justice; and the authority of merely human, and therefore fallible,
courts of law is insufficient to command popular assent and obedience.
<P>
     It does not follow, however, that all just men and women
recognize the ultimate source of ideas about justice, or appeal to
that ultimate source.  My grandfather never read a line that Saint
Thomas Aquinas wrote, though his understanding of justice accorded
well enough with what Aquinas expresses so convincingly in the Summa. 
To my grandfather the justice-concepts of the Hebraic and classical
and medieval cultures were transmitted through British and American
moral, legal, and literary traditions, and through long custom and
habit within his family and within the small-town American communities
where he had lived.  If pressed as to why he held a certain
understanding of the word "justice" -- indeed, he once compulsorily
engaged in a dialogue on that subject with a rather Nietzschean
desperado intent on persuading my grandfather to open his bank's safe
-- I suppose that Frank Pierce would have replied, "Because good men
always have so believed."  Securus judicat orbis terrarum, bonos non
esse qui se dividunt ab orbe terrarum in quacunque parte terrarum,
Saint Augustine of Hippo instructs us -- "The calm judgment of the
world is that those men cannot be good who, in any part of the world,
cut themselves off from the rest of the world."  The word justice
implies obligation to others, or to an Other.
<P>
     Thus far I have been describing the concept of justice that
prevailed in the Western world down to the closing years of the
eighteenth century.  Behind the phrase "to each his own" lay the
beliefs that divine wisdom has conferred upon man a distinct nature;
that human nature is constant; that the idea of justice is implanted
in the human consciousness by a transcendent power; and that the
general rule by which we endeavor to do justice is this:  "to each
man, the things that are his own."
<P>
     What is meant by this famous phrase?  To put the matter very
succinctly, the doctrine of suum cuique affirms that every man,
minding his own business, should receive the rewards which are
appropriate to his work and duties.  It takes for granted a society of
diversity, with various classes and interests.  It implies both
responsibility toward others and personal freedom.  It has been a
strong protection for private property, on a small scale or a great;
and a reinforcement, for Jews and Christians, of the Tenth
Commandment.  Through the Roman law, this doctrine of justice passed
into the legal codes of the European continent, and even into English
and American law.
<P>
     Injustice, according to this doctrine, occurs when men try to
undertake things for which they are not fitted, and to claim rewards
to which they are not entitled, and to deny to other men what really
belongs to those other men.  As Plato puts it, in The Republic, quite
as an unjust man is a being whose reason, will, and appetite are at
war one with another, so an unjust society is a state afflicted by
"meddlesomeness, and interference, and the rising up of a part of the
soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which is
made by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the
natural vassal -- what is all this confusion and delusion but
injustice, and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every
form of vice?"
<P>
     Edmund Burke re-expressed this doctrine of "to each his own"
when, in his Reflections on the Revolution in France, he wrote of true
natural rights:  "Men have a right to the fruits of their industry,
and to the means of making their industry fruitful.  They have a right
to the acquisitions of their parents, to the nourishment and
improvement of their offspring, to instruction in life, and to
consolation in death.  Whatever each man can separately do, without
trespassing upon others, he has a right to do for himself; and he has
a right to all which society, with all its combinations of skill and
force, can do in his favor."
<P>
     And yet in Burke's own time, there arose a very different idea of
justice, the Utilitarian concept, expounded by Jeremy Bentham.  From
Bentham's jurisprudence there is descended the powerful present-day
school of legal thought that we call legal positivism or legal
realism.  Positivistic jurisprudence arose in alliance with
nineteenth-century nationalism and with scientific mechanism and
materialism.  To the legal positivist or realist, laws are the
commands of human beings merely.  There exists, for the positivist, no
necessary connections between law and morals, or between law as it is
and law as it ought to be.  The positivists' legal system is a closed,
logical system without need for referring to social aims, policies, or
moral standards.  So-called "moral judgments," to the positivists, are
"value judgments" merely:  and value judgments cannot be established
or defended by rational argument.  This positivistic understanding of
justice and law looms large in American courts today.
<P>
     But in this lecture I do not have time to analyze the strengths
and weaknesses of legal positivism.  For the present, I do no more
than to point out that nineteenth- and twentieth-century positivism
stands in harsh opposition to both the classical and the Christian
understanding of justice and law.  In Catholic universities, at least,
some defense still is offered of the Augustinian virtue of justice and
the venerable theory of natural law.
<P>
     It is my purpose in today's remarks to state the classical and
the Christian concept of justice, as opposed to the positivists'
denial of any source for justice except the commands of the sovereign
state.  And I will touch glancingly upon the connections among
religion, justice, and law.  (Justice and law are not identical,
though they may be closely related:  in a good commonwealth, law is an
attempt to maintain standards of justice, so far as that may be
achieved in a bent world.)
<P>
     All law is derived from the religious understanding -- that is,
all law in the traditional societies of the West; law in totalist
states is another matter entirely.  Moses came down from Horeb and did
justice upon criminous Israelites:  the prophet as lawgiver.  Solon
reformed the laws of Draco:  the religious poet as lawgiver.  When law
is divorced from the moral sanction of religious convictions,
presently the law is corrupted by passion, prejudice, private
interest, and misguided sentimentality.
<P>
     The church is concerned with the inner order:  the order of the
soul.  The state is concerned with the outer order:  the order of the
commonwealth.  Between state and church, nevertheless, relationships
are ineluctable.  Among these relationships is an understanding of
justice.
<P>
     Such relationships took shape in the West so early as the fifth
century of the Christian era.  We perceive them in the connections
between Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, and his friend Boniface, Count of
Africa.  In theory, all Christians of the West believe in separation
of church and state -- though sometimes that principle has been more
honored in the breach than in the observance.
<P>
     The church recognizes the necessary end of the state, and so
submits to the state's laws.  Because of human sinfulness, the Fathers
of the Church taught, the state is ordained of God.  As best it can,
the state restrains the three chief forms of lust:  cupidity, the lust
for possessions; the libido dominandi, the lust for power; and sexual
lust, the abuse of the gift of procreation.  When the state is
enfeebled, these lusts work the ruin of the person and the republic.
<P>
     So it is that the church, even in Roman imperial times, has
taught obedience to civil magistrates.  Saint Augustine reasoned that
the good citizen, the believing Christian, should obey every command
of the state, save one:  an order to worship false gods and to serve
Satan.
<P>
     Yet church and state have different ends, though both uphold
justice.  There runs through the history of Christianity the doctrine
of the two swords:  the church's sword of faith, the state's sword of
secular justice.
<P>
     Knowing that this earthly existence is not the be-all and end-
all, the church holds that perfect justice is in the power of God
alone, beyond the confines of time and space.  In this world here
below, we mete out justice as best we may.  Sometimes we err in our
administering of justice; it cannot well be otherwise; we are not
perfect or perfectible creatures.
<P>
     To apprehend the church's stand on mundane justice, it is
desirable to make distinctions between crime and sin.  A crime is an
act or omission which the law punishes on behalf of the state, whether
because that act or omission is expressly forbidden by statute, or
because it is so injurious to the public as to require punishment on
the ground of public policy.
<P>
     A sin is a transgression against moral law, with that law's
divine sanctions.  It is God, not the State, who punishes or forgives
sins.
<P>
     Not all sins are crimes.  We have it on the authority of Saint
Paul that the greatest of the theological virtues is charity. 
Therefore uncharitableness is a great sin; yet lack of charity is not
an offense at law.  A man may be all his life snarling, sneering,
contemptuous, envious, abominable in his language toward his wife, his
children, and others to whom he owes obligations -- that is, perfectly
uncharitable; yet he will run no risk of being haled before the bar of
criminal justice.  The uncharitable may be dealt with at the Last
Judgment.  But mundane courts of law do not touch the sinner unless
his sins result in violence or fraud or substantial damage to others. 
The state is unconcerned with sins unless they lead to breaches of the
peace, or menace the social order.  This separation of function
accords with the doctrine of the two swords.
<P>
     Quite as the state -- that is, the constitutional state -- does
not lay down religious dogmata in recent times, so the church does not
decree the laws of mundane justice, as expressed through courts of
law.  When the church has endeavored to impose its doctrines through
the operation of the state's criminal law, the church has erred.
<P>
     I have been speaking of orthodox Christian doctrine, interwoven
with principles of law in America, Britain, and many other countries
-- interwoven, that is, until recent decades.  But great confusion has
fallen upon us in these years near the end of the century. 
Increasingly, the state -- aye, the democratic state, too -- separates
itself from the religious understanding of the human condition.  And a
good many churchmen abandon Christian realism for a sentimental
humanitarianism.
<P>
     Let me remind you of the true signification of this word
"humanitarianism."  Properly defined -- and this is the definition one
still finds in the Oxford English Dictionary -- humanitarianism is the
doctrine that Jesus of Nazareth possessed a human nature merely, not
being divine; and, by extension, the doctrine that mankind may become
perfect without divine aid.  A humanitarian is a person totally
secularized in his convictions.  Yet erroneously many people use
"humanitarian" as a term of commendation.  "He was a great
humanitarian," they say of Albert Schweitzer.  That charitable and
heroic man, a professing Christian, would have rejected indignantly
that label.
<P>
     Now what has this distinction between humanitarianism and charity
to do with justice?  The point is this:  the humanitarian denies the
existence of sin, declaring that what we call "sins" are not moral
matters at all, resulting instead from circumstance, faulty rearing,
or social oppression.  In the view of the humanitarian, sins -- and
crimes, too -- are the work of "society"; and sinners and criminals
are victims, rather than unjust offenders.  Such reasoning is the
consequence of holding that man and society may be perfected through
mere alteration of social conditions, without the intervention of
divine grace.
<P>
     The humanitarian frequently proclaims his abhorrence of severe
punishments -- perhaps of any punishments.  Why?  First, because of
his illusion that no human being possesses the ability to make moral
choices.  Second, because of his horror of inflicting pain.  He leaves
no ultimate justice to God, because he fancies that no God exists. 
The mere preservation of one's comfortable earthly life is his
obsession, he fancying that man is not made for eternity.
<P>
     On the other hand, the humanitarian fulminates against those who
disagree with his principles.  Thus there occurs the phenomenon called
"the humanitarian with the guillotine."  (The recent French film
called Danton sufficiently illustrates this ferocious love of all
humankind.) As Edmund Burke put it, speaking of the humanitarian
Jacobins, men who today snatch the worst criminals from the hands of
justice tomorrow may approve the slaughter of whole classes. 
Humanitarian apologies in our own time for butchery by communist
revolutionaries sufficiently suggest the persistence of this curious
intolerant humanitarianism.  The ideologue need merely proclaim that
his object is universal happiness here below, and he is approved
uncritically by the humanitarian.  As Solovyev wrote, the banners of
the Anti-Christ will bear the legend, "Feed men, and then ask them of
virtue."
<P>
     In this disordered age, when it seems as if the fountains of the
great deep had been broken up, our urgent need is to restore a general
understanding of the classical and Christian teaching about justice. 
Without just men and women, egoism and appetite bring down a
civilization.  Without strong administration of justice by the state,
we all become so many Cains, every man's hand against every other
man's.  The humanitarian fancies himself zealous for the life impulse;
in reality, he would surrender us to the death impulse.  The
humanitarian's visions issue from between the delusory gates of ivory;
justice issues from between the gates of horn.
<P>
     Public instruction that ignores both our classical patrimony and
our religious patrimony may fail to rear up just men and women. 
Positivist jurisprudence that denies any moral order and any religious
sanction for justice may end in a general flouting of all law.  We
prate of "peace and justice" in a dissolving culture, without
apprehending tolerably the words we employ.  "Shrieking voices/
Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,/ Always assail them."  These
are the voices of the ideologue, the neurotic, and the nihilist,
pulling down the old understanding of Justice, "to each his own."
<P>
     "Justice is a certain rectitude of mind, whereby a man does what
he ought to do in the circumstances confronting him."  So Thomas
Aquinas instructs us.  At every college and university, the doctors of
the schools ought to inquire of themselves, "Do we impart such
rectitude of mind?  And if we do not, will there be tolerable private
or public order in the twenty-first century?"

<P>

      A few days past, my wife fell into casual conversation with
three medical men.  All three of the doctors were dismayed at the
present situation and future prospects of the American people, and,
unsolicited, expressed at some length their vaticinations.  A surgeon,
after remarking that on the imminent breadlines people would be armed
and fighting, claiming rights but denying duties, then groaned.  "It's
all over!  I thought we had more time!  We lasted only two hundred
years!"
<P>
      This mood of despondency is widespread today.  "Shine, perishing
Republic!"  in the line of Robinson Jeffers.  The parallel with Roman
decay is sufficiently obvious.  As the American economy staggers under
a burden of taxation that soon, we are promised -- under Clinton
Caesar -- will be increased, the federal government sends the Marines
to Somalia to take two million Somalis under our spread-eagle wings. 
It was thus the Romans occupied Greece, for the sake of the wayward
Greeks -- and never left Greece until the Greek cities were ruined in
the collapse of the whole Empire.  Whom the gods wish to destroy, they
first make mad.
<P>
      Yesteryear's great expectations are blasted.  For the first
time, a great many Americans suspect that America's culture is
decadent.  Some of them seem well content with the sickness of our old
culture.  "What do you mean by 'culture?'  the Governor of New York
exclaimed four months ago.  "That's a word they used in Nazi Germany." 
This uncultured and unscrupulous demagogue is mentioned by President-
elect Clinton as a praiseworthy future associate justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States.  When such persons are elevated to
great power in the Republic, indeed there exists reason to raise the
question of social decadence.
<P>
      Defining Culture.  There has appeared a spate of books about the
present "Culture War."  And much obloquy is cast upon the so-called
"cultural elite" of the United States.  Succinctly, how may we define
this "culture" that has grown controversial?  In my newest book,
America's British Culture, published this week by the sociological
firm of Transaction, I examine at length such definitions; but for the
present, let us take a definition by Christopher Dawson, the great
historian of culture, whose works, in twenty-two volumes, I have begun
to edit in a uniform edition, at the request of the Homeland
Foundation.  Here, extracted from Dawson's first book, The Age of the
Gods (1928), is that definition:
<P>
 <UL> A culture is a common way of life -- a particular
      adjustment of man to his natural surroundings and his
      economic needs....  And just as every natural region tends
      to possess its characteristic forms of animal and vegetable
      life, so too will it possess its own type of human
      society....   The higher culture will express itself
      through its material circumstance, as masterfully and
      triumphantly as the artist through the medium of his
      material.</UL>
<P>
      Just so.  Our American culture, derived in large part from
centuries of British culture, has grown in this continent to a
tremendous civilization; President Bush takes pride in the fact that
America is now the only superpower.  Pride goeth before a fall.  That
is why I am conversing with you on the subject of whether this
civilization of ours may endure during the twenty-first century of the
Christian era.  What, if anything, may you and I do to renew this
shaken culture of ours?
<P>
      In my preceding three lectures, I dealt with three menaces to
the survival of our civilization:  first, the fraud called
multiculturalism, which is a device to pull down the inherited culture
of these United States; second, the endeavor of militant secular
humanists to undermine the religious heritage of the American people;
third, the ideology called democratism, the heresy of democracy, which
proclaims that one man is as good as another (or perhaps a little
better), and that the voice of the abstract People is the voice of
God.  Of course these movements or attitudes are not the only reasons
why our civilization appears to be in the sere and yellow leaf, but
they are of fairly recent origin and constitute a clear and present
danger.  How may you and I contend with a tolerable hope against these
forces, thus shoring up the footing of the edifice of the American
common way of life?
<P>
      Well, before we endeavor to prescribe remedies, we need to
ascertain the causes of our difficulties.  We must remind ourselves,
to begin, that culture arises from the cult:  out of the religious
bond and the sense of the sacred grow any civilization's agriculture,
its common defense, its orderly towns, its ingenious architecture, its
literature, its music, its visual arts, its law, its political
structure, its educational apparatus, and its mores.  Christopher
Dawson, Eric Voegelin, and other historians of this century have made
this historical truth clear.
<P>
      Decay of the Cult.  Modern society's gravest afflictions,
conversely, are caused by the decay of the cult upon which a society
has been founded, or by the sharp separation of the trappings of a
sophisticated civilization from the nurturing cult, with its glimpse
of the transcendent.  Alexander Solzhenitsyn, in his Templeton Address
at London, put this plainly enough:
<P>
 <UL> Our life consists not in the pursuit of material success
      but in the quest of worthy spiritual growth.
<P>
      Our entire earthly existence is but a transition stage in
      the movement toward something higher, and we must not
      stumble or fall, nor must we linger fruitlessly on one rung
      of the ladder....   The laws of physics and physiology will
      never reveal the indisputable manner in which The Creator
      constantly, day in and day out, participates in the life of
      each of us, unfailingly granting us the energy of
      existence; when this assistance leaves us, we die.  In the
      life of our entire planet, the Divine Spirit moves with no
      less force; this we must grasp in our dark and terrible
      hour.</UL>
<P>
      Thus it should be understood that the ideology of secular
humanism, the ideology of democratism, and the ideology of negritude
that lies behind professed "multiculturalism," all are assaults upon a
common way of life that has developed out of Christian insights -- or,
if you will, Judeo-Christian insights -- into the human condition. 
Ideology always is the enemy of religion, and endeavors to supplant
its adversary among humankind.  But ideology has been unable to
produce a counter-culture that endures long -- witness the collapse of
the Soviet Union after seven decades of power.
<P>
      The relationship between religious faith and a high culture,
described here by Solzhenitsyn, has been denied or ignored by the
intellectuals, although not forgotten by the humble.  At the beginning
of his Templeton Address, Solzhenitsyn made that point.  "Over half a
century ago, while I was still a child," Solzhenitsyn said, "I recall
hearing a number of older people offer the following explanation for
the great disasters that had befallen Russia. ' Men have forgotten
God; that's why all this has happened.'"  They were right, and so are
their counterparts in the United States today.
<P>
      About eight years ago, the Brookings Institution published a
careful study by James Reichley, entitled Religion in American Public
Life.  In a chapter entitled "Religion, Politics, and Human Values,"
Mr.  Reichley examined eight value-systems, and found only one of
those sufficient to balance individual rights against social
authority, so bringing about harmony in a culture.  That one value-
system he called "theist-humanism":  most people recognize it as
Christianity, in Reichley's description.  It is only a renewed sense
of the sacred, I am suggesting -- by a return to Christian
understanding of the human condition and its limitations, I am
suggesting, that the American nation may withstand the designs of
ideology and restore those common ways of life that we call America's
culture.
<P>
                         

      The governor of Mississippi has been reproached for declaring
that America is a Christian nation.  Despite objections, he was quite
right; his opponents seem not to understand the meaning of the word
"nation," except as it is incorrectly employed by the daily
journalist.  True, the United States of America is not a Christian
state, for the country's Constitution forbids the establishment of a
national church by Congress, and stands tolerant of all religions. 
But the words state and nation signify different concepts.  "State"
means the governmental organization of a country, political society
with sovereign power; while "nation" means the people of the land,
with their culture -- and not merely the people who are living just
now, but also their ancestors and those who will descend from them: 
that is, a nation is extended in time and shares a culture:  those
participants in a common culture who are living today, and the
participants in that culture who have preceded them in time, and those
participants in the common culture who are yet to be born.  One might
call a nation a community of souls.
<P>
      In that proper understanding of what a nation amounts to, the
American nation is Christian, although more Christian formerly,
perhaps, than it is just now.  For Christianity, if sometimes in a
diluted form, is the religion of the majority of Americans nowadays;
and beyond church communicants, there are millions of Americans who do
not attend churches, but nevertheless are strongly influenced by
Christian morals; moreover nearly else who has lived long in the
United States, though he be Jew or Moslem or agnostic, conforms in
large degree to American folkways and customs and conventions that are
Christian in origin:  in short, the American culture, with its
Christian roots, is everywhere dominant in these United States, among
the larger "minorities" of the population as well as among Americans
of European descent; that is, the Christian ethos is no less strong
among blacks and persons of Latin-American descent than among
Americans who can trace their descent in this country back to the
seventeenth century.
<P>
      So the Governor of Mississippi is quite right:  America is a
Christian nation; this is a matter of fact, not of opinion.  Whether
America will remain a Christian nation is matter for argument,
perhaps:  the creation of special rights for pathics, for instance,
indicates that Christian morals are going by the board; and the
prevalence of abortion, the deliberate destruction of one's offspring,
is another suggestion that both Christian belief and Christian morals
have begun to succumb to total religious indifference, if not yet to
atheism.  But if Christian faith and morals will be generally rejected
by the coming of the twenty-first century, then probably the whole
culture will disintegrate, the material culture as well as the
intellectual and moral culture; and human existence here will become
poor, nasty, brutish, and short:  unless some quite new culture, which
as yet nobody can imagine, should rise up.  Any such unnameable
innovative culture, to endure, would require some transcendent
sanction, perhaps some theophanic event -- something more enduring
than mere Marxist ideology, which was a violent attempt at a new faith
and a new culture.
<P>
      Why have an increasing number of Americans endeavored to break
with our inherited culture and its religious roots?  The reasons are
diverse; but the fundamental impulse to reject a religious patrimony
is expressed by T.  S.  Eliot in his choruses for "The Rock,"
especially in the following lines:
<P>
 <UL> Why should men love the Church?  Why should they love her laws?<BR>
      She tells them of Life and Death, and of all that they would
         forget.<BR>
      She is tender where they would be hard, and hard where they like
         to be soft.<BR>
      She tells them of Evil and Sin, and other unpleasant facts.<BR>
      They constantly try to escape<BR>
      From the darkness outside and within<BR>
      By dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be
         good.</UL>
<P>
      Religion restrains the passions and the appetites:  and sensate
natures flout restraints.  The more perverse the pleasure, the more it
is sought by some.  So it is that public funds have been employed
recently to subsidize obscene representations of Jesus of Nazareth;
this seems to some titillatingly smart.  I find it odd that, so far as
I know, nobody has compared these "works of art" to the obscene
representations of Jews in which Joseph Goebbels and his colleagues
rejoiced during the regime of Hitler. 
<P>
      Religious Renewal. I have been suggesting, ladies and gentlemen,
that for our culture -- our inherited ways of life that have nurtured
our American society in the past -- to be reinvigorated, a renewal of
religious faith is required.  So long as many of us deny the dignity
of man and indulge what T.  S.  Eliot called "the diabolic
imagination," our culture limps downward.  Our public schools, almost
totally secularized, starve the religious imagination; federal and
state courts often tend to frown upon Christian morals and churches'
claims to independence.  Will a time arrive when religion is indulged
by public authorities only on sufferance?
<P>
      What can be done to restore the religious imagination within our
common culture?  One cannot look to many seminaries for such a
vigorous work of renewal:  most of those institutions are pursuing
theological or quasi-theological novelties, and are caught up in the
humanitarian spirit of the age.  No one can sincerely embrace a
religious creed merely because it might be socially beneficial to do
so.  Conceivably some great preacher or great novelist or great poet
may move minds and hearts toward the transcendent again, opening eyes
that had been sealed; there come to mind the examples of John Wesley
in eighteenth-century England, Chateaubriand in France at the end of
the French Revolution, T.  S.  Eliot in this century.  Or possibly men
of the natural sciences may come to perceive design in the universe,
purpose in mutations.  Or, as in ages past, we may be given a Sign.
<P>
      Some people, after the fashion of T.  S.  Eliot, may turn toward
Christianity once they have discovered how unendurable a place the
twentieth-century world would become were that faith altogether
lacking.  Others, myself among them, may come from much reading and
meditation to conclude that Augustine of Hippo and Sir Thomas Browne
and Samuel Johnson and Samuel Taylor Coleridge and John Henry Newman,
professed Christians and apologists too, were no fools.  Whether
enough such persons may take up the cause of Christian teaching to
alter the spirit of the age -- why, who can tell?  C.S.  Lewis and
Malcolm Muggeridge succeeded in moving intellects and consciences, and
a half-dozen American writers continue to do so among us today.  By
the way, I particularly commend to you, ladies and gentlemen, a new
book by William Kirk Kilpatrick, Why Johnny Can't Tell Right from
Wrong:  Moral Illiteracy and the Case for Character Education.  Say
not the struggle naught availeth:  this earnest book very effectively
exposes the mischief being done by those educators who in Britain are
called "the crazies."  At one American gathering of that educationist
clan, hard haters of old moral principles, all the major religions of
the world were dismissed as "male chauvinist murder cults."

<P>

      Short of a mighty reinvigoration of the religious imagination,
what may you and I do to redeem the time?
<P>
      Confining ourselves to the three causes of cultural decadence
that I discussed in my three previous lectures, I declare that we can
do much, in a practical way.
<P>
      With respect to multiculturalism, it is entirely possible to
resist this silly, malign movement, despite its temporary successes,
and to begin to restore a decent curriculum to schools, colleges, and
universities; if we succeed, nine-tenths of the students will bless
us.  At the University of Texas, recently, the multicultural program
was opposed by a majority of the faculty in a secret ballot; and the
university's president resigned in consequence, praise be.  A little
more courage on the part of college administrators and professors
would undo this anti-cultural tyranny.  And yet the advantages still
lies with the aggressors.  At one Michigan college, this year, black
militant students engaged in wild demonstrations.  Far from
disciplining the student offenders, the woman president of the college
ordered two or three members of the faculty to undergo sensitivity
training, so that they would learn to be sufficiently servile to
militant students.  A mad world, my masters!  Let us prod some
university presidents and trustees into defense of true academic
freedom.
<P>
      With respect to the assaults upon religious belief, which has
been the source of all high culture over the ages, it is high time for
us to oppose most strenuously those governmental policies which
discriminate against religion and received morality.  In New York
City, very recently, Dr.  Russell Hittinger, a redoubtable learned
champion of the doctrines of natural law, issued from the platform a
virtual call to arms against the enemies of moral order -- some of
them entrenched behind the federal bench.  Let us remember that not
even the Supreme Court of the United States is endowed with arbitrary
and absolute power:  Congress, if it so chooses may remove from the
Court's appellate jurisdiction certain categories of cases, and in
other ways may remind the judiciary that it is not a constitutional
archonocracy.  But I leave to your ingenuity, ladies and gentlemen,
the devising of ways to resist and even to intimidate those zealots
for the abolition of all restraint upon sensual impulse.
<P>
      In connection with this possible restoration of the religious
imagination, it is of the first importance to bring about more choice
in education at every level -- so that those parents and others who
would have their children obtain religious knowledge may be enabled to
do so.  The national administration of President Bush gave at least
lip-service to this cause:  and more than ever before, there exists a
possibility of persuading state legislators to pass such measures. 
<P>
      Third, I urge you friends, to resist manfully and womanfully the
thoughtless centralization of political and economic power.  Not
content with having reduced the several American states, nominally
sovereign, to impotent provinces, America's centralizers, with their
dream of a New World Order, have commenced to acquire provinces
overseas -- Somalia the first in this decade, perhaps.  "Take up the
white man's burden," certain liberal voices exhort us.  One can
imagine the nightmare of a universal domination of egalitarian
"democratic capitalism" directed by the Washington bureaucracy --
unimaginative, arrogant, everywhere resented in the twenty-first
century -- draining America's resources and energies as Rome was
drained by her empire.  The more centralization, the less freedom and
the less energy.
<P>
      Is this the manifest destiny of the United States to become the
New Rome?  Have you and I no choice about that?  Nay, not so.  In
1795, a dread year for Britain, old Edmund Burke, in his first Letter
on a Regicide Peace, denied that great states have to obey some
irresistible law of progress or decay; Burke set his face against the
attitude now called "determinism."  Permit me to quote a key passage:
<P>
 <UL> It is often impossible, in these political inquiries, to
      find any proportion between the apparent causes we may
      assign, and their known operation.  We are therefore
      obliged to deliver up that operation to mere chance; or,
      more piously (perhaps more rationally), to the occasional
      interposition and the irresistible hand of the Great
      Disposer.  We have seen states of considerable duration,
      for which ages have remained nearly as they have begun, and
      could hardly be said to ebb or flow.  The meridian of some
      has been most splendid.  Others, and they the greatest
      number, have fluctuated, and experienced at different
      periods of their existence a great variety of fortune.  At
      the very moment when some of them seem plunged in
      unfathomable abysses of disgrace and disaster, they have
      begun a new course, and opened a new reckoning, and even in
      the depths of their calamity, and on the very ruins of
      their country, have laid the foundations of a towering and
      durable greatness.  All this happened without any apparent
      previous change in the general circumstances which had
      brought on their distress.  The death of a man at a
      critical juncture, his retreat, have brought innumerable
      calamities on a whole nation.  A common soldier, a child, a
      girl at the door of an inn, have changed the face of
      fortune, and almost of Nature.</UL>
<P>
      In those two sentences, Burke may refer to the reverses of
Pericles, to the death of the Constable of Bourbon and other startling
historical instances of a country's fate hanging upon a single life. 
His common soldier is Arnold of Winkelreid, who flung himself upon the
Austrian lances at Sempach; his child is Hannibal, taking at the age
of twelve his oath to make undying war upon Rome; his girl at the inn
is Joan of Arc.  Providence, chance, or strong wills, Burke declares,
abruptly may alter the whole apparent direction of "that armed ghost,
the meaning of history" (Gabriel Marcel's phrase).
<P>
      Even such as you and I, my friends, if we are resolute enough
and sufficiently imaginative, may alter the present course of events. 
God, we have been told, helps those who help themselves.  In the face
of increasing tribulations, sometimes conservatives and liberals are
making common cause in the defense of America's culture.  Both Arthur
M.  Schlesinger, Jr., and your servant have written books in
repudiation of multiculturalism.  Once more, say not the struggle
naught availeth.  A great number of the American people already have
taken alarm at the drift of policy and morality in this land. 
Reactions may be salutary:  as the poet Roy Campbell used to say, a
human body that cannot react is a corpse; and so it is with society. 
Up the reactionaries against decadence!
<P>
      Permit me, in conclusion, to quote a heartening passage from a
book, Our Present Discontents, published in 1919, a year in some
respects like the year 1992.  The author was William Ralph Inge, then
Dean of St.  Paul's in London, commonly described by journalists as
"the Gloomy Dean."  The passage I offer you, however, is one of hope:
<P>
       <UL> There may be in progress a store of beneficent forces
      which we cannot see, There are ages of sowing and ages of
      reaping; the brilliant epochs may be those in which
      spiritual wealth is squandered; the epochs of apparent
      decline may be those in which the race is recuperating
      after an exhausting effort.  To all appearances, man still
      has a great part of his long lease before him, and there is
      no reason to suppose that the future will be less
      productive of moral and spiritual triumphs than the past. 
      The source of all good is like an inexhaustible river; the
      Creator pours forth new treasures of goodness, truth, and
      beauty for all who will love them and take them, "Nothing
      that truly is can ever perish," as Plotinus says; whatever
      has value in God's sight is for evermore.  Our half-real
      world is the factory of souls in which we are tried as in a
      furnace.  We are not to set our hopes upon it, but learn
      such wisdom as it can teach us while we pass through it.</UL>
<P>
       America has overcome the ideological culture of the Union of
Socialist Soviet Republics.  In the decade of this victory, are
Americans to forswear the beneficent culture that they have inherited? 
For a civilization to arise and flower, centuries are required; but
the indifference or the hostility of a single generation may suffice
to work that civilization's ruin.  We must confront the folk whom
Arnold Toynbee called "the internal proletariat" as contrasted with
the "external proletariat" from alien lands.  Otherwise we may end,
all of us, as fellow-proletarians, culturally deprived, in a nation
that will permit no one to rise above mediocrity.

      This year my Heritage lectures have been concerned with American
political errors during the closing decade of the twentieth century --
errors of the Republican party, of the Democratic party, and general
blunders in foreign relations. This evening, ladies and gentlemen, I
conclude my lecture series for Anno Domini 1991 with some desultory
remarks on the possibility of redemption from error -- and, in
particular, whether our rising generation in these United States may
find it possible to "redeem the time, redeem the dream" -- to borrow
T.S. Eliot's line.
<P>
      First, a few words about this concept "generation." To generate
is to beget; to bring into existence. In popular usage we mean by a
generation a large number of persons brought into existence about the
same time; in the same year, perhaps, or possibly in the same decade.
Thomas Jefferson promulgated the somewhat vague concept of every
"generation" of people making its own choices; of the generation of
the living not binding the generation which soon would come into
existence.
<P>
      Yet, this notion cannot be sustained logically or pragmatically.
For really there exists no line of demarcation parting alleged
generations of men and women. Every minute, as I address you, babies
are being born somewhere; and during the same minutes, old people are
dying in every land. 
<P>
      Actually, society is an intricate continuity of lives, not a
mere succession of human beings resembling the flies of a summer,
generation unable to link with generation. It is possible for me to
say truthfully that six generations of my family have lived in our
house at the village of Mecosta, in Michigan; but those alleged
"generations" have much overlapped; at no time over the past twelve
decades has only a single generation lived in our family home. The
notion of distinct generations, then, each generation monopolizing the
earth during its brief span of existence, is merely a convenient
fiction.
<P>
      Nevertheless, we employ that useful fiction frequently,
particularly with reference to literary and political movements. Thus
Spaniards refer to the "Generation of '98," made up of literary movers
and shakers whose convictions were formed at the time of Spain's naval
and military defeats that caused the loss of the Philippines, Cuba,
and Puerto Rico. Thus, in Britain, Wyndham Lewis referred to the "men
of 1914" -- certain innovating writers who began to appear in print
about the beginning of the First World War: Eliot, James Joyce, Ezra
Pound, T.E. Hulme, and Lewis himself. And thus, a very few years ago,
here at The Heritage Foundation, Mr. Ben Hart introduced the concept
of three generations of American conservatives that have exercised
influence since the late 1940s, say. Tonight, I address especially the
third of those hypothetical generations.
<P>
      By the First Generation, I take it, Mr. Hart means men and women
of politics and letters who began to come to public attention about
the end of the 'Forties and the beginning of the 'Fifties; who, most
of them, had grown aware of the sunken state of the world about them,
some time between, or during, the First World War and the Great
Depression. Among such persons who grew up with a conservative
inclination were Richard Weaver, Francis Wilson, Robert Nisbet, Daniel
Boorstin, William Buckley, and your servant; one might add William
Yandell Elliott (a little older) and William McGovern, and others who
were active so early as 1933, say. There would be regarded as
belonging to an earlier "generation," both in point of years and of
thought, such persons as T.S. Eliot, Irving Babbitt, Paul Elmer More,
and George Santayana. Among public men, Senators Robert A. Taft and
Carl Curtis, say, would be classified as members of the pre-
conservative generation, I suppose, their activity having occurred
mostly during the presidencies of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman;
while Senator Barry Goldwater, a relatively late conservative champion
in arms, would be classed with the First Generation conservatives, I
suppose, in Mr. Hart's scheme. You will perceive, ladies and
gentlemen, that membership in a hypothetical generation does not
necessarily coincide with the date of one's nativity.
<P>
      The Second Generation of conservatives, in Mr. Hart's
categories, consists of persons of varying ages who were attracted to
conservative causes, or began to style themselves conservatives,
sometime after 1953, in which year The Conservative Mind was
published. Thus Mr. Irving Kristol, almost so old as is your servant,
is classified as Second Generation; so is my wife Annette Yvonne
Cecilie Courtmanche Kirk, the first secretary at the organizational
meeting of Young Americans for Freedom, twenty-one years younger than
myself. I take it that Dr. Jeffrey Hart, Mr. Ben Hart's father, is
Second Generation -- although very nearly meeting the requirements for
Generation I; that Mr. M. Stanton Evans, despite his many years of
active duty in the conservative array, is a Second Generation
legionnaire; while Mr. Ben Hart himself, and his spouse are field
marshals of the Third Generation. 
<P>
      But, more subtle distinctions and classifications I leave to Mr.
Gregory Wolfe, now engaged in preparing an Encyclopedia of the Right.
So far as public men go, permit me to suggest merely that such
conservatively-inclined gentlemen as Senator Richard Lugar, Governor
John Engler, and Mr. Patrick Buchanan seem to fall within the Second
Generation fold. In brief, nowadays First Generation conservatives --
such of them as have not passed unto a less troubled realm of being --
usually are people in their seventies or their sixties; Second
Generation conservatives, most of them, in their fifties or forties;
Third Generation conservatives, in their thirties or their twenties --
or even in their teens. Pass we then to these ladies and gentlemen of
the Third Generations.

<P>

      Few of the Third Generation folk retain personal memories of the
Disaster of 1964 -- that is, the defeat of Barry Goldwater's
presidential candidacy, the centralizing follies of President
Johnson's "Great Society," the foretaste of ruin in Vietnam, the
loathsome and destructive antics of the crazy black militants and the
crazier young white radicals. The present members of the Third
Generation were reared when the hearts of our great American cities
already were dismal and rotten; when addiction to narcotics plagued
every social class; when public schools, with few honorable
exceptions, offered next to nothing for mind and conscience; when
Demon TV offered something for every taste but good taste; when
promiscuity and sexual perversity demanded recognition as normality;
when it was unwise to walk the streets o'nights; when shrieking mobs
dominated what had been the grove and halls of Academe; when
altercations in Washington made it almost impossible to conduct the
regular business of government; when American life seemed confusion
worse confounded; when one came to appreciate the mordant aphorism of
Albert Jay Nock: "American society is like German beer; dregs at the
bottom, scum at the top."
<P>
      In short, the conservative Third Generation have not known a
tranquil and pleasant and confident America. They scarcely can imagine
a time, not many decades past, when it was the happy evening diversion
of families or couples to stroll in New York's Central Park of
Detroit's Belle Isle Park. They have little knowledge even of the
neighborhood grocery or butcher-shop, the corner drug-store with its
soda-fountain; for them is the leviathan shopping-mall, commercial
collectivism. They have experienced little of continuity; the
expectation of change has been greater far. Yet, they know that much
remains to conserve, and that much ought to be restored.
<P>
      In one respect, but in that respect only, the task of the
conservative of 1991 looms less oppressive than was the task of the
conservative of 1951, when my first book was published. I mean that
the grim menace of the Soviet Union no longer hangs over us. Seventy
years were required for the Communist ideology to work its own ruin,
so that it fell to pieces at a good-natured push, quite bloodless,
from Mr. Ronald Reagan. Always will there be wars and rumors of war;
yet from the Soviet terror we have been saved, so that the Third
Generation conservatives may address their energies to something more
fundamental than resisting the armed doctrine called Marxism.
<P>
      What, then, is the mission of Third Generation conservatives,
young men and women who seek to preserve the Permanent Things, those
elements in human existence that were not born yesterday? It is not to
promulgate a "conservative ideology": for conservatism is the negation
of ideology. Ideology is an attempt to govern all life by political
slogans; while American conservatives believe that no mere political
formulas can make a people content. Conservatives take for their guide
in politics what Edmund Burke called "the wisdom of the species": that
is, the experience of human beings in community, extending over many
centuries. Thus, American conservatism is a cast of mind and
character, not a neat body of political abstractions. Ideology is
political fanaticism, an endeavor to rule the world by rigorous
abstract dogmata. The dogmata of an abstract "democratic capitalism"
may be mischievous as the dogmata of Marx.
<P>
      It is possible to describe certain attitudes that make up
America's conservative mentality, even though not all Americans could
express coherently their belief in such general principles, and
although some conservatives would dissent from one or more of the
general assumptions or principles I now mention.
<P>
      First, belief in some transcendent order in the universe, some
law that is more than human: a religious understanding of the human
condition, if you will; a belief in enduring moral norms. As the
national pledge of allegiance puts it, "One nation under God.... "
<P>
      Second, opposition to totalist ideology and the totalist
political order. The American conservative rejects the notion of a
future earthly paradise -- which the ideologue promises to attain.
<P>
      Third, confidence in the American Constitution -- both the
written national Constitution and the intricate fabric of custom,
belief, and habit that makes up the underlying "unwritten"
constitution of a nation-state. Many decisions of the Supreme Court in
recent decades are bitterly resented; nevertheless, attachment to the
Constitution itself remains strong.
<P>
      Fourth, maintenance of the rights of private property and of a
free or competitive economy, as contrasted with a directed or
socialist economy. This healthy prejudice persists despite the
increasing consolidation of business and industry into large
conglomerations or oligopolies.
<P>
      Fifth, suspicion of central political direction, and preference
for state and local powers: insistence upon private rights. 
<P>
      Sixth, a deep-rooted patriotism, joined to uneasiness at
"entangling alliances"; this latter attitude, nevertheless, modified
by determination to resist totalist powers that menace the American
national interest.
<P>
      Seventh, an awareness that change is not identical with healthy
improvement; a relish for the American past; a genuine preference for
the old and tried.
<P>
      Such is the consensus of that very large body of Americans who
choose to call themselves conservative in their politics. Within this
crowd of conservative citizens exist various factions, each
emphasizing some aspect or another of the general conservative
attitude. There exists no "party line" to which conservatives of one
persuasion or another are compelled to conform.
<P>
      Retrenchment and Reform. With such assumptions as those I
outlined just now, America enters upon an age of retrenchment and
reform in economic concerns. If American prosperity is to endure,
public expenditure and taxation must be kept in check. Conservative
economic measures must be employed to prevent inflation of the
currency and to reduce the national deficit -- a hard necessity of
which the general public is becoming aware.
<P>
      In this present era when the Soviet power fades away, the
majority of the American public seem disillusioned with social
experiments and with the rapid pace of change; with excessive
governmental regulation; with cities fallen to ruin and tormented by
crime; with subsidized abortion, with judicial usurping of power, with
a permissive indulgence of license and criminality, with the blight of
pornography, with the whole liberal climate of opinion. For the next
half-century at least, I suggest, the American democracy will tend to
reject those politicians who still indulge dreams of Lotos-land.
Liberalism has undone itself.
<P>
      There have been ages when custom and inertia have lain
insufferably upon humankind; and such an age may come to pass again;
but such is not our age. Ours is an era when the moral and social
heritage of many centuries of civilization stands in imminent peril
from the forces of vertiginous indiscriminate change. Resistance to
the folly of such change is the primary duty of the Third Generation
conservative.
<P>
      The continuing American conservative movement, if it is to be
carried on tolerably well, must work within the minds and the
consciences of a good many young men and women. I do not think that
this work of conservation can be accomplished by any particular group;
certainly not by any idealizing of "business rule." I trust that
Americans will conserve a market economy and all the better features
of an economy marked by volition. But Americans will conserve such
advantages only if they conserve something higher and older: that is,
a society of tradition, diversity, and the life of spirit.

<P>

      The critic Eliseo Vivas wrote once that "It is one of the marks
of human decency to be ashamed of having been born into the twentieth
century." Spiritually and politically, the twentieth century has been
a time of decadence. Yet, as that century draws near to its close, we
may remind ourselves that ages of decadence often have been followed
by ages of renewal.
<P>
      What can you do to commence redeeming the time, to conserve the
Permanent Things, to raise up the human condition to a level less
unworthy of what Pico della Mirandola called "the dignity of man"?
Why, begin by brightening the corner where you are; by improving one
human unit, yourself, and helping your neighbor.
<P>
      You will not need to be rich or famous to take your part in
redeeming the time: what you need for that task is moral imagination
joined to right reason. It is not by wealth or fame that you will be
rewarded, probably, but by eternal moments: those moments of one's
existence in which, as T.S. Eliot put it, time and the timeless
intersect. In such moments, you may discover the answer to that
immemorial question which now and again enters the head of any
reflective man or woman, "What is all this? What is this world that
surrounds us, and why are we here?"
<P>
      Yes, what is all this? Why, this present realm of being, in
which your consciousness and my consciousness are aware of reality, is
a divine creation; and you and I are put into it as into a testing-
ground -- into an arena, if you will. As the German writer Stefan
Andres put it, "We are God's Utopia." You and I are moral beings meant
to accomplish something good, in a small way or a big, in this
temporal world.
<P>
      The Roman Stoics taught that some things in life are good, and
some are evil; but that the great majority of life's happenings are
neither good nor evil, but indifferent merely. Wealth is a thing
indifferent, and so is poverty; fame is a thing indifferent, and so is
obscurity. Shrug your shoulders at things indifferent; set your face
against the things evil; and by doing God's will, said the Stoics,
find that peace which passes all understanding.
<P>
      True Authority. How do we know such postulates, religious and
philosophical, to be true? Why, by the common sense and ancient assent
of mankind -- that is, by hearkening to the voice of true authority,
the voice of what G.K. Chesterton called "the democracy of the dead."
I think of what John Henry Newman wrote about Authority in 1846:
"Conscience is an authority; the Bible is an authority; such is the
Church; such is antiquity; such are the words of the wise; such are
hereditary lessons; such are ethical truths; such are historical
memories; such are legal saws and state maxims; such are proverbs;
such are sentiments, presages, and prepossessions." Believe what wise
men and women, over the centuries, have believed in matters of faith
and morals, and you will have a firm footing on which to stand while
the winds of doctrine howl about you.
<P>
      This counsel that I offer you, conservatives of the Third
Generation, will not guarantee your winning any of the glittering
prizes of modern society; for those too are among the things
indifferent, and some of them are among the things evil. Yet, this
advice from a conservative of the First Generation who has seen a good
deal of the world conceivably may help you on the track toward certain
eternal moments, when time and the timeless intersect. What happens at
such timeless moments, such occurrences in eternity? Why, quiet
perfect events, usually; among them the act of telling stories to
one's children, or of reading aloud to them.
<P>
      What is all this -- this confused American world of glittering
material things and of appalling personal and social decay? I have
found it to be a real world, sun-lit despite its vices; a real world
in which one may develop and exercise one's potential virtues of
courage, prudence, temperance, and justice; one's faith, hope, and
charity. You will take your tumbles in this world, which can be rough
enough in our age, Lord knows; but also you may enjoy your triumphs.
It is a world in which there is so much needing to be done that nobody
ought to be bored. For young Americans especially, this is still a
world of high opportunity.
<P>
      All this creation about us is the garden that we erring humans
were appointed to tend. Plant some flowers in it, if you can, and pull
some weeds. If need be, draw your sword to defend it. Do not fancy
that a sorry policy of Looking Out for Number One will lead you to
Heaven's gate. Do not fail to remind yourselves that consciousness is
a perpetual adventure. Do not ignore the wisdom of the ages, the
democracy of the dead. Such, ladies and gentlemen, is the counsel of
this survivor from the First Generation.
<P>
      Those of us who aspire to conserve our inherited order and
justice and freedom, our patrimony of wisdom and beauty and loving-
kindness, have a hard row to hoe nowadays -- that I confess. But, I am
heartened from time to time by a stanza from Chesterton's long poem,
The Ballad of the White Horse. Chesterton is describing the prophets
of doom, who tell us that nothing in life is permanent; that all is
lost, or is being lost, in our culture; that we totter on the brink of
an abyss. Such prophets of doom think themselves wise. Chesterton has
in mind the typical intellectuals of the twentieth century, but he
calls them the wise men of the East. Here I give you Chesterton's
lines: 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The wise men know what wicked thingsAre written on the
      sky,They trim sad lamps, they touch sad stringsHearing the
      heavy purple wings,Where the forgotten seraph kingsStill
      plot how God shall die.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Such despairing souls, though possessed perhaps of much
intelligence, in truth are not wise. In our time, ladies and
gentlemen, many voices have been declaring that life is not worth
living. A multitude of writers and professors and publicists and
members of the class of persons commonly styled "intellectuals"
gloomily instruct us that we human beings are no better than naked
apes, and that consciousness is an illusion. Such persons insist that
life has no purpose but sensual gratification; that the brief span of
one's physical existence is the be-all and end-all. Such twentieth-
century sophists have created in the murky caves of the intellect an
Underworld; and they endeavor to convince us all that there exists no
sun -- that the world of wonder and of hope exists nowhere, and never
did exist. Plato knew just such sophists in his age. Those doctrines
of despair, the rising generation of conservatives must confront and
refute.

<P>
      My counsels so far may have seemed somewhat ghostly, no doubt.
But, I have learned from life in various regions of the world, and
under differing circumstances, that it is the life of spirit which
truly matters; and that the Permanent Thing most worthy of
preservation is an understanding of the human soul. The conscious
conservative defends the soul of humankind against the corrosive
materialism and sensuality of twentieth-century will and appetite.
<P>
      Let me turn, however, to the art of worldly wisdom. I can offer,
too, some practical advice. How, for instance, you may ask me, does
one contrive to forge ahead in practical political life in this
sprawling American democracy, with the intention of conducting a
conservative defense of the Permanent Things?
<P>
      Why, ordinarily it is fairly simple to make one's way in the
American political structure. American political parties could not
function without volunteers. Volunteer, and you will be gladly
accepted, such as you being urgently needed; you will find, indeed,
that a number of your fellow-volunteers are rather peculiar people,
almost Outcasts of Poker Flat, but welcome in a local political
organization (if not welcome in many other circles) because, whatever
their peculiarities, they are willing to work for the common cause.
<P> 
      If you are an intelligent and adept volunteer, you will be made
much of by the party leaders and faithful, and will be advanced in
your responsibilities. You may be asked to be a delegate, whether
elected or appointed. If chosen delegate, arrive early at caucus or
convention. When the meeting proper commences, endeavor to sit at the
chairman's right hand; then others may take you for his right-hand
man. There are many little arts by which one may gain ascendancy over
the minds of one's political colleagues. But, the great necessity is
to have acquired previously a fund of knowledge and some mastery of
rhetoric -- and honest principles. That is why I sometimes advise
undergraduates not to expend their time in street demonstrations, but
instead to study. If Karl Marx, instead of reading books within, had
spent his days parading round and round the outside of the British
museum, a placard "Down with the bourgeois!" tacked to a sandwich-
board over his shoulders -- why, had he been so foolish, the world
would be so much better off today.
<P>
      Redeem the time, redeem the dream -- in ways mundane as well as
ways spiritual. If you should resolve really to take a vigorous part
in restoring the American Republic, choose your vocation accordingly,
so that the work by which you gain your livelihood, and the work by
which you help to redeem the time, may coincide. Take to the law -- if
you can endure the boredom of our law schools nowadays. Or, take to
serious journalism -- or, for broader and more immediate influence, to
television and radio. You may accomplish some reform of the American
mind through book-publishing. Or, supposing you possess fortitude
sufficient to fight your way through our PC graduate schools, aspire
after a college professorship that might enable you to counteract the
freaks who appear to dominate the typical campus nowadays. Or take to
pedagogy, if you can surmount the dull obstacles to certification as a
teacher. If you feel a religious calling -- why, in no way might you
accomplish more to restore meaning to lives in the twenty-first
century. And, the best way to insure a Fourth Generation of
intelligent young conservatives is to beget children, and rear them
well: the wise parent is the conservator of ancient truths. As Edmund
Burke put it, "We learn to love the little platoon we belong to in
society." The institution most essential to conserve is the family.
<P>
      If we aspire to redeem this age of ours, so far gone in
decadence -- well, we have no time to lose before commencing our
endeavors. Fixed to the walls of the entrance hall of my house are
masks of the archaic god Cronos, in his role of Time the Devourer; his
half-leonine, half-human face bares his fangs, which the ancient
Greeks dreaded. Those masks serve to remind me daily that the night
cometh when no man shall work, and that I had best turn back to my
productive typewriter.
<P>
      Yet, Time is not a devourer only. With proper use of the life-
span that is allotted to us, we may accomplish our part in redeeming
our era from its vices, terrors, and catastrophic errors. With
Demosthenes, ladies and gentlemen, I beg of you to think. For only if
you think soundly at this juncture in your lives will you be enabled
to act decisively in those years when you have achieved some
influence.
<P>
      I conclude with an exhortation which Orestes Brownson, that
redoubtable conservative reformer, scholar, and journalist, delivered
at Dartmouth College in 1843. His topic was "The Scholar's Mission."
He concluded, as follows, his charge to the rising generation:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Ask not what your age wants, but what it needs, not what it
      will reward, but what, without which, it cannot be saved;
      and that go and do; and find your reward in the
      consciousness of having done your duty, and above all in
      the reflection, that you have been accounted to suffer
      somewhat for mankind.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      In the later 'Sixties, many of the rising generation thought it
amusing to pull down what earlier generations had patiently built up;
their zeal extended even to the burning of university libraries. In
the early 'Nineties, I hope and trust, many of the rising generation
will find it satisfying to restore and redeem their patrimony from
earlier times -- and so save the world from suicide. That labor will
require cleverness and courage. Some of you present here tonight may
choose it for your vocation.

      In commencing this second lecture on the sorry state of
political parties in these United States, I ask you to indulge me in
quoting a passage from Edmund Burke's Thoughts on the Present
Discontents, a political tract, published in 1770, mordantly critical
of the ways of George III with Parliament.  In this famous essay Burke
defines the phrase "political party":
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they
      will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a
      contemptible struggle.... 
<P>
      Party is a body of men united for promoting by their joint
      endeavors the national interest upon some particular
      principle in which they are all agreed.  For my part, I
      find it impossible to conceive that anyone believes in his
      own politics, or thinks them of any weight, who refuses to
      adopt the means of having them reduced into practice.  It
      is the business of the speculative philosopher to mark the
      proper ends of government.  It is the business of the
      politician, who is the philosopher in action, to find out
      proper means towards those ends, and to employ them with
      effect.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Now I confess myself to be one of those speculative
philosophers, mentioned by Burke, whose business it is to mark the
proper ends of government; I do not pretend to possess remedies for
all the political ills to which our nation is heir.  But I venture to
criticize those politicians, in either great party, who, far from
being philosophers in action, are merely what Burke and his
contemporaries called "placemen":  that is, seekers after the power
and the emoluments of public office, not scrupulous as to the means by
which advantages for themselves may be obtained.  The demagogue seeks
for himself a cozy place in the political sunshine.
<P>
      In my previous lecture of this series, I touched upon some
errors of the Republican Party, under George Bush, in affairs domestic
and in affairs abroad.  Today I turn to the errors of the Democratic
Party, under leaders of recent years.  For the past decade the
Democrats have been an opposition party -- that is, in opposition to
the national Executive Force.  In their opposition the Democrats, with
some honorable exceptions, have gained little credit for themselves.
<P>
      Difficult Attitudes.  The Democratic party claims descent from
Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans, but any remaining relationship to
Jeffersonians is difficult to discern.  In its origins, the Democratic
Party at the beginning of the nineteenth century was the champion of
the agricultural and rural interest, the defender of states' powers as
opposed to political centralization, the advocate of hard money and
the opponent of national debt.  Democratic attitudes nowadays are very
different.
<P>
      For at Democratic national conventions, the cry is all for
grander federal expenditures and piling up of more debt, in
consequence.  With few exceptions, the leading Democrats would
centralize everything, not bothering to reflect upon what the word
"federal" signifies.  For the most part ignoring the remnant of
America's rural population, the Democrats are subservient to organized
"minorities" in America's great decayed cities; upon the proletariat
they are sedulous to confer more "entitlements," on humanitarian
principles.  Senator Moynihan and a handful of other Democratic
legislators think seriously about our urban afflictions, seeking
practical remedies, a difficult task; but most Democrats in office
hold by the exploded notion that legislative bodies can sweep away
social conundrums by throwing money at them.
<P>
      Democratic Majorities. In presidential contests, the Democrats
have won only one of the past six elections, and take a dim view of
their own prospects in the election of 1992.  The ethnic coalition
from which they drew a great part of their support in the Roosevelt
and Truman years has been dissolving; the labor unions that delivered
a massive Democratic vote have been diminishing in numbers and in
zeal; white voters in the Old South have shifted, a great many of
them, to the Republican ticket; the Democratic party seems devoid of
imagination and deprived of true leadership.  How is it, then, that
Democratic majorities prevail in House and Senate?
<P>
      The answer to that question seems to be that in presidential
elections, the voting public becomes fairly well aware of the issues
in dispute and of the personalities of the candidates:  massive
television coverage, prolonged newspaper discussion, and candidates'
debates give the typical voter some notion of what the Republican
presidential candidate and the Democratic candidate respectively think
and propose.  So informed, the majority of citizens then vote for the
Republican, having found him nearer to their hearts' desire.
<P>
      For the Democrats, in their endeavor to cater to even the most
unlikely "minority," have alienated the majority in nearly every state
of the Union.  The American public is conservative in its sentiments,
for the most part; and when the contest occurs between candidates
recognizably conservative and candidates recognizably liberal or
radical, the public prefers the conservative.  The governor of New
York, Mario Cuomo, so often mentioned as a possible Democratic
presidential candidate, at present is vigorously advocating a bill in
the New York legislature to confer special privileges upon
homosexuals.  The fancied political advantage to be gained by pleasing
pathics will be overwhelmed by public opinion if ever Mr.  Cuomo
confronts President Bush or any other Republican nominee who does not
endeavor to reward sexual deviancy.  What a genius the Democrats this
past quarter-century have developed for misjudging public opinion!
<P>
      Republican Goal.  How is it, then, that nevertheless the
Democratic party holds a majority, most of the time, in both Senate
and House?  Why, in the election of Senators and Representatives, the
typical voter is ill informed about the views of the respective
candidates, and knows next to nothing of their voting records,
supposing them to be incumbents of the offices at stake.  The voter
tends to approve a candidate according to what the candidate claims to
have accomplished by way of securing benefits at federal expense for
his state or his congressional district, regardless of the chief
political issues of the hour.  Also the voter in many such elections
is powerfully influenced by name-recognition, so that Democratic
incumbents, long entrenched in office, are almost impossible to
dislodge in many districts and states.  In the long run, possession of
the executive branch of the federal government by Republicans will
work to erode the Democratic majority in both legislative houses.  But
to achieve that success, Republican presidential candidates might have
to forgo the goal of winning all fifty states for their personal
triumph, and instead spend money and time upon electing senators and
representatives.  Presidents Nixon, Reagan, and Bush, although
virtually certain to be elected by wide popular and electoral
majorities, somewhat neglected their duty of trying hard to bring in
Republican Congresses -- or at least their campaign managers failed
them in that respect.
<P>
      However that may be, time is not on the side of the Democratic
Party:  their leaders talk the language of yesteryear.  Mr.  Carter,
addressing the Democratic convention that had nominated him in 1976,
made promises and employed a rhetoric that would have gone down very
well in 1932 or 1936, but were absurdly archaic in the very different
era of the Bicentenary.  Nevertheless, Mr.  Carter won the election --
not because of what he said, but in spite of it.  His successors as
Democratic presidential candidates have behaved with equal absurdity
-- being their own worst enemies -- but did not enjoy the good fortune
to run against a Republican candidate who fancied that Poland was not
Soviet dominated.  Like the Bourbons, the Democrats since F.D.R.  have
learned nothing and forgotten nothing.

<P>

      Time has been when the Democratic leaders were great men.  One
thinks of John C.  Calhoun, or Grover Cleveland.  It has been
otherwise since World War II.  An impartial observer -- from Mars, say
-- necessarily would regard with some misgiving a party headed by
Lyndon Johnson, whose infamy has been exposed by careful biographers;
or a party whose most conspicuous United States Senator nowadays is
the amorous and bibulous gentleman from Massachusetts.  Yet have there
not been Democratic leaders of recent decades who were veritable
Galahads or Percivals, you may inquire?  Why, there were some honest
and able men among those leaders; yet not, perhaps, precisely those
eminent Democrats whom the party panegyrists delight to honor.
<P>
      Take, for instance, the Honorable Hubert Humphrey, long United
States Senator from Minnesota, who since his death has been
politically canonized.  Once upon a time I debated Mr.  Humphrey
before a huge audience in Ann Arbor.  I found him an amiable man,
courteous, forthright when assailed by a band of student fidelistas in
the crowd; but excessively fond of the sound of his own voice, for
which indeed he apologized to me at the debate's end.  Yet Senator
Humphrey did not lead a career free of all stain and reproach.  I do
not refer to peccadillos of the sort committed by Mr.  Gary Hart: 
rather, I mean a conflict of interest of the gravest kind, in which
Humphrey put his own interest above the interest of the foreign policy
of the United States -- a case involving the security of the North
Atlantic Treaty allies.
<P>
      Primary Defeat.  What I am about to tell you never has been
published before, although some reference to it will appear in my
memoirs.  Let me preface my narration by reminding you, ladies and
gentlemen, of the hard-fought Democratic primary in West Virginia
during the year 1960.  Senator Kennedy was pitted against Senator
Humphrey; a vast amount of money was expended by both presidential
aspirants.  Eugene McCarthy, a Democrat as honest as he is
interesting, said to me once that this West Virginia primary was the
most corrupt episode in the political history of the United States. 
However that may be, Humphrey lost the primary, if somewhat narrowly;
therefore he lost his party's presidential nomination.  And he was
left forlorn with a great mass of West Virginia debts upon his
shoulders.
<P>
      So much for that, just now.  Our scene shifts from West Virginia
to Turkey; the events to be described occur three to four years after
Hubert Humphrey's defeat.  I am about to quote to you, verbatim, a
report made to me by a retired Foreign Service officer who at the time
of those events was assigned to duties in the Near East and the Middle
East.  I have known this former diplomat for a good many years and
have complete confidence in his veracity.
<P>
      "One of the kindest and most helpful men in the Senate," my
informant commences, "was Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota." 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
           He seemed sensitive to the national interest, willing
      to resist special interests of the financial or ethnic
      sort, and always ready to understand State's views, to
      advise, and to help when he could.  He even "condescended"
      to me socially in the grand old meaning of that word.
<P>
           In the mid-fifties, the legendary hero Ismet Inonu,
      successor to Kemal Ataturk, surprised the world by
      permitting a free and fair national election, and by giving
      up power peacefully when he lost to Adnan Menderes. 
      Menderes, with broad peasant support, won handily and
      installed his own regime in place of that of Inonu, who
      became leader of the Opposition.  Within a short time the
      Menderes government became the stage of typical Third World
      financial corruption, much of it involving rake-offs in
      alleged "development" contracts with foreign firms.  When
      Menderes began to deprive the Opposition of its political
      rights and even threatened the personal safety of Inonu,
      the armed forces, feeling that their role in society had
      been betrayed, threw out Menderes and his friends and
      reinstalled Inonu.
<P>
           Inonu, whose administration was reasonably honest by
      Turkish standards, had the backing of the Army in bringing
      to trial and punishment Turkish politicians and officials
      believed to have been among the worst of the grafters.  In
      one of many cases, several officials were punished for
      accepting large bribes from an American ("The Promoter")
      who had contracted to provide a complete small steel mill
      to Turkey.  It was shown in the trial that the "mill" was
      actually the old, rusted, and broken-down hardware from a
      plant on the southern U.S.  coast which had been closed as
      obsolete and sold by the owners to The Promoter for one or
      two million dollars; for the plant owners it was of value
      only as scrap.  The Turkish regime was no more than amused
      when The Promoter, who would have been arrested for fraud,
      bribery, and conspiracy if he had entered Turkey, formally
      asked the Turkish government for his final payment of ten
      million dollars under the contract.  He pointed out that
      the machinery in question had been delivered, even though
      it was just rusting on the docks in Turkey.  The Turkish
      government refused, noting that expert testimony in the
      trial had proved the machinery to be inoperable, worthless,
      and not as specified in the contract.  It suggested that if
      The Promoter wished to pursue his claim further, he follow
      the contract and file suit in a Turkish court, and that if
      he felt this clause was not binding, that he join the
      Turkish government in submitting the dispute to
      international commercial arbitration through established
      private institutions.  The Promoter refused to accept that
      he had not fulfilled his contract, refused to pursue the
      matter through either of the suggested channels, and again
      demanded early payment.  The Turks paid no further
      attention to him; they were convinced he would lose an
      arbitration and be assessed the costs of arbitration.

    <P>  
           The annual foreign-aid legislation then came before
      the Senate.  To our stupefied surprise, Senator Humphrey
      offered and pushed to adoption an amendment so worded as to
      apply only to The Promoter's claim, to the effect that no
      U.S.  military assistance would be provided to any country
      under the bill as long as claims by an American contractor
      for goods or services already provided had not been met in
      full.  It was further specified that the alleged quality of
      goods/services delivered could not affect the requirement,
      nor could any provisions of a contract providing for means
      of adjudicating or arbitrating the amount claimed.  This
      was called The Humphrey Amendment, and was an object of
      amusement or outrage at State and on Capitol Hill, but was
      never the subject of press inquiry, analysis, or interest. 
      The White House and State queried Humphrey's staff about
      the possibility of a compromise, but were told that if
      Senator Humphrey were to be kept on board the entire
      foreign-aid project, the Amendment must become law.  Our
      own bureau queried the staffs of Senators Fulbright and
      Mansfield to see if they couldn't make Humphrey back off or
      at least compromise.  One of Fulbright's top staffers told
      me that Humphrey, very uncharacteristically, refused to
      discuss the Amendment, except to say that it was a matter
      of principle to avoid the robbing of one of his
      constituents (The Promoter), and that he, the Senator,
      would not change a word of it.  Humphrey's prestige was
      such that he easily beat back the half-hearted move to
      reconsider the Amendment, and the Administration did not
      want to tangle with him over a measly ten million dollars.
<P>
           The bill became law with the Amendment.  Reluctantly
      we told the Turks that deliveries of new material as
      provided in the legislation and as planned by NATO could
      not be made until The Promoter was paid.  The Turks, who
      were as loyal as any ally we had, and Inonu, who had always
      co-operated with us fully, pointed out the effect on the
      Turkish armed forces of the delay of scheduled deliveries,
      and, conversely, the effect on Turkish public opinion as to
      both the U.S.  and Inonu government if the money were paid
      to The Promoter.  There was nothing we could do.  Finally
      Inonu had to ask his Parliament for ten million dollars in
      public funds to pay The Promoter before hundreds of
      millions of dollars worth of NATO materials could be
      delivered.  The Opposition pointed out with gusto the
      overwhelming proof advanced in earlier legal proceedings
      that the project was one of bribery and fraud from the
      beginning, and that the machinery was nothing but scrap. 
      Inonu swallowed the dishonor, got the money, paid The
      Promoter, and got the arms and ammunition.
<P>
           While the legislation was still before the Senate, we
      enlisted the help of a friendly office of the FBI, which had
      helped us in the past, to check The Promoter's background on
      this and earlier deals, in the hope of finding something which
      could be used to influence other Senators.  The world-weary FBI
      man, an old friend, who had conducted most of the search and
      directed it all, came in to tell me that The Promoter was quite
      shady and could be termed a boardroom confidence man, but that
      he had never been convicted -- only a couple of unpursued
      indictments in minor scandals.  As we talked I opined that The
      Promoter just couldn't by himself wield that much influence with
      the Senator -- that there must be a more weighty partner in the
      woodpile.  I asked him if he could, strictly on his own and to
      satisfy my personal curiosity, try to dig up such a partner. 
      The FBI man came in a week or two later, warned me that this
      meeting with me was not occurring, and informed me that there
      was a partner on halves with The Promoter who bought in for a
      pittance during the past year, and that the partner's name was
      the maiden name of Muriel Humphrey.
      <P>
           During the rest of my assignment at State we continued
      to receive the best possible co-operation from Senator
      Humphrey in all other matters, and his personal affability
      was undiminished.  On reflection, and considering the
      common gossip that Humphrey was tragically in debt
      following his primary collision with the Kennedy moneybags,
      I could not work up much indignation against the Senator
      personally.  I saved my indignation for the interface
      between foreign aid and the American political system, and
      slowly began to drift toward the conclusion that any good
      done by foreign aid was outweighed by the damage it caused
      here and abroad.

<P>
      At this point, my friend's narrative ceases.  Permit me to
comment that I have no animus against Hubert Humphrey.  I recount this
episode merely to suggest that even the more genuine of democratic
idols may be found to have feet of clay.  At least Senator Humphrey
needed the money in question.  During the Kennedy and Johnson
Administrations, probably the richest man in the Senate was the most
corrupt of senators:  Kerr of Oklahoma, whose devious enriching ways
are candidly described by his lieutenant, Bobby Baker, in the latter
scoundrel's memoirs.  To perceive how deep in peculation was President
Johnson himself, assisted by his agents Bobby Baker and Billy Sol
Estes, one may turn to the recent memoirs of a Republican of
integrity, Senator Carl Curtis, entitled Forty Years Against the Tide.
<P>
      Doubtless a number of persons present today have read Henry
Adams' novel Democracy.  In that book, an elderly diplomat from
Eastern Europe grows exasperated with a pompous American senator whose
character is suspect.  Baron Jacobi is referring to political
corruption about the year 1870:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
           You Americans believe yourselves to be exempted from
      the operation of general laws.  You care not for
      experience.  I have lived seventy-five years, and all that
      time in the midst of corruption.  I am corrupt myself, only
      I do have the courage to proclaim it, and you others have
      it not.  Rome, Paris, Vienna, Petersburg, London, all are
      corrupt; only Washington is pure!  Well, I declare to you
      that in all my experiences I have found no society which
      has had elements of corruption like the United States.  The
      children in the street are corrupt, and know how to cheat
      me.  The citizens are all corrupt, and also the towns and
      the counties and the States' legislatures and the judges. 
      Everywhere men betray trusts both public and private, steal
      money, run away with public funds.  Only in the Senate men
      take no money.  And you gentlemen in the Senate very well
      declare that your great United States, which is the head of
      the civilized world, can never learn anything from the
      example of corrupt Europe.  You are right -- quite right! 
      The great United States needs not an example.  I do much
      regret that I have not yet one hundred years to live.  If I
      could then come back to this city, I should find myself
      very content -- much more than now.  I am always content
      where there is much corruption, and ma parole d'honneur!" 
      broke out the old man with fire and gesture, "The United
      States will then be more corrupt than Rome under Caligula;
      more corrupt than the Church under Leo X; more corrupt than
      France under the Regent!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Baron Jacobi's prophecy has come to pass, more than a century
later.  Everyone in this room is aware that two very eminent
Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives, last year found it
prudent to resign their seats rather than face expulsion.  Everyone
also knows of the several senators who betrayed their trust in
connection with the savings and loan disaster.  Everyone has read of,
if not experienced, the maladministration of demagogic mayors elected
on the Democratic ticket in certain great cities, Washington
especially.  Corruption is not confined to the Democratic party's
placemen, of course; but corruption seems to have become epidemic in
the Democratic Party during recent decades.
<P>
      Accepting bribes, pocketing public funds, and selling political
influence are not the worst forms of political corruption.  For more
malignant still is that professed political humanitarianism which is
merely a mask for a politician's lust for power and place.  Such
politicians, and they are legion in today's Democratic apparatus,
extemporize flimsy measures that will procure for them an evanescent
popularity.  Senator Carl Curtis tells of a conversation, some years
ago, with a senatorial colleague of this stamp.  That colleague had
been active in the passage of a fiscal bill that in the long run would
be immensely costly -- almost insupportable.  Curtis expostulated on
what would be the consequences thirty years in the future.  "But I
won't be in the Senate when that happens," said his colleague. 
Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.
<P>
      Grim Mistake. My point is this:  the greatest error of the
Democratic Party nowadays is dishonesty.  Here permit me to quote one
of my less-favorite authors, Voltaire:  "It was worse than a crime: 
it was a mistake."  When a Democratic Congress appropriates vast sums
for new federal undertakings, but reproaches the executive branch for
increasing the national debt, the Democrats are dishonest -- as they
are in other great concerns.  Such political hypocrisy is not a crime
for which public men may be indicted; but it is a grim mistake.  For
presently a party that so behaves will be recognized by the public as
a dishonest party, and then its days will be numbered.
<P>
      When Ronald Reagan was re-elected to the presidency by so
overwhelming a majority, I suggested in public addresses that
conceivably the Democratic Party might begin to split into factions
and to follow the Federalist Party and the Whig Party down to dusty
death.  That process may be at work, despite temporary Democratic
majorities in the Congress.  More than the Republicans, the Democrats
have become suspect to a great part of the American public.  They are
suspected of ignoring the national interest.
<P>
      This present decade, just begun, will be a time when the United
States of America must make irrevocable decisions, in affairs domestic
and affairs international.  We would be foolish to fancy that a pax
Americana will settle upon the world.  Rather, our situation is very
like that of Britain just two centuries ago.  As Burke wrote then:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> I despair neither of the public fortune nor of the public
      mind.  There is much to be done undoubtedly, and much to be
      retrieved.  We must walk in new ways, or we can never
      encounter our enemy in his devious march.  We are not at an
      end of our struggle, nor near it.  Let us not deceive
      ourselves; we are at the beginning of great troubles.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Party Reform. Just so.  In our time of troubles, either great
political party requires high prudence, high imagination, high
honesty.  Surely the Bush Administration, which I criticized somewhat
mordantly in the course of my preceding Heritage lecture in this
series, ought to be the object of severe but honest scrutiny by the
opposing Democrats.  There are yet active in the Democratic ranks many
honorable men and women capable of working a party reform.  May they
come forward, for the sake of the Republic!
<P>
      After all, reform is within the power of honest members of the
party.  Here I quote Burke's Thoughts on the Present Discontents once
more:
<P>
     <BLOCKQUOTE> Until a confidence in government is re-established, the
      people ought to be excited to a more strict and detailed
      attention to the conduct of their representatives. 
      Standards for judging more systematically upon their
      conduct ought to be settled in the meetings of counties and
      corporations.  Frequent and correct lists of the voters in
      all important questions ought to be procured.
<P>
      By such means something may be done.  By such means it may
      appear who those are that, by an indiscriminate support of
      all administrations, have totally banished all integrity
      and confidence out of public proceedings; have confounded
      the best men with the worst; and weakened and dissolved,
      instead of strengthening and compacting, the general frame
      of government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      From the precinct and the township upward, conceivably, the
Democratic Party may be chastened and reinvigorated.  Certain
Democratic office-holders need to be taught afresh the old lesson,
"Honesty is the best policy."  In a genuine parliamentary system, at
least two strong and principled parties are required.  A party
dominated by frauds and fantastics cannot long endure.  If the
Democrats fail at reform, some other party, the nature of which cannot
now be predicted, will supplant the Democratic Party.  That is what
happened to the Liberal party in Britain.  Democratic reform lacking,
the American public may be tempted to shout an old Republican partisan
cry:  "Rotten eggs and dead cats are good enough for Democrats!"

      Now that the United States has become, temporarily, the greatest
power in the world, some of us recall an observation, half a century
ago, by the French writer Andre Siegfried:  "The United States is the
only country to have passed from barbarism to decadence without having
known civilization."  At the end of the twentieth century, have
Americans intelligence and imagination sufficient to lead the peoples
of the world?  Indeed, do Americans possess talents sufficient to
maintain their present degree of security and prosperity?
<P>
      These are grave, if not fatal, questions.  Decisions are being
made nowadays, in public policies abroad and at home, that may be
irrevocable.  And it appears that such decisions may be based upon
erroneous assumptions.
  <P>    Therefore I offer you during this year of our Lord one thousand
nine hundred and ninety-one, ladies and gentlemen, a series of four
lectures on the general topic "Political Errors at the End of the
Twentieth Century."  My first lecture, to be delivered to you this
very day, is entitled "Republican Errors"; the second, this spring,
will be "Democratic Errors"; the third, in summer or fall, will be
"International Errors"; the concluding one, "The Politics of Reality,"
when I will suggest some paths to truth in public policy.
<P>
      I commence with an examination of the state of mind and heart in
America's two great political parties; and of the two, I venture first
to touch upon certain errors prevalent in the Republican Party.  I
have known various Republican presidents, presidential candidates,
members of Congress, governors, and other party leaders, all the way
from Herbert Hoover to my friend and neighbor, John Engler, very
recently elected governor of Michigan against heavy odds:  From time
to time I have had a hand in their campaigns, especially in those of
Senator Goldwater.  I was on cordial terms with President Nixon and
President Reagan.  My wife and I succeeded in reconciling the several
factions of the Republican Party in Michigan, on the eve of the
national convention which chose Mr.  Bush as the party's nominee for
the presidency.  So you will understand, ladies and gentlemen, that in
my lamenting of the present state of Republican leadership in
Washington, I am more moved by sorrow than by wrath.
<P>
      Stolid Party. During this twentieth century the Republican Party
has been more stolid than imaginative.  It has attracted public
support by its appearance of practicality, its defense of private
property and of a competitive economy, its reluctance -- most of the
time -- to embark upon adventures abroad.  Although praised as the
party of industry and business, also, at least in my Michigan
backwoods, Republicans were the representatives of the rural interest. 
In short, it has been a broad-based party which, in recent decades,
has made considerable gains in the region that used to be the Solid
South.  Of presidents taking office since World War II, five have been
Republican, three Democratic.  The tremendous margins of victory
enjoyed by Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush in their
presidential campaigns seemed to suggest that the Republican Party
might sweep away the Democratic Party within a few years, as long
before the Federalist Party, and the Whig, had gone to the wall.
<P>
      Yet the Republican Party, which achieved its greatest vigor in
this century during the presidential terms of Ronald Reagan, now seems
in the sere and yellow leaf.  Permit me to discuss with you, for a
quarter of an hour, the domestic errors of the Republican national
administration, and then to examine, for the second quarter of an
hour, that administration's blunders in foreign policy.
<P>
      My task with respect to the fiscal measures of the Bush
Administration is made the easier for me by Dr.  Edwin Feulner's
"State of Conservatism, 1991" message, entitled "Fashionably Out of
Fashion Again."  I concur heartily in his observation that "after more
than eight years of steady growth, a combination of new federal taxes,
out-of control spending increasing, and suffocating regulatory burdens
have conspired to send the economy into spasms."  Federal expenditure
soon will exceed a quarter of the gross national product; the deficits
for the present fiscal year and for the fiscal year 1992 will be the
largest in the history of the United States.  The reforms of income
tax and inheritance tax, worked in the Reagan years, are undone.  As
socialism dissolves in Eastern Europe, in the United States, an
unofficial and unproclaimed form of socialism gains ground. 
<P>
      Why has this come to pass?  Why does a national administration
elected on a conservative platform offer such feeble resistance to
measures advocated by doctrinaire liberals.
<P>
      "Rockefeller Republicans."  Why, one ought not to blame Mr. 
Bush unduly.  When he stood for the Republican presidential nomination
against Mr.  Reagan in 1980, of necessity he turned for support to the
liberal wing of the Republican Party.  That wing had insufficient
strength to secure him the nomination; but in the course of the
contest he acquired advisors and helpers best classified as
"Rockefeller Republicans."  Those people, some of them eminent, are at
his side still, and have his ear.
<P>
      An anecdote will illustrate my point.  While, in 1988, Mr.  Bush
was campaigning vigorously, I was invited to confer with an inner
circle of his staff, in Washington.  Mr.  Bush was busy elsewhere, but
kindly telephoned me during the course of the discussion.  One of the
pieces of advice I had offered to the Bush people there was to
emphasize Mr.  Bush's opposition to abortion-on-demand; I said he has
consistently advocated the sound policy of returning the abortion
question to the police powers of the several states.  My remark was
received with an embarrassed silence; clearly some people present very
much favored abortion.  A little later I pointed out that in national
publicity, the Bush campaign should refer repeatedly to Mr.  Bush's
conservatism.
<P>
      "What has he done that's conservative?"  inquired, perhaps
rhetorically, a Young Lion of the Bush.  I might have pointed to his
intelligently conservative years in the House of Representatives, but
contented myself at the moment by suggesting that others present might
know Mr.  Bush's principal views and utterances better than I did. 
Some of Mr.  Bush's people there present in the headquarters shivered
at that dread word "conservative."
<P>
      I am suggesting that all presidents, in some degree, are held
captive by the inner circles of the Executive Force, their own
Executive Force.  I doubt whether President Bush himself inclined
initially to the fiscal measures that presently he accepted; but those
close about him persuaded him of the need for such damaging
concessions to liberals' demands.
<P>
      Now the Republican Party long boasted of its frugality.  The
Bush Administration, on the contrary, has stolen some of the
Democrats' old clothes while the sons of Jefferson and Jackson were
out bathing.  But those purloined garments are ragged; and Republicans
look odd and unconvincing when clad in them. 
<P>
      Oppressive Taxation. With respect to a sharp increase in the
level of taxes, it seems as if the Bush Administration really does not
understand the principle of diminishing returns, or know the history
of the consequences of excessive taxation.  When computing our federal
income tax very recently, my wife and I discovered that more than half
our gross income is taken in taxation -- federal income tax; Social
Security taxes; state income taxes; village, township, and county
taxes, school property tax; sales taxes.  And we are not of the number
of Franklin Roosevelt's "malefactors of great wealth."  We are in the
process of educating four young daughters, paying off mortgages,
trying to save something for one's declining years -- I, being
seventy-two years of age already -- and contributing to charitable
causes.  Yet we are better off than many taxpayers.  What straw will
break the camel's back?
<P>
      A state that annually exacts in taxes half of a citizen's income
is more oppressive, financially, than the despotisms of old.  In the
ancient monarchies of China, a tax load of more than ten percent would
have been thought unjust.  Excessive taxation is a major cause of the
decline and fall of great states:  so writes C.  Northcote Parkinson,
the author of Parkinson's Law, in his last book.
<P>
      "Taxation, taken to the limit and beyond, has always been a sign
of decadence and a prelude to disaster," as Parkinson puts it.  "For
government expenditure is the chief cause of inflation and is also the
means of government interference in commercial, industrial, and social
life.  Where evil has been averted it has normally been from lack of
funds.  Where evil has been done it was usually because the
perpetrators had money to spend."
<P>
      Billion Dollars Daily.  The Bush Administration had one handsome
prospect for reducing governmental expenditure, reducing the federal
deficit, and possibly even making a gesture at reduction of the
federal debt:  that is, the prospective contraction of the armed
forces, what with the dwindling of the Soviet menace.  Instead, Mr. 
Bush has plunged the United States into a war which, so far, has cost
about a billion dollars a day.  (You will recall that a billion
dollars is a thousand million dollars.) Already, more taxation to pay
for this struggle in the Levant is being discussed in Washington.  So
I quote Parkinson once more:  "Taxes become heavier in time of war and
should diminish, by rights, when the war is over.  That is not,
however, what happens.  Although sometimes lowered when the war ends,
taxes seldom regain their pre-war level.  That is because the level of
expenditure rises to meet the war-time level of taxation."
<P>
      Unless the Bush Administration abruptly reverses its fiscal and
military course, I suggest, the Republican Party must lose its former
good repute for frugality, and become the party of profligate
expenditure, "butter and guns."  And public opinion would not long
abide that.  Nor would America's world influence and America's
remaining prosperity.
<P>
      But, time running on, I must turn to affairs diplomatic and
military:  Republican errors internationally.  What are we to say of
Mr.  Bush's present endeavor to bring to pass a gentler, kinder New
World Order?
<P>
      Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon
Johnson were enthusiasts for American domination of the world.  Now
George Bush appears to be emulating those eminent Democrats.  When the
Republicans, once upon a time, nominated for the presidency a "One
World" candidate, Wendell Willkie, they were sadly trounced.  In
general, Republicans throughout the twentieth century have been
advocates of prudence and restraint in the conduct of foreign affairs.
<P>
      But Mr.  Bush, out of mixed motives, has embarked upon a radical
course of intervention in the region of the Persian Gulf.  After
carpet-bombing the Cradle of Civilization as no country ever had been
bombed before, Mr.  Bush sent in hundreds of thousands of soldiers to
overrun the Iraqi bunkers -- that were garrisoned by dead men,
asphyxiated.
<P>
      And for what reason?  The Bush Administration found it difficult
to answer that question clearly.  In the beginning it was implied that
the American national interest required low petroleum prices: 
therefore, if need be, smite and spare not!
<P>
      That excuse reminds me of Burke's rebuke to the Pitt ministry in
1795, when it appeared that the British government was about to go to
war with France over the question of the navigation of the River
Scheldt, in the Netherlands.  "A war for the Scheldt?  A war for a
chamber-pot!"  Burke exclaimed.  Now one may say, "A war for Kuwait? 
A war for an oilcan!"
<P>
      "The blood of a man should never be shed but to redeem the blood
of man," Burke wrote in his first Letter on a Regicide Peace.  "It is
well shed for our family, for our friends, for our God, for our
country, for our kind.  The rest is vanity; the rest is crime."  Burke
was eager that England declare war against France because of the
menace of the French revolutionaries to the civilized order of Europe,
and because of their systematic crimes.  But he set his face against
war for mere commercial advantage.  So should Republicans.  "The rest
is vanity; the rest is crime."
<P>
      War for Righteousness. A war for an oilcan not turning out to be
popular, however, President Bush turned moralist; he professed to be
engaged in redeeming the blood of man; and his breaking of Iraq is to
be the commencement of his beneficent New World Order.  Mr.  Bush has
waged what Sir Herbert Butterfield, in his little book Christianity,
Diplomacy, and War, calls "The War for Righteousness."  As Butterfield
begins the third chapter of that book, "It has been held by
technicians of politics in recent times that democracies can only be
keyed up to modern war -- only brought to the necessary degree of
fervor -- provided they are whipped into moral indignation and heated
to fanaticism by the thought that they are engaged in a 'war for
righteousness'." 
<P>
      Now indubitably Saddam Hussein is unrighteous; but so are nearly
all the masters of the "emergent" African states (with the Ivory Coast
as a rare exception), and so are the grim ideologues who rule China,
and the hard men in the Kremlin, and a great many other public figures
in various quarters of the world.  Why, I fancy that there are some
few unrighteous men, conceivably, in the domestic politics of the
United States.  Are we to saturation-bomb most of Africa and Asia into
righteousness, freedom, and democracy?  And, having accomplished that,
however would we ensure persons yet more unrighteous might not rise up
instead of the ogres we had swept away?  Just that is what happened in
the Congo, remember, three decades ago; and nowadays in Zaire, once
called the Belgian Congo, we zealously uphold with American funds the
dictator Mobutu, more blood-stained than Saddam.  And have we
forgotten Castro in Cuba?
<P>
      Momentum of Its Own. I doubt whether much good is going to come
out of the slaughter of perhaps a hundred thousand people in Iraq. 
"For one of the troubles of war," Butterfield writes, "is that it
acquires its own momentum and plants its own ideals on our shoulders,
so that we are carried far away from the purposes with which we began
-- carried indeed sometimes to greater acts of spoilation than the
ones which had provoked our original entry into the war.  Before the
war of 1914 had lasted a year, its own workings had generated such a
mood that we had promised Russia Constantinople and had bought the
alliance of Italy with offers of booty, some of which had later to be
disavowed by President Wilson.  And it is a remarkable fact that in
wars which purport to be so ethical that the states attached to
neutrality are sometimes regarded as guilty of a dereliction of duty,
the great powers primarily concerned may have required an iniquitous
degree of bribery to bring them into the conflict, or to maintain
their fidelity.  The whole ideal of moderate peace aims, and the whole
policy of making war the servant (instead of the master) of
negotiation, is impossible -- and the whole technique of the 'war for
righteousness' has a particularly sinister application -- when even in
the ostensibly 'defending' party there is a latent and concealed
aggressiveness of colossal scope, as there certainly was in 1914."
<P>
      You may perceive some parallels between Butterfield's
description of the course of the Allies during World War I and the
course, so far, of the coalition against Iraq.  Already there is talk
of what shall be done with the "remains of Iraq."  Mr.  James Baker
talks of rebuilding Iraq; others talk of dismantling Iraq altogether,
by way of spoilation.  And what promises and bribes were provided by
the government of the United States, in recent months, to secure the
assent of such murderous governments as that of Ethiopia to strong
measures against Iraq; to secure, indeed, by holding out prospects of
massive economic aid, the cooperation of the Soviet Union, Iraq's
former patron?
<P>
      Was not Egypt's cooperation obtained by forgiving the Egyptian
government's indebtedness of several billion dollars?  Was not Syria's
assent gained by America's ignoring of the Syrian conquest of the
Lebanon, with a massacre of General Aoun's Christian army?  What began
as determination to restore a legitimate (if somewhat arbitrary)
government in Kuwait may result in the overturn of several governments
in the Levant.  As for regarding neutral states as guilty of
dereliction of duty -- why, the United States has done just that to
Jordan, by cutting off economic aid at the very time when Jordan is
crammed with destitute refugees from Iraq.
<P>
      Disagreeable Consequences.  In short, deliberate entry into war
commonly brings on consequences disagreeable even to the seeming
victors.  Prudent statesmen long have known that armed conflict, for
all involved, ought to be the last desperate resort, to be entered
upon only when all means of diplomacy, conciliation, and compromise
have been exhausted.  In Iraq, we have crushed an insect with the club
of Hercules.  Temporarily, Mr.  Bush's stroke is popular.  When a
democracy goes to war, at first there occurs a wave of enthusiasm: 
"Bop the Wop; sap the Jap; get the Hun on the run!"  But afterward,
when troubles arise.... 
<P>
      True, we did not suffer a long war in the deserts of Kuwait and
Iraq.  But we must expect to suffer during a very long period of
widespread hostility toward the United States -- even, or perhaps
especially, from the people of certain states that America bribed or
bullied into combining against Iraq.
<P>
      In Egypt, in Syria, in Pakistan, in Algeria, in Morocco, in all
of the world of Islam, the masses now regard the United States as
their arrogant adversary; while the Soviet Union, by virtue of its
endeavors to mediate the quarrel in its later stages, may pose again
as the friend of Moslem lands.  Nor is this all:  for now, in every
continent, the United States is resented increasingly as the last and
most formidable of imperial systems.
<P>
      In this century, great empires have collapsed:  the Austrian,
the German, the British, the French, the Dutch, the Portuguese, the
Spanish, the Italian, and the Japanese.  The Soviet empire now
languishes in the process of dissolution.  "Imperialism" has become a
term of bitter reproach and complaint; all this within my own
lifetime.
<P>
      American Empire.  But there remains an American Empire, still
growing -- though expanding through the acquisition of client states,
rather than through settlement of American populations abroad.  Among
the client states directly dependent upon American military power are
Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Israel, and El Salvador; and until the
withdrawal of American divisions from Germany for service in Arabia,
Germany, too, was a military client.  Dependent upon American
assistance of one kind or another, and in some degree upon American
military protection, are the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, and
Panama; and also, in the Levant, Egypt and Jordan, and formerly
Lebanon.  Now Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are added to the roster of
clients.  I hardly need mention America's earlier acquisitions: 
Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgins, and lesser islands.  I refrain from
mentioning America's economic ascendancy, through foreign aid or
merely trade, over a great deal more of the world.  In short, although
we never talk about our empire, a tremendous American Empire has come
into existence -- if, like the Roman Empire, in a kind of fit of
absence of mind.  No powerful counterpoise to the American hegemony
seems to remain, what with the enfeebling of the U.S.S.R.
<P>
      Such a universal ascendancy always has been resented by the
lesser breeds without the law.  Soon there sets to work a widespread
impulse to pull down the imperial power.  But that imperial power,
strong in weapons, finds it possible for a time to repress the
disobedient.  In the long run -- well, as Talleyrand put it, "You can
do everything with bayonets -- except sit on them."  In the long run,
the task of repression is too painful a burden to bear; so the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union has discovered in the past few
years.  Napoleon discovered that hard truth earlier and King George
III and the King's Friends discovered it between the years 1775 and
1781.  Doubtless George Bush means well by the world near the end of
the twentieth century.  He is a man of order, diligent, dutiful,
honest, and a good family man.  But he lacks imagination, "the vision
thing."  And power intoxicates; and, as Lord Acton put it, power tends
to corrupt.  The love of power tends to corrupt both speech and
actions.  It may corrupt a grave national undertaking into a personal
vendetta.  It may corrupt what began as a chivalric rescue into a
heavy belligerent domination.  (Talk continues to come to our ears of
a "permanent American presence" in the Persian Gulf.)
<P>
      President Bush and Americans of his views doubtless intend the
American hegemony to be gentler and kinder than the sort of hegemony
that prevailed in the ancient Persian Empire, say; more just even than
the Roman hegemony that gave peace, for some centuries, to several
lands -- relative peace, anyway, at the price of crushing taxation and
the extinction of earlier cultures.  But devastating Iraq (and the
rescued Kuwait) is an uncompromising way of opening an era of
sweetness and light.  Peoples so rescued from tyrants might cry, as
did the boy whom Don Quixote de la Mancha had saved from beating by
the muleteers but who was thrashed by them not long later,
nevertheless -- "In the name of God, Don Jorge de la Casablanca, don't
rescue me again!"
<P>
      Don Jorge de la Casablanca has toppled and imprisoned one
Central American despot -- somewhat small fry -- and is in the process
of dealing after the same fashion with one Mesopotamian despot,
somewhat larger fry.  "Well done!"  some cry.  It has all been rather
like deer hunting in my Michigan back woods.
<P>
      Yet presidents of the United States must not be encouraged to
make Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace, nor to fancy that they can
establish a New World Order through eliminating dissenters.  In the
second century before Christ, the Romans generously liberated the
Greek city-states from the yoke of Macedonia.  But it was not long
before the Romans felt it necessary to impose upon those quarrelsome
Greeks a domination more stifling to Hellenic freedom and culture than
ever Macedon had been.  It is a duty of the Congress of the United
States to see that great American Caesars do not act likewise.
<P>
      Echo of 1984.  If that duty is forgotten, before many years are
out we may receive such television communications as follows.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
      The voice from the telescreen paused.  A trumpet call,
      clear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air.  The
      voice continued raspingly:
<P>
      "Attention!  Your attention please!  A newsflash has this
      moment arrived from the Malabar front.  Our forces in South
      India have won a glorious victory.  I am authorized to say
      that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war
      within a measurable distance of its end.  Here is the
      newsflash -- "
<P>
      Bad news coming, thought Winston.  And sure enough,
      following a gory description of the annihilation of a
      Eurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and
      prisoners, came the announcement that, as of next week, the
      chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grams to
      twenty.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

      Perhaps you have already recognized the preceding passage from
Orwell's 1984.  Orwell describes our world of 1991, too.  Perpetual
War for Perpetual Peace comes to pass in an era of Righteousness --
that is, national or ideological self-righteousness in which the
public is persuaded that "God is on our side," and that those who
disagree should be brought here before the bar as war criminals.
<P>
      I shall have more to say about such concerns in my Third
Heritage lecture this year.  Just now I conclude my thoughts on
Republican errors by suggesting that it would be ruinous for the
Republicans to convert themselves into a party of high deeds in
distant lands and higher taxes on the home front.  Such a New World
Order, like the Pax Romana, might create a wilderness and call it
peace; at best, it would reduce the chocolate ration from thirty grams
to twenty.  And in the fullness of time, the angry peoples of the
world would pull down the American Empire, despite its military
ingenuity and its protestations of kindness and gentleness -- even as
the Soviet Empire is being pulled down today, thanks be to God.

<P>
Our friend Russell Kirk, &quot;The Wizard of Mecosta,&quot; seemed
an ill-suited visitor to Washington back in 1978. He was accompanied
by his loving wife Annette, and he shared with a packed auditorium
some of the truths that made his published works so powerful and
so influential.
<P>
Then sixty years old, Russell Kirk was not a newcomer to Washington,
and yet he was certainly not a part of this unreal, political
place.
<P>
Despite his visits here in subsequent years, Russell Kirk was
always more comfortable surrounded by his family and his books
in Mecosta. He was at home among inquisitive students on one of
the college campuses where he held visiting appointments or where
he lectured.
<P>
Despite his discomfort, however, he made a real impact on Washington.
In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists,
legislators and staffers of prudence and of taking the long view.
<P>
It was at an I.S.I.-sponsored seminar, more than thirty years
ago over the Christmas holidays, that I first met Dr. Kirk. He
was already a fixed star in the conservative firmament. Although
he has described himself in those days as &quot;roly-poly and
benign,&quot; all of us students were in awe of him.
<P>
Had we known that he was an occasional eater of beaver and an
habitual smoker of &quot;dark, thick,&quot; Burmese cigars, &quot;looking
and tasting . . . Like torpedoes,&quot; we probably would have
addressed him with even greater trepidation. Yet, as he talked
with a small group of us on that frosty night in Detroit I could
not project that twenty years later Russell Kirk would be a Heritage
Distinguished Fellow and that three of his books would be based
on lectures that he first delivered here.
<P>
Over the years, Russell's Washington lecture themes would include
natural law, the prospects for conservatives, and individual rights.
They are masterpieces of clear thought and eternal truth.
<P>
These volumes and his other works mean that Russell Kirk's influence
in Washington will continue to be far greater than many
of the transient politicians who descend upon this city, cycle
after cycle.
<P>
As a back row observer at his soirees for the last sixteen years,
I never ceased to be amazed by the inevitable overflow crowd of
young people who couldn't get enough of him.
<P>
I asked one of them what his hold was on them. Her reply: &quot;I
had only admired him from afar and, of course, reading his books
at my university was not politically correct.&quot; Or, as a young
Reagan appointee said, &quot;He taught us all why our role was
important beyond ourselves and beyond politics.&quot;
<P>
Russell Kirk's operating guide was prudence and what Patrick Henry
called &quot;the lamp of experience,&quot; which abhorred all
forms of ideology claiming some instant substitute for genuine
tradition, custom, and experience.
<P>
He often described himself as a &quot;Bohemian Tory.&quot; A Bohemian
Tory who adapted to his environment, whether this meant a humble
cellar, a rustic cabin, a city mansion, or one of the great country
houses of Europe.
<P>
From time to time here in Washington, Russell was entertained,
feted, or downright idolized. While he seemed to enjoy this, his
heart belonged to Mecosta.
<P>
Russell Kirk has left an indelible mark on us, on Washington,
and on our nation. Perhaps his words have more meaning for us
today because, as one of his friends, T.S. Eliot puts it:
<P>
&quot;The communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond
the language of the living.&quot;<A NAME="gleaves"></A>
<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Gleaves Whitney<BR>

The Honorable John Engler, Governor of Michigan</CENTER></b>
<p>
 Russell
Kirk once wrote: &quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle,
to suffer, to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors
and in themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love. They
are put into this world to live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
By his own measure, Russell Kirk lived a robust and manly life,
and he died a noble and manly death.
<P>
Let it be said at the outset--without hesitation and without qualification--Russell
Kirk was a great man. His work will stand as one of the most significant
intellectual achievements of our time. That is because he understood
our time. Before his most famous book, <i>The Conservative Mind</i>,
was accepted for publication, Russell Kirk wrote a letter to Henry
Regnery, saying: This work is &quot;my contribution to our endeavor
to conserve the spiritual and intellectual and political tradition
of our civilization; and if we a e to rescue the modem mind we
must do it very soon . . .The struggle will be decided in the
minds of the rising generation.&quot;
<P>
There can be no doubt that Russell Kirk reached many minds-- and
touched many hearts--over the last four decades. His words coursed
over the continents and across the generations. He touched us
not just because of what he said, but how he said it. This &quot;Bohemian
Tory,&quot; this &quot;Canny Scot,&quot; possessed an excellent
ear for the language, and his readers felt all the force of his
personality in his prose.
<P>
And then there were the many personal qualities that endeared
Russell Kirk to us. He was a loyal friend and a faithful correspondent.
Who could forget his keen wit, those fantastic ghost stories,
and that mischievous twinkle in his eyes? He was devoted to his
family--a wonderful family so many of us have come to know: his
lovely wife Annette, their four beautiful daughters, his sons-in-law,
and the larger family. For years they have opened their arms to
us, as today we open our arms to them.
<P>
Russell Kirk had an uncommonly generous spirit--a spirit that
never flagged, but gave tirelessly. It is evident in his letters
and lectures, his books and conversation. Weakened though he was
toward the end of his life, Dr. Kirk's last public gesture was
to sign books from his bed, because he knew how much that would
mean to his readers
and friends. The last book he signed, just a week before his passing,
vas to Governor Engler.
<P>
Russell Kirk was very much a Michigan man--one of us. We can imagine
him as a young boy, reading historical adventures by the train
yards in Plymouth where his father worked. We can think of him
as a gifted teacher at his alma mater, Michigan State. We can
see him walking out of that drafty old library at Piety Hill and
turning down the road which leads to the woods.
<P>
Russell loved Michigan. Recently his heart made its final journey
back to the &quot;stump country&quot; that he called his ancestral
home, to return to the land that shaped him. But his spirit now
knows its true and eternal home. And the wisdom in his writings
will remain to help those of us still on this earthly pilgrimage.
Indeed, for generations to come, his words will find a resting
place wherever there is right reason, and wherever there is a
heart in search of the Permanent Things.
<P>
Today we mourn. We have lost a friend. Michigan has lost its preeminent
man of letter. America has lost one of the men who understood
her best. We mourn, but Russell would not want us to become too
melancholy this day. In the epilogue of his memoirs, which he
recently composed and which will be published next year, Russell
Kirk tells us that he lived a good life. At the age of seventy-five,
he says that what he sought in life had come down to three things.
<P>
First, he had sought to defend the Permanent Things -- truth, justice,
freedom, a tolerable moral order and in so doing he was more successful
than he thought would be possible at the outset of his career.
<P>
Second, he had sought to lead a life of decent independence, living
much as his ancestors had lived, on their land, in circumstances
that would enable him to utter the truth and make his voice heard:
a life uncluttered and unpolluted, not devoted to getting and
spending. This, he tells us, he had achieved as a man of letters
at Piety Hill.
<P>
Third, he had sought to marry for love and to rear children who
would come to know that the service of God is perfect freedom.
Words cannot express how filled with gratitude he was for Annette
and his children, who are endowed with the unbought grace of life.
In this, too, he had been wonderfully blessed.
<P>
To Russell Kirk, the three goals of his life had been reached,
and he was grateful. And we who are here today can be grateful
that we knew him, and that he walked a little distance with us
in our journey to our eternal home.<A NAME="pat"></A>
<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Pat Buchanan<BR>
Founder and Chairman <BR>
The American Cause</CENTER></b><p> We are here today to mourn the passing
of a wonderful friend, and to celebrate a great life, that of
Dr. Russell Kirk, Patriarch of Piety Hill, Sage of Mecosta, gentle
giant of American conservatism. And, I am proud and honored to
add, leader of the Buchanan Brigades in the Michigan primary of
'92.
<P>
In 1953, when Dr. Kirk's seminal work, The Conservative Mind,
appeared In a desert of liberal orthodoxy, it was celebrated,
not only here but across the West. For the wise men of the age
were aware something new had been born, a genuine conservative
movement, and Russell Kirk was its father. His was the spark that
set fire to the minds of so many of my generation.
<P>
For forty years, Dr. Kirk wrote his columns and commentaries,
essays, and stories, books and reviews- a treasure house of work
that now becomes part of the deposit of faith--of the cause in
which we believe. And his books will be read and reread and cherished,
when most of what his contemporaries published is long since forgotten.
Why?
<P>
Because Russell Kirk wrote not only for his time, but for all
time. He was the custodian, the caretaker of &quot;The Permanent
Things&quot;, the eternal truths that do not change. All his life
he wielded his pen to expose the false gods of modernity, and
in particular, the false god of ideology.
<P>
To Dr. Kirk, ideology, whether of Left or Right, was something
that took possession of a soul that was empty. &quot;Ideology,&quot;
he wrote, &quot;provides sham religion . . . comforting in its
way to those who have lost or never have known genuine religious
faith.&quot;
<P>
When Dr. Kirk discovered this heresy in the camp of the saints,
he used a needle to winkle it out. A few years back when the ideology
of democracy was being exalted to the status of high dogma, he
wrote, &quot;A trouble with this civil-religion notion is that
the large majority of Americans think they already have a religion
of their own, not one cobbled up by some department in Washington.&quot;
<P>
When some great minds arose in our midst to declare The End of
History, Dr. Kirk merrily laughed. Because he knew more history
than all of them put together; and because he knew that the seedbed
of conflicts and war lay in the human heart, which is unchanged
and unchanging, save through grace.
<P>
As the presence here today of Russell Kirk's wife and four daughters
so beautifully testifies, Russell Kirk did not simply preach the
values of family and faith, he lived them. He not only wrote of
the search for truth, he persevered all his life; and when he
came upon the truth in the Roman Catholic Church, Russell Kirk
embraced it. This was a man, whole and entire, whose hierarchy
of values were in perfect order and synchronization, as are the
planets in God's heaven that circle the sun. And because his values
were in harmony, Dr. Kirk was one off the most genuinely, visibly
happy men I have ever met.
<P>
I recall the last time we met, in Philadelphia near midnight for
a drink after a speech; Annette and Dr. Kirk invited me out to
Piety Hill, to see the library in which he took such joy.
<P>
And, upon occasion, Dr. Kirk would undertake my instruction.
<P>
After listening to me propound the latest economic nostrum for
America's ills, this gentle teacher sent me a slim book that contained
his own introduction: &quot;I have regarded with some suspicion
many practitioners of the Dismal Science,&quot; Dr. Kirk had written.
&quot;I have found economists a blindered breed, worshipping the
false god, Efficiency.&quot;
<P>
Dr. Kirk believed in a market economy, but all his life he fought
this Cult of Efficiency--because it dehumanized man; and because
he knew there is a higher order of things in God's universe, ruled
by a law higher even than the law of supply and demand.
<P>
If today a man should ask me what is conservatism, I would tell
him: Read Russell Kirk. He endures; he speaks to the ages of what
it means to be one of us.
<P>
If there is an image I will carry with me all my days of Dr. Kirk,
it is the image of the loving father of the Prodigal Son, the
father who; nightly, walks to the edge of his estate to look to
the horizon to see if his wandering boy is ever coming home again.
And when the son appears, disheveled, having squandered his patrimony
chasing after the fads and follies of the age, the gentle father,
never reproachful, rejoices to take his son back home.
<P>
He was that--to us.
<P>
&quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle, to suffer,
to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors, and in
themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love,&quot; Russell
Kirk wrote forty years ago. &quot;They are put in this world to
live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
A brave man all his life, Russell Kirk died like a man, passing
away in the arms of the wife and daughters he loved. <i>Ave atque vale</i>,
my friend.<A NAME="russell"></A>
<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Russell Hittinger<BR>
Professor, Department of Philosophy <BR>
The Catholic University of America</b></CENTER><p> In <i>The Roots of American
Order</i>, Russell wrote: &quot;Whatever America's incertitudes today,
it is difficult to find American citizens who can sketch any convincing
ideal new order as an alternative to the one long rooted here.&quot;
This sentence was aimed particularly at the malcontents of the
1960s. But it might just as well have been aimed at all of us;
especially those of us who work in universities, think tanks,
and newspapers. Who among us knows so much as to offer the prospect
of any &quot;convincing&quot; alternative to an order long rooted
in the experience of a people? Our answer to this question will
determine how we understand the word &quot;conservative.&quot;</B>
<P>
We know how Russell Kirk answered the question. To his eternal
credit, he did not impart to this movement the name &quot;Kirkianism.&quot;
When he wrote <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, he certainly did not suggest
that the &quot;mind&quot; was his own. The whole point of the
book was to have the reader draw quite the opposite conclusion.
The permanent things are not known by merely one mind or party;
thanks to the gift of culture, they are known by many minds. Whether
we speak of culture in its moral and religious sense, or culture
in terms of liberty and economic markets, the conservative believes
that the kind of social order worth living in most certainly is
not something vouchsafed exclusively to a privileged class of
theorists.
<P>
Russell Kirk kept a distance, both spiritual and geographical,
from the institutions of the elite. He did most of his thinking
and writing outside of the academy. While it seems at least paradoxical
to say this about a conservative, he needed no institutional credentials
to certify his ideas. It was enough for him to call upon the authority
Cicero, Burke, and John Randolph of Roanoke. He certainly kept
a distance from the imperial institutions of this city. Except
for two terms as Justice of the Peace in Morton Township, Mecosta
County, Michigan, Russell never held public office.
<P>
Nonetheless, he had the chief virtue of a public man: he regarded
cultural order as a gift, even if it had been neglected and despoiled
by the age. One might think that it was a great misfortune for
him to have lived in our time, with its rejection of authority
and its rejection of the vicarious communion of the living with
the dead. Russell was, of course, duly critical of the age.
<P>
But criticism was rarely his first word, and never his last. 1
recall the first time I met him, during one of his annual seminars
at Piety Hill. I never, by the way, met a man of his prominence
who spent such time with young people, especially college undergraduates.
That year he was considering the subject, &quot;Is Virtue Teachable?&quot;
After citing all of the classical authorities, and making every
argument (pro and con) of which we were capable, we retired to
the living room on the final evening, whereupon Russell told ghost
stories. I returned more than once to these annual affairs in
Mecosta, and I can assure you that the ghosts always had the final
word.
<P>
When we consider the life of Russell Kirk, we may ask ourselves:
Can a virtuous man be happy in a decadent time? Aristotle said
of Priam's misfortunes: &quot;A truly good and intelligent person
will bear strokes of fortune suitably, and from his resources
at any time will do the finest actions, just as a . . . good shoemaker
will produce the finest shoe from the leather given him . . .
If this is so, then the happy person could never become miserable.&quot;
<P>
And so it was with Russell Kirk. &quot;Happiness,&quot; he concluded
in <i>The Roots of American Order</i>, is first expressed in &quot;gratitude.&quot;
Gratitude is found neither in sadness nor in protest, but in &quot;restoring
and improving the order of the soul and the order of the republic.&quot;
<P>
For his piety, for his example, for his paternal solicitude for
his students, and above all for his sanity, we will miss him.
But we. are grateful for his extraordinary defense of the ordinary,
civilizing virtues.<A NAME="irving"></A>
<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Irving Louis Horowitz<BR>
Professor of Sociology and Political Science<BR>
Rutgers University</b></CENTER><p> It would be futile, not to say frustrating,
to try summarizing Russell Kirk's life and work in a few well
chosen words. Russell him self was wise enough to leave for paradise
ultimate summaries and judgments. He understood that our world
was comprised, if not shrouded, in mystery and paradox; and hence
in need of dispositions not dogmas. He lived his extraordinary
life accordingly.
<P>
He was a huge public presence with a private life that remained
ever intact. He was a man who wrote fiercely, but who yet managed
to speak softly. Russell gave substance to a movement floundering
in search of theory, and yet only episodically participated in
partisan politics. He was as dedicated to what Veblen called the
higher learning with an unmatched ferocity, and yet chose the
life of what Mannheim called the <i>freischwebende Inelligenz</i> -- 
or loosely translated, the free-wheeling intellect. He was a political
philosopher in the strictest, Burkean, sense of the word, and
yet could produce ghost I stories and aphoristic works with equal
aplomb and ease. And yes, he was Catholic in the exacting sense
of that word, and yet fully able to register a catholicity that
knew no boundaries of religion or culture.
<P>
In short, he was one of us: a human being with aspirations no
less than accomplishments. His conservatism was ample enough to
take the measure of man as a complex bundle of twine; touched
by original sin but in search of ultimate redemption, and filled
with such tumult as to make possible an appreciation of order.
But having said this, one must add a qualifier: Russell did not
use paradox as a mechanism for avoiding decisions or skirting
issues. Better than nearly any I person I have ever known, he
took forthright positions on basic ques tions. For Russell, what
ought to be is at least as important as what is in the conduct
of human affairs.
<P>
I take this passion for the political as his secret war against
empiricism and for moralism. He was at heart, an essayist. He
loved preparing introductions to his favorite contemporary authors:
Irving Babbitt, Christopher Dawson, William H. Mallock, John Randolph,
Forrest McDonald, Donald Davidson, Wilhelm Roepke, Victor Kravchenko, Louis deBonald, George Scott-Moncrieff -- to name some of
them. They spoke at levels that provided meaning without fueling
animus.
<P>
I suspect that this opportunity to dialogue with his friends and
mentors of ages past no less than times present was a large part
of Russell's reason for sponsoring the Library of Conservative
Thought a series wthich has brought such distinction to Transaction,
 no less than pleasure to its readers. He shared with Montaigne
the deep belief that the essay form was that most amenable to
give I expression to ethical considerations. If this made him
at times appear I avuncular, it was a small price to pay for giving
intellectual shape to the struggles of our century and our nation.
<P>
Russell's life spanned much of the century: he knew many victories,
and suffered defeats as well. He handled both ends of the public
spectrum with equal equanimity. I suspect that the warmth of his
private life above all, his unabashed love and beaming pride of
his wife and four daughters allowed him to put into perspective
any indignities, and put into practice his belief in the values
of family, tradition, and faith. There was a seamless movement
from the private to the public that gave an informed unity of
purpose to his life.
<P>
In the short few weeks since his death, I have received many encomiums
about the Library of Conservative Thought. Several of them have
spoken of the series as somehow complete, or near completion,
with his passing. While well-intentioned, this is simply not the
case. That rich body of analysis to which Russell both contributed
so mightily and recovered so consistently, is no more near completion
than the planet earth itself. It would be high irony that a person
dedicated to the search for eternal values in a changing polity
would advocate or announce the competition of such a stupendous
task.
<P>
I suspect that these letters are giving expression to a feeling
of deep sorrow at the loss of a spiritual leader in a spiritless
environment. But the need for the comfort of belief, the instinct
for tradition, the impulse to maintain, if not create order, must
ultimately overcome our sorrow at the loss of a human being, however
talented and whatever achievements he may have registered. The
fact is that Russell is now one with the great tradition he helped
to articulate and recover. He is one with Plato, Augustine, Burke,
Brownson, Calhoun, Eliot and countless other names who helped
Russell give definition to western civilization. May his soul
rest in peace. May our souls remain restless in the pursuit of
peace.<A NAME="honorable"></A>

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Honorable T. Kenneth Cribb,
Jr.<BR>
President<BR>
Intercollegiate Studies Institute</b></CENTER><p> The priceless regalia
of the Scottish kings--the crown, the scepter, the sword of state--are
known as the Honors of Scotland. They are more ancient by far
than the British Crown Jewels, and it is said that the gold circlet
of the richly reworked crown was worn by Robert the Bruce. Despite
their incalculable worth, the Honors of Scotland were put away
following the union of the English and Scottish nations, and then
were lost to memory for 150 years.</B>
<P>
It was none other than Sir Walter Scott who, understanding their
significance, used all the powers of his scholarship and imagination
to deduce their forgotten resting place. After infinite pains,
he himself lifted the Honors of Scotland from the dusty recess
where they had been consigned by an earlier generation careless
of its patrimony.
<P>
In our age, it was Russell Kirk who, with ground-breaking scholarship
and moral imagination, rediscovered what we may call the Honors
of the West. At a time when the American heirs to conservatism
had fallen into forgetfulness of the great tradition, and liberal
intellectuals had proclaimed its demise, Dr. Kirk, like the Walter
Scott he so admired, lifted with his own hands our forgotten patrimony
from dusty oblivion.
<P>
In his early work Dr. Kirk treated modern exemplars of the conservative
tradition from Burke to Eliot, but always with respect to their
insights into timeless truths. Later, he more explicitly traced
these eternal verities to their ancient historical roots, and
to their Source beyond history. All along the way he erected guideposts
for those who would follow--all of us here and so many others--that
we too could travel the path he had marked toward order in the
soul and order in the commonwealth; that we too could discover
the Honors of the West.
<P>
Friend or foe would occasionally address him as Professor Kirk--not
realizing that he had held professorships no longer than he had
to--such was his contempt for Behemoth University. But teacher
he was, all his life. More than a few volumes on his long shelf
of books were written explicitly to instruct the young, not to
F mention hundreds of college lectures from coast to coast, scores
of Wilbur Fellows who served as his research assistants, or the
Piety Hill seminars begun more than twenty years ago. As with
Chaucer's Clerk, gladly would he teach and gladly learn.
<P>
Russell Kirk also taught by the example of his towering integrity.
Here was the man of letters who, without the usual sinecures,
actually lived by his pen. Here was the scourge of the Welfare
State who quietly practiced the arts of private charity. He and
Annette made their house a home to the troubled, to the dispossessed,
to great eccentrics seeking refuge from the commonplace world.
Who has not visited Piety Hill only to find himself dining with
the deposed imperial family of Ethiopia, or a young person with
grave family problems, or an intellectual expatriated from the
totalitarian East. There was even the Burglar Butler who before
finding shelter with the Kirks, made his way by robbing church
poor boxes, taking--as he said--only what was absolutely necessary.
<P>
Yes, Dr. Kirk taught us by the very nature of the household that
he established, graced by Monica, Cecilia, Felicia, and Andrea,
and presided over by Annette with an encompassing love.
<P>
In January of 1993 Russell Kirk learned that he suffered from
congestive heart failure, and realist that he was, understood
that his remaining time was short. He took the news as no more
and no less than an artifact of the human condition, and in his
last year and-a-half neither despaired in his spirit nor flagged
in his Herculean literary feats. After all, this was a man who
measured his intellectual pursuits in millennia and who planted
trees throughout his life as a symbol of our duty to strive for
good that we may not live to see.
<P>
Well into his seventies, Dr. Kirk could canoe on the rivers of
Mecosta County or walk the hills of the Scottish Borders, only
to sit down later at his typewriter and engage in learned disputation.
This past December nineteenth, Dr. Kirk wrote me, &quot;I fear
that my days of canoeing and hill-walking are over,&quot; and
then proceeded to outline a series of literary projects that daunted
even in the reading. Since the onset of his illness in 1993, he
had produced two of his most important works: <i>America's British
Culture</i>, a consummate defense of our common patrimony against
the destructive sallies of the multiculturalists; and <i>The Politics
of Prudence</i>, a series of essays instructing the rising generation
in the essence of conservative thought and exhorting them to nurture
and transmit their precious cultural heritage.
<P>
But perhaps the most significant work of his last days was the
completion of his final literary gift to us, <i>The Sword
of Imagination: Memoirs of a Half-Century of Literary Conflict</i>.
This 874-page treasure of a manuscript is currently being prepared
for publication by Eerdmans Publishing Company and, according
to Dr. Kirk, is a memoir humbly penned in the tradition of Julius
Caesar and Henry T Adams.
<P>
During his final illness, Dr. Kirk would gather his daughters
around him to tell stories of his youth and of their family history--as
well as an occasional gothic tale. He mustered the energy to read
aloud to his family Walter Scott's <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>,
and, on Easter Sunday, Chesterton's <i>Ballad of the White
Horse</i>;.
<P>
On his last morning, he heard on the radio that the Pope had slipped
and fallen. He asked his family to pin him in prayer for the Holy
Father's recovery. At the end, he sat up in his bed at his beloved
Piety Hill, and sank back with eyes closed. As Annette went for
the nurse, two of his young daughters took his hands and began
to sing the songs he had sung to awaken them from their a slumbers.
He opened his eyes once more to the angelic voices that sang him
to his rest. His life was gentle in the old sense; his death,
in all senses.
<P>
The final works and days of Russell Kirk were at one with his
long life. From across the ages the best minds of the West spoke
to Dr. Kirk of permanent things which eclipsed the paltry preoccupations
of our time, and he made those thinkers our contemporaries. It
is across the ages that Russell Kirk's own voice will be heard
by future voyagers embarked on the reflective journey toward order
in the soul and order in the commonwealth. May they redeem for
their time, as Russell Kirk has done for ours, the Honors of the
West.<A NAME="homily"></A>

<P>
On Sunday we celebrated Pentecost, and on Monday, I was at Yale
graduation. The contrast between them was extreme. Certainly at
Yale I discovered much knowledge. Certainly at Yale, I discovered
much learning. Yet, with all of this knowledge and learning, was
the lack of moral imagination; and in the midst of &quot;political
correctness,&quot; the refusal of the truth; and therefore the
absence of all wisdom.
<P>
Certainly, there was much talk of &quot;freedom from,&quot; and
lamentably little understanding of &quot;freedom to:&quot; a multiplication
of rights; and a convenient amnesia of duty.
<P>
Yet as Pentecost reminds us, the vocation of a Catholic is to
witness to the truth. To this end, God reveals Himself in covenant;
in sacrifice; in flesh and blood; and through the Holy Spirit.
<P>
Poured out upon the Church at Pentecost, and upon us at our baptism,
that Spirit leads us into the truth, and as we discover the truth,
if we are to live our lives with integrity, we must proclaim it.
<P>
For it is in this fearless proclamation of truth, that we ourselves
learn: from each other; from tradition; from grace; and from that
radical transformation of the heart. Truth comes from the entirety
of the human condition and has been refined and forged in the
inner conflicts between truth and lies; between good and evil;
between the world and the kingdom. And from the proclamation of
the truth, we discover wisdom.
<P>
Given the corruption of human nature, it is, perhaps, too much
to expect gratitude from those challenged and exposed by the proclamation
of the truth, but in the midst of persecution, explicit or implicit,
we see &quot;<i>Cor ad Cor loquitur</i>,&quot; heart speaks to heart.
Like the rim of a bell, it does not matter where it is touched,
for it rings clear, out across the earth. Wisdom speaks heart
to heart, because it perceives not only truth, but the purpose
of truth, which is God.
<P>
Wisdom speaks to the human: body, soul, mind, for wisdom both
understands the truth of the human condition, and is the ground
of its healing. It mines the individual he art for the good for
which humanity was made; for the good of which it is capable;
and for that fragile good confronted by the dark destructive selfishness
of which each one of us is daily tempted to succumb.
<P>
Such wisdom comes from God who is wisdom Himself; Himself the
author, the purpose and the end and it is the birthright of every
Catholic.
<P>
Here in the presence of the author of truth and seat of wisdom
we are given a sign: we see the bread and wine; we perceive the
flesh and blood. We see in what we have made, in bread, in wine,
the seeds of our mortality: the bread must rot and the wine spoil.
Yet we see God take what we have made, and by them, give to us
immortality.
<P>
This sign shows us what God will do, not with what we have made,
but with what he has made: ourselves. &quot;Now we see a dim reflection
in a mirror; but then we shall be seeing face to face. The knowledge
that I now have is imperfect; but I shall understand as I am understood.&quot;
(1 Cor. 13:12)
<P>
&quot;To understand as I am understood&quot; is the ultimate wisdom.
It is still the vocation of our brother Russell Kirk; it is the
lesson of his life; and it is the legacy, like Elijah's mantle,
that falls upon us here.<HR>

Heritage Lecture No. 571<br>
Delivered on May 15, 1996
<p>

When Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn addressed the graduates of Harvard on the eighth of June, 1978, they gathered in anticipation of an extraordinary event.  But in his remarks, which he called <I>A World Split Apart</I>, Solzhenitsyn eschewed the kind of fulsome compliments now endemic in commencement speeches.  Instead, taking advantage of the fact that Harvard's motto is "Veritas," he ventured to tell them the truth:  that "a decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the West today."  Speaking barely three years after the fall of Saigon, he observed in Americans something approaching "a lack of manhood" in acquiescing in communist aggression, a trend he found most pronounced "among the ruling and intellectual elites."
<p>
Solzhenitsyn's speech, which might have been an opening wedge into closed minds, only made some Americans stamp their feet in irritation.  It was much easier to conclude that he was wrong than to admit that we had abandoned Vietnam because of our own cowardice.  So his speech provoked a firestorm of condemnation in the media, led by First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who claimed that the Russian writer had no understanding of the United States.
<p>
Though Solzhenitsyn, who had braved the death camps of the Gulag Archipelago and the interrogations of the Soviet secret police in his quest for the truth, hardly needed to burnish his character as a brave man by speaking the truth in Harvard Yard, the speech did prove to be the turning point in his public reputation in this country.  Because of his many unfashionable conclusions, the mainstream media decided that he was a crank, so the man who had been lionized in American literary circles was thenceforth shut out, dismissed, and ignored.  A host of ignorant charges were made against him, while his message to Americans was buried and forgotten.  Harper and Row, which published the address in a little book with the Russian text on one side and the English translation on the other, allowed it to go out of print by the late 1980s.
<p>
The antipathy of the media toward Solzhenitsyn was long-lasting and still has not let up.  When he returned to Russia in 1994, they hastened to conclude that he was just as irrelevant in his own country as they had deemed him to be in ours.  As <I>A World Split Apart</I> makes clear in its lucid discussion of the media in Western countries, they are not open to unfashionable arguments.  Their reaction to the speech was predictable, and in effect Solzhenitsyn's speech predicts it, at least in broad outline.  Thus, the speech was more than a reproach, from a friendly but frank observer, of America's loss of courage:  It was a demonstration of courage by the Russian writer, whose speech was also a deed.
<p>
Solzhenitsyn's example of courage in the speech had a practical effect.  The complacency of the media was not the only opinion abroad in the land.  Among American students of foreign affairs, and also the general public, there was a widespread and justified apprehension by the late 1970s that our loss of courage had left the United States at risk.  The war in Afghanistan, pursued in sharp contrast with the former caution of the Soviet Union, was one sign of danger; another was the impudent seizure of American hostages by the Iranian revolutionaries.  The 1980 presidential election, which turned on the difference between these two opinions about America's place in the world, marked an important turn in our politics.
<p>
In the decade after Solzhenitsyn spoke, American courage played a vital part in the collapse of the Soviet Union -- the most astonishing political event in the lifetime of my generation.  The stiffening of American resolve after the humiliations of the 1970s had many manifestations, but it was personified in the presidency of Ronald Reagan, whom Solzhenitsyn publicly praised.  From the beginning of his administration, Reagan showed courage unknown to his predecessor.  His prompt decision to fire air traffic controllers engaged in an illegal strike caused Americans and foreigners alike to take notice.  Even more important was the way he acted when he was shot in the spring of 1981:  We saw courage in his jokes, and nothing made him more formidable.  His subsequent willingness to call the Soviet Union an "evil empire" instead of falling back on the usual diplomatic euphemisms, and his evident resolve to prevent that country from achieving worldwide hegemony, made a deep impression on his countrymen, on their allies, and also on the Soviets.
<p>
By the time Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia, of course, the "world split apart" that he had described in his speech had been transformed by the American victory in the Cold War, which culminated in the fall of the Soviet Union.  The tense bipolar world of two superpowers, each representing a different moral and political understanding of man, had been replaced by the uneasy -- and sometimes unacknowledged -- triumph of liberal democracy.  Russia returned to the sort of remedial aspiration for democracy that held sway before its government was hijacked by communists during the Great War, while the United States greeted its own dominance with the sort of absentminded modesty that comes over it when it is not at war.
<p>
The sudden demise of the Soviet Union, like the fall of Saigon, was only the culmination of a long series of events, many of them little noticed or understood at the time.  The Soviet Union fell after its rulers realized that communism, which always left the Russian empire at a moral and economic disadvantage, could not keep up with technological progress in the free nations of the world.  That realization, which became widespread among well-placed Russians in the 1980s, made them lose heart about continuing their long-standing war of nerves with the United States.
<p>
It is not given to human beings to know the future, so we cannot be sure that the changes in the Soviet Union are irreversible, dramatic as their effects already have been in many parts of the world.  Powerful politicians who cleave to communism and prefer the old regime now control important offices in Russia and are bidding for the presidency.  The picture also is mixed in many of the former Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe.  Cuba and North Korea remain unbending, though increasingly isolated in their backwardness.  China and Vietnam have begun to modernize their economies by taking some small steps toward a free market, but without dismantling communist tyranny.  In China's case, the transition has been accompanied by an unwelcome belligerency toward the interests and friends of the United States.  Therefore, the post-Cold War world calls for continuing resolve and prudence on our part, not relaxation or inattention.
<p>
But there is plenty of evidence in <I>A World Split Apart</I> -- and much more in Solzhenitsyn's other writings on human nature and politics -- that the Russian writer considers courage important not only as an aid to preserving a decent regime, which it has been for the United States, but also as a virtue that belongs to a properly ordered human soul.  Thus, courage is prized for its own sake as well as for its instrumental effects.  When Solzhenitsyn reproached us for losing heart, he meant to make us ashamed, not just afraid.
<p>
What is courage?  Ernest Hemingway described it as "grace under pressure."  John Milton wrote that a man who had it would "never...  submit or yield."  Solzhenitsyn's predecessor as an honorary American citizen, Winston Churchill, esteemed it "the first of human qualities" -- in fact, the one that guarantees all the others.  In his youth, he sought to win a reputation for courage.  He tells us in his autobiography <I>My Early Life</I> how, after he left the military academy at Sandhurst, he carried out a private experiment by attaching himself to a Spanish column fighting a guerrilla war in Cuba.  Before he got too far into his career as a cavalry officer, he wanted to find out if he had courage enough.  On his 21st birthday, he came under fire for the first time and was relieved to discover that not everyone gets killed, or even hurt.  The young Churchill escaped unscathed, thanks to a well-fed Spanish officer who was asleep in a hammock between him and the enemy guns.  He did not begrudge the fat man his meals.  Keeping the example of his unofficial trial of courage in Cuba in mind, we can discern a few capital facts about it.
<p>
Courage has to do with braving dangers nobly.  It means surmounting the fear of wounds or death.  In his autobiography, Churchill tells us how he gave up a piece of skin from his forearm to seal the wound of a brother officer.  A brave man can endure the prospect of bodily pain or violent death, or even the reality of it, without flinching.  But the danger that he knows how to face has to have something of nobility in it:  Courage is shown in surmounting your fear of being hurt or killed not through illness or a car accident, but through war.  Therefore, courage is seen more in Churchill's being under fire than in his willingness to be flayed by the doctor to help his wounded friend, though as a brave man he faced both kinds of pains well.  This endurance, which is really just doggedness, is an important part of courage and distinguishes someone who has the virtue from someone who does not have it.
<p>
It was Aristotle who invented the distinction between intellectual virtue and moral or ethical virtue, arguing that courage was one of the moral virtues, along with moderation, magnanimity, justice, veracity, and others.  He showed us that, like other moral virtues, courage is a habit, not an opinion or a frame of mind.  It is not enough simply to praise courage, or even to understand it.  To develop a habit like courage, you need chances to practice it.  Hence Churchill's eagerness to put himself in harm's way:  You can't act courageously without having dangers to face, and you can't cultivate a habit of courage without acting courageously.
<p>
Aristotle argued that, again like other moral virtues, courage is found in a mean, in between an excess and a defect.  The courageous man is not too afraid of dangers, like a coward, nor is he too unafraid of them, like a rash man.  Of the two extremes, the ordinary human bent is toward cowardice, because people have a natural disinclination to suffer pain or death -- a disinclination that is perfectly reasonable.  But rashness is a vice as well, because the rash man lacks the steadiness and the prudence of the courageous man.  Churchill acted rashly when he jumped off a bridge just after his 18th birthday to avoid being captured by his brother and a cousin, who were chasing him.  He fell 29 feet to the ground, ruptured his kidney among other organs, and for a year afterward "looked at life round a corner."  But rashness can be turned toward courage by age and experience more easily than cowardice can.
<p>
If wanting to avoid pain or death is perfectly reasonable, then courage, which puts you in harm's way, seems to have something in common with stupidity.  Churchill admits as much when he says of his trip to Cuba, "You might call it tomfoolery.  To travel thousands of miles with money one can ill afford, and get up at four o'clock in the morning in the hope of getting into a scrape in the company of perfect strangers, is hardly a rational proceeding."  Being virtuous is supposed to be pleasant, yet courage requires you to stand your ground tenaciously even when the consequence may be pain or death.  A brave man will sometimes charge into the enemy line, but a horse never will.  A horse is smart enough to shy away, and men often shy away too.  Hence Hobbes's notorious description of a battle as a running away on one side -- or both.
<p>
Nonetheless, Churchill knew "there were very few subalterns in the British Army who would not have given a month's pay" to share his adventure.  A courageous man does not just run away from battle.  He is willing to risk danger because, for him, avoiding pain and staying alive are not the most important things.  Everyone prefers to stay alive, of course; but the courageous man gives even his own life the proper weight:  not too little and not too much.  He isn't willing to pay any price just to stay alive, because he isn't willing to live just any kind of life.  He knows that everyone dies in the end, so what matters is the kind of life you live.  The price you pay to stay alive is too high if it means your life is not fully human; and a life of comfortable self-preservation is not a fully human life, because it lacks risk and adventure.  In addition to the endurance or tenacity -- the doggedness -- that I mentioned earlier, courage involves daring.  The courageous man dares, and dares greatly, like Churchill, who as a young man took risks over and over again to get to the battlefield, and then took risks on the battlefield to win a name for valor.
<p>
Here is a clue as to why he ranked courage first among the virtues.  For human beings, living means taking risks, because we are neither omniscient or omnipotent.  If we knew everything that was going to happen to us ahead of time, we could foresee and forestall injury and perhaps even death, but then life would be dull and not worth living.  Or, if we had the power to master everything, we could overcome even dangers that we could not foresee, which again would give us the conceit of absolute assurance and a very humdrum life.  Churchill explores these possibilities in his essay "A Second Choice," published in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>.
<p>
This idea of becoming omniscient or omnipotent is the real aspiration of modern science -- mastering nature, overcoming chance, learning to control our surroundings, taking the risk out of life by making it entirely predictable.  For Churchill, this aspiration is misbegotten, as he suggests in some of the other essays in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>.  Insofar as science succeeds in mastering nature -- and Churchill is impressed with the success of modern technology -- it adds to our power, but without making us better or happier.  As fast as we embrace the fruits of modern science, we find that the guarantee of a good life is still somewhere around the next corner.  And when men reach the limits of their ability to control the world -- for Churchill concludes that there are limits to our science and power, particularly when it comes to reshaping human nature -- then they may realize ruefully that what nature gives us is not so bad after all, compared to what we make for ourselves.  Indeed, that realization may prove a relief.
<p>
We do not have the kind of comprehensive knowledge that would allow us to avoid every wrong turn, but we can have a human wisdom that allows us to see a little way ahead, if we are prudent.  And we do not have the kind of absolute power that would allow us to overcome every obstacle and accomplish every wish, but we do have the human strength to make a better life for ourselves, if we act wisely.  Discernment is needed to guide our actions; that is the intellectual side.  But courage is the moral equipment we need to live in an uncertain world without letting ourselves be either reduced to malleable material directed from without (a cowardly surrender of our humanity) or seduced by the idea that human beings can control everything (a rash attempt to play God).
<p>
Modern science leads men into both mistakes by considering us at once as material beings undifferentiated from the rest of nature and as rational beings radically distinct from the rest of nature.  A more suitable and courageous posture is suggested by Aristotle, who found no mean part for men with the moral virtues (and no one who has read Aristotle will fault me for any originality in my treatment of courage, unless I have made any mistakes).  Winston Churchill's discoveries about courage are remarkably similar to Aristotle's treatment of that virtue in the <I>Nicomachean Ethics</I>.  Churchill was aware of this similarity, but he did not consider it a coincidence.  When someone recommended Aristotle's book to him and then asked Churchill what he thought after he had read it, the answer he got was that Aristotle's views on ethics were very sensible, but not very different from those that Churchill had formed on his own.
<p>
Courage is always a popular virtue, but especially in wartime, when it seems so obviously needed.  A coward is no use to others in case of danger, whereas everyone hopes to find a brave man fighting shoulder to shoulder at his side.  But courage is not useful only on the battlefield:  It also is a good sign that a person is worth befriending.  One who prizes his own comfort and life above everything else is too selfish to be a friend to anyone else.  Churchill mentions that, in his youth, men who had been in battle had an aura about them that was recognized by the girls they courted.  In this, the girls showed a nice understanding of what was good for them, since a coward is too selfish to give much consideration to anyone else -- even his own wife or family.
<p>
But a courageous man is not courageous simply because he seeks the esteem of others.  While that aspiration is a healthy spur to a young man learning to be courageous, it cannot be the motive of a man who has courage.  A courageous man does not sacrifice his own pleasure as he does courageous deeds, though he may sacrifice his own comfort; he takes pleasure in acting courageously, even if he has to endure pain.  The pain, or the risk of death, is a reminder that human beings are not all souls, that we live in bodies and are vulnerable through them.  It is also the reason that courage, as the first of the virtues, is on a lower level than others, like friendliness and wittiness, that do not require us to suffer pain.
<p>
Aristotle reserves courage, and the rest of the virtues as well, for gentlemen who have been properly raised.  But Churchill, though he does not turn up his nose at gentlemanliness, seems to encourage young men of spirit wherever he finds them.  He calls his autobiography <I>My Early Life</I> "a tale of youthful endeavour," dedicates it "to a new generation," and in it exhorts young men "all over the world" to take their places "in life's fighting line."  He tells them that they should never "take No for an answer" and "Never submit to failure."
<p>
Churchill's autobiography, which is still in print, is an adventure story that rivals for color, incident, and vivid description the best stories of Mark Twain, whom he admired.  Churchill would approve of the study of his own life as a spur to ambition, a guide to political judgment, and a model of courage, just as he studied and learned from the examples of his father Lord Randolph Churchill and his great forebear John Churchill, the first duke of Marlborough.
<p>
But Churchill is not the only one who can teach us courage.  Solzhenitsyn's books hold lessons for us too, especially his most impressive book, the three-volume <I>Gulag Archipelago</I>, which opens a whole new moral universe to the unsuspecting Western reader.  Beginning with <I>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</I>, the only one of his books that was published in communist Russia, Solzhenitsyn explored the question of what gives a human being strength to live a virtuous life under the most unpromising conditions.  <I>The Gulag Archipelago</I> affords a lengthier description of the men who discovered their souls under the bleak and distant sun of the Soviet death camps.  One of the merits of Solzhenitsyn's account is to show how that courage cannot quite stand alone as a moral virtue, that it needs to be paired with prudence.  Aristotle had come to the same conclusion.
<p>
And if we are looking for American heroes, some of the same discoveries may be made from reading the memoir written by our highest-ranking Vietnam POW, Admiral Jim Stockdale, and the woman who staunchly waited and worked for his return, Sybil Stockdale.  Stockdale is a man of remarkable thoughtfulness, a careful student of philosophers like Plato and Epictetus.  He had plenty of time to think as he endured privation and torture in the Hanoi Hilton.  The book he wrote with his wife, <I>In Love and War</I>, tells the story of his captivity from both sides.  Both endurance and daring, and the way these two elements of courage have to be guided by practical wisdom, can be learned from the Stockdales' book.
<p>
At first blush, Solzhenitsyn's warning that Americans might lack courage to prevail over the Soviets now seems too pessimistic.  The United States is the only remaining superpower:  The Soviet Union lies in the dust.  American steadiness won the Cold War, though my generation has never experienced a hot war worldwide.  Still, we have only to go back to the Gulf War to remember how the United States formed ranks against a nasty aggressor.  Though few Americans were called on to make sacrifices in that war, our experience in Korea, or in the two world wars, suggests our countrymen will not shrink from fighting to defend liberty.  In retrospect, Vietnam looks like an exception -- not that our soldiers, sailors, and airmen were loath to put themselves in harm's way, or the American people (with some sorry exceptions) to support them; but our political leaders lacked steady resolve to guide them and to explain the war to their fellow citizens.
<p>
Up to this point, I have emphasized courage in battle or in other situations of mortal danger.  That is a necessary corrective to the penchant today to prefer so-called moral courage, or the courage of your convictions, to real courage.  People who have the courage of their convictions, which means sincerity and a certain determination, have the strength of soul required for all the virtues, but not necessarily the particular moral habit of courage.  Voltaire is famous for saying that though he might disagree with what you said, he would defend to his death your right to say it.  For this sort of remark, he is widely praised for having moral courage.  But as Harvey Mansfield points out, that is not courage at all, but only cheap talk.  Voltaire never defended to the death anyone's right to say anything, much less something with which he disagreed; and it is doubtful that anyone ever has.
<p>
Since the decision to end the draft for American citizens, most of our young people have no experience of military service or the possibility of risking their lives for their country.  This deprives them of the usual way of learning about courage in practice.  But I do not mean to suggest that if you have no chance to go into battle, you cannot have courage.  That virtue belongs not only on the battlefield, but also in the peaceable lives of citizens and statesmen.  There is reason to be apprehensive about the courage of Americans today, from the man in the street right up to the White House.  Students are more likely to know about George Washington's false teeth than his courage as a general and statesman, and shoppers do not even remember whose birthday "Presidents' Day" once celebrated.  Public schools aim to make students fit in or to give them a specious self-esteem rather than teach them examples of the virtues, and courage is one of the most neglected.
<p>
Stigmatized as aggressive behavior by people who are hostile to anything noble, courage is treated with suspicion if it ever comes up; but mostly, the politically correct curriculum simply avoids mentioning it.  The kind of challenging, competitive, or warlike occasions that call forth courage are neither studied nor experienced in the classroom.  By giving up any effort to instruct students in moral virtues like courage, public schools discourage them.  The student who has faced exacting expectations from a teacher is a rare bird, easily recognizable by the unusual demands of his self-respect; but mostly, little is asked and little is learned.  Unambitious, unaccomplished, unenterprising students make half-hearted scholars, but they also are ill-prepared for life and make an easy mark for the engrossing distractions of alcohol, drugs, and television stupor.
<p>
Yet when you neglect the spirited part of students' souls, they do not just atrophy.  High aspirations remain, and students learn courage, if they do, in their increasingly risky unofficial dealings with each other and the world.  Too many of them are punished for their courage if they stand up to gang violence; others learn to act courageously in the bosom of a gang on behalf of a bad cause.  Public schools and the media maintain a conspiratorial silence about the prevalence of gang violence.  Parents do not want to believe it and too often are oblivious to the problem, but students know all about it.
<p>
Students today seem starved for good examples, for some relief from the public school professionalism that chills their ardent curiosity about the right way to live and denies them the kind of rousing adventures that appealed to young Winston Churchill.  Teachers who love their subjects and hold students to high standards, academic contests with winners and losers, conversations in class that give students a chance to explore their own questions with the help of classic writings -- these traditional methods could bring some excitement back into the classroom.  Students would be as encouraged to see dumbed-down, mealy-mouthed textbooks replaced with real books as to see dumbed-down, mealy-mouthed facilitators replaced with real teachers.
<p>
The long-run effects of neglecting courage go beyond our schools to civil society, where a parallel professionalism makes courts ineffective at maintaining civil order.  In our political leaders, lack of courage manifests itself, as Churchill observed, in living "in the temperamental atmosphere of a Gallup Poll -- always feeling one's pulse and taking one's temperature."  The politics of meeting the demands of your constituents, of pleasing an often uninstructed public, of changing your stance to get re-elected -- in short, what you might call the politics of valetudinarianism -- is rampant today (not that cautious compromise is always wrong, or a shift in position always the sign of a craven politician).
<p>
But Churchill warns that that sort of politician is increasingly common in our democratic age.  As usual, he reflects on this subject in his writings.  As he writes in "Fifty Years Hence," an essay published in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>, "Democratic governments drift along the line of least resistance, taking short views, paying their way with sops and doles and smoothing their path with pleasant-sounding platitudes."  That's a good description of presidential politics today.  Few of our politicians understand Churchill's remark that "politics is almost as exciting as war and quite as dangerous" because "in war you can only be killed once, but in politics many times."  Most of them are too timid to risk being killed politically even once.
<p>
In his essay on "Consistency in Politics" in <I>Thoughts and Adventures</I>, Churchill explores his view of political courage.  He deprecates the small-souled kind of consistency that means unbending adherence to a certain position, no matter what the circumstances; circumstances change, so positions have to change too.  A larger consistency means that a man has "the same dominating purpose," as he writes, even if circumstances force him to throw his weight now on one side, now on the other of a durable political controversy.  For instance, it is impossible to say in principle whether defense spending should be higher or lower; it is only possible to make a practical judgment about what the current situation requires, which may change from one year to the next.
<p>
But, as his countrymen would discover in the 1930s when he began his brave but lonely campaign to warn them of the Nazi menace, Churchill had no time for the kind of politician who simply swims with the current.  Such a timid policy neglects a statesman's responsibility as custodian of his nation's abiding interests.  Representative government requires a certain courage in its statesmen:  the courage to show constituents their true interests instead of just reflecting their wishes.  Americans citizens need that kind of instruction as much as their political leaders need the political courage and discernment to offer it.
<p>
When Solzhenitsyn explored the reason for resistance to Soviet tyranny in the third volume of <I>The Gulag Archipelago</I>, he found it in the courage of some human beings who had, as he said, "a nobler conception of life."  Courage is the virtue that defends our liberty; it is also the first virtue of a man who is truly free.  Therefore, it belongs, in the company of the other moral virtues, with what Russell Kirk finely described as "the permanent things."

<h3>Eve Without Adam: What Genesis Has to Tell America About Natural Law</h3>
By David F. Forte<br>
Professor of Law, Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, Cleveland State University
<p>
Heritage Lecture No. 570<br>
A <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a><br>
Delivered May 1, 1996<br>
<p>

In the spring of 1992, I was ensconced here on the fifth floor of the Heritage Foundation. There I was, ferreting out the historical basis of the Supreme Court's right to strike down legislation, when, from a few blocks away, the Justices graced my work with the following statement:
	<p>
<blockquote>At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. (<I>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</I>, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2807 [1992].)
</blockquote>
<p>
All that was mine?  I thought. You mean, I -- on the fifth floor of the Heritage Foundation -- could define "existence," "the mystery of human life," and the "universe" too?  Yes, said the Court. All I need do, the Justices said, was accept the right of the Court to "speak before all others" on constitutional ideals and to follow its lead no matter what qualms of conscience I might have. The Court made that statement, of course, to support the right of a woman to terminate the life of the developing human fetus within her. But somehow, the Court's declaration had a more ancient ring to it.
<p>
Normally when I speak at the Heritage Foundation, I talk about law. But I am not going to talk about law today, even though the Supreme Court has inspired this reflection. Instead, I want to talk to you about a cultural moment, a moment Russell Kirk worked for and, I am sure, prayed for all his life. We are at a time when faith and reason, which moderns regard as antagonists, are resuming a partnership long overdue. Faith and reason are, in fact, two pillars of Western civilization, and their reintegration comes at a time when the hallmarks of that civilization are disintegrating around us.
<p>
I need not chronicle the statistics of our decline. You are familiar enough with them. <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>, Gary Bauer, Marvin Olasky, and so many others have described a society where each person has become disconnected with his fellows, where we create zones of privacy to find ourselves and lose everyone else in the bargain. We are a citizenry where to a large extent, metaphorically speaking, Eve exists without Adam, Adam without Eve, where neither truth nor permanence are seen as real and relationships of all sorts are fitful, episodic, and transient.
<P>
This may be an America where there are a thousand points of light, but each one illuminates only itself. Faith is an outlaw in the public square, and philosophy deconstructs reason itself.
<p>
It was not always this way. It certainly was not this way at the founding of the country. For, as the Founders knew so well, Western civilization was built upon both reason and faith: the faith of the Judeo-Christian revelation and the reason that discovered and applied the natural law.
<p>
Today, I wish to make but three points. First, I want to discuss something of the history of the alliance between faith and reason in Western intellectual history and their estrangement. Second, by referring to some of the elements in the Book of Genesis, I would like to affirm the basic compatibility between the principles of the natural law and the values of our religious heritage. Finally, I raise a caution regarding religious doctrine and liberty that any effective and principled alliance between faith and reason must deal with.
<p>
<b>Faith and Reason</b>
<p>
	The Greeks, who gave us so much, gave us the natural law school of thought, particularly in the writings of Aristotle. Natural law was subsequently universalized by the Stoics, incorporated into the law by the Romans, allied with Christianity, and finally raised to its highest exposition by St. Thomas Aquinas in his Scholastic philosophy. The school of natural law championed man's reason, his being, his capacity for sociability, and his virtue. The values espoused by that school dominated Western thought through the end of the 18th century and were included in the principles of the American Founding.
<p>
The Judeo-Christian revelation provided the other, complementary notion of the nature of man: created by God, fallen, covenanted, and graced with a divinely inspired mission.
<P>
In the high Middle Ages, the traditions of faith and reason reached their greatest level of integration in the natural law philosophy of Thomas Aquinas. Scholasticism constituted the most fully developed version of natural law, while of the faith of the Church unified Europe. Then came the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, and the age of scientific inquiry. The link between faith and reason was weakened, and eventually broken. The age of Reformation and Rationalism was launched. Faith sought to undo the shackles of reason, while reason tried to free itself of the shackles of religion.
<P>
Important Protestant theologians found the good solely through the will of God as revealed in His Word, while rationalists forsook natural law thinking as being too close to religion. The Reformation disparaged the Scholasticism of the high Middle Ages. God's law was divine positive law, and no natural law could independently find the good.
<p>
Not that natural law was extinguished at the end of the high Middle Ages. On the contrary, the cultural force that the alliance of faith and reason had created lasted for centuries. Even though Protestant theology rejected Scholasticism, Biblical values paralleled the norms of natural law. Magnanimity was charity, courage was fortitude, fidelity was faithfulness, community was congregation. On the other hand, although few philosophers "did" natural law from the 14th century on, most traded on its fundamental norms. Sir Edward Coke found natural justice to be "right reason," which was the basis of the common law. John Locke presumed those norms to be in the law of nature, which both limited and gave legitimacy to individual liberty. When international politics degenerated into self-interested discord, Grotius, Pufendorf, and Vattel sought to revive a modified natural law to restore some moral order to the relations between states.
<P>
The Founders fully understood that a civil society could not be maintained without recourse to the intellectual values of the natural law and the parallel spiritual values of revelation. Washington knew how crucial that bond was. As he said in his farewell address:
<P><blockquote>
	Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, Religion and Morality are indispensable supports.... In Vain would man claim the tribute of Patriotism, who should labour to avert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of Men and Citizens. The mere Politician, equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them.... And let us with caution indulge the supposition, that morality can be maintained without religion.
</blockquote><p>
By the 19th century, however, the connection between the mind and the spirit was finally severed. When religion and revelation could no longer restrain reason and positivism, the power of the state and the power of the unconstrained individual came to the fore. It is not much of an exaggeration that the problems of politics since the 19th century in the world lie in the contest between the supposedly self-sufficient power of the state on the one hand and the supposedly self-sufficient power of the individual on the other. The higher law that tames both is absent.
<p>
In the 19th century, natural law had retreated to being a Catholic intellectual discipline. It was disdained in the academy. A character in Stendahl declares, "There's no such thing as natural law. This expression is nothing but old nonsense."  A lot of "old nonsense" was done away with in Fichte, Hegel, and Marx, in Austin, Bentham, and Holmes.
<p>
It was not until the aftermath of World War II, in confronting the Holocaust, that natural law stirred again in the conscience of the philosopher and the judge. If the Holocaust was evil, pure and simple, then there must be a good, pure and simple. If we shrink from thinking that the Final Solution can ever have been a valid human law because its purpose was so utterly perverse, there must be a purposive standard by which we can know what laws are indeed legitimate or not.
<P>
And so the revival began, kindling in different places: Jacques Maritain in France, Russell Kirk in the United States, the Hart/Fuller debate. By the 1980s, natural law had once again become an independent philosophical discipline. Dozens of books and hundreds of articles poured out. Natural law as a vibrant school of philosophy has returned. It is something we have not seen for six centuries.
<p>
Today, in the face of the dissolution wrought by positivism, there is a renewed alliance between faith and reason. Natural law thought is flourishing, pursued by Catholics, Jews, and Protestants, while a reawakening to faith stirs throughout the country. Pope John Paul II calls a return to natural law values essential to saving Western civilization itself, while Protestant ministers and political activists from the late Martin Luther King, Jr., to Ralph Reed find in the natural law those essential human values that are confirmed by revelation. The "law written on men's hearts," as St. Paul puts it, is once again recognized by Protestant Christianity.

<p>
<b>Genesis and the Natural Law</b>
<p>
The renewed alliance between faith and reason makes eminent sense, for the fundamental view of nature and of humanity articulated in the natural law school parallels the divine definition of creation and man taught by revelation. The example I use today is Genesis, though there are myriad other instances. I do not do so as a Biblical exegete. I am not qualified for that. But I do know something about the natural law and find that its insights are confirmed in many parts of the saga of creation in the Book of Genesis, at least according to many common interpretations of that text.
<p>
Every culture's creation stories reveal its basic concept of what is human, what is nature, and what is divine. In Genesis, we have a compilation of creation stories. Taken together, they tell us in mythic language what reason has brought us to apprehend in natural law. In its own terms, Genesis tells us what natural law tells us. It speaks to us of natural man and created man, of conjoined man and disunited man. It affirms man's reason, his goodness, his unity, and his ego. 	 Let me discuss just three parts of Genesis in relation to the natural law: the creation of the material world, the creation of man, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
<p>
Now, I am not going to talk about the creationism, or sin, or sex. If you want to talk about evolution, let's discuss it over coffee. If you want to talk about sin, perhaps we can do that over a beer. If you want to talk about sex, sorry, I'm a married man.
<p>
Let us start with the account of creation in the first chapter:
<p><blockquote>
	In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless waste, and darkness covered the abyss, and the mighty wind [the spirit of God] swept over the waters. (Genesis 1:1-2.)
</blockquote><p>
In that one majestic verse, God's creation astonishes us in two simultaneous ways. First, He creates everything ("the heavens and the earth") out of nothing. Second, He brings order out of chaos. In the image of the ancient Hebrews, the stuff of the cosmos was water, and water symbolized chaos -- which God orders. Think for a moment of the difference between farmers and fishermen: A farmer subdues the land and makes it his servant, but an experienced fisherman knows he is always a stranger on the sea and is never home till he reaches shore.
<p>
In Genesis, God's mighty spirit moves across the water, pushing it where He wills. He orders chaos itself. Recall in the New Testament, when Jesus awakens in the boat to still the storm that was threatening to overwhelm the disciples. "Who can this be," they ask in awe, "that the wind and the sea obey him?"  (Mark 4:41.) The disciples understood that this was no ordinary wonder-worker. In Genesis, God pushes the water out of the world by creating a domed firmament and separates the remaining water in the world into seas while permitting some of the remaining cosmic waters to sluice in as rain through holes in the dome, or bubble up from below through springs (oases perhaps) or rivers.
<p>
The point of creation is that without order, there would not be nothingness, but utter chaos. Let us reflect on that. People will give up their lives for order. They will die for their country, their faith, their family, or their friends. But a life without meaning leads to despair. Chaos, not death, holds the real terror for man. In the most primeval sense, a terrorist does the devil's work.
<p>
Notice also in this first chapter, that as soon as God controls chaos, pushing a mighty wind over the seas, He creates light. (Genesis 1:3.) Light is the greatest of the elements. Light is good. It illuminates the order he is creating. It is understanding. Throughout scripture, the notion of light is always seen as illuminating an understanding of the inner reality of things.
<p>
Finally, God proceeds, in a measured and deliberative manner, to create the remainder of material reality. Even with their pre-scientific notions, the Hebrews understood that everything created was logically and organically interrelated, and that reality was created in a purposeful manner from the most basic to the more refined. There is a purpose and a point to creation. It leads to man. And in finishing the work of creation, God said that it was good. (Genesis 1:31.)
<p>
In this most fundamental description of reality, natural law concurs. In natural law, reality is objective and ordered, and man is organically part of it. Socrates taught that man's reason could apprehend and illuminate this reality. He spent his life battling the Sophists, who saw only chaos underlying everything. Plato sought to discover the good that was the ultimate reality. Aristotle found that the world was the result not of chance, but of intelligent intention. He taught that change was not chaotic, but purposeful, wherein each thing moves to fulfill its own nature, and that being -- existence itself -- was in its very nature, good. All these elements were synthesized in Aquinas.
<P>
Similar parallels are in the account of man.
<p>
In the first chapter of Genesis, God creates man and woman equally in his image; that is, unlike the animals, men and women are to reflect the divine. In the second story of creation, God creates man (adam = universal humanity) and finds that "it is not good for man to be alone, I will make a suitable partner for him."  (Genesis 2:18.) God's creation is incomplete. It is not yet "good."  In natural law, too, things are good only when their nature is fulfilled, when their potentialities are brought to completion.
<p>
In Genesis, for man (that is, mankind in its individualization) to be complete, he needs a helpmeet. Likewise, in the natural law tradition, Aristotle insists that man cannot truly flourish as a human unless he is associated together in the polity. From Aristotle on, the natural law tradition emphasizes the fundamental good of friendship, defined as seeking the good of the other. In Genesis, there is a special complementarity in the friendship of a man and a woman, which becomes the fundamental experience of the good of sociability of each individual.
<p>
In natural law, sociability (which I think is natural law's unique contribution to understanding contemporary problems) is something without which man cannot flourish as a human person. It has its most intense fulfillment in the relations between a man and a woman in the family. That ordering of human relations is a fundamental good attached to human nature itself.
<p>
We can see already how radically similar the views of revelation and natural law are on the nature of reality and of man. Order, reason, community, purposeful action, the goodness of being, sociability, sexual complementarity are essential to both.
<p>
Now we come to the part of the story that everybody knows best: the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Adam and Eve, you recall, could eat of all the fruit of the trees in the Garden except one. But the serpent was a persuasive advocate:
<p><blockquote>
	The serpent asked the woman, "Did God really tell you not to eat from any of the trees in the garden?"  The woman answered the serpent: "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden; it is only about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God said, `You shall not eat it or even touch it, lest you die.'"  But the serpent said to the woman: "You certainly will not die!  No. God knows well that the moment you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods who know what is good and what is bad."  The woman saw that the tree was good for food, pleasing to the eyes, and desirable for gaining wisdom. So she took some of the fruit and ate it; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. (Genesis 2:1-7.)
</blockquote><p>
The serpent said three things about this tree. Fruit is sweet tasting. Knowledge is a delight. And you can be like God. Now, I love caramel sundaes, but I can turn down a sweet. I revel in the life of the mind, but I don't really have to know everything. But to be like a God -- that's a dizzying prospect. The exegetes tell us that the temptation to Eve and to Adam was to define for oneself what the scheme of good and evil is instead of apprehending what is objectively good for man. If I can define for myself for my own world, if I can determine what is good and evil, then for that little world of my making, I am a god. The serpent did say something else. He said Eve would not die. In the end, the promise to be a god, as enticing as it may be, is always a false promise.
<p>
By eating the fruit, Eve names good and evil for herself. Remember that earlier in this chapter of Genesis, God had given Adam the right to name the animals, to distinguish them, to find their inner scientific order. But the naming of good and evil, God retains to himself. Man was given reason to apprehend good and evil, but he does not, in his nature, possess the capacity for creating it.
<p>
Aristotle teaches that a just man is one who practices virtue, and he defines virtue as the habit of acting rightly. When one acts rightly, one reflects or participates in the objective moral order (the image of God in the words of Genesis). But when one defines the moral order for himself, he images nothing but his own will. By definition, under the natural law, one cannot act virtuously if one is knowingly acting outside of the objective moral order.
<p>
Having asserted one's own will as defining good and evil, the results ineluctably follow. For, as the story of creation predicted, without order there is not nothingness, but the terror and distress of chaos.
<p>
There is first the disorder of the soul, in the form of shame. Second, social cohesion is shattered. God strolls through the Garden of Eden and accuses Adam of eating of the forbidden tree. And Adam dissembles: "The woman whom you put here with me -- she gave me fruit from the tree, and so I ate it."  (Genesis 2:12.) Even in the garden of Eden, the man abandons the woman. They are no longer friends. The bonds of sociability are broken. As soon as we take unto ourselves the right to define good and evil, we jettison the interconnectedness between one another that our natures call us to have. Trust vanishes.
<p>
Lest you think that such insights come only from a religious tradition, let me read to you Cicero:
<blockquote><P>
	True law is right reason in agreement with nature; it is of universal application, unchanging and everlasting; it summons to duty by its commands, and averts wrongdoing by its prohibitions.... It is a sin to try to alter this law, nor is it allowable to attempt to repeal any part of it, and it is impossible to abolish it entirely. We cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people, and we need not look outside ourselves for an expounder or interpreter of it. And there will not be different laws at Rome and at Athens, or different laws now and in the future, but one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and all times, and there will be one master and ruler, that is, God, over us all, for he is the author of this law, its promulgator, and its enforcing judge. Whoever is disobedient is fleeing from himself and denying his human nature, and by reason of this very fact he will suffer the worst penalties, even if he escapes what is commonly considered punishment. (<I>De Republica</I> 3:21.)
</blockquote><p>
Cicero never read Genesis.
<p>
The Supreme Court's definition of human nature in <I>Casey</I> has given us Eve without Adam, and Adam without Eve. We are solitary autonomous beings, unconnected, without responsibility for each other. The Court empowers us to define ourselves, to create our own universe, to be, as Genesis predicted, "like God."  In the same way in which the Supreme Court makes law without a constitutional standard, it has declared that there is no rule of law against which we must measure our own actions. We make the rule of law for ourselves, each one a different rule of law. So, for example, we often hear the familiar non sequitur, "I believe abortion is the taking of human life, but I would never want to impose my values on you."  It denies us the fundamental natural law standard of an objective basis of morality, and equally denies us the opportunity to strive to that perfection to which we are constituted.
<p>
That is our world today, and it comes from the disdaining of religion and of reason. The world of deconstructed philosophy, of private moralities, of God that cannot be mentioned in the public square leaves Eve without Adam, unborn children without their mothers, born children without their fathers, and the dying without hope. The homeless are not just those we see on the streets. Such a world leaves us all homeless. That is the Faustian bargain that the Supreme Court offers us in <I>Casey</I>.
<p>
Thus, there is little wonder that the philosophers of the school of natural law and the followers of revealed religion find themselves in a political, intellectual, and moral alliance today.

<p>
<b>Religious Doctrine and Human Liberty</b>
<p>
For the alliance of reason and faith to be effective, it must contend with issues of doctrine and with issues of liberty. The beauty of the natural law philosophy is that it is universal. It calls upon all persons to consider and freely to order their lives by an objective moral standard. Whether or not creationism can be justified scientifically, the rest of our society perceives it solely as a religious doctrine. Whether or not contraception is contrary to the natural law, the rest of our society perceives it as a Catholic doctrine. A simple rule of prudence requires that those values not be imposed. This is not to say, however, that the scientific shortcomings of evolutionary theory cannot be discussed. They should be. Nor that contraceptives should be distributed in the schools. We know the objective harm that brings and the invasion of the family it constitutes. But that is different from imposing those values as doctrines. Abortion, obviously, is qualitatively different because it is a universal question of how a moral society treats dependent life.
<p>
The other issue is liberty. Two points should be made here. First, we sometimes forget that under the plan of God, mankind was utterly free, except for eating of the tree of good and evil. As Pope John Paul II emphasizes, freedom and virtue depend upon there being an objective order, which we can accept or not. Without an objective moral order, there is no true freedom, for it has nothing to measure itself against. Second, modern natural law theory must acknowledge the great advances in the justification for liberty that 18th century natural rights theory made. Modern natural law theory, in its mature form, finds the freedom of the human individual rooted in the good, and holds that political authority is contingent upon that human freedom.
<p>
But what natural law offers in addition is that the free, flourishing individual prospers in his social relations, most especially in the family. What Adam Smith and John Locke presumed in their vaguely perceived notions of natural law and in the social experience of the Enlightenment was that these social relations would flourish of themselves. For the most part they were right. But we have learned in the two centuries past, and especially in this country, that those relations, the family, are much more fragile than we imagined and that for true liberty to be enjoyed, such relations need to be fostered and nurtured. For natural law not only judges what human laws ought not to be passed, but also illuminates the benign face of the law: It looks to those laws that ought to be enacted to assist human persons in the flourishing of their free individual personalities. Natural law is not only imperative; it is aspirational.
<P>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
When a philosophy -- even one like natural law -- is in the ascendancy, intellectual fatigue, as well as impatience with the imperfections any human system has, slowly brings on criticism and perhaps even rejection. But when order threatens to break down altogether, when chaos looms, then the mind reaches back to the stability of principle. Man cannot abide error for too long, for error produces a disintegration, a disorder of the soul, and a disorder of society. We can live a complex life; we can live a life of contradictions; but we cannot live an absurd life. That is our nature.
<p>
Whenever subjective relativism and objective truth have come into contest, whenever the choice is one or the other, man will ultimately opt for the truth, no matter how discomfiting it may be. Just look at whom we choose for heroes:
<p>
Is it Antigone or Creon?
<p>
Socrates or Alcibiades?
<p>
Is it Ruth, who embraces the One God despite the humiliation it brings, or her sister-in-law Orpah, who remains comfortable with the pagans?
<p>
Is it Lincoln or Douglas?
<p>
Solzhenitsyn or Brezhnev?
<p>
Jesus or Pilate?
<P>
Only when faith and reason are rejoined in mutually respecting friendship and are cognizant of liberty can the bonds of civil society, of civilization itself, be renewed. That moment may be upon us once again. May it come soon.

<h3>"First Principles in the Public Arena"</h3>
<b>By Governor John Engler</b><br>
<p>
Michigan Governor Engler delivered the first <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a> on Tuesday, September 26, 1995, at The Heritage Foundation, Washington D.C.
<p>

	This weekend, Michigan Republicans held a leadership conference on Mackinac Island. For all practical purposes, we met in honor of Dr. Russell Kirk. After listening to the various presidential candidates and to Speaker Gingrich, it was clear that many of the ideas Russell had written about since the 1950s not only had taken root, but had blossomed. He always said it took about 30 years for a new generation of ideas to enter the public arena--and in this, as in so much else, he proved right.
<p>
	I am honored to be in this redoubt of conservative thought to inaugurate the Russell Kirk Memorial Lectures. It is a humbling experience for me to stand in this auditorium, knowing that I follow in the footsteps of giants. Russell himself must have given some 60 lectures within these walls. In 1986, at a landmark Heritage event, President Reagan paid a wonderful tribute to the Sage of Mecosta, calling him a pillar of post-war conservative thought.
<p>
	Who could have foreseen it back in 1952, when Russell submitted a manuscript to Henry Regnery called <i>The Conservative Rout</i>? Strange as it may seem to us today, that was the original title Russell proposed for the classic the world would know as <i>The Conservative Mind</i>. Back in the early 1950s, Russell was concerned that there was not a more spirited defense of what he and T. S. Eliot called "the permanent things." But he never put his pen down in despair. Over the course of four decades, he wielded the "Sword of Imagination" against an "antagonist world" and gave new strength to conservative ideas.
<p>
	How the battle had turned at the close of the day, for Russell could see the makings of a liberal rout. One can only imagine what mordant comment he would have made about last November's historic elections and the resulting confusion and chagrin in the Liberal Mind, which more than a few are characterizing as brain-dead. Michigan's own Jack Kevorkian--otherwise known as Dr. Death--could be the poster boy of latter-day liberals.
<p>
	If you have ever been to St. Paul's Cathedral in London, you may have seen Sir Christopher Wren's tomb. Wren designed the cathedral and is buried there. On his tomb is an epitaph, which in translation reads, "If you seek my monument, look around you." I think that epitaph is apt for our purposes today, because if you seek a monument to Russell Kirk, look around  you.
<p>
	This foundation, this audience, and in significant ways this city, which today is becoming an epicenter of conservative policies and ideas, all bear Russell's mark. As Ed Feulner eulogized at last year's Memorial Mass in Russell's honor, the Sage of Mecosta "made a real impact on Washington. In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists, legislators, and staffers...of prudence and of taking the long view."
<p>
	Not just in Washington, but on both sides of the Atlantic, conservatives looked to Russell for inspiration and guidance. Closer to home, I sought his counsel as well. We both lived in central Michigan's "stump country," just two dozen miles from each other, and Russell was a trusted friend. He and Annette, whose hospitality is known around the world, always kept the door at Piety Hill open, not only for the refugee, the hobo, and the scholar, but also for a young legislator just out of college and eager to learn from Michigan's pre-eminent man of letters.
<p>
	I don't think Russell ever held public office except for a brief time as Justice of the Peace. He was, above all, a man of ideas. Yet he was wise to the nature of politics. He always used to say--and it's good advice to remember in Washington these days--that "politics is the art of the possible." The trick is not only to fight for reform, but to live to tell about it.
<p>
	As an aside, let me say that the Republican Party today has a great advantage over Democrats. It is conservative Republicans and their ideas that are driving the debate. And I think the more Americans get to know Republican ideas, the more they will vote for Republican candidates. But whatever their party affiliation, Russell had much to say to the men and women charged with the responsibility of governing. Nobody was more eloquent than Russell in defending what he called the "first principles" of conservative thought. At the center of these "first principles" is the apprehension that order, justice, and freedom are mutually dependent on one another.
<p>
	Another way Russell used to put it: For there to be order in society, there must be order in the soul--and vice-versa. You cannot have one without the other. So it is not just freedom, but ordered freedom that we must strive to preserve. Otherwise, the barbarians will come crashing through the gates.
<p>
	There are a number of first principles that Russell wrote about and that have been important to me as governor. What I would like to do today is tell you how I have tried to apply one of them in the public arena. It concerns the importance of community and the need to respect state and local government because they are closest to our communities.
<p>
	Here, as in so much else, Russell followed the lead of Edmund Burke. The great British statesman wrote that the true wellsprings of community are "the little platoons we belong to in society." By that quaint term, Burke was referring to the groups that we voluntarily seek to associate with and that give our lives meaning. Our church and alma mater, the professional and civic organizations to which we belong, the volunteer charities and friendships we seek out--these are the little platoons that enrich our lives and humanize our relations with one another.
<p>
	Russell early perceived that the centrifugal forces of modern times were tearing apart these little platoons, which are the fabric of our communities. He wrote:
<blockquote>
We have more voluntary organizations than has any other nation.... But it is tempting and easy to let centralized power assume the burdens which necessarily accompany the privileges of community.... I may add that this disintegration of community, and its supplanting by centralized authority, commonly have been accompanied by a proportionate decay of culture and morality.... A nation is no stronger than the numerous little communities of which it is composed.1</blockquote>	These words, though written some four decades ago, ring truer than ever today. They certainly resonate with Marvin Olasky's landmark work, <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, which I am sure Russell would have applauded. For in the court of public opinion, the verdict is in: We have seen the unintended consequences of a horrendous, $5 trillion experiment in centralized authority known as the Great Society. After three decades, even liberals are beginning to concede that the Great Society was neither great nor good for society.
<p>
	In one of his last Heritage lectures, Russell said that the centralizing tendency of the Great Society, combined with the centrifugal forces of modem times, had helped create "a mass of people who have lost...community, hope of betterment, moral convictions, habits of work, sense of personal responsibility, intellectual curiosity, membership in a healthy family, property, active participation in public concerns, religious associations, and awareness of the ends of human existence."2 How could this tragedy come about?
<p>
	At the diseased heart of the Great Society there evolved more than 300 welfare programs, a number of which rewarded ignorance, idleness, and illegitimacy--the absolute antithesis of the qualities you want a free citizenry to possess. These programs have worked untold mischief on the American republic.
<p>
	As many of you know, the welfare debate is a battleground on which, as governor, I have fought from the beginning. Soon after I took office, back in 1991, I made a priority of getting the Michigan legislature to abolish a state version of the Great Society	known as General Assistance. GA provided a monthly check to almost 100,000 able-bodied adults without children. In essence, it paid them not to work.
<p>
	We put an end to the program with some dispatch and said we wanted these tax-takers to become taxpayers. And you know what? Despite bitter denunciations in the liberal media at the time, not one of the four Democrats who challenged me in my 1994 re-election campaign called for the restoration of GA. That is significant because abolishing GA was, I believe, the first tangible sign in America that the nation was serious about ending welfare as we know it. Nobody else had said, "Get rid of a $250 million government welfare program; it won't exist next year." But that's what we did--and it signalled the beginning of the paradigm shift that is currently afoot.
<p>
	As my friends at the Heritage Foundation know, I have some thoughts about Washington's role in welfare. I am not an advocate of pruning federal programs, because those of you who are gardeners know that pruning just makes things grow faster than ever. What I advocate is getting a firm grip on the system as we know it and pulling it up by the roots. That means pulling welfare's roots out of Washington and letting the states decide what to transplant and what to reject. To stick with my gardening metaphor--and to use the words in a recent issue of <i><a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html">National Review</a></i>--let 50 flowers bloom instead of the weed patch in Foggy Bottom.
<p>
	As a result of last November's historic elections, the relationship between Washington and welfare is undergoing radical redefinition. Under Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole, the l04th Congress is taking an extraordinary step: It is beginning the process of relinquishing power and returning it to the 50 states. Getting Washington out of the way is the crucial first step in the long process of returning authority and responsibility to where they ultimately belong--to the "little platoons" of civil society, our families and neighborhoods, churches and charitable organizations.
<p>
	In the area of welfare, I and other governors are hopeful that this historic opportunity will result in no-strings-attached block grants. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: There is no devil in devolution. No-strings-attached block grants are the first crucial steps to meaningful reform. But I am not content to stop there. Ultimately, the goal of welfare reform is to cut federal taxes and return all the fiscal and policy initiatives to the states. This is consistent with America's heritage. There are both constitutional and historical grounds for removing the federal government from such programs as Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
<p>
	Two weeks ago, the Heritage Foundation teamed up with the Federalist Society to present a working conference on the Tenth Amendment. I do not know whether Russell's book <i>The Conservative Constitution</i> was cited, but it should have been, because in it we are reminded that the Constitution set up a federal government that was to be supreme in its sphere, while the states were to remain supreme in their sphere. Washington and the states were meant to be co-sovereigns, with a host of undelegated powers reserved to the states. Welfare is one of those areas in which the states were meant to be supreme.
<p>
	This point is buttressed by the fact that our Founders never gave any indication that welfare should be the responsibility of the federal government. America was at its founding, and still is in many ways, a nation of immigrants, and almost 100 percent of the immigrants who have come to our shores have been poor. The men who drafted our Constitution knew the face of poverty. Despite numerous innovations that came out of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, no one called for giving the federal government a role in alleviating poverty. Yet over the last 60 years, as we have moved from the social insurance system proposed by FDR to the massive giveaway programs enacted by LBJ, Uncle Sam has become Big Daddy. And a tragic number of American citizens have been hurt in the process.
<p>
	I would not be so adamant about getting Washington out of the way if I did not think the states could succeed. If given a chance, the states can and will succeed. Remember the classic by Jonathan Swift, <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>? We in the states are like poor Gulliver on the beach, tied down by small-minded Lilliputians who remind me of the army of federal bureaucrats in Washington. If, like Gulliver, we can extricate ourselves from the entanglement of federal rules and regulations, we will be free to experiment and find better ways of truly helping the needy go to work and become independent.
<p>
	In Michigan, for example, an array of welfare reform initiatives over the past three years is yielding dramatic results. One goal of reform has been to get people to work and thereby enable welfare recipients to accept more responsibility for their lives. Because Michigan recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children must sign a Social Contract, they are working, training for a job, or volunteering in communities at least 20 hours a week. As a result, the number of Michigan AFDC recipients earning income is up to an all-time high of almost 30 percent, compared to just 8 percent nationally.
<p>
	A second goal has been to shrink the size of welfare rolls and save taxpayers money. Again, because of our enforced Social Contract, over 67,000 cases have been closed since 1992 because families are earning enough to be independent. Consequently, Michigan's AFDC caseload has declined to its lowest level in over two decades--and that is saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars as a result.
<p>
	A third aim of reform has been to keep at-risk families intact. In Michigan, our family preservation programs have a proven track record of reducing foster care and helping troubled families work through their problems. Much of our success is due to the fact that we contract out to private agencies, many of them church-run, because they an important moral element in the battle against poverty.
<p>
	Finally, the most critical objective has been to lower the illegitimacy rate. Efforts of the public-private Michigan Abstinence Partnership have helped bring about the lowest teen pregnancy rate in the Great Lakes State in a decade. However, our task--and America's task--is far from finished. In Michigan, 70 percent of births to teen mothers are to unwed teen mothers. If you think that is shocking, in Detroit it is 95 percent.
<p>
	My friends, this is a crisis of unprecedented proportions. As a state we could move even more aggressively to tackle the problem were it not for one thing--and that thing is the federal government. Like Gulliver, the states have been tied down by Lilliputians in Washington who make reform difficult, if not impossible.
<p>
	I hope the people who complain about the lack of federal control over welfare reform will look at the example of states like Michigan. I also hope they will acknowledge that the 50 governors have at least one credential that nobody in Washington has: We governors must actually administer the welfare system. We are closer to the problem than any federal bureaucrat. We know what works and what doesn't. We know what needs changing and how to change it. And if our reforms are not working, we can tackle the problem quickly rather than wait literally years for the federal government to act. Fifty states experimenting will create what are tantamount to market forces that will encourage governors and state houses to be responsible to both tax-takers and taxpayers.
<p>
	Whatever the final shape of welfare when the 104th Congress adjourns, more is at stake than whether this group of conservatives or that wins the debate. At bottom, this is a fight for the freedom of the states to exercise their constitutional authority and responsibility. If the states lose and Congress insists it has the right to micromanage welfare programs among the 50 states, then an important principle of freedom will have been compromised.
<p>
	But I do not think the states will lose. And in this I draw strength from our good friend, Russell Kirk. One of the things I appreciated most about Russell was his ability, no matter what the challenges, "to let a little cheerfulness break in."
<p>
		I want to close on the last words of one of the last lectures he delivered here at Heritage. This passage summarizes both his belief in the "little platoons" and his indomitable spirit of hope:
<p><blockquote>
		Spritually and politically, the twentieth century has been a time of decadence. Yet as this century draws to a close, we may remind ourselves that ages of decadence sometimes have been followed by ages of renewal.
<p>		What can you do, young men and women of the rising generation of the 1990s, to raise up the human condition?... Why, begin by brightening the corner where you are, by improving one human...yourself, and by helping your neighbor.
<p>	You will not need to be rich or famous to take your part in redeeming the time: what you require for that task is moral imagination joined to right reason....
<p>	Shrug your shoulders at things indifferent; set your face against things evil; and by doing God's will...find that peace which passeth all understanding.3
</blockquote><p>

<P>
(Washington D.C., October 30, 1996) -- Empower America's Chief Economist, Lawrence A. 
Hunter released the following statement on the state of the American economy in response to 
today's report on third-quarter growth in gross domestic product (GDP):
<P>
"Is the economy better off today than it was four years ago?  Clearly not.  Today, the Commerce 
Department reported that the economy was growing at a paltry 2.2 percent annual rate in the 
third quarter after correcting for inflation.  Four years ago at this time, the economy was growing 
at a respectable 3 percent.  And, in the fourth quarter of 1992, real, inflation-adjusted economic 
growth leapt forward at 4.3 percent.  One must look long and hard for any economist who 
expects the economy to grow faster than 2.5 percent in the upcoming fourth quarter.
<P>
"This pessimistic assessment of the economy is reinforced by a report on declining wages issued 
earlier this week by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee (JEC).  The JEC report, which 
is based on a release of data by the nonpartisan Bureau of Labor Statistic (BLS), points out that 
inflation-adjusted ("real") median weekly earnings declined between the third quarters of 1995 
and 1996.  The current level of real median weekly earnings is below their level four years ago of 
$493 in the third quarter of 1992.
<P>
"Best economy in 30 years?  Hardly.  The truth is, we are experiencing the slowest economic 
expansion in more than 100 years."
<P>

<center><h2>Empower America's Chief Economist Warns,</h2>
<h3>Todays' GDP Numbers are a "Statistical Blip"</h3></center><p>
(Washington D.C., August 1, 1996) -- We shouldn't pop the corks on the champagne quite yet over today's reported 4.2 percent second quarter increase in GDP.  The fizz will quickly go out of these numbers as American workers realize that they do not mean an end to the treadmill economy we have been experiencing since the end of the 1980's<p>
<i>Empower America's</i> Chief Economist Lawrence Hunter said, "The American people, to whom GDP statistics are a mere abstraction, will take little solace in this report because this statistical blip in the GDP numbers is not translating into rising real wages.  During the same time period covered by this GDP report, second quarter 1996, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that usual weekly earnings of workers are at their lowest level in three years."<p>
Even before today's report was made public, Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Alan Greenspan, made it clear that the expected strong second quarter report was an aberration, both by his words and by the Fed's deeds.  Greenspan said he fully expected economic growth to fall back to its more typical anemic norm of  two-something expansion in the second half of the year.  Confirmation that the Fed does not take the second quarter blip seriously comes from the fact that it has refrained from raising interest rates as one would expect if the central bank were taking this aberrant report as indicative that the economy was anywhere near this strong.<p>
"Today's report also is consistent with the expectation that this preliminary 4.2 percent increase may well be revised downward in the months to come.  First quarter GDP, which originally was reported to have increased 2.8 percent, was revised downward by almost one third in today's report, to 2.0 percent," Hunter said.<p>

"Yesterday we learned from interviews with Secret Service agents (released by a House committee) that background investigations on White House employees found that more than 40 had used drugs; a few dozen showed drug usage had been within the last five years; and that among those few dozen people were individuals who had used cocaine, crack cocaine and hallucinogens.  We learned, too, that the Secret Service initially rejected White House passes to an unspecified number of White House employees because they were considered a security risk -- a recommendation which apparently was unacceptable to the Clinton administration.  Instead, the administration opted for a far more lenient policy -- a twice-per-year surprise drug test.  These are very disturbing revelations -- but ones which do not seem to trouble the Clinton administration at all.
<p>
I have also read the transcripts of Mike McCurry's July 17th press briefing in which he stated that "of course" he used illegal drugs during the 1970s.  What exactly did Mr. McCurry mean by "of course"?  That every young person used drugs in the 1970s?  Or that it was no big deal?  Why didn't Mr. McCurry show any regret for having used illegal drugs?  Mr. McCurry is wrong on all counts -- and he should admit that he was wrong.        
<p>
These revelations by Secret Service agents, combined with Mr. McCurry's comments are, I think, emblematic of the Clinton administration's cavalier and indifferent attitude toward illegal drug use.  The Clinton administration doesn't seem to care about this issue.  They seem unwilling to take a strong and unambiguous stand against drug use.  And this nation is now paying a very heavy price for the Clinton administration's indifference, in terms of wrecked and lost lives.      
<p>
Mr. McCurry's comments are of course not helpful.  But neither are they surprising.  After all, President Clinton's record on fighting illegal drug use is abysmal.  It is worth pointing out that this is not a partisan opinion.  Democratic Senator Joe Biden has been a strong critic of the administration's anti-drug efforts.  And it was Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel who said this about the Clinton administration:  "I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any administration that's been so silent on this great challenge [illegal drug use] to the American people."
<p>
Consider the record under Bill Clinton's watch: drug use among high school seniors has risen steadily since he took office.  The number of 12- to 17-year-olds using marijuana has almost doubled.  Methamphetamine emergency room cases are up over 300 percent.  LSD use has reached the highest rate since record-keeping started in 1975.  Drug-related emergency room admissions are at record levels.  And these trends have occurred after real progress was made against drug use in the mid-1980s and early 1990s.    
<p>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy.  The Clinton administration suffers from moral diffidence on this issue.  Policy follows attitude.  In 1991, when asked about his past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never "broken any drug law."  A year later, he admitted that when he was in England, he had experimented with marijuana but he said, "I didn't like it.  I didn't inhale it, and never tried it again."  Later, when asked whether he would inhale if he had to do it over again, he answered, to laughter: "Sure, if I could.  I tried before."  
<p>
Then there is President Clinton's former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who had been one of this administration's most vocal voices on drugs and who had favorable words about drug legalization.  And of course now we have Mr. McCurry's comments. 
<p>
During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her "Just Say No" campaign.  But it turns out that "Just Say No" is far more effective than "I didn't inhale" or an attitude of "of course I used illegal drugs."
<p>
I realize that Mr. McCurry, a skilled press secretary, was simply reflecting the attitude of the President and his administration.  But I would be interested in the answer to two questions:  first, what does General Barry McCaffrey think about Mr. McCurry's comments and the underlying attitude they expressed?  And second, does President Clinton have any objection if a person who has used cocaine, crack cocaine or hallucinogenic drugs during the past five years is working in his administration?  Is there any kind of recent (pre-White House) drug use or drug activity that would disqualify somebody from joining the Clinton administration?  Perhaps the president could clarify what his policy is on these matters.       

<p>
On the issue of fighting illegal drugs -- like so many other issues of national importance -- the American people deserve better from their president."

NEW LEADERSHIP </h3></center>

<center><h4><i>Conservative advocacy organization outlines focused agenda.</i></center></h4>
<P><hr size=3 width=50%>
<P>





<i>May 6, 1996, Washington, D.C. </i>
<p>On behalf of the Board of Directors, Empower America Co-Directors William J. Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber today officially announced the appointment of Thomas W. Weisel as Chairman of the Board and Tex Lezar as President and Chief Executive Officer.  Weisel has served as acting Chairman since the Fall of 1995. 
<p>
Weisel is founder, Chairman, and CEO of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, one of the nation's leading securities firms.  Under Weisel's leadership, Montgomery's annual revenues have grown over the last 25 years to exceed $500 million.  Weisel holds five National Master's titles in cycling and served in the past as Chairman of U.S. Skiing, the governing body of the U.S. Ski Team.
<p>
Jack Kemp called Weisel, who specializes in taking smaller "growth" companies public, "the embodiment of the American dream."  Kemp went on, "Thom has demonstrated in his professional life that entrepreneurial capitalism works.  He has spent his life pushing entrepreneurs toward success.  His real-world insight and world-class fundraising capabilities will continue to be of tremendous benefit to Empower America."
<p>
William Bennett said, "Thom Weisel is wonderfully accomplished in a whole range of pursuits.  His tenure with us has brought needed stability and energy to Empower America."  
<p>
Empower America's new President and CEO, Tex Lezar, comes to the organization from Dallas, Texas, where he is engaged in private law practice.  Lezar, who served as Assistant U.S. Attorney General under President Reagan and edited Making Government Work: A Conservative Agenda for the States, has been a prominent litigator and appellate lawyer in Texas since 1977.  In 1994, Lezar was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Texas.  
<p>
Bennett, Kemp, Kirkpatrick, and Weber jointly said, "Tex Lezar comes from the school of Ronald Reagan and adheres to its credo -- an optimistic faith in freedom, democratic capitalism, strong national defense, and time-honored values.  He has a sound knowledge of public policy and politics, and brings to Empower America the fruits of an impressive career in government, law, and politics.  We are very pleased to have Tex aboard."
<p>
Former Empower America Board Chairman Steve Forbes will remain an active member of the Board.  Forbes said of Empower America's new leadership, "I am glad to see Empower America in the capable hands of Thom Weisel and Tex Lezar.  I look forward to working closely with both of them as an Empower America Board member."  William Dal Col, Empower America's former president, will be working with Forbes while continuing informally to advise Empower America. 
<p>
Under the leadership of Weisel and Lezar, as well as the Co-Directors, Empower America plans a very aggressive, focused policy agenda for the remainder of 1996.  
<p>
<UL>
<LI>On the economic front, Empower America will expand its efforts to promote a dynamic, pro-growth, pro-family, single-rate tax system based on the recommendations of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, which Jack Kemp chaired for Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich.  Additionally, Empower America will promote a plan gradually and responsibly to privatize our Social Security system, while honoring our obligation to those who have paid into the system and must be protected. <p>
<LI>Empower America is strongly supporting an urban renaissance agenda focusing on legislation proposed by members of Congress such as Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, Senator Abraham of Michigan, Senator Mack of Florida, Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton of Washington D.C.<p>
<LI>Empower America will continue to make the broader argument for the need to restore decency and civility to American life.  It will continue its ongoing campaign in the area of popular culture, including the content of television and music.  It will also continue to address the issues of crime, drugs, educational choice, and adoption.  In addition, Empower America will begin systematically to address issues dealing with judicial activism and legal reform.
<p>
<LI>In international affairs, Empower America will continue its advocacy of an American foreign policy based on U.S. national interests and which reflects the need for the U.S. to exercise effective and prudent international leadership.  The support for the expansion and consolidation of new democracies, the restoration of an honest and sound money policy for America and the world, and furtherance of free- and open- global trade arrangements are of principal concern.  Empower America supports a strong national security posture and the development and deployment of a national missile defense system.

<P>
(Washington D.C.; October 25, 1995) On the heels of their successful campaign against violently obscene music lyrics, Empower America co-director <a href="/empower/bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> and Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) will hold a Washington <a href="/empower/pr1026a.html">press conference</a> at 10:00am tomorrow to launch a new phase in their campaign against the cultural decomposition to which the entertainment industry is contributing. Specifically, Dr. Bennett and Sen. Lieberman will target certain day-time television talk shows which repeatedly focus on sordid subject matter, petitioning producers to acknowledge their responsibilities toward their viewers, both children and the general public, rather than just the profits they may stand to gain from them. Once again, Dr. Bennett and Sen. Lieberman are not calling for content censorship but corporate citizenship.
<P>
Daytime television talk show producers will meet this weekend in New York City for the "Talk Summit" to discuss program content.

<title>THE CASE AGAINST 
THE US EDUCATION DEPARTMENT</title>
<center><h2>THE CASE AGAINST <br>
THE US EDUCATION DEPARTMENT</h2>

<h4><i>by</i><br>
<i>Jennifer A. Marshall and Eric Unsworth</i>
</h4></center>
<hr size="3" width="30%"><br>
A century and a half ago, Alexis de Tocqueville recognized that increased centralization and bureaucratization take away civic and individual responsibility: "[A] centralized administration is fit only to enervate the nations in which it exists, by incessantly diminishing their local spirit."<p>

It isn't just fiscal crisis that necessitates the latest round of proposed budget cuts -- our social crisis demands that the role of the federal government be cut back.  Bureaucracies like the US Education Department breed local apathy and mediocrity and should be eliminated -- even if we had a budget surplus.<p>

Once upon a time the federal role in education was constitutional: it had none. Things began to change in the 1930s when the New Deal brought increasing federal involvement.  Later, under President Eisenhower, Congress created the cabinet-level Department of  Health, Education and Welfare.  In 1965, Lyndon Johnson rammed through Congress the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which vastly expanded federal involvement.<p>

Then, in 1976, candidate Jimmy Carter promised a separate education department and received the backing of the National Education Association (NEA) as a result.  In 1979, President Carter, facing a liberal challenge from Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), set about to make good on his promise.  But there was strong opposition from the American Federation of Teachers, from much of higher education, and from the general public.  The AFL-CIO attacked the idea and even the <i>Washington Post </i>argued that bureaucratic costs would increase.<p>

Marvin Stone, writing for <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, articulated the fears of many Americans:  "Would the Education Department have the power to tamper with America's traditional local control of education?  Of course it would.  Where there is money to be given, there is the implicit responsibility to make sure that it is spent according to the purposes of the donors -- or else."  Though the bill establishing the department stated emphatically that state and local control would not be undermined, Stone was not convinced, citing a "subtle schizophrenia meandering through the legislation" that revealed the authors' true intentions.<p>
									

The US Education Department, then, is a bureaucracy with a dubious past.  Its conception was of doubtful legitimacy, given the strictures of the Constitution and tradition.  The circumstances of its birth were also suspect -- more or less a political payoff to the NEA.  And the US Education Department has not improved American education.<p>

Before its creation, President Carter could point to "[o]ur Nation's pluralistic education system" as "the most competent and open in the world."  No longer so.  According to former Secretary of Education William Bennett, more than 90 percent of the students entering US colleges today would not be admitted to institutions of higher learning anywhere else in the world.<p>

Meanwhile, the US Education Department has grown into a huge bureaucratic "blob,"  elbowing its way into places it does not belong.  Federal intrusiveness reached a new height with passage of Goals 2000, which John Jennings, director of the Center on National Education Policy, calls "a monumental movement <i>away</i> from local control of education" (emphasis added).<p>

Goals 2000 promotes national education goals and standards that override local priorities and ignore the fact that many private entities have developed gauges for student learning.  University of Virginia professor E.D. Hirsch has written a series of books on cultural literacy, describing fundamentals of education at each grade level.  The Family Research Council has published an outline of US history entitled <i>Let Freedom Ring</i>.  William Bennett's best-selling <i>Book of Virtues</i> is a wonderful source on America's literary heritage.  All of these examples meet the need for a high academic standard.<p>

How is it possible that a program like Goals 2000 -- quite inimical to American tradition -- has become the manual for running local schools?  Partly through subterfuge:  the insistent repetition that it is entirely voluntary.  Partly because the profound crisis of American education has convinced many that only an enormous federal initiative can cope with it.  But this conviction is based on a fallacy: <i> the fallacy that the federal government has money of its own</i>.  Our culture of dependency has forgotten that the only money the US Education Department or any other federal agency has, is money that citizens have earned.<p>

Tocqueville's lesson has been relearned in our times:  centralization and huge bureaucracies don't work very well. That truth swept away the regimes of the Soviet Union and half a host of other countries.  Finally, it's beginning to hit home, too.<p>  

Today, no politician would dare highlight the facts which President Carter touted in his proposal for a US Education Department:  over 150 programs, 16,200 employees, and a budget of more than $13 billion, making Education larger than five other departments.  Such big-government philosophy has been rightfully stigmatized.<p>  

Bureaucracy must be pruned back to effect a renewal of the local spirit that Alexis de Tocqueville praised so highly in 1835:<p>

<blockquote>I know of no people who have established schools so numerous and efficacious, places of public worship better suited to the wants of the inhabitants, or roads kept in better repair.  Uniformity or permanence of design, the minute arrangement of details, and the perfection of administrative system must not be sought for in the United States; what we find there is the presence of a power which, if it is somewhat wild, is at least robust, and an existence checkered with accidents, indeed, but full of animation and effort.</blockquote>

It's time to disestablish the US Education Department -- for the sake of American education, our fiscal health, and the renewal of local spirit.<p><br>

<title>DISESTABLISHING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</title>
</head>
<BODY>
<center><h2>DISESTABLISHING THE<br> DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h2></center>
<h4><center>Testimony of Robert G. Morrison<br>
Education Policy Analyst<br>
Family Research Council<br>
before the House Committee on Economic<br>
and Educational Opportunities <br>
June 29, 1995</center>
</h4><hr size="3" width="30%"><br>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:  my name is Robert G. Morrison and I am here to represent Gary Bauer and the Family Research Council.  Our organization serves more than 250,000 members nationwide.  I served with Gary Bauer in the U.S. Department of Education from 1985-87.  My testimony today will call for the disestablishment of the Department of Education and the repeal of Goals 2000, the Educate America Act. <p>

In 1979, when President Jimmy Carter first proposed the creation of a U.S. Department of Education to repay the National Education Association for its political support,  columnist Marvin Stone warned of  the centralization of power over education:  writing for <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, Stone asked:  "Would the Education Department have the power to tamper with America's traditional local control of education?  Of course it would.  Where there is money to be given, there is the implicit responsibility to make sure that it is spent according to the purposes of the donors -- or else."  Despite half-hearted objections at the time, the Department has moved inexorably toward greater and greater control over local education.  With Goals 2000, the U.S. Education Department and other federal bureaucracies seek to tighten their grip on the genuine education reform movement and extinguish it. <p>

Of course, these ceaseless efforts at centralization will fail.  They must fail, because they sap local community spirit and individual responsibility.  They must fail because, as Mr. Jefferson said:  "If we waited for Washington to tell us when to sow and when to reap, we should soon want bread."  They must fail for an even more profound reason.  Alexis de Tocqueville has been recently quoted both by President Bill Clinton and by Speaker Gingrich.  But Tocqueville, as a genius of political science, explained <i>why</i> the attempt to centralize administration ultimately fails.<p>

<i>However enlightened and skillful a central power may be, it cannot of 
itself embrace all the details of the life of a great nation.  Such vigilance exceeds the powers of man. And when it attempts unaided to create and set in motion so many complicated springs, it must submit to a very imperfect result or exhaust itself in bootless efforts. <br>
							- - Alexis de Tocqueville
							Democracy in America, 1835
</i><p>
"Imperfect results" and  "bootless efforts" pretty well describe the record of the U.S. Education Department.  Under the spur of Goals 2000, the Department has seen fit to endorse the new national history standards.  These politically-correct standards seek to teach all American students that Madonna and the Simpsons are significant figures, while neglecting Paul Revere, the Wright Brothers, Marian Anderson and Jonas Salk.  They speak of "Soviet advances in space" and the <i>Challenger</i> disaster, while completely omitting the U.S. landing on the moon even though Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a respected liberal historian, has said that the moon landing may be the most significant event of the twentieth century.  Worse, the standards could be fairly termed "anti-American" history standards because they teach young people that U.S.-Soviet "swordplay" led to the American involvement in Korea, Vietnam and U.S. interventions around the world.  Never do the standards speak of Soviet invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Afghanistan.  Never do the standards acknowledge communist efforts at subversion in the U.S. or Western Europe.  We urge this committee and the full House to join the Senate in denouncing these history standards.<p>

Not only do we at Family Research Council believe that the national history standards that have been produced are unacceptable, we believe that <i>any</i> effort of the federal government to dispense official truth is misguided and dangerous.  We have only to look at the Clinton administration's recently reported failure in the area of childhood immunizations to recognize the harm that government can do when it manufactures a crisis based on faulty data and a political agenda.  Yet, if there are any of our liberal friends who still defend the idea of a political determination of  U.S. history, we would ask them to consider this:  what if national history and economics standards were to be devised by Professor Gingrich, Professor Gramm and Professor Armey?<p>

The reality in contemporary American life is that parents, taxpayers and citizens generally are not of one accord about all education programs.  There is broad support, measured by polls, for safe and drug-free schools.  There is consistent public backing for schools which teach children reading, writing, arithmetic and history, for schools which impart reliable standards of right and wrong.  But there is no stable consensus on many other hotly-debated issues.   Family life and sex education continue to be points of contention.  Methods of teaching reading, similarly, divide Americans.  So, too, does the teaching of evolution.  Even bilingual education is fraught with controversy.  What the Education Department and Goals 2000 do is put the federal government in the middle of all these controversies. <p>

When the federal government becomes an antagonist, it is viewed increasingly as hostile to one or another group of parents or interests.  That is why we at Family Research Council support the <i>disestablishment</i> of the U.S. Department of Education and the <i>repeal</i> of Goals 2000.  We seek the return of decision-making  authority  to local communities -- to elected school boards which are close to the people they serve.  We also strongly support parental choice of schools.  Only when every parent can freely choose a safe and effective public, private, religious or home school will we have an end to the interminable clashes over education and values. <p>

Many in the education establishment, we know, question whether parents are capable of
wisely choosing a school for their children.  To this we can only answer:  if parents are capable of choosing presidents, governors and members of congress, then surely they can choose a school.  Further, if advocates of a public school monopoly persist on this point, we must challenge them.  If Americans cannot make an <i>educated </i>choice of schools for their own children, whom they love, then who bears the responsibility for their failure? We have had compulsory public schools in this country for a century and a half.  Nearly ninety percent of Americans attend those schools.  The fact is, of course, parental choice works.  That's why some of those most knowledgeable about education -- including teachers' union members, the Clintons and the Gores -- choose their own children's' schools. <p>

Our vision for education reform includes a de-centralization of decision-making which will not only be effective in getting us "back to basics,"  but which will also reinvigorate democracy at the grassroots.  One of the reasons why Goals 2000 will fail is because it saps local initiative and disperses accountability.  There are also historical reasons.  We have attempted a more modest, arguably a more realistic national goals effort before.<p>

 In 1984, the Reagan administration sought to set out Goals 1990.  It hoped to have American students recoup just <i>one-half </i>of the points lost in the SATs since the mid-60s.  Initially, there were some hopeful upticks.  But, by the end of the decade of the 80s, it became clear that American students were not listening to even the best lectures from the Bully Pulpit.  In 1990, President Reagan had retired to California, deservedly honored for his central role in the defeat of communism, respected throughout the world for unleashing a great and productive economy and looked to with gratitude by millions of American families for his championing of parental rights and traditional values.  No one criticized Ronald Reagan for the failure of U.S. students to achieve Goals 1990. <p>

The education establishment says that "kids deserve a place at the table with the President."  It's an attractive soundbite.  But it would be far better for us to have a nation of  "education mothers and fathers" and empowered local education leaders than it would be to hold out a role for the President or Congress that is neither realistic nor constitutionally appropriate.  The truth is, the President and Congress are always going to be preoccupied with taxing and trading, with national defense and international cooperation.  We need to move beyond "kids as props" to show Washington's intimate concern for education. <p>

This Congress has before it legislation which will disestablish the Department of Education and repeal Goals 2000.  Family Research Council shares these objectives.  We look forward to working with the members of this committee and with your staff to perfect it.  We urge this committee to give the resources and the responsibility back to the parents, taxpayers and locally elected leaders who can most effectively act to improve education. <p>

To de-centralize education decision-making is to recognize once again "the genius of the people" of which Madison spoke in <i>The Federalist Papers</i>.  By disestablishing the U.S. Department of Education and repealing Goals 2000, this Congress will demonstrate its respect for the Constitution and, especially, the Tenth Amendment.  This Congress will show that it listens to the petitions and the concerns of millions of parents.  Congress will also prove that it is serious about cutting wasteful federal spending.  While this action may not gain this body the title of  the "Education Congress" from the vested interest, it will win for this Congress a new measure of gratitude and respect for restoring "Democracy in America."<p><br>

<h2>NEA Yearly Report: Agenda for 1995</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
The Association believes that closed public school buildings should be 
sold or leased only to those organizations that do not provide direct 
educational services to students and/or are not in direct competition 
with public schools. <p>
A-11.  Federal Financial Support for Education. <p>
The Association asserts that a major federal role is to collect basic 
data to be used in public schools and to engage in research, 
development, and consultation activities.  The Association further 
believes that funding for federal programs should be substantially 
increased. <p>
A-13.  Basic Financial Support of Public Education. <p>
Funds must be provided for programs to alleviate race, gender, and 
sexual orientation discrimination and to eliminate portrayal of race, 
gender, and sexual orientation stereotypes in the public schools.<p> 
A-27.  Deleterious Programs. <p>
The National Education Association believes that the following 
programs and practices are detrimental to public education and must be 
eliminated:  privatization, performance contracting, tax credits for 
tuition to private and parochial schools, voucher plans (or funding 
formulas that have the same effect as vouchers), planned program 
budgeting systems (PPBS), and evaluations by private, profit-making 
groups. <p>
 A-28.  Federally or State-Mandated Choice/Parental Option Plans. <p>
The Association opposes federally or state-mandated choice or parental 
option plans. <p>
A-29.  Tuition Tax Credits. <p>
The Association believes that all federal and state legislation 
designed to establish or implement plans for prekindergarten through 
grade 12 tuition tax credits is detrimental to the public interest and 
urges it affiliates to work for the defeat of such legislation. <p>
A-30.  Voucher Plans. <p>
The Association beleives that legislation or ballot 
initiatives/referenda designed to establish or implement 
prekindergarten through grade 12 voucher plans are detrimental to the 
public interest and calls upon its affiliates to work for the defeat 
of such actions. <p>
B-1.  Early Childhood Education. <p>
The National Education Association supports early childhood education 
programs in the public schools for children from birth through age 
eight.  The Association supports a high-quality program of transition 
from home and/or preschool to the public kindergarten or first grade.  
The Association further believes that early childhood education 
programs should include a full continuum of services for parents and 
children, including child care, child development, developmentally 
appropriate and diversity-based curricula, special education, and 
appropriate bias-free screening services.  The Association believes 
that federal legislation should be enacted to assist in organizing the 
implementation of fully funded early childhood education programs 
offered through the public schools.  These programs should be 
available to all children on an equal basis and should include 
mandatory kindergarten with compulsory attendance. <p>
B-7.  Sexism in Education. <p>
The Association endorses the use of nonsexist language by all schools.  
The Association further believes that sexism and sex discrimination 
must be eliminated from the curriculum. <p>
B-8.  Sexual Orientation Education.   <p>
The National Education Association recognizes the importance of 
raising the awareness and increasing the sensitivity of staff, 
students, parents, and the community to sexual orientation in our 
society.  The Association therefore supports the development of 
positive plans that lead to effective ongoing training programs for 
education employees for the purpose of identifying and eliminating 
sexual orientation stereotyping in the educational setting.  Such 
programs should attend to but not be limited to - <p>
<ul>	
<li> Accurate portrayal of the roles and contributions of gay, 
lesbian, and bisexual people throughout history, with acknowledgement 
of their sexual orientation, 
<li>  The acceptance of diverse sexual orientation and the 
awareness of sexual stereotyping whenever sexuality and/or tolerance of diversity is 
taught, 
<li>  Elimination of sexual orientation name-calling and jokes in 
the classroom. 
<li>  Support for the celebration of a Lesbian and Gay History 
Month as a means of acknowledging the contributions of lesbians, gays, 
and bisexuals throughout history. 
</ul><p> 
B-20.  Educational Programs for Limited English Proficiency Students. <p>
The Association urges that those students whose primary language is 
other than English be placed in bilingual education programs to 
receive instruction in their native language from qualified teachers 
until such time as English proficiency is achieved.  The Association 
believes bilingual education programs should be promoted and supported 
at the federal, state, and local levels. <p>
B-22.  Adolescent Pregnancy and Parenting. <p>
The Association recommends that special programs for adolescents be 
implemented to include - <p>
<ul>
<li>Development of positive self-esteem and self concept. 
<li>Establishment of on-site child care services. 
</ul><p>
B-27.  Multicultural/Global Education. <p>
The National Education Association believes that multiculturalism is 
the process of valuing differences and incorporating these values into 
behavior for the goal of achieving the common good.  The Association 
further believes that multicultural/global education is a way of 
helping students perceive the cultural diversity of U.S. citizenry so 
that they may develop pride in their cultural legacy.  
Multicultural/global education develops an awareness of cultures and 
an appreciation of our interdependency in sharing the world's limited 
resources. <p>
B-30.  Career Education. <p>
The career education concept needs to include programs in gender-free 
career awareness.  The Association believes that educational programs 
for all students should be developed that will enhance self-esteem. <p>
B-34.  Family Life Education. <p>
The Association recommends that programs be established for both 
students and parents and supported at all educational levels to 
promote - <p>
<ul>
<li>The development of self-esteem. 
<li>Education in human growth and development. 
</ul><p>
The Association believes that education in these areas must be 
presented as part of an antibiased culturally sensitive program. <p>
B-35.  Sex Education. <p>
The Association recognizes that the public school must assume an 
increasingly important role in providing the instruction.  Teachers 
and health professionals must be qualified to teach in this area and 
must be legally protected from censorship and lawsuits.  The 
Association urges its affiliates and members to support appropriately 
established sex education programs, including information on sexual 
abstinence, birth control, and family planning, diversity of culture, 
diversity of sexual orientation, parenting skills, prenatal care, 
sexually transmitted diseases, incest, sexual abuse, sexual 
harassment.  To facilitate the realization of human potential, it is 
the right of every individual to live in an evironment of freely 
available information, knowledge, and wisdom about sexuality. <p>
B-36.  AIDS Education. <p>
The National Education Association recommends that educational 
institutions establish comprehensive acquired immunodeficiency syndrom 
(AIDS) education programs as an integral part of the school 
curriculum. <p>
B-38.  Environmental Education. <p>
The Association further urges the development and improvement of 
educational programs that will - <p>
<ul>	
<li>  Promote the concept of the interdependence of humanity and 
nature. 
<li>  Develop an awareness of the effects of past, present, and 
future population growth patterns on world civilization, human 
survival, and the environment. 
<li>  Promote an understanding of the necessity to protect 
endangered, threatened, and rare species. 
<li>  Promote an understanding of the necessity to protect the 
earth's finite resources. 
</ul><p>
The Association urges its affiliates to support environmental programs 
n school systems. <p>
B-52.  Standardized Testing of Students. <p>
The National Education Association opposes standardized testing that 
is mandated by local, state, or national authority.  The Association 
also opposes the use of these tests to compare one student, staff 
member, school, or district with another. <p>
B-63.  Home Schooling. <p>
The National Education Association believes that home schooling 
programs cannot provide the student with the comprehensive education 
experience.  The Association believes that if parental preference home 
schooling study occurs, students enrolled must meet all state 
requirements.  Instruction should be by persons who are licensed by 
the appropriate state education licensure agency, and a curriculum 
approved by the state department of education should be used.  The 
Association further believes that home schooling programs should be 
limited to the children of immediate family, with all expenses being 
borne by the parents. <p>
First New B.  Diversity. <p>
The National Education Association believes that diversity is any 
combination of similarities and differences of people in community, 
work places, school systems, or similar environments.  Some examples 
are race, ethnicity, color, national origin, language, geographic 
location, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, physical ability, 
size, and marital, parental, or economic status.  The Association 
further believes that all education employees must recognize and 
respect diversity that exists among students and all the peoples. <p>
Second New B.  Global Education. <p>
The National Education Association beleives that global education 
increases respect and awareness of planet earth and its people.  
Global education imparts information about cultures and an 
appreciation of our interdependency in sharing the world's resources 
to meet mutual human needs. <p>
C-1.  Health Care for All Children. <p>
The National Education Association believes that every child should 
have direct and confidential access to comprehensive health care.  The 
Association urges its affiliates to support legislation to provide 
comprehensive health care to all children. <p>
C-7.  Day Care. <p>
The National Education Association believes that all child care 
centers should be examined and monitored on a continuous basis, and 
additiona legislation should be sought as necessary to maintain the 
highest quality child care.  The Association encourages school 
districts and educational institutions to establish on-site child care 
for preschoolers, students, the children of students, and the children 
of staff members. <p>
C-23.  Comprehensive School Health Programs and Services. <p>
The National Education Association believes that every child should 
have direct and confidential access to comprehensive health, social, 
and psychological programs and services.  The Association also 
believes that programs in the schools should provide a planned 
sequential, K-12 health education curriculum that integrates various 
health topics (such as drug abuse, violence, universal precautions, 
and HIV education).  The Association believes that services in the 
schools should include - <p>
<ul>
<li> Counseling programs that provide developmental guidance and 
broad-based interventions and referrals, 
<li>Comprehensive school-based, community-funded student health 
care clinics, 
<li> If deemed appropriate by local choice, family-planning 
counseling and access to birth control methods with instruction in 
their use. 
</ul><p>
C-24.  School Counseling Programs. <p>
The National Education Association believes that guidance and 
counseling programs should be integrated into the entire education 
system, beginning at the prekindergarten level. <p>
C-29.  Student Sexual Orientation. <p>
The Association believes that every school district and educational 
institution should provide counseling and suicide prevention programs 
by trained personnel for students who are struggling with their 
sexual/gender orientation. <p>
C-30.  Placement of Students with HIV/AIDS. <p>
The Association believes that students should not be refused 
admittance to school or subjected to any other adverse action solely 
because they have tested positive for HIV or have been diagnosed as 
having AIDS. <p>
C-31.  Suicide Prevention Programs. <p>
The National Education Association believes that suicide prevention 
programs including prevention, intervention, and postvention must be 
developed and implemented.  The Association urges its affiliates to 
ensure that these programs are an integral part of the school program. <p>
C-34.  Drug and Alcohol Testing of Students. <p>
The National Education Association believes that mandatory drug and 
alcohol testing of students without probable cause is an unwarranted 
and unconstitutional invasion of privacy and opposes such testing. <p>
C-40.  Gender Equity in Athletic Programs. <p>
The National Education Association believes that at all educational 
levels female and male students must have equal opportunity to 
participate in athletic programs.  The Association urges that athletic 
funds for facilities, equipment, and remuneration of staff be 
allocated equally between female and male programs. <p>
D-18.  Competency Testing and Evaluation. <p>
The National Eduation Association believes that competency testing 
must not be used as a condition of employment, license retention, 
evaluation, placement, ranking, or promotion of licensed teachers. <p>
E-9.  Academic and Professional Freedom. <p>
The National Education Association believes that academic freedom is 
essential to the teaching profession.  Academic freedom includes the 
rights of teachers and learners to explore and discuss divergent 
points of view.  The Association further believes that legislation and 
regulations that mandate or permit the teaching of religious doctrines 
and/or groups that promote anti-public education agendas violate both 
student and teacher rights.  The Association urges it affiliates to 
seek repeal of these mandates where they exist. <p>
F-4.  Affordable Health Care. <p>
The Association urges its affiliates to do all they can to enroll our 
members, their dependents, domestic partners, and retired education 
employees in comprehensive, affordable health insurance plans. <p>
F-34.  Drug and Alcohol Testing.  <p>
The Association believes that 
mandatory and/or random drug and alcohol testing of employees and job 
applicants is an unwarranted and unconstitutional invasion of privacy 
and opposes such testing. <p>
F-36.  Employees with HIV/AIDS. <p>
The National Education Association believes that education employees 
shall not be fired, nonrenewed, suspended (with or without pay), 
transferred, or subjected to any other adverse employment action 
solely because they have tested positive for the human 
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrom (HIV/AIDS) 
antibody or have been diagnosed as having HIV/AIDS. <p>
H-6.  National Health Care Policy. <p>
The Association supports the adoption of a single-payer health care 
plan for all residents of the United States, its territories, and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. <p>
H-10.  Statehood for the District of Columbia. <p>
The Association urges its affiliates to support efforts to achieve 
statehood for the District of Columbia. <p>
New H.  Celebration of Diversity in Thanksgiving. <p>
The National Education Association believes that Thanksgiving is the 
recognition of unity and the rich American diversity that was embodied 
in the settlement of America.  The Association further believes that 
this national holiday must celebrate the coming together of peoples 
and the inclusion of all immigrants as a part of this great diverse 
country. <p>
I-11.  Civil Rights. 
The Association calls upon Americans to eliminate - by statute and 
practice - barriers of race, color, national origin, religion, 
philosophical beliefs, political beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, 
age, disability, size, marital status, and economic status that 
prevent some individuals, adult or juvenile, from exercising rights 
enjoyed by others. <p>
I-13.  Family Planning. <p>
The National Education Association supports family planning, including 
the right to reproductive freedom.  The Association further urges the 
implementation of community-operated, school-based family planning 
clinics that will provide intensive counseling by trained personnel. <p>
I-18.  Immigration. <p>
The Assocation opposes any policies that deny human rights, civil 
rights, or educational opportunities to imigrants and their children 
regardless of their immigration status. <p>
I-22.  Freedom of Creative Expression. <p>
The National Education Association supports freedom of expression in 
the creative arts and therefore deplores any efforts by government to 
suppress, directly or indirectly, such expression.  The Association 
further supports the freedom of publicly funded agencies to exercise 
judgment in the awarding of grants to individuals and organizations. <p>
I-25.  Human Relations in the School. <p>
The Association calls for school recruitment and staffing policies 
that will ensure culturally diverse school employees [and] appropriate 
classroom and other student-related activities, particularly those 
that are responsive to the cultural diversity and historical 
backgrounds of our society. <p>
I-27.  Sectarian Practices in the School Program. <p>
The National Education Association believes that the constitutional 
provisions on the establishment of and the free exercise of religion 
in the First Amendment require that there be no sectarian practices in 
the public school program. <p>
I-28.  Control of Guns. <p>
The National Education Association believes that stricter legislation 
is needed to control guns and other deadly weapons. <p>
I-46.  English as the Official Language. <p>
The National Education Association recognizes the importance of an 
individual's native language and culture and the need to promote and 
preserve them.  The Association believes that efforts to legislate 
English as the official language disregard cultural pluralism; deprive 
those in need of education, social services, and employment; and must 
be challenged. <p>
I-49.  Equal Opportunity for Women. <p>
The Association supports the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the 
U.S. Constitution.  The Association urges its affiliates to support 
ratification of such an amendment.  Personnel policies must include 
family leave, maternity leave, paternity leave, leave for adoption of 
a child, child-care leave, and professional leave.  The Association 
believes that sexism and sex discrimination must be eliminated and 
endorses the use of nonsexist language. <p>
New I.  Freedom of Religion. <p>
The Association opposes federal or state legislation or other mandates 
that would require school districts to schedule a moment of silence.  
The Association particularly opposes a moment of silence as a 
condition for receiving federal, state, or other funds. <p>
<hr>
Typist's note: - So...there you have it.  Kind of makes you wonder, 
when exactly is it that these good folks have time to believe, urge, 
recommend, promote the instruction of students in such obviously 
unimportant areas as math, science, reading, writing, comprehension.   <p>
My suggestion -  TAKE YOUR KIDS AND RUN FOR THE NEAREST EXIT FROM THE 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS!  <p>

If further centralization of education and added bureaucracy will improve America's schools, if federal coercion will promote school autonomy, if government nannies are expert teachers of parenting skills -- then Goals 2000 is exactly what the ailing American education system needs.<p>

But Americans overwhelmingly rejected last fall the "government knows best" philosophy of which Goals 2000 is another manifestation.  If this Congress intends to keep its campaign promises of decentralizing authority, returning power to states and localities, empowering American families, balancing the budget, and reducing the deficit, then Goals 2000 must be repealed.  It is an impediment to these goals.  Leaving intact the Goals 2000 formula for restructuring American education will undo any education reform this Congress hopes to accomplish. <p>

Goals 2000 (P.L. 103-227) is the Clinton Administration's plan to drastically restructure the American education system.  "Goals 2000 establishes overall direction for a new local-state-federal partnership in education," writes Gordon M. Ambach, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers.1 It increases the federal role by imposing a congressional formula for reform on any state, school district, or school that wishes to receive funding under this act.  <p>

The priority of the restructuring agenda can be seen in the appropriations.  Less than half the funding for Goals 2000 will reach local schools in this first year of its existence.  Of the $105 million appropriated for Goals 2000 in FY 94, $92.4 million (88 percent) is targeted toward state grants.  Stipulations in the law require that only 45 percent of each state's grant be filtered down to individual schools.2  That means only $42 million, or 40 percent of the original appropriation, will ever reach the schools.  The other 60 percent constitutes the bureaucratic skim that is being used at each level to create the new framework for the educational system. <p>
The danger of the Goals 2000 restructuring agenda is that all future federal experimentation with education will be easily inculcated into the new network.  Local schools will be extremely vulnerable to manipulation and have little, if any, autonomy.<p>


									
The bureaucratic waste and ominous restructuring agenda of Goals 2000 are just the beginning of the argument against this legislation that will radically change American education.  Its ten titles contain dozens of problem areas that warrant the repeal of Goals 2000.<p>

<center>	<h3><a name="goals"></a>TITLE I -- NATIONAL EDUCATION GOALS</h3></center>
			
This title codifies eight national education goals.  Six were developed by 49 governors and President Bush in 1989 at the Charlottesville education summit.  The other two goals, parental participation and teacher education, were added as bait to sell the Goals 2000 legislation to interest groups, such as teacher unions and the PTA, which supposedly represent the views of teachers and parents. <p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of national education goals is based on faulty logic.  If the federal government is setting goals, that presupposes that it has the authority and ability to ensure the accom-plishment of the goals.  Reaching national education goals will require an unprecedented federal intrusion in schools. <p> 

  <li>Had the goals been popularly developed and had Americans asked for federal supervision in achieving them, Goals 2000 might be procedurally, if not philosophically, a legitimate plan.  They did not and it is not.  Secretary Riley reveals this as he retells the history of the Goals 2000 legislation:<p>
</ul><br>
<blockquote>In the first place, educators had not been in on the ground floor when the National Education Goals were developed in 1989 and 1990.  The goals were viewed by many as a classic example of a top-down reform imposed on localities....  Nor had parents, citizens, or the business community been brought into the picture in a meaningful way....  Finally, neither members of Congress nor state legislators had a hand in crafting the goals....  The truth was that the reform movement at the national level had absolutely no statutory basis....  The National Education Goals, three years after their announcement, had no legal standing of any kind.</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>National education goals cannot be reached through a <i>voluntary </i>program.  If the Clinton Education Department intends to reach these goals, they certainly cannot believe that Goals 2000 is voluntary, or at least they do not intend that it will be optional for long.  The goals are stated in section 102 using all-inclusive language:  "all students will leave grades 4, 8, and 12 having demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter...," and "every school in the United States will be free of drugs...."  These goals absolutely cannot be accomplished through a voluntary program.  The crafters of this legislation were either deceived or deceptive when they touted Goals 2000 as voluntary.<p></ul>


<center>	<h3><a name="reform">TITLE II -- NATIONAL EDUCATION REFORM LEADERSHIP,
 	STANDARDS AND ASSESSMENTS</a></h3></center> 			

Understanding title II is key to understanding the significance and danger of the Goals 2000 legislation.  This title is the heart of the restructuring agenda.  It creates two new national bureaucracies:  the National Education Goals Panel (NEGP) and the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC).<p>

The driving force of the Goals 2000 reform plan lies in title II:  <i>standards</i>.  Three types of national standards are defined:  content standards, performance standards and opportunity-to-learn standards.  In order to apply for a grant under Goals 2000, each state must develop its own content, performance and opportunity-to-learn standards, or adopt the national standards in each of the three areas (see title III).<p>  

Title II is very problematic for anyone who believes in a decentralized system of education:<p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly, adding bureaucracy is contrary to the goals of this Congress.  It will not lead to better education, only waste.	<p>

<li> Goals 2000 called for the creation of the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC) within 120 days of the law's enactment (March 31, 1994) [Sec. 212(e)].  The council was not named during that time, nor has it been since then, yet in FY 94 
$2 million was appropriated for its use.  To what end are these funds being used? <p>  

<li>NESIC was to "identify areas in which voluntary national content standards need to be developed" [Sec. 213(a)(1)(A)].  Since NESIC has not been formed it obviously has not performed this function.  Which bureaucrat decided what standards projects would be funded?  With such anonymity there is no accountability.<p>

<li>The content standards are being presented to school personnel and the general public as though they have been officially and legally approved.  Neither of these can happen because the body set up by law to certify the standards -- NESIC -- does not exist.  It is misleading to present these as <i>the </i>"national standards" when they have been neither federally nor popularly approved.<p></ul>

The <i>National Standards for United States History</i>, produced by the Center for History in the Schools, are a case in point.  A politically correct account of American history, these standards are being presented to history teachers as<i> the national standards</i>.  While Congress may believe it has addressed the issue with the Senate's 99 to 1 vote to reject the U.S. history standards, this non-binding resolution was merely symbolic.  In Goals 2000, Congress gave authority over the standards to NESIC.  That makes the Senate's resolution only a good gesture.  Congress should follow this vote to reject the history standards with a vote of much greater significance: the repeal of the entire Goals 2000 legislation, which calls for national standards and has the potential to produce more material like the U.S. history standards.  <p>

The federal government should not be involved in the creation of standards.  Government-endorsed standards are by nature coercive, not voluntary, and will create a body of "official knowledge."  This is contrary to the American tradition of freedom of thought.  Furthermore, content standards deal with curriculum, an area which the federal Department of Education was expressly forbidden to enter when it was created in 1979.  The creation, critique and usage of standards must remain a community endeavor.  No further federal money should be spent on standards projects, and there should be no federal certification or endorsement of existing standards.<p>

Opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards are an especially troublesome element of title II:<p>
<ul>
<li>These standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing inputs into education, a tried-and-failed method.  OTL standards chosen by states and school districts will require schools to provide adequate resources -- including such things as gender-equitable materials, curriculum aligned with national content standards, and anything else NESIC deems appropriate. <p> 

<li>OTL standards are measuring sticks for schools and teachers, not for students.  They are not a reliable method for improving student achievement.  Indeed, numerous studies linking dramatically increased spending and declining test scores indicate that spending does not drive academic success.<p>
<li>OTL standards invite further federal intrusion in American education.  Diane Ravitch, an assistant secretary of education in the Bush administration, wrote, "[T]he new standards, euphemistically called 3opportunity-to-learn3 standards, would permit Federal regulation of curriculum, textbooks, facilities and instructional methods....  The bill describes the Federal 3opportunity-to-learn3 standards as 3voluntary,3 but litigation would quickly turn them into mandates."</ul><p>
The idea of lawsuits and mandates is not an alarmist fabrication; an Alabama state court recently declared the state school system unconstitutional for not providing adequate education to its students.  The judge's 125-page opinion imposes OTL-type standards on the state's schools.<p>
<center><h3><a name="local">Title III -- STATE AND LOCAL EDUCATION SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT</a></h3></center>
This title authorizes block grants to states and subgrants to local school boards [Sec. 309(a)].<p>
<ul>
<li>In order to receive a grant under Goals 2000, a state is obligated to adhere to the federal outline for reform:  opportunity-to-learn standards, content and performance standards, assessments, etc.  State improvement plans must be approved by the Secretary of Education.  Never before have states had to submit such lesson plans to the federal government for approval.  Contrary to the rhetoric of Goals 2000, this is not a formula for local authority over school reform; it makes the word <i>voluntary </i>moot.<p>

<li>In its grant application, a state must include "an assurance that State law provides adequate authority to carry out each component of the State's improvement plan..." [Sec. 305(a)(2)(B)].  In other words, the state must explain how it will impose the Goals 2000 agenda on each of its school districts, voiding the voluntary option for them as well.<p>

<li>The Goals 2000 prescription for reform encourages states to include plans to transform schools into "one-stop shopping" centers which offer a variety of social services, including health care and child care [Sec. 306(f)(2)].   This coordination of services tends toward a collectivism which is contrary to our nation's history as a free society.  Concentrating the services in one place and on one group of people may lead to a sense of dependency.  <p>
	
<li>Advancing social services, health care and related services likely includes the promotion of school-based clinics (SBC).  The term "coordinated services" has been used by proponents to refer to school-based clinics.   These clinics commonly distribute contraceptives and, when these measures fail, the clinics refer for abortion. <p> 
  </ul>
<center>	<h3><a name="parental">TITLE IV -- PARENTAL ASSISTANCE</a></h3></center>
		
This title provides for parental information and resource centers and describes parental involvement in education.  Laudable as it sounds, this title is problematic:
<ul>		
<li>Goal 8 (parental participation) and title IV (Parental Assistance) assume that schools and parents have equal authority over and responsibility for children.  The legislation denies the fact that parents' authority over their children is intrinsic and that schools have only a delegated authority.  <p>

<li>To improve family life and help parents, Goals 2000 suggests more programming, more meetings, more time at school and with school personnel, and more home visits from professionals.  All of this leaves less time for parents and children to spend together. <p>

<li>With their Goals 2000 grants, states must spend money on "parent education."  Parents as Teachers (PAT), which advocates home visits by counselors beginning at birth, is one of the programs specifically endorsed by the law.  Not only are states encouraged to use their "parent education" money to fund PAT programs, but the objectionable organization was directly appropriated $10 million under Goals 2000 for FY 1995.  The House Education, Labor, HHS Subcommittee for Appropriations is to be commended for targeting this program for termination.  Its rationale for proposing cuts to parent education programs is that "these are the very paternalistic and 3government knows best3 programs that the American people rejected last year."<p>

<li>Publicly-funded institutions like PAT are not equipped to improve families because they cannot speak to the values issues inherent in the breakdown of families.  Private voluntary associations and individuals must take responsibility in this arena.<p>
</ul>	
<center>	<h3><a name="skill">TITLE V -- NATIONAL SKILL STANDARDS BOARD</a></h3></center>

Title V is devoted to linking education to business and industry.  It authorizes the creation of another national bureaucracy:  the National Skill Standards Board (NSSB).  NSSB will establish business-education partnerships and oversee development of skill standards and assessments.  <p>
<ul>
<li>The $3 million spent in 1994 to develop skill standards is another misguided appropriation of funds.  It also calls for the development of national assessments to certify achievement of the skill standards.  These additions, however, will not produce better candidates for business.  According to a <i>Chicago Tribune</i> article, employers seek critical thinking and creativity, but when it comes to promoting those skills, "most of the visible school reform efforts, such as uniform national testing schemes, head 180 degrees in the wrong direction."</ul><p>
<center><h3><a name="international">TITLE VI -- INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM</a></h3></center>

Title VI calls for evaluation of foreign education systems.  It also sets up a program of education personnel exchange with central and eastern European countries and any country formerly a part of the Soviet Union.<p>
<ul>
<li>The United States does not have the resources to "provide Department of Education personnel and technical experts to assist eligible countries to establish and implement a database or other effective methods to improve educational delivery systems, structure and organization" [Sec. 601(c)(5)].  Moreover, U.S. envoys should not be pushing the Goals 2000 agenda, unproven in our own country, on eastern European countries.<p></ul>

<center>	<h3><a name="safe">TITLE VII -- SAFE SCHOOLS</a></h3></center>
			
This title provides grants to local school districts to achieve safe and drug-free schools.  Section 705 describes types of programs to be implemented to prevent violence.<p>
<ul>
<li>Conflict resolution, anger management, and peer mediation are cited as "programs of demonstrated effectiveness in addressing violence"  (Sec. 705).  In reality, experts are skeptical of these soft-approach violence prevention programs.<p>
 <li>We cannot afford to spend millions on a violence prevention strategy that 
includes programs of no proven effectiveness.  Serious efforts must be made to curb violence, but conflict resolution and peer mediation will not get to the real solution:  changed lives and families. <p></ul>
<center>	<h3><a name="minority">TITLE VIII -- MINORITY FOCUSED CIVICS EDUCATION</a></h3></center>
This title provides grants for teacher seminars on minority-focused civics and government.<p>
<ul>
<li>Minority-focused courses will likely promote versions of history similar to that produced by the Center for History in the Schools in its <i>National Standards for United States History</i>:  politically correct, victim-focused, anti-American, and inaccurate.  Claiming to be multicultural, the standards selectively include minority figures from American history who are currently in vogue.  Teaching minorities using such curriculum will not produce acculturation but cultural friction and fragmentation.</ul><p>

<center>	<h3><a name="research">TITLE IX -- EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT</a></h3></center>
			
Title IX makes organizational changes in the Department of Education's Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI); prescribes OERI's functions in relation to Goals 2000; establishes within OERI a National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board, five National Research Institutes, and a National Education Dissemination System linking federal and local agencies.  It also authorizes expansion of research grants for comprehensive school health education (Sec. 971).<p>
<ul>
<li>Once again, Goals 2000 aims to improve education by adding and reshuffling bureaucracy.<p>

<li>Health education, which includes sex education, has already been a major source of grief to parents.  Advancing these programs will undoubtedly lead to an increase in challenges to parental authority.  <p>
</ul>
<center>	<h3><a name="miscellaneous">TITLE X -- MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</h3></center>
This catch-all title contains a gun-free school act, a non-smoking policy for children's services in schools, a policy for distribution of contraceptive devices, and authorization of grants for Midnight Basketball programs.<p>
<ul>
<li>The Goals 2000 policy on contraceptive devices further marginalizes parents.  Section 1018 states that "all federally funded programs which provide for the distribution of contraceptive devices to unemancipated minors [shall] develop procedures to encourage, <b>to the extent practical</b>, family participation in such programs" (emphasis added).  How unlikely is it that a school administrator will find it impractical to listen to parental objections to its condom distribution policy?<p>

<li>Midnight Basketball was originally a private sector plan.  There is no need for government to get involved in these charitable efforts and regulate them to death.  <p>
	
</ul>
<Center><h3><a name="conclusion">CONCLUSION</a>   </h3></center>

The proposed rescissions and terminations in Goals 2000 appropriations are good:  reduction in state grants, terminating Parents as Teachers, cutting back school-to-work activities, etc.  Especially significant is the $21.5 million proposed cut in the Goals 2000 National Programs, wiping out all FY 95 funding for this account which supports development of standards and assessments.<p>

The proposals do not go far enough, however.  The Goals 2000 restructuring agenda will continue to spread like kudzu throughout America as long as states receive Goals 2000 grants.  Furthermore, zero-funding the Goals 2000 programs individually leaves open the possibility of future funding.  Complete repeal of Goals 2000 is the only solution.<p>

Education reform at this historic moment calls for a reduction in the role of the federal government in the system and a return to the traditional role of school:  teaching students basics like reading, writing, and arithmetic.  A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals 2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation and spending.<p>

<h2><center>
	OUT OF THEIR OWN MOUTHS:<br>
	SELECTED QUOTATIONS ON THE<br>
	SIGNIFICANCE OF GOALS 2000</h2>
<b><hr size="3" width="30%"></center><br>
"The enactment of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and the School-to-Work Opportunities Act signaled the beginning of a new era in education reform that <u>will over time touch all schools</u>."<br>    
	<i>--Department of Education Justifications of Appropriation Estimates to   	the Congress Fiscal Year 1996 Volume I</i><p><br><br>

America 2000, President Bush's educational reform plan, was the predecessor of Goals 2000.  "It was a self-proclaimed conservative Republican... who was advocating <u>a monumental movement away from local control of education</u>."<br>    
	<i>--John F. Jennings, Institute for Educational Leadership</i><p><br><br>

"When the legislative dust settles and future historians examine the Clinton Administration, they will devote a major chapter to the Goals 2000: Educate America Act.... Like President Lincoln's Morrill Act of 1862 and President Johnson's Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, President Bill Clinton's Goals 2000 Act will stand as an education beacon."<br>     
	<i>--Richard W. Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education</i><p><br><br>

"[Goals 2000 is] the most important education legislation we've ever had." <br>   
	<i>--Albert Shanker, President, American Federation of Teachers</i><p><br><br>

"In the first three titles, Goals 2000 establishes overall direction for a new local-state-federal partnership in education." <br>   
	<i>--Gordon M. Ambach, Executive Director, Council of Chief State School 	  Officers</i><p><br><br>

"Perhaps most important, Goals 2000 lays the conceptual groundwork for other federal legislation, establishing a model for coherence among federal and 
national endeavors in education that has never been seen before...." <br>   
	<i>--Jennifer O'Day, Associate Director, Pew Forum on Education Reform </i><p><br><br>


"Goals 2000 is a new way of doing business in America.  It represents the direction our government must take in many problems in the 21st century."  <br>  
	<i>--President Bill Clinton </i></b><p><br><br>

<a name="issues"><h3>Important education issues to expect during the fall session of the 104th Congress</h3></a><br><a href="#contents">[Contents]</a><br>
<h4>ACTION:  Set up an appointment to meet with your Congressman or Senator at their district offices during the August recess, which lasts from now until Labor Day. Use this outline of issues for your meeting:</h4>


<b>I.  Ending federal programs for America's schools</b>. Of the 552 education programs the federal government runs at a cost of $70 billion (244 in the Education Department, 308 in 30 other agencies), it's difficult to point to many that have been successful, let alone cost-effective. It's time to question the federal role in education, and two bills are doing just that:<p>   
<ul>
<li>The Back to Basics bill (H.R. 1883) goes after most of the programs in the U.S. Education Department, consolidates them into a block grant to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services and moves remaining programs to other departments.<p>

<li>The Restoring Local Schools bill goes further.  Developed by conservatives, this bill would immediately eliminate the U.S. Education Department and repeal many of the 552 federal education programs.  Three block grants, to end within four years, would replace them.  The highlight of this bill is its provision for enactment of a tax cut to replace $60 billion in federal education spending. <p></ul>

<b>II.  Resist the Urge to Merge</b>.  Merging the U.S. Education and Labor Departments will not solve the problems created by the federal role in schools.  Equally objectionable is any merging of programs which might lead to a philosophy that does not differentiate between education and workforce preparation.  Two plans are moving in that direction:<p>
</ul>
<li>Congressmen Bill Goodling (R-Penn.) and Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) have developed a plan to merge the U.S. Education and Labor Departments and fold in the EEOC as well.  They have determined that the federal government's legitimate role in education is workforce preparation, so that the country may benefit economically.  On that basis they would relocate the Education Department, reorganized but not reduced in size, in the Labor Department.  By maintaining the federal education bureaucracy and its current status as director of education in America, yet prioritizing its functions in such a way as to benefit labor, this plan sends a dangerous message that education is merely economic development.<p></ul>

<ul><li>The CAREERS bill (H.R. 1617) is the first step toward the Goodling-Gunderson plan.  It would combine 90 job training programs into four block grants, but retain many School-to-Work ideas, including government-endorsed skill standards and skill certificates and career counseling for elementary students.  In addition, it creates an unneeded and wasteful "workforce development infrastructure," which would include creation of one-stop career centers.<p>
</ul>
<b>III.  Defund and Repeal Goals 2000</b>.  America has seen a new height in federal directives in education since the passage of Goals 2000 during the spring of 1994.  While rhetoric touts this program as voluntary, upon entry into the Goals 2000 contract a state will be compelled to follow the federal prescription for school restructuring:  development of standards and aligned assessments and submission of state plans to the U.S. Secretary of Education.  Efforts to end this inappropriate federal program are meeting with some success:<p>
<ul>
<li>The Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations Bill (H.R. 2127) passed the House late last week without funding for Goals 2000.  This bill also makes several important strides to reduce abortion.  The bill will go through the gauntlet of debate and mark-up on the Senate side when Congress reconvenes in September, beginning with the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor/HHS/Education, then the full Appropriations Committee, and finally, the full Senate.  Subcommittee Chairman Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Penn.) has vowed his intention to reverse the victories that pro-family Americans achieved in this bill.  <p>

<li>Rep. John Shadegg (R-Ariz.) has been a leader in the charge against Goals 2000 on the House side. Earlier this summer he drummed up support for the elimination of Goals 2000 funding in the appropriations bill and also expressed his desire to see the program repealed.  <p></ul>

<a name="disappoint"><h3>DISAPPOINTMENTS AND DISSENTERS:  104TH CONGRESS ON EDUCATION</h3></a><a href="#contents">[ Contents ]</a><br><br>
	Conservatives have reason to be dismayed with the "Republican Revolution" which has little influenced the education theory coming out of this Congress.  A prime example is the Education Reform Consolidation Grant, which would combine over 50 elementary and secondary education programs into a single block grant, presumably in an attempt to reduce the federal role in education.  In current draft form, however, the bill maintains a Washington-knows-best philosophy by following the pattern of Goals 2000, including prescriptions for states to submit standards and assessments to the National Education Goals Panel, which would report to the U.S. Secretary of Education.  The education bureaucracy would be largely untouched by this supposed improvement.  <p>
	While most conservatives find the efforts of this Congress lacking when it comes to education, a few notable education theorists say the opposite.  Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute and Diane Ravitch of the Brookings Institution charge that "Republican anti-governmentalism occasionally becomes overwrought," referring to the effort to end the federal role in education.   In a report entitled "Education Reform 1994-95," they praise "reinvention" strategies like school choice and charter schools, yet cling to the status quo--federal oversight of America's schools.  Finn and Ravitch also support national standards and assessments. Unfortunately, standards and assessments will not directly improve student achievement; they will simply make it easier to evaluate and compare schools, thus empowering the beureaucrats that control the system.<p>

<h2>CAN THE MARKETPLACE SAVE OUR SCHOOLS?</h2> 
<i><b>By James R. Rinehart and Jackson F. Lee, Jr.</b></i><p> 
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
Problems continue to mount in our public schools. Should we give 
private schools more of a chance?<p> 
 Sometimes it's hard not to feel smug. The current struggle to 
move from central planning to a free market approach within the 
former Soviet Union and its neighboring countries has led some 
Americans to get that "we told you so" feeling. It's not that we 
revel in the misery and uncertainty faced by the residents of 
these countries, but many of us have known all along of the 
incredible deficiencies in central planning and the enormous 
power embodied in free markets. We have no problem understanding 
that the collapsing economies of Eastern Europe owe their failure 
to government ownership and control. <p>
Surprisingly, the lessons that are still being learned at such a 
high cost to the Eastern Europeans seem to be lost on most 
Americans. We continue to call for, and support government 
solutions to problems that would be solved better through private 
enterprise. Somehow, we just don't get it. Either we fail to 
recognize the costs associated with government involvement in the 
production and distribution of goods and services, or we know 
what is happening but feel unable or unwilling to do anything 
about it. The answer is probably both. Year after year, the 
influence of American government on the lives of Americans 
continues to grow. A telling measure of that growth is government 
spending as a percentage of GNP, which has tripled since 1929. <p>
We take it for granted that in the United States, the very cradle 
of free enterprise, governments should own and operate such wide 
ranging enterprises as parks, roads, postal services, buses, 
trains, hospitals, airports, sewer and water systems, garbage 
disposal services, jails, fire departments, and schools. We are 
even willing to tolerate the ever expanding regulation of 
thousands of private firms and individuals. At the state level 
alone, we license and control more than 4,000 occupations and 
professions. <p>
As we watch the centrally planned economies around the world 
disappear and move toward privatization, we see little real 
progress toward lessening the reach of government here at home. 
Some favorable signs, however, are appearing on the horizon. Many 
local and state governments are divesting themselves of 
activities that used to fall almost exclusively within the domain 
of the state. Private companies are beginning to take over such 
diverse services as prisons, garages, refuse collection 
facilities, transit systems, fire departments, waste disposal 
units, ambulance services, and low-cost housing. The driving 
Economic Report of the President, U.S. Superintendent of 
Documents, force behind these efforts is the U.S. Government 
Printing Office, Washington D C (various years) growing 
realization that privatization is more efficient and provides 
better quality service. <p>
<center><h3>WHY GOVERNMENT CONTROL DOESN'T WORK </center></h3><p>
The current interest in educational vouchers and choice 
represents the application of privatization in the area of 
education. Choice involving private schools shows real promise 
for educational reform. Of the many critics making vitriolic 
complaints about the quality of American public schools, most 
fail to see that government monopolization of education is a 
significant contributor to these poor results. A brief look at 
the government's involvement in education illustrates just how 
desperately we need to privatize our schools. <p>
Although local government schools go back to colonial times, 
until the mid-19th century, the general thrust was toward private 
schools. The transformation to our current system began when 
Horace Mann became Secretary of the newly created Board of 
Education in Massachusetts in 1837. He immediately started 
Massachusetts and this nation on a course that resulted in 
centralized, state controlled, and government owned public 
schools financed by property taxes. The net effect of universal 
free education supported by compulsory taxes and compulsory 
attendance laws was to entice, and sometimes force, parents to 
send their children to public schools. It also led many parents 
to forfeit control over their children's education under the 
mistaken assumption that responsibility lies with the schools. 
Today, fewer than 12 percent of American elementary and secondary 
students attend private schools. <p>
Everyone more or less agrees that public schools are failing 
miserably to reach even the most modest expectations set for 
them. The massive but largely ineffective school reform movement 
of the 1980s is a manifestation of this fact. What is not so well 
recognized is that public schools are failing largely because of 
the government's involvement in the production of education -- 
precisely the same phenomenon that has caused the collapse of the 
economies of many Eastern European countries. <p>
We are well aware of the fact that changing social conditions 
caused by weakened families, increased crime, and drugs have 
adverse effects on the educational achievement of children, but 
schools must adjust to educate students in any environment, and 
government schools find it almost impossible to do that. 
Government must perform a few functions, but managing the 
education of more than 40 million youngsters is just not one of 
them. <p>
The absence of effective incentives on the part of those who 
consume and those who produce education explains the poor results 
we get. The consumers of education, the students and parents, 
have little power to influence what educators do. This feeling of 
powerlessness often results in apathy and neglect. The producers 
of education, on the other hand, have few direct incentives to 
satisfy students and parents. Educators are not consistently or 
tangibly rewarded or penalized on the basis of how well their 
students learn. Instead, they are rewarded on the basis of the 
number of degrees held, and years of teaching experience. Neither 
of these factors correlates very well with student achievement or 
satisfaction. <p>
Educational decisions are largely political, and rest primarily 
in the hands of the state and local departments of education. 
Everyone from members of boards of education and superintendents 
to principals and teachers try to satisfy their superiors. 
Although educational leaders are often aware of community 
demands, nowhere are they forced to be responsive to the wishes 
of their student and parent clients. Educators actively try to 
influence school board members and state and local politicians 
because these people have the power to provide pay raises, job 
security, and better working conditions. Politicians, in turn, 
appeal to voters and special interest groups in an attempt to get 
reelected. Students and parents find themselves at the bottom of 
the hierarchy with little influence and even less clout. <p>
<center><h3>WHY FREE COMPETITIVE MARKETS DO WORK </center></h3><p>
The marketplace comes to terms with how to meet customer demands. 
Free competitive markets exhibit a power hierarchy significantly 
different from that seen in the public school system. The 
emphasis, from the owner of a company to the lowest paid 
employee, is on customer satisfaction, because everyone realizes 
that the customer always has the option of taking his or her 
business elsewhere. Failure to retain and satisfy customers leads 
to losses. Success in retaining and satisfying customers 
generates profits. The incentive system gives central importance 
to the customer. <p>
No similar incentive operates within the public school system. 
Rewards for educators, such as they are, follow regardless of 
student achievement. Salaries are based almost exclusively on 
degrees held and years of experience. Rewards can even come as a 
direct result of poor quality. Educators often argue that poor 
results are due to inadequate funding, so, the weaker the 
results, the greater the financial need. It is an interesting 
fact that we heap accolades on schools with high per capita 
spending while deprecating those with low spending per capita. 
Imagine a private firm such as IBM complaining because their cost 
of making computers is too low! <p>
If we really want to improve education, we need to rediscover the 
power of unregulated markets. At a minimum, we should provide 
parents with credit vouchers so they can choose between public 
and private school alternatives. But an even better solution can 
be found in the privatization of the entire educational system. <p>
Under privatization, state and local governments could sell their 
school properties. Parents could be given a coupon equal to the 
average amount currently spent on education. The coupon could 
then be used to pay tuition at any school (all would be private) 
selected. Competition among schools would keep tuition levels 
under control and force them to satisfy the wishes of students 
and parents. Schools that successfully satisfied their consumers 
would make money, and those that did not would lose money. No 
longer would educational decisions be largely a function of 
political considerations. Instead, the focus would be on (1) 
meeting the educational demands of parents and students and (2) 
controlling costs. <p>
No educational plan is perfect, including the privatization 
option: we live in a world without panaceas. But some solutions 
are clearly better than others. <p>
After the relevant benefits and costs of current alternatives are 
weighed, the evidence continues to mount that an educational 
system involving private school options has the best chance of 
producing the outcomes we want at a minimum expenditure of 
resources. There are three specific types of evidence that lead 
us to believe such a system would give parents the kind of 
education they want at lower costs than would be the case for 
public schools. <p>
<center><h3>COMPETITION</center></h3><p> 
The first type of evidence comes from microeconomic theory 
concerning monopolies. In general, monopoly firms restrict 
output, raise prices above the marginal cost of production, 
underutilize plant capacity, waste resources, and often produce 
inferior quality products or services. Since public schools are a 
monopoly, one would expect public schools to function less 
efficiently than private schools. Replacing public schools with 
private schools would impose competitive restraints, forcing them 
to pay closer attention to client demands and the cost of 
satisfying those demands. Most public schools lack the incentives 
necessary to cause them to pay closer attention to their clients' 
wishes. <p>
<center><h3>EFFICIENCY</center></h3><p>
Empirical evidence represents a second type of support for the 
proposition that private schools operate more efficiently than 
public schools. Robert Genetski, for example, examined the costs 
of public and private schools in Chicago. His figures put the 
cost of private schools in that city at anywhere from 45 to 77 
percent of the cost of public schools. These figures resulted 
even after adjustments were made for the fact that public schools 
usually pay higher salaries than private schools, and must deal 
with students who have disabilities, language problems, financial 
deprivation, and social and intellectual disadvantages. <p>
According to a 1978 study of New York City schools, public 
schools spend $4,785 per pupil per year for non-handicapped 
students, while private schools spend $4,512. The difference in 
cost is even greater for handicapped students. The per student 
cost for handicapped students was $6,196 in public schools -- and 
$4,730 in private schools. One of the reasons for the cost 
differential with both handicapped and non-handicapped students 
is that public schools generally are more labor intensive than 
private schools, especially at the staff level. The New York 
study found this to be the case. <p>
<center><h3>COST </center></h3><p>
The third source of support for private options can be found in 
the success of privatization in other government functions. Many 
other traditional activities of government, from protective and 
custodial services to health care and transportation services, 
have already been privatized by some cities and counties. <p>
The evidence that privatized services are generally provided at 
lower cost than public services is overwhelming. In Privatizing 
the Public Sector, E.S. Savas provides many examples of 
successful privatization. Studies covering the United States, 
Canada, and Switzerland, for example, show that municipal solid 
waste collection is 61-71 percent more expensive when government 
provides it. Scottsdale, Arizona, found that a private firm could 
provide fire protection for 52 percent of the government agency's 
cost. In the Federal Republic of Germany, municipal bus service 
costs 160 percent more per kilometer than private service. <p>
In another study, nursing homes operated by the U.S. Veterans 
Administration had a per patient cost that was 83 percent higher 
than that for comparable private nursing homes. Reports on 
privatization efforts in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Newark, New 
Jersey, also point to improved service at lower cost. <p>
Often the debate over choice is muddled because of an inability 
to separate choice limited to pubic schools from public-private 
choice via vouchers, and either of these from a privatized 
system. For example, the empirical studies on choice published in 
a special issue of the Economics of Education Review are devoted 
to either public school choice or public-private choice via 
vouchers, but do not address a system consisting only of private 
school alternatives such as we describe. <p>
<center><h3>WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED</center></h3><p> 
Some of the controversy over the efficiency of private schools 
stems from the fact that while most private schools operate at 
lower cost than public schools, the kinds, amounts, and types of 
education they produce may not be comparable. While most private 
school supporters would be content to let the judgment about 
school product rest with parental choice in much the same way 
consumers judge supermarket standards, most critics of private 
school choice would be unwilling to accept such a proposition. 
Public school advocates have a strong philosophical bias against 
school variety and parents possessing the power to choose schools 
and programs of study. The steady march of school consolidation 
and standardization over the decades attests to this fact. <p>
Of course, there are valid concerns that do arise from, and often 
strong opposition that does surface to, options involving private 
schools. Even advocates see some problems to be overcome if 
schools are to introduce any meaningful choice system. <p>
<center><h3>THE BAD NEWS </center></h3><p>
The following list represents some of the concerns related to the 
implementation of a private school choice system. <p>
1. At least some students, teachers, and staff would find 
themselves temporarily or permanently dislocated as the new 
system was brought "on line" and new schools opened and/or 
ineffective schools restructured or closed. <p>
2. Schools in some areas could resegregate even though the net 
effect would probably be increased integration, especially for 
the inner city schools. <p>
3. Some parents might give only marginal thought to school 
choices, and they might need assistance in making their choices. <p>
4. Under any choice system, there would be the ever-present risk 
of state governments taking over more and more power through 
increased regulation.  <p>
5. The diversity of types of schools and curricula represents a 
potential danger. Some "fringe groups" would no doubt want to 
establish their own special schools. <p>
6. In the education market, as with markets in general, the 
public would need to be vigilant against fraud and deceit. <p>
7. Students in more populous areas would have far more options 
than students in rural areas. <p>
<center><h3>THE GOOD NEWS </center></h3><p>
Each of these concerns, along with others yet to be discovered, 
will deserve our attention. None of them, however, represents a 
"deal buster." The benefits of private school choice derive 
primarily from the increased flexibility and sensitivity of the 
system. Rather than a static bureaucratic monopoly, a system of 
choice would permit rapid and efficient change and growth. <p>
Even without the advantages of publicly provided funding, some 
private schools are forging ahead with newer and better ways of 
providing education. Jim Boyle formed Ombudsman Educational 
Services Ltd. and now operates 22 schools in Illinois, Minnesota, 
and Arizona, servicing a total of 800 students. The American 
Association of Educators in Private Practice, a new professional 
association of teachers in private enterprise schools, was formed 
recently by 50 teachers. Education Alternatives Inc. currently 
contracts with local authorities to operate specific public 
schools. This firm now has contracts to operate public schools in 
Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, and Arizona. <p>
Some private firms are already moving into position to take 
advantage of any opportunities that may arise from the school 
choice movement. The most widely publicized effort is that of 
Christopher Whittle, Chairman of Whittle Communications. This 
company has invested $60 million in The Edison Project, which 
plans to open 200 schools with 150,000 students by 1996 at a 
total investment of $2.45 billion. By the year 2010, this firm 
expects to have 2 million students coast to coast. Whittle has 
received financial commitments from a number of partners, and has 
put in place a team of advisors and specialists, i.e., 100 well-
known educators, businessmen, and other personalities. <p>
Several other major firms have also entered the for-profit 
education business. Sylvan Learning Centers, Huntington Learning 
Systems, and Britannica Learning Centers are franchised 
operations with schools operating across the nation. Even Burger 
King is operating quasi-private secondary schools in 14 cities 
under the name "Burger King Academies!" And IBM and Apple have 
recently expressed serious interest in starting profit-making 
schools, too. <p>
Definite signs are emerging that local, state, and federal 
governments are willing to encourage the movement toward public 
school privatization. The town of Epsom, New Hampshire, has 
instituted a $1,000 tax rebate for families sending their 
children to any school other than the local public school. 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has a voucher system already in place for 
1,000 ghetto children. For two years now, parents of these 
children have been allowed to select private schools and have the 
government pay $2,500 per student per year to the school 
selected. Colorado had a voucher proposal on the ballot in the 
1992 general election, but lost because of strong opposition from 
teachers' unions. California's proposal suffered a similar fate. <p>
<center><h3>WHY THE TIME IS NOW </center></h3><p>
Can the marketplace save our schools? <p>
In the United States, private school enrollment traditionally has 
been restricted by the fact that parents sending their children 
to private schools have had to pay private tuition AND public 
school taxes. Most parents have been unwilling or unable to 
shoulder such a financial burden. Statutory restrictions have 
also discouraged the formation of private schools. <p>
In recent years, however, a move appears to have gotten under way 
to remedy this situation through options involving choice. This 
trend should be openly encouraged. Real reform will come to the 
nation's schools only through free markets that permit private 
schools to compete for the students they educate. <p>

<h2>Education: A Plan for the Next Generation</h2><br>
<i><b>Robert L. Montgomerie </b></i>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
There is the large debate within the right concerning education. Much 
of the focus is the funding of education and the result we're getting 
from the sea of dollars that is spent on it. Much of the main focus is 
on the lack of certain skills on the part of youngster as opposed to 
older generations who seemed to have gotten a far more superior 
education then present generations. Quite a bit of anger is directed 
towards liberal policy with respect to the social part of education 
while many of the actually grade figures are more or less used in a 
rather curious way to justify the need for social reform in public 
education. Many of these arguments include the once practiced early 
morning prayer by students in the morning. Also it includes such 
things as an end to handing out condoms, an end to education regarding 
alternative lifestyles, and another broad practice that doesn't 
necessarily include alternative lifestyles but should is 
multiculturalism. Many camps within the right competing for jobs in 
the next two or three elections will be faced with these issues 
perhaps much more seriously in the future. Nativists who are a curious 
breed of quasi-conservatives are latching on to the ideas of changing 
the face of public school as we know it. Perhaps it should be changed. 
The only thing about education that will change will probably be a 
shift in liberal to conservatives policy regarding education to fit a 
more explicitly moral overtone linked to Christianity.<p>  
Much of the proposed reform that was been thrown around is the 
standard approach to cultural literacy that is proposed by many 
nativists calling for an end to revisionist history being taught 
currently. Many do not like the idea of Columbus being depicted as 
anything other than a visionary, or a Lincoln who personally didn't 
think blacks should hold elective office but it all boils down to a 
point of that they dislike the current thought in place of teaching 
other histories not pertaining entirely to the founding of the nation 
as we know it or of the origins of that nation. Much of this is linked 
to nationalist thought and it is linked to an idea of America as a 
Christian nation. It is known that America was here long before 
Europeans came just as it is known that George Washington's cherry 
tree story is not a very truthful story. Those of us who grew up with 
ideas of a Benjamin Franklin working hard are very astonished to find 
out that he had a very unpuritian stay in France and was a little bit 
of a ladies man while he was there. When faced with ideas of slave 
holding founding fathers would considered blacks and Indians as lesser 
men than them and even went so far as to write that into the 
Constitution as opposed to the idealized view of moral founding 
fathers who were straight edged to the end is a hard thing to take in. 
Especially when it may be true. <p>
The original purpose of public education was to create citizens who 
could speak a common language necessary for the smooth operation of a 
nation entering into the industrial revolution, have a literate 
population, and to instill the meaning of America and to explain the 
civil duties and benefits of being a citizen. Noble enough until you 
enter the agent of politics which of course seems to run any good idea 
into the rocks when given what seems to be a simple task. Funding 
education was simple also in the pre-industrial era and even into 
modern times so what went wrong when SAT scores have fallen 
consistently since 1960? Are schools adequate enough to teach students 
in these times? Is it a lack of work ethic among teachers to teach 
students in the classroom sitting? Is it a lack on the behalf of 
parents to teach children the importance of education which may 
include helping with homework or among other things personally 
insuring that children even participate in what many children in other 
country's don't get; a free education. <p>
In 1996 the Republican Party committed to social issues has to address 
the issue of education with a plan that takes necessary strains off of 
the budget plus aid in improving the quality of not only education but 
of schools and the institutions that run them. It would be easy to 
make this an ugly political background but it is hoped that out of a 
sense of decency that in front of young eyes there will be serious 
debate and little rhetoric bouncing. The Republican Party has to 
address ambitiously the issue of crime in schools all across the 
board, teaching, institutional social policy, curriculum, and cost and 
that isn't an easy job when so much special interest is at stake. The 
changes made in public education will affect a whole generation of 
young minds needed to shape a nation of the future and hopefully the 
reform of today will aid in this process and not in effect some to an 
institutional "rubber check" to show the true ineffectiveness of this 
generation in handling the challenges of today. <p>
Many of the contemporary ideas include such things as vouchers and 
reassigning responsibilities, including funding, to the states. Much 
of the idea concerning empowerment of the states fully in the 
education process as a statement in itself is a reasonable idea. One 
because states have a better idea of the field of endeavor children 
was go on such as banking, farming, and roping horses. States also 
have a better idea of  what children, residing in that state, need to 
work on and can create a better, more personalized plan to better 
attack these weaknesses and hopefully show an improvement in that 
general area. Conversely will states be able to cover the cost the 
federal government spends on education. In fiscal 1992 the federal 
government spent 26.04 billion for education. Will states be able to 
supply the needed resources to properly educate every child in every 
setting without federal help. Perhaps if states intend on opening more 
magnet type schools and even then access would still be limited. 
Lastly will states act with integrity in the social education of 
children. If the Federal Government leaves any indication then it is 
reasonable to expect that state governments will conduct themselves 
similarly. This is not to say that the states might not do a better 
job with education because of the fact that they haven't been given a 
chance. But nevertheless tax burden for education won't be taken off 
the backs of the taxpayer and there is reason to suspect that this tax 
burden will increase. Best case scenario will be that it won't change. 
It will just be collected by a different source. <p>
Should the federal government get out of the business of education? 
The answer is that the federal government should provide a leadership 
role in education, but the federal government should not be so 
financially committed to education as it has been in the past ten to 
twenty years. Realistically we can expect that the federal government 
won't be out of the education business within the next twenty years 
and this is where now the Republican Party can take a crucial role in 
molding the face of education of years to come.  <p>
One of the main objectives of the Republican Party is tax relief. Part 
of that is in ensuring that as much of a standard of equality exists 
in funding as well as in collecting funds. <p>
It should be considered unconstitutional to collect property taxes 
from all property owners in order to fund education. Many people who 
are paying for education don't even have children attending public 
school or don't have children at all or anymore. Why should they pay? 
Empowerment has to fit into the framework somewhere with regard to 
funding. As long as we know that it is here and that someone has to 
pay why can't those who participate pay for the system? Those who pick 
up the tab for public school should also have a larger say in what 
goes on in that which they are a partner of therein. Many in public 
life are clamoring for "vouchers" that will give families the right to 
take their children to any school they wish to attend. A voucher 
system is in itself an interesting idea; families taking their 
children to any school they wish and using this voucher to pay for it. 
How will this change the face of funding education? It won't. Vouchers 
are simply another form of government handout like free lunch tickets. 
There are three things that are a problem in public school that won't 
be cured by vouchers and one is overcrowded classrooms. In the 
meanwhile perfectly good schools will sit largely dormant and will be 
too expensive to run after a time mainly because of low attendance. 
Vouchers will also affect private school education with this same 
overcrowded problem the public schools are having. Currently 
classrooms are comprised of one teacher attempting to teach thirty or 
more students. Vouchers will only aid in this madness.  <p>
Since segregation many schools have been closed in order to achieve 
racial balance in communities especially in the south. That is very 
present in large cities where it isn't uncommon to find old school 
buildings dotting neighborhoods. Perhaps  federal money should be 
spent to reopen some of these buildings rather than that money being 
spent on chasing suburbanites into the countryside in order to insure 
the schools they open will meet a standard of equality. Opening 
schools will spread out the population and thus spread out the 
classrooms and those attending those classrooms. More schools would 
mean more funding to run these schools. If  it is already expensive to 
pay for the schools that exist then why expand on that problem. 
Simple. We know some reasons why there are the problems within many 
public schools. They are packed into classrooms, and hallways, and 
cafeterias like sardines. Teachers are expected to successfully teach 
roughly a classroom of thirty or more students so it is wise to note 
that not every student is getting the proper attention that student 
deserves. Are we interested in coming to at least as close of a 
solution as possible? If we are then we have to address the 
fundamental problems that currently exist. <p>
The important issue with respect to the last paragraph is in funding. 
We know that as fiscal conservatives we are committed to freeing up 
incomes. We are also committed to finding an equitable fair system of 
funding that will be efficient and as self sustaining as possible 
which is no easy task. Adding other principles such as personable 
responsibility and empowerment we can come to a partial solution of 
funding public education while achieving all goals. That partial 
solution would be The Public School Funding Act. This would create a 
middle ground to both tax relief, empowerment, personal 
responsibility, and improvement of institution. Part of the PSFA would 
include cutting property taxes used to fund education by half in order 
to ensure fairness in taxation and to also remove "penalties" on 
owning property. It would include cuts in the Department of Education 
budget on a graduated basis for five years by three million a year so 
that states will have ample time to absorb new budgetary demands. 
After the five year period the Department of Education would then 
operate at roughly half  of it present cost in fiscal 1996 and would 
retain a  cap on it's budget not to exceed  60% of the fiscal 1996 
budget. Funding will be used solely as aid to build schools, refurbish 
closed schools, and to provide grants as budgetary restraints allow. 
It will also require a user fee to be imposed on families who 
participate public schools with regards to income, cost of living 
within a particular area, and amount of children within that family 
who attend public school. This fee will be payable by the beginning of 
the next school year and that fee will be payable pass or fail. If 
they cannot afford the fee then arrangements will be made for their 
child to attend while they pay the fee. The PSFA will also call for an 
end of Magnet Schools as they will not be needed. States will be able 
to hold lotteries to fund education and will be required to relinquish 
all proceeds for that purpose if it is originally intended for that 
purpose. The PSFA will also allow neighborhood schools to solicit 
private business for contributions of funds and equipment such as 
computers, and any other items suitable for either liberal arts 
education or vocational education. This plan will ensure that fairness 
in funding public school will be paramount and that no one group will 
carry the entire burden.  <p>
The major objective of the PSFA is to return to  a more communities 
based education by diminishing the demand on few schools that exist in 
many cities. Families will have schools that they can be proud of and 
they will have schools that they will feel obligated to take an active 
interest in because they are a partner of that school. Also as 
partners who directly pay into their neighborhood school they will 
hopefully take a more active interest in their child's education and 
will hopefully take an active leadership role in insuring the success 
of their child in his academic endeavors. <p>
The need for an end to social experimentation in public schools is 
very relevant because it does not encourage children to be 
individuals. It is no more right to use schools for indoctrination 
purposes than it is to segregate them and make them exclusionary if 
they are provided by government at any level. Individuals come into 
agreement to form governments for the common good of those who choose 
live within that government therein. So to insure that the civil 
liberties of all students who attend public school won't be abridged 
within reason there is a need for an Ethics in Public School Act. This 
act would allow religious expression in public school. It would allow 
for groups who share a common religious bond to assemble for religious 
activities. The limits on these activities would be decided by local 
and state administrations. It will also protect any philosophical 
expression, speech, and belief as supported by the first amendment of 
the constitution. Anti-Discriminatory policies still apply. It will 
not provide for lead prayer in classrooms but it will not discourage 
any expression in private during a moment of silence. The EPSA would 
also make students who engage in a Felony such as murder, attempted 
murder, or dealing drugs within public school property will be 
punished as a mature adult. <p>
It is important for children and families to believe in the schools 
they are directly or indirectly taking a part in. It is also important 
for children not only to know that their civil liberties won't be 
abridged beyond absurdity, but it is important of all to know that 
they are individuals and that they live in a society of individuals. 
Part of knowing that is in being able to see the differences people 
possess. To know that all beliefs are supported will insure that 
mutual respect exist among students as long as they are in public 
school. <p>
These are ideas that the Republican Party should consider advocating 
in the up and coming election in 1996. They are fair and they would be 
simple to implement. As Republicans we can all agree it should be our 
purpose to limit government as much as possible while trying to be as 
fair as possible at the same time. We should also not be fearful of 
experimentation especially when the future of our children is at 
stake. <p>

<h2>Choice in Action:</h2><br>
<h3>What's Working Around the Country</h3><p>
<i>The Center for Education Reform</i> 
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
With the increasing demand for better schools, dozens of states and 
communities are providing more options to families. By doing so, they 
are not only improving the condition of education for those children, but 
having a dramatic impact on how schools operate in their communities.  
Armed with the evidence presented below, lawmakers in each of a dozen 
states will soon give serious consideration to launching and expanding 
upon the school choices provided to their citizens.<p> 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, implemented the nation's first pilot school 
choice plan in September, 1990.  The program provides up to 1,500 low-
income children with a grant of half the Milwaukee per-pupil expenditure 
($3,200 for the 1994-95 school year) to attend the private, non-sectarian 
school of their choice.   In 1990, 341 Milwaukee children used grants at 
six private schools.  Today, the initiative is enabling 830 students to 
attend one of thirteen participating private schools -- with hundreds of 
children on waiting lists. Participation in the Milwaukee program has 
been limited because of restrictions on the schools that may participate.  
However, Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson has pledged to expand 
the program to allow all private schools, including sectarian schools, to 
participate, and has included funds for such an expansion in his 1995 
budget.<p> 
Evaluations for the Milwaukee program show that choice students are 
ten times more likely than their public school counterparts to stay in their 
choice school through the year, and 50% more likely to be there the next 
year, despite the fact that choice students are more often from single-
parent homes on welfare, closest to the poverty line.  The choice program 
has resulted in high levels of parent and student satisfaction, increased 
parental involvement in their children's education and with the schools, 
and improved discipline and attendance.(1)<p> 
In September, 1993, the Puerto Rico legislature passed the first state-
wide full school choice law, providing $1,500 grants for children from 
low-income families to attend a private school or a public school of their 
choice.  In 1993, 1,596 students participated in the program; in 1994 that 
number increased more than ten-fold, to 16,899.  The vast majority of 
those students -- 88% -- chose to transfer from a private or a public 
school into another public school; the rest opted for a private school.  In 
1994, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court declared the section of the program 
extending to private schools unconstitutional, but the decision did not 
affect the nearly 15,000 children using the public school choice option.  
The ruling also did not affect the reality that so many children, once 
empowered, chose to go to a different school, whether public or private.<p> 
The earliest evidence of choice working came from New York's East 
Harlem school district.  In 1974, the school district gave parents the right 
to choose among diverse schools-within-schools created by teachers.  The 
resulting competition increased education quality: graduation rates shot 
up from less than 50 percent to more than 90 percent; the district, which 
ranked last of New York City's 32 districts in reading scores, climbed to 
16th; community morale soared as the choice program brought parents 
and teachers together to work on behalf of their children; and the plan 
continues to attract students from districts across New York City, creating 
voluntary desegregation.  The students are strong choice proponents, and 
say it gives them a sense of ownership and pride in their schools that they 
did not have before.<p> 
In 1993, when another three New York City districts opened up schools 
to choice, a summer school fair drew over 1,000 parents eager to learn 
about their options.  Choice for the city's 80,000 high schoolers is 
available through the wide array of magnet schools that operate 
throughout New York City, many on a selective admissions basis.  And 
the trend has spread to other urban districts demanding a better system.  
In Boston, Massachusetts (enrollment 60,000), Indianapolis, Indiana 
(enrollment 47,000), and Detroit, Michigan (enrollment 50,000), parents 
must choose which school their child will attend.  In Boston, 57% of 
students now choose to go to schools other than those to which they were 
assigned.<p> 
The competition among schools trying to attract students -- even when 
limited to the public sector -- has forced schools to be more informative 
to parents and to offer a better product.  When open enrollment was 
introduced in Los Angeles in the Fall of 1993, with 22,000 seats open in 
the district, schools aggressively marketed their wares via cable television 
and local newspapers to attract parents and show they could offer their 
children something better.  And when schools in a choice state are faced 
with dipping enrollments, they are forced to raise their own standards.  
When high school students began to use Minnesota's post-secondary 
enrollment option to earn their high school credits on college campuses, 
high schools responded by quadrupling the number of advance placement 
courses they offered in order to attract students, and their funding, back 
to the high schools.<p> 
In fact, in Minnesota 15% of the state's 750,000 public school students 
participate in the various choice programs available throughout the state -
- using their school choice to get the education best tailored to their 
needs.  In 1987, the program's first year, over 2,000 dropouts enrolled in 
alternative schools through the new choice plan; by 1993, 14,000 
dropouts were opting back into schools through Minnesota's various 
"second chance" programs.  Recently, the first religiously affiliated high 
school joined the ranks of private high schools in the state contracted by 
districts to educate at-risk students that the public school system can no 
longer handle. Through a similar program in Arizona, districts every year 
send about 2,000 children who aren't benefiting from their district school 
to private schools more suited to their needs.<p> 
Meanwhile, private scholarship programs are working in more than 20 
cities to enable over 8,500 children from disadvantaged families to attend 
the school of their choice.  And nearly 10,000 children are on waiting 
lists. The infusion of private enterprise into the choice equation not only 
enhances the options available to children, particularly the most 
underprivileged, but also imposes a greater challenge to existing public 
schools to respond more directly to children's' needs.<p> 
Throughout the country, dozens of public and private sector programs 
are expanding the choices available to families, and, in so doing, are 
having a positive effect on the quality of education all children receive.<p>

<center><h3>FOR-PROFIT PUBLIC SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SPREADS</h3></center><p> 
The Minneapolis School Board recently voted to hand over the 
management of all the city's public schools to Public Strategies 
Group, Inc., a private consulting firm that specializes in operating 
public organizations. The Minneapolis-based firm will manage the 
school district's 75 schools and $220 million budget. The school board 
would continue to set policy. The Minneapolis plan is the first 
district-wide privately run program in the country. Elsewhere, only a 
single school or small group of schools is run privately. <p>
Peter Hutchinson, President of Public Strategies, will replace 
the school superintendent if the state grants a waiver to allow a 
person without the traditional credentials to head the school system. 
Hutchinson's pay and the firm's fee will be tied to completion of 
goals such as gains in test scores, improved attendance, and declines 
in violent school incidents.<p>
Public Strategies hopes to revolutionize the way schools are run. 
The firm's CEO, Babak Armajani, says "We want to change the schools 
from the culture of bureaucracy to a culture that focuses on customer 
service, where the parents and students are the customers."<p>
Using management techniques from private schools, companies such 
as Public Strategies are confident they can provide better services 
than publicly run school districts for the same or even less money. 
Critics claim profits will take precedence over quality and 
efficiency. "There is a cynicism about the companies," says Albert 
Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers. "In every 
other sphere of life, if someone came along and said they have a 
special potion to fix schools, you wouldn't treat them as wonderful 
innovators. You would call them hucksters." <p>
But the experience to date suggests Shanker's view is unfounded. 
An earlier venture by Education Alternatives, Inc. (see BEI #8, 11, 
18, 19), a Minneapolis-based private, for-profit company, is in its 
third year of running the South Pointe Elementary School in Dade 
County, Florida, and has run nine public schools in Baltimore, 
Maryland, since August 1992. The company's plan is to test students to 
determine whether they learn best by doing, reading, or hearing, and 
then devise an individual learning plan for each student. Preliminary 
data from April-June 1993, indicate that the students in the Education 
Alternatives schools on average advanced at almost three times the 
rate of those in comparable classes in reading and math. <p>
These early results have satisfied many of the earlier critics 
about the motives of Education Alternatives, Inc. Elijah E. Cummings, 
a Maryland legislator whose district includes the neighborhood where 
the company has taken over the schools, states, "I was the company's 
No. 1 opponent because I had reservations about their profit motive. 
But it has changed the attitude not only of children but of teachers. 
Never have I seen this kind of turnaround."<p>
Parents and students also praise the new arrangement. Pamela 
Brown, a mother, told The New York Times recently, "A lot of parents 
say their kids come home singing. Kids are excited about going to 
school." Adds Sean Urquhart, a fifth grader, "It used to be a boring 
old school. Now its fun and exciting."<p>
Another company hoping to duplicate this Baltimore performance is 
the Edison Project (see BEI #18, 20, 24), headed by entrepreneur 
Christopher Whittle. Its original goal was to build two hundred for-
profit schools by 1996, at a cost of $2.5 billion. But this ambitious 
plan failed to draw sufficient investors, and the plan has now been 
scaled back to a joint public-private partnership, with public school 
systems providing 80 percent to 100 percent of the funds they 
currently spend on students, and private investors spending up to $3.5 
million to upgrade each school. Its new goal is to run six to ten 
charter schools by 1995.<p>
The Edison plan envisions a teacher-student ratio of one to 
sixteen, hiring and firing of teachers based on performance, school 
days of eight hours, school years of 210 days, a six-week summer 
break, a personal computer for each student that parents can also use 
to interact with school officials, stricter discipline, and a core 
curriculum.<p>
School districts intrigued with the idea of private management 
hope the ventures will provide better services at lower cost. Many 
will be looking carefully at Minneapolis to see if this proves to be 
the case. <p>

<h3><center>NATIONAL SCHOOL CHOICE IN SWEDEN</h3></center>
While America debates school choice, Sweden, the model of 
socialist experimentation, has opened up its entire school system to 
genuine competition.<p>
Before the advent of the school choice plan, which was introduced 
in 1992, Swedish government schools enjoyed a virtual monopoly in the 
education system: 99 percent of the Swedish school-age population 
attended public schools. Swedish officials concluded, however, that a 
monopolistic system does not work. "Monopoly is just as disastrous in 
schools as in any other area," says Under Secretary of Education Odd 
Eiken. "We need an alternative, competing system."<p>
Under the new national school choice plan, Swedish parents can 
choose any public or private school anywhere in Sweden. If a student 
chooses to attend a school other than a public school, he gets a 
voucher worth 85 percent of the average cost per student in his 
municipality. Swedish officials insist that a voucher worth 85 percent 
is better than one worth 100 percent, because it creates an incentive 
for parents to find more effective and less expensive schools.<p>
All private schools participating in the voucher program must be 
approved by the Ministry of Education. The basic requirements include 
a core curriculum, no racial or religious discrimination, and an 
agreement that the student's performance will be monitored and 
evaluated by the national evaluation system. Religious schools may 
participate in the voucher program.<p>
Since parliament approved the reform, the number of private 
schools has doubled in response to the demands of Swedish students and 
parents dissatisfied with the quality of government education. Says 
Eiken, "We get a new private school every week."A variety of 
organizations are starting these new schools. Christian and Montessori 
groups are taking the lead. But many have been formed by groups of 
low- and middle-income parents, who have formed companies or co-
operatives to operate schools in their own communities.<p>
Sweden plans to extend the school choice idea to its university 
system. Today, the Swedish government is deeply involved in university 
decision-making -- from faculty appointments to the type of research a 
university pursues. The Swedish government aims to replace this with 
an American-style system, in which universities will decide their own 
admission procedures as well as the way courses and study programs are 
organized. According to Per Unckel, the Swedish Minister of Science 
and Education, this is the only way to improve the system: "Higher 
education and research must be given extensive freedom, and the 
incentives to attain high standards."<p>

<h3><center>SLOW REFORM WORRIES BUSINESS LEADERS</h3></center><p>
A recent report by the Conference Board, a New York City-based 
business organization, says that business leaders are very concerned 
about the lack of progress in American schools. The report, entitled 
"Ten Years After A Nation At Risk," is based on a survey and 
interviews of business leaders and educators.<p>
Authored by Conference Board researchers Leonard Lund and 
Cathleen Wild, the report says that, "While affirming the good 
intentions and the effort in workplace programs," business leaders 
"are deeply disturbed by the lack of broad-based measurable results." 
According to the study, business leaders believe there must be a 
stronger commitment to systematic change, including deregulation and 
school choice. For example, retired IBM education director Jack 
Bowsher told the authors that, "The business leaders of this country 
must demand a total restructuring of the American public school system 
in future years. Then, the C.E.O.s and other well-intentioned leaders 
could decide if they wish to continue to support 'quick-fix feel-good' 
programs that only fine-tune the existing paradigm."<p>
Lund and Wild note that although huge amounts of money have been 
poured into the public school system by business over the past ten 
years since the Department of Education's A Nation At Risk report was 
released, there has been little measurable progress. As Bowsher puts 
it, "The return on investment in education is minimal when one applies 
real quality-control measurements to the public school system."<p>

<h3><center>PRIVATE VOUCHER PROGRAMS FLOURISH </h3></center><p>
The Scholarship Fund for Inner-City Children, a private group 
based in Newark, New Jersey, is making school choice a reality for 
poor children who need it most. Founded in 1984, the Fund already has 
provided 13,700 scholarships.<p>
The fund will disburse $480,000 in scholarships during the 1993-
1994 school year to allow needy students to attend one of the 95 
Catholic inner-city elementary and secondary schools within the 
Archdiocese of Newark, which covers Essex, Hudson, Union, and Bergen 
counties. Only just over half of the scholarship students are 
Catholic. As Kevin Moriarty, the Fund's executive director, notes, 
"Most of our scholarship recipients live in areas where the public 
schools are ineffective and unsafe. For these children a Catholic 
school education represents a golden opportunity to escape from 
poverty and join the mainstream of society. The Fund together with 
Catholic schools gives thousands of children a choice of schools and a 
chance for a brighter future."<p>
In almost every case, a scholarship student graduates and goes on 
to college. "The graduation rate for Catholic high schools within the 
Archdiocese is more than 99 percent," says James H. Lynch, Jr., 
president of the Fund's Board of Trustees, "and 92 percent of their 
graduates enter college immediately upon graduation. If our 
organization can help children in need and at risk to attend schools 
that good, I know that we are doing something worthwhile." <p>
In addition to offering scholarships for elementary and secondary 
education, the Fund participates in programs with Fairleigh Dickinson 
University and Kean College, through which more than $250,000 in 
college scholarships have been awarded to Catholic high school 
graduates for the coming school year.<p>
The Scholarship Program also gives grants to schools to develop 
programs and curricula that address the particular needs of their 
students. For example, one recent grant was given to St. Patrick High 
School in Elizabeth to help establish a Special Education Program for 
students with learning disabilities. The Fund is providing $62,000 
this year to support twelve school-based educational programs similar 
to the one in Elizabeth.<p>
All of the money distributed by the Fund is the result of 
personal, foundation, and corporate donations. The DeWitt Wallace-
Reader's Digest Fund is the largest supporter of the Fund's 
scholarship program. The Samuel I. Newhouse Foundation and the Public 
Service Electric and Gas Company are the largest supporters of its 
school-based programs.<p>
Along with the Scholarship Fund, there are major programs in 
several other cities which help poor children attend the school of 
their choice. Among the private sponsors who perform this role are the 
Indiana-based Golden Rule Insurance Company (BEI #12, 17, 19), the 
Texas Public Policy Foundation (BEI #19), the Milwaukee-based Lynde 
and Harry Bradley Foundation (BEI #6, 21), the Georgia Public Policy 
Foundation (BEI #23), the Student/Sponsor Partnership in New York 
City, and the Washington, D.C.-based Charity for Choice (BEI #23). In 
addition, Bob Woodson, President of the National Center for 
Neighborhood Enterprise, is busy setting up a similar program in 
Newark. Low-income parents have been very eager to seize the 
opportunity to give their children a private alternative to failing 
inner-city schools.<p>

<h3><center>THE QUIET CRISIS:  SCHOOLS FAIL AMERICA'S BRIGHTEST</h3></center><p> 	
A recent report, "National Excellence: A Case for Developing 
America's Talent," published by the U.S. Department of Education, 
claims that America's public schools are failing their smartest 
students.  Many bright students, particularly poor and minority 
students, are not encouraged to work hard or master complex material, 
thereby learning less than their counterparts around the world. The 
result: an absence of high-achieving graduates, particularly in 
mathematics and science. <p>
According to the Department's report, "The U.S. shortage of 
graduate students in mathematics and science forces many large 
companies -- such as Texas Instruments, Bell Laboratories and IBM -- 
to fill jobs, particularly in research, with people educated outside 
the United States."<p>
Most gifted elementary school children have mastered from a third 
to half of the year's curriculum before the first day of class. But 
most teachers make little provision for the special needs of these 
children. In fact, the report finds that 84 percent of assignments for 
gifted students are the same as those for the rest of the class. In 
addition, a survey of gifted high school students finds that they 
spend less than an hour a day doing homework. As Secretary of 
Education Richard Riley writes in the foreword to the report, 
"Youngsters with gifts and talents that range from mathematical to 
musical are not challenged to work to their fullest potential."<p>
The official report urges public schools to let all children 
progress through challenging material at their own pace, and grouping 
students based on their interests and needs.<p>

<h3><center>BIG MONEY BEATS PROPOSITION 174 </h3></center><p>
While California's Proposition 174, which would have created a 
voucher system for California's schools, lost heavily on November 2, 
exit polls indicate that school choice in California is not dead. 
According to an election day exit poll by Luntz Weber Research and 
Strategic Services, more than half of those who voted against 
Proposition 174 would support a different school choice initiative, 
while only 18 percent of Californians are fully opposed to the concept 
of choice in education. The measure gained only 29 percent of the 
vote.<p>
Money appears to have been the biggest factor in Proposition 
174's defeat. School choice advocates were outspent by a 10-to-1 
margin; opponents raised over $16 million for an anti-voucher media 
blitz. Heading up the opposition campaign was the California Teacher's 
Association, who raised $12.5 million by assessing each of its members 
$57. The ad blitz began in mid-September, causing the Proposition to 
slip in the polls. With only $2.6 million available for its 
activities, the pro-voucher campaign could not fight the deluge of 
negative publicity.<p>
While anti-voucher forces had no trouble collecting money for 
their campaign, proponents of Proposition 174 had great difficulty. 
One reason for this is that business leaders were noticeably absent 
from the effort. Ken Kachigian, campaign manager for Proposition 174, 
summed up the situation: "The business community wimped out." Many in 
the business community do not realize the great amount of money the 
present education system is costing them. By not supporting true 
reforms like school choice, they have, in effect, played into the hand 
of the education establishment. Former Education Secretary William 
Bennett notes, "Business always likes to present itself as a friend of 
education, but ends up as a friend of the education establishment."<p>
Despite these difficulties and Proposition 174's defeat, a future 
choice initiative could pass. According to exit polls, 73 percent of 
voters would have voted for the choice measure if they had not felt 
that it would cut the per-pupil spending for public schools. In 
addition, nearly three-fourths of all California voters grade the 
California education system with a "C" or less. There also seems to be 
political capital in endorsing school choice, since 49 percent of the 
electorate say they would be more likely to vote for a public official 
who supports it. Finally, California voters rank the PTA as the single 
most credible organization in the education debate by a 2-to-1 ratio 
over the California Teacher's Association and a 5-to-1 ratio over the 
American Federation of Teachers.<p>
Although the statewide voucher plan was defeated, the threat of 
passage pushed the California state legis-lature into adopting several 
choice reforms to blunt the momentum. These included a mandate on 
school districts to permit choice within their districts, an expansion 
of inter-district choice, and a charter school measure. None of these 
would have been enacted, say choice proponents, without the threat of 
174.<p>
<hr>
<br>
<h3><center>SPEAKER'S CORNER </h3></center><p>
Do the teacher unions represent the ideas and interests of teachers?  
You decide:  <p>
A thousand public school teachers were asked, "If you had to pick one 
of the following as the area that should be given the highest priority 
in public education policy for the next few years, what would it be?" 
 Fully 80 percent of the teachers questioned replied that 
strengthening parents' roles in their children's education should 
receive priority.  <p>
The teacher unions, however, oppose letting parents choose the schools 
their children attend and other education reforms which increase 
parental involvement.  <p>
Seventy-three percent of teachers support expanding alternative 
certification to open the teaching field to qualified professionals 
with degrees in areas other than "education," such as scientists, 
historians, and writers.  <p>
The teacher unions oppose alternative teacher certification.  <p>

<h2>Private School Choice: <br>
Governor Thompson's Philosophy </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
<h3><center>Improve Education </h3></center><p>
Milwaukee Public Schools are in dire straits.  Nearly half of its students 
don't graduate, and those who do graduate with an average of 1.6 grade 
point average, which breaks out to a D+. Therefore we need to try new 
ideas geared to breaking the status quo and improving education in 
Milwaukee, particularly for inner city students.  Keep in mind, the 
governor only sees School Choice as one element to the solution; there is 
no silver bullet for this problem. That is why it is imperative that new 
ideas and initiatives be given a chance in Milwaukee. We need to be 
innovative.  <p>
<center><h3>Parent Power </h3></center>
The governor believes that parents need to be empowered as an important 
first step in improving education. Getting parents more  
involved in choosing the school their child attends and monitoring how  
they are doing at that school is a gigantic plus toward making sure  
students are more dedicated to learning and getting a better education.  
The school choice program empowers parents -- particularly poor  
parents -- by giving them a choice. Right now, they don't have a choice.  
They're stuck with the public school the state says their child must  
attend. <p>
<center><h3>Opportunity/Equity </h3></center>
This is at the core of the governor's beliefs. He believes that poor parents 
in Milwaukee should have the same opportunities to educate their 
children as more wealthy parents. Right now, if a wealthy parent is 
unsatisfied with the child's public school, she can afford to send her to a 
private school of higher quality. She has a choice. A poor mother at the 
corner of Sixth and North in Milwaukee doesn't have a choice because 
she cannot afford to send her child to a private school. She's stuck. The 
governor believes that is unfair and detrimental to that child's education 
and future opportunities. The governor sees school choice as just one 
vehicle to provide more opportunities for poor children and families -- 
opportunities that will hopefully enable them to climb out of poverty and 
break the generational cycle. <p>
As a related issue, it's very interesting that a study by the Center for  
Education Reform showed that 33 percent of Milwaukee public school  
teachers send their own children to private schools. First, they can afford  
it and have a choice, unlike poor parents. Second, what's good enough  
for school teachers' kids should be good enough for poor kids. Yet, the  
teachers union is the biggest opponent of school choice. <p>
<center><h3>Constitutionality </center></h3>
If anything is inconsistent in the constitutional question it is that religious 
school choice is not allowed at the K-12 level. Currently, public money is 
allowed to be spent at private, religious pre-schools and day care centers 
(via day care grants) and at religious colleges and universities (via Pell 
grants, G.l. Bill, student loans.) It is only at the K-12 level that we say 
"no," public money can't be spent on private education. Why? School 
choice is very consistent with past practices in this country when it comes 
to education. Also, the voucher system helps address constitutionality 
questions. The parents control the voucher; they decide where it is spent. 
All we're saying is that if they want to spend that voucher at a religious 
school, that is allowable. <p>

<title>Religious School Choice Plan</title>

<i>June 29, 1995</i>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Gov. Thompson's Religious School Choice Plan Passes</h2><p>
<i><b>Wisconsin becomes first state to offer real education choices to poor 
parents</b></i> 
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
MADISON -- Gov. Tommy G. Thompson's watershed religious school 
choice program was passed by the Wisconsin Legislature on Thursday, 
making Wisconsin the first state in the nation to give poor parents  
the full opportunity to choose where to send their children to school. <p>
The religious school choice program is limited to the city of Milwaukee, 
where the state's current non-sectarian school choice program is already 
in operation. In 1990, Wisconsin became the first state to pass private, 
non-sectarian school choice. <p> 
"The expansion of our school choice program to include religious schools 
will truly empower the poor parents of Milwaukee, giving them the same 
educational choices for their children as other parents," Gov. Thompson 
said. "If a poor inner city mother wants to send her child to the private 
school across the street, rather than busing her child across town to a 
public school she is dissatisfied with, she should have that opportunity 
regardless of her income." <p> 
"Religious values aren't our problem. Drop out rates and low test scores 
are," the governor added. "School choice is a belief that parents know 
best when it comes to their children, not bureaucrats." <p> 
The religious school choice program will accommodate 7,000 students 
beginning with this fall's school year, with an increase to 15,000 students 
in the 1996-97 school year and thereafter. <p> 
The state Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates the program will cost $17 
million the first year and $39 million the second year for a total of $56 
million. The money will come from a reduction in state aid to Milwaukee 
Public Schools commensurate with the number of students participating 
in the choice program In other words, the money follows the child. The 
payment for each participating student would be equal to whichever is 
less: the private school's operating cost as determined by the state 
education department (on average about $2,800), or the states per pupil 
aid to MPS (about $4,000 in l995-96). <p> 
The religious school choice program gives vouchers to parents who then 
choose the school for their child, thus addressing any constitutionality 
concerns. The governor notes that the state and federal government  
currently pays for children to attend religious preschools or day care 
centers and for students to attend religious colleges and universities, so 
it's now time to include K-12 schools in the mix. <p> 
To be eligible for the program, a student must come from a family whose 
income- is at or below 175 percent of the poverty level (about $26,000 
for a family of four ) For schools to be eligible, they must be  
located within the city of Milwaukee.<p>   
Religious school choice was passed as part of Gov. Thompson's 1995-97 
biennial budget bill. The governor plans to sign the bill within the next 
month. <p>

<h3>SCHOOL CHOICE RALLY 
MESSMER HIGH SCHOOL 
MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN </h3><p>
<h2>A Speech by Gov. Tommy G Thompson of Wisconsin</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
THANK YOU, BROTHER BOB. <p>
WHAT A DAY! <p>
 THIS MORNING I SIGNED INTO LAW THE MOST  
REVOLUTIONARY BUDGET IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY ... <p>
 AND THIS AFTERNOON WE ARE HER; TO CELEBRATE ONE OF  
THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY PARTS OF THAT BUDGET ... THE  
EXPANSION OF THE MILWAUKEE PARENTAL SCHOOL CHOICE  
PLAN. <p> 
"REVOLUTIONARY" IS NOT OVER-STATING THE CASE: THE  
MILWAUKEE SCHOOL CHOICE PROGRAM WAS "THE SHOT  
HEARD ROUND THE WORLD." WE WERE THE FIRST. <p> 
AND NOW OTHERS ARE FOLLOWING OUR LEAD ... OHIO IS  
STARTING SCHOOL CHOICE IN CLEVELAND ... WASHINGTON  
D.C. IS TALKING ABOUT A VOUCHER PROGRAM. <p> 
(YOU KNOW YOU'RE MAKING PROGRESS WHEN WE  
WASHINGTON POST FINALLY ADMITS YOU MIGHT  
ACTUALLY HAVE A GOOD IDEA.) <p> 
WHAT SCHOOL CHOICE IS DOING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  
IS VERY SIMPLE: IT IS REDEFINING PUBLIC EDUCATION.  <p> 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS MUST NO LONGER BE GOVERNMENT-RUN 
SCHOOLS. THEY WILL BE SCHOOLS THAT SERVE THE PUBLIC.  <p> 
SCHOOL CHOICE IS MORE THAN A PROGRAM .. IT IS A  
PHILOSOPHY. <p>
IT IS THE BELIEF THAT PARENTS KNOW BEST WHEN IT COMES  
TO THEIR CHILDREN ... <p> 
AND IT IS THE BELIEF THAT POOR PARENTS HAVE THE SAME  
RIGHT TO CHOOSE THAT OTHER PARENTS DO. <p> 
THAT'S EDUCATION THAT IS SERVING THE PUBLIC. <p> 
WHY SHOULD WE BUS OUR CHILDREN ACROSS TOWN WHEN  
THERE ARE PERFECTLY GOOD SCHOOLS RIGHT IN THEIR OWN  
NEIGHBORHOODS? SCHOOLS LIKE MESSMER. <p> 
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. AND IT ALSO DOESN'T  
MAKE ANY SENSE TO CROSS VERY GOOD SCHOOLS OFF THE  
LIST SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A RELIGIOUS 
AFFILIATION.<p> 
RELIGIOUS VALUES ARE NOT OUR PROBLEM, LADIES AND 
GENTLEMAN, DROP-OUT RATES ARE. <p> 
I AM NOT NAIVE. I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO FACE A FIGHT  
ON THIS. <p> 
BUT I ALSO KNOW WE ARE GOING TO WIN ... BECAUSE WE 
ARE RIGHT! <p> 
OUR OPPONENTS WILL THROW UP SMOKE SCREENS. THEY'LL  
SAY THE ISSUE HERE IS THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND   
STATE. <p> 
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE ISSUE IS HERE -- TO MAKE SURE  
MILWAUKEE SCHOOL CHILDREN RECEIVE THE BEST  
EDUCATION POSSIBLE... PERIOD. <p> 
THAT'S THE ISSUE ... THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY ...  
AND THAT'S WHY WE WILL WIN ANY COURT BATTLES THEY  
THROW IN OUR WAY. <p> 
ONE-THIRD OF MILWAUKEE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS SEND  
THEIR CHILDREN TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS. <p> 
IT SEEMS TO ME WHAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM OUGHT  
TO BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ALL OF YOU. <p>
THE PHONES ARE RINGING OFF THE HOOK. THOUSANDS OF  
PARENTS HAVE ALREADY CALLED TO MY "GIVE US A  
CHANCE ... GIVE US A CHOICE." <p> 
MEANTIME, OUR OPPONENTS ARE FIGHTING US. THEY'RE  
GOING TO SPEND THEIR MONEY ... THEY'RE GOING TO SUE ...  
THEY'RE GOING TO STAND IN THE WAY OF CHANGE. <p> 
THEY CAN AFFORD TO ... THEY ALREADY HAVE THE CHOICE. <p> 
SO TODAY, WE ARE LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. <p> 
WE ARE SAYING IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU LIVE ON LAKE  
DRIVE ... OR 35TH AND NORTH ... <p> 
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE BEST  
SCHOOL FOR YOUR OWN CHILD. <p> 
TOGETHER, YOU AND I HAVE TURNED MILWAUKEE INTO THE  
LEXINGTON AND CONCORD OF THE EDUCATION REFORM  
BATTLEFRONT. <p>
TODAY, WE ARE TAKING THE NEXT STEP. EVERYONE IS  
LOOKING TO US. <p> 
LETS SHOW THEM WHAT WE'VE GOT! <p>
THANK YOU. <p>

<title>What I Really Learned in School Today</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>What I Learned at School Today</h2>
<i>Peter W. Schramm</i>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
I went to the former Soviet Union again this April. For a week I 
lectured and conducted seminars for sixty Estonian (both Estonian 
and Russian speaking) high school teachers. You would think that 
teaching the principles and practices -- with its many flaws of 
democracy to people who have been living under communist tyranny 
for five decades would be quite a chore. The truth is it is not. 
They are intelligent, hard working, and keen to learn. Besides, 
the principles of natural rights, constitutional government, 
equality of opportunity, and so on, seem to be something they 
almost instinctively understand. Their new laws reflect their 
sound understanding.<p>
I arrive back home heartened by what I have seen and the progress 
Estonia has made since my last visit. In good spirits I return to 
the classroom, my home. Sharing my excitement and what I have 
learned with my students, my thinking seems clearer and more 
deliberate. A few days later I enter my seminar on the 
theoretical difference between the French and American 
Revolutions. Surprised by seven or eight young girls in the room 
whom I had never seen, I am told that they are junior high school 
students from a nearby community in Northern Ohio who are 
visiting the University, part of a program to encourage them to 
start thinking about higher education.<p>
After the introductions, I politely ask them what they are about, 
what they are interested in, and so on. I was thinking that after 
a few minutes of civility, I would just begin my class and they 
would have an idea of what goes on at a university.<p>
But something unexpected happened. Without hesitation or 
provocation they began making pronouncements. They begin by 
telling me that they do not stand for the National Anthem, nor do 
they recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Although surprised by both 
the subject and the tone, I pursue it by asking them why. They 
assert that because both Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln (!) 
had slaves, America is profoundly corrupt, always ready and 
willing to be oppressive. That is what the flag represents. The 
situation, they maintain, is not much better now. They all feel 
oppressed, prejudice reigns, and they are in a continual state of 
depression as a result.<p>
I decide to begin with a fact. Abraham Lincoln did not own 
slaves, and was opposed to slavery his whole life. One student 
responds firmly: that is not true, our history book says that 
Lincoln owned slaves. I maintain the opposite, but not 
persuasively. Finally, I think more as a result of my position 
and age, they seem to let me have my way about this one fact. 
However, without taking a breath, she begins to maintain that it 
doesn't matter if he actually owned slaves or not because he had 
black people working for him, and that's just like slavery 
anyway, isn't it? After all, she was certain that they weren't 
well paid.<p>
Although shocked at the turn of the discussion, I regroup and 
take a different tack. I rhetorically start defending slavery. I 
tell them that I think slavery is a good thing. They are aghast, 
but I push on. I tell them that slavery has existed in virtually 
all societies for millennia. Indeed, it is only during the last 
couple of centuries or so that it has been called into question 
and actually ended, at least in the West. I ask them what the 
matter is with slavery; I think slavery is good. They are 
squirming in their seats now. I ask again, "If you think that 
slavery is wrong, tell us why it is wrong." They murmur, hem and 
haw, but no answer. I repeat my question, in different form, to 
see if they are thinking. I ask, why should one human being not 
rule another human being without his consent? Why should a person 
not treat another as I treat my cow or dog? I think I sense that 
their minds are beginning to go into first gear. Yes, I begin to 
see movement. One thirteen year old says: "You shouldn't treat 
people like dogs because they are not dogs." They are different, 
she says.<p>
All right, I say. Now there is a document, a very important 
document at the founding of the United States that uses this 
self-evident truth. What is the principle, and what document is 
it to be found in? They're quiet again. But this time I know they 
are starting to think. Definitely a movement, a lurching forward. 
After some minutes of thoughtfulness -- and some huddling on 
their part -- one of them announces, "All men are created equal, 
and it's in the Constitution."<p>
First part true; second false. What document? Another try claims 
that it's the Bill of Rights. No. They are thinking again. Two 
minutes later someone says, "The Declaration of Independence." 
All right! Now I try to articulate, by continuing to pose 
questions to them, what this means. If it is true that all -- I 
emphasize the all -- men are created equal, that none is so 
obviously superior to another as to be his natural ruler, then 
what follows this self-evident truth is that men have to agree to 
be ruled by someone else, and only for a limited period. Slavery, 
one man ruling another without the other's consent, is wrong. 
They agree. And they are much quieter than they have been. 
Although one is daydreaming, the others seem focused and even 
eager to see where we go next.<p>
Next I merely point out to them that before the founding of the 
United States of America, no political order, no country, had 
ever asserted such principles. This was the first time. We're 
back to the fact that slavery continued to exist in this new 
political order, but in understanding this practical 
imperfection, we now begin to see it at its theoretical best. 
This is the thing Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr. could 
appeal to when they wanted to bring the country back to its true 
self. They see it.<p>
The discussion is by no means finished. I get back to the Pledge 
of Allegiance and ask what it is they object to in it. After some 
false starts they maintain that they do not like to pledge to the 
flag because it is a symbol of the imperfection; of slavery, of 
taking the Indian's land, etc. I get someone to recite the 
Pledge, and she finally does so not without some assistance. I 
point out that it says that the flag stands for the Republic and 
for "liberty and justice for all." I ask if there are any 
objections to liberty and justice for all. I emphasize the all. 
Someone whispers, "No, I don't have an objection to liberty and 
justice for all." Thank you.<p>
Sometime during this discussion one of the girls announces that 
she is a mulatto. Pretending not to know what this means, I ask 
what it is and why is it important. She says that her father is 
white and mother is black, and a grandparent was an Indian. This 
is important, she maintains, because it allows her to clarify 
what she is as a person. It gives her identity. We have a long 
discussion about race that culminates in my asking, "Have you 
ever met anyone who is not a mulatto?" She sees my point. No, she 
never has met any such person. We then talk about our own 
individual characters, and how nice it would be if we were all 
judged only by the content of our character, rather than the 
color of our skin, or who our grandparents were, or where we came 
from. This way we could take responsibility for our own lives. 
Everybody is thinking now, also feeling a bit better about 
themselves and what the future may portend.<p>
We then conclude our discussion by talking more explicitly about 
what an education is, an education that should be liberating of 
the self from the reigning silly opinions one encounters. We talk 
about reading books, writing, thinking. We talk about waking up 
each morning knowing we are better human beings than we were the 
day before because we learned something that day . We have tested 
our mettle a bit, and we are better for it.<p>
These were your average, normally intelligent, young Americans. I 
liked them. I could spend time with them; they are capable of 
learning and thinking. They are capable of becoming citizens. But 
isn't it interesting that eight full grades into their public 
education, they don't seem to know very much, and what they think 
they know is almost never so. Who is responsible for this state 
of affairs? Why has it come to pass? Why do I go to Estonia to 
teach? I should stay at home, there is no travel involved, and 
much more need.<p>

<hr><br>
In 1984, the Under Secretary of Education, Gary Bauer, released a report, Disorder in Our Public Schools, which highlighted the problem of school discipline with these startling facts:<br>
<ul>
<li>Teachers spent 30 to 80 percent of their time on discipline. <p>
<li>Half of all teachers felt misbehavior interfered with teaching to a "moderate or greater extent."<p>
<li>Three million high school students were victims of in-school crimes each month.<p>
<li>Eight percent of high school students missed at least one day each month because they were afraid of violence.<p>
<li>Four out of every 10 high school students had been a crime victim the previous year.<p>
<li>Each month 1,000 teachers re
Required medical attention because of in-school assaults 
and 125,000 were threatened.</ul><p>

Today, ten years after the Bauer report, the problems are worse.  America's schools are battlegrounds where children are too often physically harmed and deprived of a good education.  Teachers are more at risk than ever before.  Consider some recent examples of school violence.

<ul>
<li>A St. Louis student, 14, was stabbed at school.<p>
<li>An Atlanta student, 12, was shot at school by a friend showing off a stolen gun.<p>
<li>A 5-year-old and two 7-year-olds were suspended from school in Rockville, Maryland for bringing knives to school.<p>
<li>A 15-year-old fatally shot a schoolmate in a Los Angeles school.<p>
<li>A 14-year-old seventh grader was arrested in Wichita, Kansas after a pistol was found in his school locker.<p>
<li>Two Denver, Colorado high school students detonated a pipe bomb outside their school.<p>
<li>A New York City student was shot during a school basketball game.<p>
<li>The 1994 National Teacher of the Year helped her California students hide weapons "so they won't get killed after school."<p>
<li> A Maryland teacher caught a student with a pistol inside a school restroom.  The student shot the teacher.<p>
<li>A Dartmouth, Massachusetts high school student was knifed and clubbed to death during a government class.<p>
<li> An Atlanta student opened fire in a crowded school cafeteria, killing one student and wounding another.<p>
</ul>Violence at school is worse today than ten years ago.  The growing epidemic of school violence frightens children and their parents, undermines the education process, and threatens the future competitiveness of this country.  <p>

The school violence epidemic is rooted in larger societal problems.  Consider the current school violence trend, its impact on the education environment, an analysis of the changed nature of school violence, and the roots of the problem.<p>

<h3><center><a name="trend">SCHOOL VIOLENCE TREND</a></center></h3>

Michael Resnick, spokesman for the National School Boards Association (NSBA) states, "Just as the incidences of violence are increasing, so is the severity of the violence, so that this is becoming a much more serious problem in terms of numbers, location, and severity."<p>
School Superintendent Octavio Vistedof for Dade County, Florida, states, "There are children that witness more violence on their way to school on any given day than we as adults have witnessed in a lifetime, and yet we expect that child to come in and be, you know, summa cum laude and basically go in and graduate with honors.  It doesn't work that way."<p>
An NSBA survey shows that violence has increased each year over the last five years in 82 percent of the nation's school systems.<p>
The growing problem is especially felt by students.  The Institute for Social Research reports that 91.6 percent of high school seniors worry about crime and violence, and their greatest concern is drug abuse (77.8 percent).  Black female students from the South are the most likely to be worried.<p>
The indicators of school violence are everywhere.  For example, a recent Gallup poll found that in the past year one teen in five had a friend who was attacked by someone who was wielding a knife or gun, seven percent had been assaulted, 14 percent had their property vandalized, and 24 percent lived in a state of fear at school.<p>
Nearly 135,000 guns are brought into schools every day.19  About three million crimes occur on or near school property each year.20  Nearly a fifth of schools report student-on-teacher assaults.  And illegal drugs are available in at least 70 percent of our schools.<p>
The rising incidences of school violence also affect student views about law enforcement.  For example, at the time of Mr. Bauer's report, 36.9 percent of high school seniors had a positive attitude toward the performance of local police, but in 1992 confidence had declined to 26.9 percent.  It is especially low (12.4 percent) among black students.<p>
<center><h3><a name="impact">IMPACT OF VIOLENCE IN THE CLASSROOM</a></h3></center>
The 1984 Bauer report linked effective learning with a disciplined school environment.  Metropolitan Life Chairman Harry P. Kamen announced a recent nationwide public education survey which said that violence is so roiling the waters of public education that students cannot learn and teachers cannot teach.<p>
Kenneth Trump, coordinator of the Youth Gang Unit for the Cleveland Public Schools, states: "Besides the obvious physical harm caused by assaults and fights, the psychological impact to both staff and students can be damaging.  Students who are victims of school crimes or who perceive the school environment to be unsafe may not attend regularly and may not adequately concentrate on classwork when they do attend."  The National Education Goals Report found that in 1992 seven percent of 8th graders reported staying home from school at least once during the previous month because of concerns for their physical safety.<p>
Moreover, "teachers are not able to focus their efforts on instruction if they are preoccupied with disruptions and altercations.  Additionally, prolonged work in such environments is likely to increase teacher stress and reduce their overall classroom effectiveness."  The National Education Goals report shows that teachers were more often subject to physical and verbal abuse and in cities they tend to feel unsafe in their buildings after school hours.<p>
American Federation of Teachers President Albert Shanker explains, "The thread that ties this mixed bag of findings together is that, across the board, real or feared violence and a quality education are recognized as incompatible.  Schools have a primary mission -- to provide high standards, a challenging academic experience and maximum achievement for all students, but it won't work when the specter of violence is afoot.  The daunting effort to improve academic achievement is undermined every time a teacher is confronted by threatened or perpetrated trauma in the classroom or on school grounds, every time a student is afraid to go to school, and every time a parent neglects to set a good example at home."<p>
<h3><a name="nature">NATURE OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE</a></h3>
Dissecting school violence requires an examination of the types and frequency of violent incidents, a profile of the victims and offenders, and a profile of the crime sites.  

<h4><a name="frequency">TYPES AND FREQUENCY OF VIOLENT INCIDENTS</a></h4>

The Justice Department found that two percent of students reported experiencing one or more violent crimes and seven percent reported at least one property crime during the first half of 1989.29  The most common types of violence involved were simple assaults: pushing, shoving, grabbing, and slapping.  But more students than ever before brought weapons, including guns, to school.<p>

A Louis Harris poll found that 19 percent of central city schoolchildren report having had a physical fight in the past year and nine percent of suburban children have been suspended for the same reason.  A parallel finding shows that 32 percent of central city students have been physically threatened in the past month, compared to 29 percent in the suburbs.<p>
There are an estimated 71 weapon-carrying incidents per 100 students per month.  Typically boys carry weapons four times more often than girls, and the incidents are more common among Hispanic boys.  The weapon of choice is a knife or razor (55.2%) with the second choice being a club (24%).<p>
The National Education Goals Report found that in 1992 nine percent of 8th graders, 10 percent of 10th graders, and six percent of 12th graders reported they had brought a weapon to school at least once during the previous month.  A significant percentage frequently carried weapons to school.<p>
A Gallup poll found that weapon-toting students tend to use their weapons to settle disputes.  Twenty-one percent of students said they had been attacked with a knife or gun and, overall, assaults were reported by 63 percent of students. The poll found that nine percent of the students labeled weapons at school as a "very big problem."<p>
Guns at school are a special problem given their lethality.  A 1993 Louis Harris poll found that 11 percent of schoolchildren had been shot at by a gun in the past year, and 39 percent know someone personally who has either been killed or injured from gunfire.  Children enrolled in private and parochial schools "say they know how to get a gun than do those who go to public schools." <p>
A Justice Department report found that one in five suburban high school boys owns a gun, and that 45 percent of these boys have been threatened with a gun or shot at on the way to or from school during the previous few years.  Half of these boys said that they have friends who routinely carry a gun. <p>
<h4><a name="victims">WHO ARE THE VICTIMS AND OFFENDERS?</a></h4>
A 1993 Metropolitan Life survey, "Violence in America's Public Schools," found that 23 percent of students and 11 percent of teachers have been victims of violence in and around school.  MetLife reports that boys are twice as likely (30%) as girls (16%) to be victims of violence.<p>
The Justice Department found that public school students (9%) are more likely to be crime victims than private school students (7%).  Black and Hispanic students are more likely than white students to be victims of violent acts at school involving weapons.  Age, family income, and frequency of family moves were predictors of victimization: younger kids were more likely to be victims; students from homes with annual incomes of $50,000 or more were likely to be victims; and students from families that had moved three or more times in the last five years were crime victims twice as often as students who had not moved.<p>
Without factoring in age, family income and frequency of moves, teenagers from single-parent families are more likely to be violent crime victims than teens from two-parent intact families.  The statistics are the same whether the single parent is a mother or father.<p>
Fear of victimization varies by school location, type of school, and mode of transport to school.  For example, public school students (22%) are more likely than private school students (13%) to be fearful of attack at school.  Public school students are twice as likely as private school students to avoid certain areas at school.  And students who travel to school by car are the least likely to fear attack.<p>

Wesley Mitchell, commander of the Los Angeles Unified School District police, said, "Schools are feeling the outgrowth and the experiences of the larger community." This is especially true with regards to the violent student offenders.  Children bring to school the problems they have at home and in the community.<p>
A Washington State survey found that the more a student uses alcohol and other drugs or reports a history of physical or sexual abuse, the more likely he is to carry a weapon to school or to have been in a fight in the past year that resulted in injuries which required medical attention.  Boys (32%) are far more likely than girls (15%) to carry a weapon to school.  Hispanic (41.1%) and black (39.4%) male students are more likely to carry a weapon than white (28.6%) male students.<p>
Gangs promote violence in schools and, according to the Justice Department, 15 percent of schools have violence-prone gangs and 12 percent said gang members fought once or twice a week or even every day.  Students in central cities are more likely to report gangs at their schools (25%) than suburban students (8%), and black and Hispanic students (20% and 32%) say their schools have gangs more often than white (20%) students.Most (78%) students from schools with gangs report that a student can obtain drugs at school compared to 66 percent of students in schools without gangs.<p>
<h4><a name="where">WHERE DOES SCHOOL VIOLENCE TAKE PLACE?</a></h4>

The Justice Department explains in "Teenage Victims" that the likelihood of becoming a crime victim in a particular location is influenced by the amount of time spent in one location relative to another.  That's why schools, according to the Justice Department, are prime locations for teen crime.<p>
Teachers say that most acts of student violence take place in or around school.  Students are, however, less certain.  Police officials say that student violence is equally evident inside, outside, and in the school neighborhood.<p>
Teachers told Louis Harris that 64 percent of in-school violence takes place in the hallways or stairways, 16 percent in lunchrooms, 12 percent in the classrooms, and 15 percent in bathrooms.  Students believe more violence takes place in the classroom and athletic areas than teachers report.<p>
The Justice Department reports that six percent of students avoid some place in or around their school because of the potential that someone might attack them.  School restrooms were listed most often as a place to avoid and hallways were second. More than two-thirds of students don't feel completely safe going to and from school.
<h3><center><a name="what">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO CURB THE VIOLENCE?</a></h3></center>
School authorities are trying virtually anything that might curb the violence.  There are programs to help parents to reduce family violence.  There are groups who seek to reduce violence in television and music lyrics.<p>
<ul>
<li> NSBA surveyed school districts to determine the most common anti-violence strategies.  It found that suspension is used 78 percent of the time.  Other strategies include: expulsion (72%), locker searches (50%), security personnel in schools (36%), gun-free school zones (31%), metal detectors (15%), dress code (41%), and volunteer parent patrols (13%).<p>
<li> Orange County, Florida started a program that includes conflict resolution, peer mediation, and support groups. The S.A.F.E. program (Student Assistance and Family Empowerment) includes five students from each grade who are trained to offer mediation for students in conflict.<p>
<li> New York City public schools have S.T.A.R. (Straight Talk About Risks) which is designed to help students avoid crime.  The program teaches protective skills needed to avoid threatening situations with guns.<p>
<li> A Dayton, Ohio, program promotes character education, inculcating values like honesty, responsibility, courage, and loyalty.<p>
<li> Duval County, Florida uses local policemen to patrol schools and Denver, Colorado, has a special school security force.  A school in Tucson, Arizona built an eight-foot fence around the parking lot in response to a drive-by shooting.  In San Diego, California, schools recently removed all lockers to reduce hiding places for contraband.<p>
While some schools are on the offensive, trying to stem classroom violence, a recent Department of Justice study found that some of these anti-crime efforts don't make a significant difference.  For example, schools using hall monitors or patrols suffered the same incidence of violence as schools which didn't have these programs.  And students in schools with these programs were more likely to fear an attack than those attending schools without monitors and patrols.<p>
Even more troubling, an American Association of School Administrators report finds that some schools consciously and actively play down the incidence of violence.  This is done to avoid bad publicity, to avoid litigation, out of fear they will be regarded as ineffective, and to avoid being labeled as poor leaders.  Teachers under-reported crime and violence because they wanted to avoid litigation, had difficulty identifying the offender, and did not wish to stigmatize young offenders.<p>
The National School Safety Center recommends an action plan to achieve safe schools.  The plan includes:  assigning responsibility for developing a plan; consulting an attorney who knows education law, analyzing the nature and scope of the problem, identifying and implementing measures to fight the problem, establishing procedures for school employees, conducting regular in-service training for staff on school crime and violence, establishing procedures for students and parents to make suggestions, developing an effective relationship with local law enforcement and court officials, sharing information with other schools, and regularly evaluating programs.<p>
In spite of considerable expenditure of money and effort to curb the epidemic of school violence, no school district has yet declared victory.<p>
Parents are looking for safe schools and are expressing their displeasure with their feet and pocketbooks.  They walking out of public schools with their children and placing them in "safer" private institutions.  The number of private school students has grown from 2.4 million in 1981 to more than 3.3 million last year.  In addition, more than 700,000 children are now schooled at home.  This move comes at great cost to parents because the average private school tuition is $6,400 annually.  <p>
A decade ago parents considered discipline a very important factor in choosing their children's school.  Mr. Bauer's study found that 85.6 percent of public school parents and 87.1 percent of private school parents considered discipline when choosing a school.<p>

Today, a vast majority of parents (84%) believe that "problems affecting children have grown worse."  A larger majority (92%) of parents feel that there is "more violence in the schools [today] than when they were growing up."  Because they are concerned for the physical safety of their children due to the widespread availability of guns and the resulting violence, they are taking action to protect them.<p>

A May 1994 nationwide poll commissioned by the Family Research Council found that 83 percent of Americans favor giving parents the right to select the safest available school for their children.  This overwhelming support for school choice demonstrates that school safety is an important issue for parents.<p>
<h3><center><a name="root">THE ROOT OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE</a></h3></center>
The American Federation of Teachers captured the essence of the problem when it stated, "Discipline problems both cause and are caused by a growing gap between school and home.  They are exacerbated by faulty public school policies framed by students' rights advocates who have been so preoccupied with protecting the difficult child that they have failed to consider the rights of the average child to learn in a disciplined, structured place."<p>
Unfortunately, a minority of disruptive and too often violent students are spoiling the system for children, who, if given a fighting chance, would succeed.<p>

Deborah Prothrow-Stith, a public health official and author of <u><i>Deadly Consequence</i>s</u>, stated, "[i]f all the children born in America learned at home how to manage anger and aggression non-violently, our homicide and assault rates would decline by 50 percent -- maybe even 75 percent."<p>
<h3><center><a name="conclusion">CONCLUSION</a></center></h3>
Violence is a problem that begins at home and spreads to the community.  Much of the increase in violence in this country and in the schools is due to "changing family situations."  These changes include a lack of parental caring and supervision, lack of discipline on the part of parents, lack of parental concern regarding student behavior and student whereabouts, poor family discipline, and a lack of connectedness with an extended family.<p>

Many children experience difficulty in school because they are emotionally incapacitated by the explosive drama at home.  This is especially true for a growing segment of students from single-parent families.  These children are two to three times as likely as children in two-parent families to have emotional and behavioral problems: they drop out of high school more often, get pregnant as teenagers, abuse drugs, and more often get into trouble with the law.  And most single-parent families are headed by mothers who cannot provide the paternal direction young boys desperately need.<p>
According to Charles Murray, a Bradley Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, the growing number of fatherless boys creates a "Lord of the Flies" culture evidenced by widespread physical violence, immediate gratification, and predatory sex.  These problems are all-too-evident in America's schools today.<p>
Parents must take responsibility for the rearing of their children and support teachers who need a disciplined classroom to teach.  If parents do their job, then the teacher finds creating a good learning environment easier.<p>
Mary Bruce, a spokeswoman for the Federation of Women's Teachers Associations of Ontario, says teachers must begin early.  She states, "The guns and knives at secondary school get all the attention, but those violent acts were born years earlier in elementary school."<p>
Her observation rings true for many teachers.  Children cultivate a proclivity for violence during the elementary school years and too often those schools tolerate misbehavior which grows more violent with time.  Children need to understand what is acceptable behavior and school authorities need the authority to create a positive learning environment which gives each child the opportunity to learn without fear of verbal and physical intimidation and assault.<p>

Ten years ago, the U.S. Education Department warned the nation that the classroom was seriously handicapped by violence.  The problem is worse today.  School administrators, teachers, law enforcement officials, parents, and teachers must work together to reclaim the classroom for education.  Building well-disciplined schools begins with parents taking responsibility for rearing their children to respect one another and other adults, and it takes school policies which facilitate a climate of discipline.  This combination will promote learning and protect children during their formative years.<p>

The institutionalization of "family life" or sex education classes in public and private schools around the country has created a demand for curricula on the subject.  Unfortunately, the broad reach of organizations such as Planned Parenthood and SIECUS have left many school boards and parents thinking that there is no alternative except to teach "safe sex."  But there is an alternative that has shown to be even more effective than "safe sex" in reducing teen pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases -- Abstinence.  This paper is designed to help concerned school board members and parents choose a solid abstinence curriculum.<p>
<CENTER>
<h3><a name="abstinence">WHY ABSTINENCE EDUCATION?</a></h3><br></center>

Abstinence is the only strategy for preventing teenage pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases that is 100 percent effective.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is "the most effective solution" to unwanted pregnancy and sexual disease.<p>

Given the effectiveness of abstinence, a number of states--including Texas, California, Washington, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Indiana-- have passed laws in recent years stipulating that public school sex education programs be abstinence-based. Many of these programs have produced promising results:
<p>
 <ul><li> 	San Marcos Junior High in San Marcos, California, adopted an abstinence-only curriculum developed by Teen-Aid, Inc., titled Sexuality, Commitment, and Family.  The year before the curriculum was implemented, 147 girls were reported pregnant.  But two years after the program's adoption, only 20 girls became pregnant.<br><br>
<li>Historically, the eighth-grade class at Nathan Hale Middle School in the Chicago suburb of Crestwood included a number of already pregnant girls.  When the school decided to adopt an abstinence program for the kids, many adults were skeptical.  But after three years of quality sessions with the abstinence program <i>Project Taking Charge</i>, the school graduated three pregnancy-free classes in a row.<br><br>
<li>In the Washington, D.C. chapter of "Best Friends," only one out of 400 girls has become pregnant since the program began.  Elayne Bennett, director of "Best Friends," says that between 20 and 70 pregnancies are common for the same sized group of fifth- to ninth-grade girls in the District of Columbia.  One "Best Friends" member explains, "I want to 												
	save my virginity for the man I marry....And I want my child to have a daddy."<br><br>
<li>An evaluation of the abstinence-based program Sex Respect:  <i>The Option of True Sexual Freedom</i> found that students participating in the program had considerably lower pregnancy rates than those in a comparison group.  Five percent of the female program participants and nine percent of the non-program students became pregnant in the two years following the program.<br><br>
<li>Emory University's abstinence-only curriculum, <i>Postponing Sexual Involvement</i>, teaches kids about abstinence through skill-building exercises on "how to say no."  An evaluation of the program showed that its participants were less likely to become sexually active than those not involved in the program.<br><br>
<li><i>AANCHOR</i>, an alternative national curriculum on responsibility, stresses the importance of family involvement and individual responsibility to prevent adolescent pregnancy.  An evaluation of the curriculum found three statistically significant differences between students receiving the AANCHOR curriculum and students receiving the standard school curriculum.  The students participating in AANCHOR were significantly more likely to report (1) higher family strengths, i.e., loyalty, emotional support, cohesion, (2) greater discussions with parents about sexual values and beliefs, and (3) more abstinent attitudes regarding premarital sexual involvement.<br><br>
<li>Students who participated in the abstinence-based <i>FACTS</i> curriculum showed significant pre-post effects occurring on the measures of (1) affirmation of abstinence, (2) rejection of permissiveness, and (3) future orientation and peer support for abstinence.  These attitudinal data are important indicators of delaying sexual activity.<br><br>
</ul>
<h3><center><a name="choose">HOW TO CHOOSE A GOOD ABSTINENCE CURRICULUM</a></h3></center>
In order to choose an appropriate abstinence curriculum, parents and school board members should study curricula for their focus, methodologies, and content.<p>

<h4><a name="focus">Focus of Curricula:</a></h4>  The growing interest in abstinence curriculum has caused many contraception programs to frame themselves as "abstinence-based," "abstinence-plus" or "comprehensive" because they mention abstinence as one of several options.  Such programs, however, communicate a mixed message to students which thereby tremendously weakens the abstinence message.  Some common characteristics of these "comprehensive" or "abstinence-plus" programs are that they (1) assume that teenagers are inevitably sexually active, (2) emphasize contraception and abortion, and (3) include affective decision-making (presenting abstinence one of many options from which to choose).  Thus, parents and school boards should choose a curriculum that avoids these danger points, and instead, upholds abstinence as the way to handle teen sex issues.<p>


<h4><a name="methodology">Methodology of Curricula:</a></h4>  The method used to deliver sex education material heavily influences the way students will respond to the abstinence message.  Effective abstinence programs are directive in their approach.  Dr. Onalee McGraw provides a comparative analysis of competing delivery models of sex education in her book <u>Foundations for Family Life Education</u>:<p>

<p></pre>
Directive abstinence education emphasizes the importance of values and attitudes, which is consistent with a U.S. Department of Education study, "The Role of Responsibility and Knowledge in Reducing Teenage Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing," which found that "adolescents with strong feelings of control over their lives, with higher educational expectations, and with parents who show concern and have higher educational expectations for their daughters have lower chances of experiencing teenage childbirth." <p>

Furthermore, students want help in saying "no" to sexual activity.  When Emory University surveyed 1,000 sexually active girls and asked them what they would most like to learn to reduce teen pregnancy, 84 percent responded, "How to say no without hurting the other person's feelings."   Moreover, a recent study done by Roper Starch in association with the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) found that, of the teens who have had sex, 54 percent wish they would have waited until they were older to have sex. 

<p>
<h4><a name="content">Content of Curricula:</a></h4>  Sex education curricula vary greatlt by content , and parents should be particuarly concerned if the curriculum contains information or pictures too explicit for the intended audience. Caution is recommended even in cases in which  a particular sex education curriculum is widely used or endorsed by prominent organizations. For Example:
<br>
<ul>
<li>The two-million member National Education Association (NEA) endorses sex education programs that promote birth control and homosexuality.<br><br><p>
<li>The influential Sex Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) has published a widely used set of goals for sex education curricula entitled, "<i>Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education:  Kindergarten - 12th Grade</i>.  The report promotes abortion, unmarried couples living together, and homosexual relationships as equal to heterosexual relationships.<br><br><p>

<h2><center>	EDUCATION, TECHNOLOGY <br>
	AND THE FAMILY</h2>
	<h4><i>by<br>

<hr size="3" width="30%"><br>

For someone who comes to you from a conservative organization, I have a somewhat radical speech to make.  I think that society is making more radical demands on education than most education professionals, and even education reformers, have yet admitted; and also that, paradoxically, these radical demands will actually add up to a good deal for the traditional family.<p>

One way to find out what demands society is making on education would be to listen to what leaders in the fields of business, education, and government are saying and then try to draw some general themes from their remarks.  You would hear, I think, a great deal about competitiveness, but also a great deal about something called diversity.  I suspect you would find that the back-to-basics movement of the early 1980s has faded, and that the world of the experts is presently divided between those who want schools to be vocational training centers for high-tech shop floors, and those who want them to be desensitization centers for initiating kids into what New York State Senator John Marchi calls "Manhattan attitudes."<p>

Actually, both those camps are missing the point, because both are working from assumptions based on educational centralism.  They think of education as a centralized function, in which a uniform product, determined by the education elite, is doled out to receptive and malleable pupils, as if on an assembly line.  I think society may be moving in a different direction than that.<p>

Commendably, there are some education reform proposals out there that are more radical.  Much of the rhetoric of these movements involves the need to, as they say, "break the mold."  One type of break-the-mold reform is exemplified by businessman Chris Whittle, and his project to create a network of low-cost, for-profit private schools.  This idea is mold-breaking, in the sense that it asks us to get past the long-held assumption that schools must be non-profit, and instead, to consider the possible role that the profit motive could play in securing good schools, just as it secures good consumer electronics.  On the other hand, while Mr. Whittle's idea breaks some molds, it <i>does </i>not break all.  It still conceives of education as a process that an elite does to a passive student body.  <p>

Another type of reform proposal is parental choice.  This movement originated with liberal sociologists in the '60s, and it was carried forward by conservatives 
in the 1980s.  The liberals who promoted it, such as Christopher Jencks, did so because it would promote equality.  Conservatives, on the other hand, liked it 
because it would empower families and disempower the state.  Opposition came, of course, from the organized interests who are dependent in one way or another on the existing public school quasi-monopoly.  Today, despite occasional setbacks, the choice movement appears to be gaining steam, with a coalition of supporters that is very diverse, both racially and ideologically.<p>

The parental choice movement is mold-breaking, because it questions the existing power structure in elementary and secondary education, and it deconstructs the authority-claims advanced by the education elites.  It also breaks molds by seeking to bring real accountability into public education for perhaps the first time since before Horace Mann.  Of all the organized education reform movements, the school choice movement is the most radical.  Yet even this movement declines to question the most deeply-held assumption of all -- that school is something you "go to" in order to "get ready," rather than something you do all your life.<p>

And yet, so radical are the changes taking place in our society, and most particularly in our technology, that some very basic assumptions may be coming into question: the assumption that school is something you "go to," entirely apart from both home life and professional life, and the assumption that the acquisition of education requires the services of an elite specially trained for that purpose.  <p>

A theory along these lines has recently been advanced by a physicist and former school teacher names Lewis J. Perelman.  Like the social critic George Gilder, Dr. Perelman belongs to the school of thought that sees computer technology as a force that will transform our lives and, on the way, weaken the behemoth state and empower individuals and families.  In terms of the conventional groupings within the wild, wonderful world of conservatism -- you've heard, perhaps, of neo-conservatives, or "neo-cons," and paleo-conservatives, or "paleo-cons"?  Well, perhaps we may call these people cyber-cons.<p>

Anyway, Dr. Perelman has written a book called <i>School's Out</i>.  The subtitle is:  <i>Hyperlearning</i>, <i>The New Technology</i>, and <i>The End of Education</i>.  His thesis is that technology is developing so fast that a number of concepts that we think we are familiar with will have to be re-thought.  The traditional paradigm of education, in which those who <i>know </i>impart knowledge to those who do <i>not yet know</i>, is becoming obsolete, because information is increasing so fast that, in effect, everyone is becoming a life-long learner.  But while information is becoming more voluminous, it is also becoming easier to store and retrieve.  More and more environments are becoming learning situations.  We are becoming a society of ongoing learners.<p>

The Perelman thesis goes on to suggest that schools, as institutions set apart from daily life in which young people spend a portion of their lives getting prepared for the adult world, are destined for the ash-heap of history.  Learning is no longer something that takes place apart from daily life; nor is it any longer something that can be said to be finished when the student reaches attains a high school diploma, or a college degree, or even a graduate/professional degree.<p>

Thus, Perelman ridicules all the present-day education reform movements as missing the point.   To illustrate, he draws an analogy between the new, computerized learning and the automobile:<p>

<blockquote>Imagine, for instance, that it's near the end of the nineteenth rather than the twentieth century.  A national task force on "excellence in horses" has issued a report exclaiming that America is "at risk" because its horse breeding and training are afflicted by a "rising tide of mediocrity."  Russian, Japanese, and German horses, the report warns, eat more oats, pull heavier loads, and can run faster and farther than American horses.  Since everyone knows that the horse is essential to agriculture, transportation, industry, and the military, it's obvious that an all-out effort is needed to raise the quality of U.S. horseflesh if America hopes to be competitive in the twentieth-century world.<br></blockquote>

<blockquote>Oh, by the way, the task force suggests, since the "horseless carriage" seems to be becoming pretty popular, all horses and their trainers should take a course in "automobile literacy" so they won't be scared by the noise of these curious contraptions.</blockquote>

I was particularly intrigued by Perelman's critique of the school choice movement.  He actually agrees with the school choice movement that parental choice is the indispensable threshold for education reform: without it, the continuing slide of our schools into mediocrity and ideology will be irreversible.<p>

But (Perelman's argument goes) if school choice is confined to choices <i>among schools</i>, as traditionally defined and maintained, then it is not choice enough.  This is for two reasons: one, school itself is becoming outmoded by new technology; two, good schools will not be able to start, expand, or multiply fast enough to accommodate demand.  Therefore, many families will not be able to take advantage of it, and this fact will fuel the anti-reform lobbying of those with a vested interest in the present quasi-monopoly.  Therefore, Perelman concludes:  "As long as `school' refers to the traditional structure of buildings and grounds with services delivered in boxes called classrooms to which customers must be transported by car or bus, `school choice' will be unable to meaningfully alter the quality or efficiency of education."<p>

What Perelman's analysis adds up to is that the principle of school choice must be followed to its logical conclusion, and that is, that the education of children, regardless of whether or not it is partly delegated to outsiders, must be seen first and foremost as a task for the home, and for the family.<p>


There is an extremely interesting fact that Perelman cites, and that was also cited in a recent ground-breaking Brookings Institution study favoring school choice, called <i>Politics, Markets, and America's Schools</i>, by John Chubb and Terry Moe.  Indeed, Perelman castigates Chubb and Moe for failing to realize the significance of this fact.  And that fact is this.  Chubb and Moe looked at various factors in the home lives of students, and correlated these with what they called "high performance schools" and "low performance schools," so as to see what features of home life have the biggest impact in making schools more effective.  By far and away, the home life factor that was most strongly correlated with effectiveness of the school was the <i>number of learning tools in the home</i>.  Students with more learning tools in the home -- such as computers, calculators, encyclopedias, and an abundance of books -- do better in school, leading to more apparent "effectiveness" on the part of that school.<p>

Lost in all the talk about "effective schools" was the truly significant finding here:  students learn more when the <i>homes </i>furnish intellectually stimulating environments.<p>

This leads to two conclusions: one would be that synergies between home and school can be very dynamic for students.  The other is that there may be a great future for one education reform movement that truly takes choice to its logical conclusion -- home-schooling.<p>

The home-schooling movement has grown phenomenally in the past thirty years.  It seems to have started in the 1960s with a few hippie parents who didn't want their children to be educated by "the Establishment."  Then it spread in the '70s to Christian families who didn't want their children educated by public schools that were perceived to be dominated by secular humanism.  In the '80s it spread to thousands of parents with graduate and professional degrees who just couldn't see the point of entrusting the education of their children to persons whom they saw as less qualified to teach than themselves.  Today, the movement is flourishing -- with hippies, Christians, intellectuals, and others, and some interesting overlaps between those groups.<p>

As for Perelman, he recommends many solutions in addition to home-schooling, but he also urges that parents look at home-schooling as an option.  And he urges that all families, whether they home-school or not, look on their family life as a part of their children's education.  In fact, after a great deal of prophecy about our high-tech future, Perelman ends his book with an exhortation to family togetherness.<p>

There is a portentous cultural convergence here: between high-tech cyber-radicals and traditional-values conservatives.  The link is this:  from the rise of nation-states during the Middle Ages, until recently, economic and industrial forces have been favorable to the growth of bureaucracy, which is a powerful rival to small-scale communities such as the family.  But the new technology, as Perelman argues at length, bypasses and cuts out bureaucracy.  Perhaps this is why defenders of bureaucratic interests are increasingly taking on an anti-technological tone, sometimes almost sounding like High Tories.  <p>


We've talked now at some length about elementary and secondary education.  What impact will the changes we are talking about have on higher education?  Very positive ones, quite possibly.  If education is going to change from a getting-ready process to a life-long endeavor, it would seem to follow that we will all find ourselves encouraged to maintain, throughout our lives, a certain student-like spirit.  Remember that the word "student" comes from the Latin verb "studere," which means to be fanatically interested in something.<p>

According to Perelman, one of the effects of the technology on education will be that academic degrees will decline in importance relative to actual knowledge.  Also, quite obviously, distances will matter less, as persons far apart will be able to communicate and share information in increasingly efficient and inexpensive ways.<p>

Therefore, I see a very interesting possibility: instead of our present-day universities, you will see new computer-linked communities of scholars spring up, linked by commonality of interest, and devoid of academic bureaucracy and infighting.  That may be the twenty-first century, but interestingly enough, if you take away the computer part, then it's also the thirteenth.  The great universities of Europe, in their infant days during the High Middle Ages, were basically just associations of scholars, who gathered together so as to learn from one another.  Young men who wanted to learn from those scholars would join them, and they were called "studentes," because they were extremely interested.  Perhaps the university of the twenty-first century will be like that, with future "studentes" tapping the scholars of their choice by computer.<p>

I've referred so heavily to Dr. Perelman that you must think I agree with him on everything.  Actually, there may be one point of divergence.  As I read him, I don't think he has a very high regard for the liberal arts as part of education.  My own view is that one can come to understand one's own society and culture only through close study of the best that has been thought and written in past societies and cultures -- that is, by participating in a trans-historical conversation on the great questions.  That is why I, personally, value the liberal arts (not, of course, that they are "liberal" in the modern sense -- in fact, many people consider them downright reactionary).<p>

In spite of this disagreement with Perelman, if it is one, I don't think I will be unhappy in the future that he describes, because I will have the option of sharing my interests in the liberal arts freely with others who truly share those interests.  The modern university is rapidly ceasing to be a place where such sharing is possible.  <p>

American higher education has followed a long, tortuous path.  During the nineteenth century, liberal arts education ceased to be considered intrinsically valuable and began to function instead as a means of maintaining a class structure.  People destined to be lawyers and bankers studied Greek philosophy and Roman poetry, not because they thought it would help them in banking or law, nor because they loved those things (were "studentes" of them) for their own sake, but because such studies served to distinguish them from those destined to be plumbers or auto mechanics.  If you doubt this, ask yourself what the young lady of yesteryear meant to communicate when she assured her parents that her beau was "a college man."  <p>

But that role for higher education has been upset by two major changes, one good, one bad:  the good change is that we are more egalitarian with regard to the professions.  The bad change is that a massive revolt against the liberal arts is being carried out, from within academia itself.<p>

To this problem, the cyber-future offers a possible solution: in the future, it simply won't matter if shrill and shallow ideologues take over what we now call the universities;  those who want the skills that the market demands will get them elsewhere.  And those who love the liberal arts for their own sake will be able to pursue them with others who share that love.<p>

So, to sum up, society today is demanding that education, at all levels, become less centralized, less bureaucratized, and less separated from home and family life.  These changes will be demanded by a knowledge-based economy; they will be facilitated by emerging technology; and they have the potential to restore hearth and home to their rightful place in the hierarchy of human values.<p><br>

<h2><center>WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,<br> RESTRUCTURE:</h2>
<h3>INTERPRETING THE NEW SAT SCORES</h3>	</center>

<h4><center><i>by</i><br>
<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>
</h4>
<hr size="3" width="30%"><br>
The results are in, the scores are up, and the education establishment is patting itself on the back.  Last week the College Board announced the results from its annual college entrance exam, the SAT.  But this year there's a twist:  this is SAT I, a new but comparable (according to test makers) version of the SAT.  Except SAT I has fewer questions.  And allows students 30 more minutes to take the test.  And permits calculators, and throws out antonyms, one of the most difficult verbal sections on the test.  As the folks at Oldsmobile might say, this is not your father's SAT. <p>  

Why the change in format?  The College Board claims changes were necessary to keep the test in sync "with what and how students are learning today."  Given that explanation, SAT I provides an interesting and accurate commentary on schools today.  Students are spending more time in school and learning less.  One has only to compare a sixth grade reader from the early 20th century to a modern middle school language arts text to verify that 12-year-olds in today's schools are not held to the same standard  their predecessors were.  Rote learning and memorization, such as learning basic math tables and vocabulary, are disparaged.  Crutches like calculators provide ways around such basic tasks.  Many students do not know what an antonym is, let alone understand the nuances of words well enough to determine their opposites.<p>

If the knowledge level of American students is down, as a 30-point drop in SAT verbal scores over two decades indicates, then common sense would prescribe a no-nonsense, back-to-basics, rigorous academic regimen.  If students can't do basic math without a calculator, then teach them their multiplication tables.  Write them, say them, or sing them, but have the students learn them.  If students have puny, bland 
vocabularies, introduce them to works of literature that will keep them striving toward mastery of our English language.  Learning is training, and any athlete knows training involves a lot of sweat and some discomfort, but the results can be exhilarating. <p> 

The pursuit of knowledge is arduous, for both teacher and student.  It requires determination, commitment, and high expectations from parents, teachers, and students.  It cannot be induced with spending or any other form of bureaucratic bribery.  It does not provide a quick fix.  Because long-term solutions to our country's educational woes involve a great deal of lag time before reaping results, most political regimes have found them unappealing.  After all, most administrations pursue an agenda that brings them credit and reelection, which makes quick turnaround time essential.  <p>

The agenda of the day is education restructuring, a term that has quietly been interchanged with education reform.  If education restructuring implied innovative thinking unconstrained by the model of the current public school system, I would have little argument.  We need to restructure the public school system to decrease the federal role and restore local schools, and we need competitive alternatives to public schools.  <p>

In reality, restructuring has only changed the system to <i>make student performance look better</i>.  Goals 2000 marks the height of the restructuring agenda. It created a framework for a new federal-state-local partnership, giving more weight than ever to the federal government.  Goals 2000-style restructuring manipulates the system so that all students can achieve to the same "high" standards.  To make standards universally attainable, they must be lowered to the least common denominator among students.  This is the epitome of Outcome-Based Education, where students are held at the same level until the group is ready to move on as a whole.  <p>

If academic standards were lowered independently of all other factors, falling performance on standardized tests would be noticeable--as it has been on the SAT in recent years--and Americans would blow the whistle on the restructuring agenda.  However, if new tests keyed to the new standards were implemented, performance on these tests would be pleasingly high relative to previous test scores, and the public would be pacified.  That's exactly why Goals 2000 calls for the creation of standards and "aligned assessments." <p> 

That's also what we've witnessed in the SAT overhaul.  Rather than remaining an objective, independent measure, the restructured SAT has been keyed to the restructured classroom.  Results, therefore, will be higher and Americans will be artificially confident that we have finally gotten back on track from our educational waywardness.<p>

That is exactly what President Bill Clinton and Secretary Richard Riley were hoping we'd believe.  They now have the statistics to give the appearance that their education agenda has been a success.  Unfortunately, what has been accomplished is the gerrymandering of objective measures and accepted standards, making it difficult to determine the true status of student achievement.  Instead of rallying Americans to the task of real education reform, our leaders are prodding us into that blissful Lake Wobegon naivete that sees all our children as decidedly above average. <p>

<title>CHEATING SCANDAL POINTS TO
	MORAL DECLINE</title>
<center><h2>CHEATING SCANDAL POINTS TO<br>
	MORAL DECLINE</h2></center>
	<h4><center><i>by</i><br>
	<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></h4></center>
<hr size="3" width="30%"><br>
Cheating scandals at the nation's military academies make news because military officers are supposed to epitomize loyalty, integrity and selfless service.  This is evidenced by the schools' strict honor codes, which are unsurpassed in academe.<p>  

The announcement of the U.S. Naval Academy's widest cheating scandal in its 149 year history suggests an erosion of the military profession's reliability, and testifies to the decline in America's culture.  The Navy convened a special review board to investigate charges that up to 134 midshipmen illegally had advance knowledge about the contents of an electrical engineering final examination given in December 1992.  The board recommended expulsion of 29 midshipmen and lesser punishment for 42 others.<p>    

Advance knowledge of the contents of an exam is a violation of the academy's honor code, which states that midshipmen must not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do.  The code serves to impress upon future naval leaders that a high standard is expected of those who must make life-and-death decisions.  A similar code applies to the other academies, and they too have suffered scandals in recent years.<p>

If future military leaders can't deal honestly with school exams, how will they perform in situations that could cost lives?  In America's combat history, the character of our leaders has often been more powerful than the firepower of our weapons.<p>     

For years, the nation's military academies took America's best and integrated them into a military regimen.  The process was simplified because applicants shared similar, well-defined ideas of right and wrong.  Today, however, there is a tremendous chasm between the values required of a professional military and those possessed by the pool of eligible college-age students.  The process of integrating and indoctrinating-- bridging the chasm-- is more difficult than ever before.<p>
  
This phenomenon goes beyond the military and affects the civilian sector as well.  Industry, business, academe, government and family all rely, like the military, on people with integrity, commitment, candor, discipline, selfless service and competence.  <p>  
                                                                                              

The erosion of values is traceable largely to changes in institutions which have traditionally been responsible for imparting them to our youth.  These key institutions include family, school, church, media and government. <p> 

<ul><li>The typical American family of the 1950s consisted of a working father, a stay-at-home mother and one or two children.  Nearly 70 percent of all households used to fit that description.  Today, nearly two-thirds of the nation's young children still are raised at home by full-time mothers or mothers who are employed part-time outside of the home.  Women are increasingly pressured, however, to work full-time in the paid labor force.  And work force competition for material benefits has reduced the time that fathers have with their children. </ul><p> 

Armand Nicholi, a Harvard psychiatrist, believes that "the character development and emotional stability of a person...is [the product] of the relationship he experiences as a child with both of his parents."  The importance of parent-child time for childrearing was confirmed in a survey commissioned by the Massachusetts Mutual Insurance Company which found that Americans believe "parents having less time to spend with their families" is the single most important reason for the family's decline in our society. <p>

Although the length of the work week has changed little in recent years, the rise of more mothers joining working fathers reduces parent-child time.  Additionally, the dual wage earning couple often leave their children with day-care providers despite a 1993 Family Research Council survey finding that 87 percent of Americans agree that young children benefit more from mother care than substitute care.  Choosing inferior child care alternatives during the child's most impressionable and value forming years is risky. <p>

Today, one in six families is headed by a single mother.  Increasing numbers of children are being born out of wedlock.  The illegitimacy rate is 22 percent for white babies and 68 percent for black babies.  Growing up in single-parent households too often means financial hardship and a serious lack of parental attention, from absent fathers.<p>

The U.S. has the highest divorce rate in the world -- 5.3 divorces per 1,000 people.  The consequences of divorce for children are significant.  Not only does the child's standard of living usually change for the worse, there is also a loss of parental attention; many children in divorced homes require psychological help.  Girls from divorced families are at much greater risk for early sexual initiation, promiscuity, non-marital pregnancies, venereal diseases, and divorce than are girls in two-parent intact families.  Boys in similar situations are at greater risk of dropping out of school than girls, and are also more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior.<p>

The traumas of abuse and neglect are frequently associated with divorce.  A National Institute of Justice study found that people who had been "abused or neglected as children are more likely to be arrested as juveniles, as adults, and for violent crimes."  Another study found that chronic exposure to violence, in the home or in the neighborhood, often can lead to violent behavior.<p>

The family as a value-influencing institution has been weakened, and children bear the brunt of parental mistakes with an inevitable impact on their value system.<p>
 
<ul><li>The school is the second most important contributor to the child's value system.  Modern educators, however, are spending more and more time on remedial social work.  Instead of equipping America's youth academically for the next century, educators are counseling their pupils about drug abuse, discipline problems, sex, suicide and anorectic and bulimic disorders.  Surveys indicate that the biggest problems in public schools today are drugs and crime.  Thirty years ago, chewing gum and talking in class were the major problems.</ul>

A national survey of college freshmen found a significant shift in motivation away from altruism and toward concern with making money and getting power and status.  Not surprisingly, students are finding it easier to rationalize lying or cheating in pursuit of their goals.<p>

Theodore Roosevelt stated, "To educate a person in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society."  Ethics training was replaced in the last 20 years by values clarification programs which treat children like adults who need only to clarify values rather than to acquire them.  At best, values clarification encourages the student to close the gap between the values he professes and his personal action.  At worst, it promotes moral relativism.<p>

The school's role as a value instiller has changed.  There is, however, a growing national momentum to require schools to introduce "character" instruction.  Whether or not this trend is positive, however, depends upon whose values prevail.<p>

<ul><li>Until the early 1960s, organized religion was very influential in most children's value-formation process.  Today, however, although most Americans claim to be religious, fewer are regularly attending religious services.  This trend has been especially evident during times of great change, particularly over the last decade.</ul><p>

For many, the church is no longer the center of family and community life.  Theology has become more relativistic in many churches, and its focus has correspondingly been altered for many people.  Members now more often expect to be served, as opposed to being challenged to serve others.  Churches are increasingly functioning as a "country club" or "social club" that scratches the religious itch and provides a drive-through "feel-good" service rather than as a center of salvation and substantive, community-building activity.<p>

The influence of organized religions has waned, and nontraditional movements have emerged, such as the New Age Movement, a post-Christian belief system that recycles elements of eastern mysticism with modern, self-centered philosophy.<p>

This fast-growing spiritual, social and political movement seeks to transform individuals and society.  It has left its mark on sociology, theology, medicine, anthropology, history, sports and literature.  The New Age movement promotes a view of reality that admits to no absolutes.  Many adherents believe that good and evil are essentially one, thus breeding moral relativism. <p>

<ul><li>The all-pervasive media also influence society's values.  Television, with its 6,600 cable systems, leaves a daily impression on most children.  The average child spends more time in front of the television than in school.  Television includes Saturday morning cartoons such as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ghost Busters -- programs that promote aggressive and disrespectful behavior.  Afternoon television provides false views of life via soap operas and sex-saturated talk shows.  Evening programming often promotes anti-family agendas, and glorifies promiscuity, violence, homosexuality, and more. </ul><p>

The average teenager in the U.S. sees 50 R-rated movies a year.  Some of these are rated "R" because of violence.  "True Romance," for example, depicts a man killing his wife's former pimp by shooting him point-blank, first in the groin and then in the face.  The wife applauds the act.<p>

Rap music is another virtual obsession with today's teens.  "2 Live Crew" has an album, "Nasty As They Wanna be," which features strings of obscenities set to music.  Women are described only as sex objects for the singer's gratification.  The album includes many explicit references to male and female genitalia and even sexual torture of women.<p>   

<ul><li>Finally, government exists to reflect the will of the people in the laws and to enforce those laws.  Unfortunately, government's track record has been poor,  particularly with regard to public safety.  Elected officials pass many laws, hire more policemen and build more prisons, but the crime problem is not abating.  </ul><p>

The government also lacks the discipline, like too many individual Americans, to balance its budget.  This communicates a message of fiscal irresponsibility.  Opinion polls place politicians and government bureaucrats at the bottom of lists of occupations ranked for trust and confidence.  This reflects a growing cynicism about those in civil authority.<p>

The breakdown of value-influencing institutions was recently linked to the Navy's scandal by Sean M. Fahey, the 21-year-old senior who, as brigade commander, holds the highest rank among the 4,200 midshipmen at Annapolis.  He states, "The idea of integrity wasn't that hard to grasp.  Now, institutionally, we've hardly changed.  But the whole world has turned upside down.  Our class -- we grew up at a time when nobody in our entire lives, in any institution, was ever there to tell us what's right or wrong."<p>

Mr. Fahey explains the significance of the value chasm for the Navy.  "The sea is the same sea now as it was 2,000 years ago," he says, "A storm will tear apart a ship just as it did 2,000 years ago.  If you go out to sea and people die because you were not good at your word, it means everything."<p>

This future officer understands the tough job that faces every American leader, military or civilian.  Our current crop of young Americans are products of institutions that have failed to instill important values.  This has grave consequences for America.<p><br>

<title>Rethinking the American Dream</title>

<center>
<h2>Rethinking the American Dream</h2><p>
<i>April 20, 1994</i><p>
<h2>By Phil Gramm</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
I want to thank the Daughters of the American Revolution not just for
inviting me to this beautiful hall to speak to you tonight, but for what
you have done in promoting patriotism and a knowledge of our history in a
country that greatly needs both.<p>
Not far up Constitution Avenue, on the walls of our National Archives are
inscribed the words, "What is past is prologue." In these troubled times,
it is vitally important that Americans know our history, because in the
faith, vision, leadership and courage of those who have gone before, are
the guideposts for solutions to our problems today.<p>
Tonight I want to talk about a subject that was very much on the minds of
the Founding Fathers who met in the First Continental Congress, and that
subject was the American Dream. The idea that America was a unique place in
the world; that you could leave the Old World, come to America and be part
of a new nation; that you could be judged not by your ethnic group or by
who your parents were, but on the basis of your God-given talent and your
effort. This was a revolutionary idea in 1776, and quite frankly it is a
revolutionary idea in 1994.<p>
But it is an idea that took root in America. The American Dream is
something that everyone here has been part of. We don't have much trouble
defining the American Dream, because for most of us, our parents dreamed it
and we lived it. And we don't want it to die in America; we want to save it
here and share it with the world.<p>
A simple event of my childhood brought home to me what the American Dream
was about. I was 8 or 9 years old, and had seen a show on television about
King Arthur and his Court. I was out in the front yard on a sunny afternoon
with my brother and we were doing yard work and, as younger brothers do, I
said, "Don, you know, it would've been great if we had lived in olden
times." And Don said, "Well, what would have been so great about it?" And I
said, "If we lived in olden times, there'd been servants out here pulling
these weeds." And with the great wisdom of an older brother, Don said to
me, "Phil, don't you know, given the kind of people we come from, if we had
lived in olden times, we'd have been the servants."<p>
Neither of my parents graduated from high school, but before I was born my
mother decided that I was going to college. I fought it. I failed the 3rd,
7th and 9th grades, but my mother prodded me every step of the way to a
Ph.D. in Economics. Mothers dreams do not die easily in America. May that
always be so.<p>
I'm often criticized in Congress for having "blind faith" in the fairness
of America, and I respond that, "it's not just faith, it's evidence." My
wife's grandfather came to this country from Korea as an indentured laborer
to work in the sugar cane fields in Hawaii. When his son, my wife's father,
retired from that same company, he was the first Asian-American ever to be
an officer of a sugar company in the history of Hawaii. And when first
President Reagan, then President Bush, appointed my wife to be Chairman of
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, she oversaw the trading of all
commodities, and all commodity futures in America, including cane sugar.<p>
Now, that is a story of America in action. That is the story of the
fulfillment of one family's American Dream. It's not a story about a very
extraordinary family. It's a story about a very ordinary family in an
extraordinary country. America is not a great and powerful country because
the most brilliant and talented people in the world came to live here.
America is a great and powerful country because it was here that ordinary
people like you and me have had more opportunity and more freedom than any
other people who have ever lived on the face of the planet. And with that
opportunity and that freedom ordinary people like us have been able to do
extraordinary things.<p>
With this backdrop of what the American Dream is about, a dream that people
in America would do better than their parents, and that their children
would do better than they had done, I am very alarmed by recent polling
data, showing that for the first time, Americans do not believe they are
better off than their parents were.<p>
An even more important, startling and frightening revelation occurs when
people are asked, "Do you believe your children are going to do better than
you have done?" By a margin of 2 to 1, Americans now say "No."<p>
Why are the American people so pessimistic about the long term prospects
for our country? First of all, I believe that the American family, the
middle class family in this country, is under great economic stress. In
1950, the typical American family making the average income with two
children sent one out of every $50 it earned to Washington D.C. On April
the 15th of this year, the typical family making the average income with
two children sent one out of every $4 it earned to Washington, D.C. In a
two wage-earner family today over half of the income of the second wage
earner goes to pay family taxes that did not exist in 1950.<p>
How has this happened? It's happened because of the explosion of
government. Government spending adjusted for inflation since 1950 has grown
by 544 percent. The size of government relative to the economy has gone up
42 percent in the last 40 years. If this trend continues, the future is not
going to be very bright for working families.<p>
I think another reason that people are pessimistic is crime. Every morning
when we pick up the newspaper, we see the brutal face of violence in
America. The Justice Department last month projected that in the future
three out of every four Americans will be victimized by violent crime at
some point in their lives. As a measure of violence in America: A boy born
in America in 1974 stands a greater chance of being murdered than a
serviceman in World War II stood of being killed in action.<p>
I think another reason people are pessimistic about the future is the
collapse of American education. And it's not from a lack of money that
American education has collapsed. In 1960, in inflation-adjusted dollars,
we spent $2,035 per student. Today we spend $5,247 per student, higher than
any other developed nation on the planet, and yet our SAT scores have
declined by 80 points in three decades, and America does not rate in the
top 20 in math and science achievement in the world.<p>
But nowhere is the failure of government more evident than in welfare.
Since 1965, when the War on Poverty began, welfare spending has risen 500
percent, after inflation. But what has happened to the number of people on
welfare? It has exploded. In most of our major cities today, the majority
of children are born out of wedlock. Not only is our welfare system not
working, it is generating new dependency and breeding drug use, child abuse
and crime. It threatens the very survival of our culture.<p>
Given the magnitude of these problems, where do we begin to find solutions?
First, if we want to do something about the tax burden on working
Americans, we're going to have to do something about the explosive growth
of government spending. Now, as you can imagine, being the Gramm of
Gramm-Rudman and trying to do the Lord's work in the Devil's city, I'm
often asked, "Well, what magic formula would you use to balance the federal
budget?" much less make it possible to cut taxes on working families. I
could give you a very technical answer, but I want to give you a very
simple but powerful answer.<p>
The day I offered the Reagan Budget in the U.S. House, I was walking down
the steps of the Capitol and a reporter came running up to me and said,
"Congressman Gramm, in a 1,300-page budget how did you decide what programs
ought to be cut and what programs ought to grow?" I thought for a minute
and said, "I'd use the Dicky Flatt test." And not being from Mexia, Texas,
she didn't know Dicky Flatt or the test, so I explained it to her. I said,
"I looked at every program in the Federal budget, and then I tried to think
of some real, honest-to-God, flesh-and-blood person who lives in my
district, and that brought to mind a printer from Mexia named Dicky Flatt.
And I thought about him because he works hard for a living."<p>
Dicky Flatt and his wife were in business then with his Daddy and his Mama,
his brother and brother's wife. They were open 'til 6 o'clock every week-
night, and 'til 5 o'clock on Saturday. And whether you saw Dicky Flatt at
the PTA or the Boy Scouts or the Presbyterian church, try as he did he
never quite got that blue ink off the end of his fingers.<p>
And I said I looked at every program, thought of Dicky Flatt, and asked a
simple question: "Will the benefits to be derived by spending money on this
program be worth taking the money away from Dicky Flatt to pay for it?" And
let me tell you something: There are not a lot of programs that will stand
up to that test. When we apply the Dicky Flatt test, there won't be a
deficit in the federal budget. In fact, when we apply the Dicky Flatt test,
we're going to be able to cut taxes for working families.<p>
Earlier this year, in the budget debate, I offered an amendment that was
viewed as radical by many of my colleagues in the Senate because,
basically, it was a radical amendment. What I proposed to do was to take
the President's spending cuts, drop his add-ons, freeze remaining spending,
and use the resulting savings to increase the dependent child tax exemption
from $2,350 a year to $4,700 a year. And just as I anticipated, Senators
who opposed the amendment got up and said, " Well, Gramm's amendment is
going to cut spending for housing, for education, for nutrition." And so I
responded, "My amendment is not going to cut spending for housing or
education or nutrition. What my amendment is going to do is change who does
the spending. What I'm trying to do is take the money that government is
spending for people on housing, education and nutrition, and let families
spend that money themselves. I know government and I know the family and I
know the difference. And when we start making those changes, we're going to
start lifting the burden on working families and we're going to rebuild our
economy and the American Dream in the process."<p>
I don't claim that I know the solution to the root causes of violent crime
in America. I yield to no one in my desire to find and eliminate the root
causes. We spend billions of dollars a year trying to deal with the root
causes of crime and child abuse in America. But there is one part of this
crime problem that I know how to solve. We do not have to live with the
situation where each morning's newspaper tells of some violent criminal who
has been convicted of five or six major crimes but is out on the streets
again and has just killed somebody's child. I know how to solve that
problem. How? By putting predator criminals in prison and keeping them
there.<p>
Now, people say that it's expensive to put people in prison, and it is. But
if we stopped building prisons like Holiday Inns, it would be cheaper. And
it's a lot cheaper to keep a predator in prison than it is to let him walk
the streets of this country. I am committed to seeing that we get that job
done.<p>
I did not reach the conclusion that we should promote educational choice
quickly. I'm an old school-teacher, I taught economics for 12 years at
Texas A&M University. As I like to say, I have taught the same subject in
Washington for 15 years, but my Aggies were a lot smarter than members of
Congress. But I have reached the conclusion that there is no reform that is
powerful enough to change American education and bring back standards and
quality other than empowering families to decide where their children go to
school.<p>
I remember once in Dallas I was debating a woman from the Department of
Education. I was arguing for local control and for parental choice and I
thought I made what was the telling point of the debate. I said, "You may
know more about education than I do, but I love my children more than you
do." And this woman looked at me and said, "No you don't." And I asked,
"What are their names?" My point is that since parents have the largest
stake, the more control you give them, the better the results are going to
be. For the sake of our children and for the sake of America's future, it's
time to give choice a chance.<p>
I believe that everybody receiving public welfare in America ought to
either work or go to school. I believe that if they did that, they would
earn more than just their welfare check. When my Mama worked in a cotton
mill, she earned more than $17 a week: She earned self-respect, and it made
all the difference. I want to help people in America find the American
Dream by giving them back their self-respect and asking them to get out of
the wagon and help the rest of us pull it. Hasn't the time come to stop
paying welfare mothers to have illegitimate children? Our welfare system
has destroyed the poverty family, promoted dependency, and fostered child
abuse, crime and hopelessness. I say we should throw this system out and
start over again.<p>
Now the real question is, where do we find the courage and the leadership
to do those things? I believe that deep down in our hearts we know that
there are fundamental problems in our country and that we have to make
dramatic changes if we're to preserve the things we love about America. An
America where people do not believe their children are going to do better
than they have done is not the country that I grew up in. Nor is it the
country I want my children and grandchildren to grow up in. But where do we
find the leadership and courage to change it?<p>
A good place to start searching for the answer is to look to our Founding
Fathers. When you look at the problems they faced, they were overwhelming
as compared to ours. When you look at the resources they had to deal with
those problems, they were very meager as compared to ours.<p>
But they had two things, it seems to me, that we don't have enough of
today. They had faith and they had will. They had faith that God did not
set aside this continent for nothing. They had faith that God did not build
a society dedicated to freedom and that God did not raise America as a
beacon of hope for the world, only to let us fail.<p>
And secondly, they had will, the will to act, the will to make the world
over again, the will to risk everything in order to build a country that
would be a model for the world.<p>
In closing, I want to leave you with a quote from George Washington. We
often think of George Washington's gravest moment as coming at Valley
Forge, but it didn't. It took politics to bring Washington's lowest moment.
And it occurred during the period of the Articles of Confederation. So much
sacrifice had been incurred, yet America was floundering because we didn't
have a system that worked. Washington wrote in a letter to Lafayette: "I do
not believe that Providence has done so much for nothing. It has always
been my creed that we should not be left as an awful monument to prove that
mankind was unequal to the task of self-government."<p>
I believe that Washington's creed is as true today as it was then. And if
we have faith, if we are willing to act on that faith, I believe we can
remake America. Now some people will say that's just a dream, and they're
right: It is just a dream, but it's not just any dream, it is the American
Dream. I know you hold that dream in your hearts, and so do I.<p>
Thank you and God bless you.<p>
This was the keynote address delivered to the 103rd Continental Congress of
the Daughters of the American Revolution, April 20, 1994.<p>

<H2>The City and the Crusade</h2><br> 
<h2>by Patrick J. Buchanan</h2><br>
<B><I>Commencement Address for Christendom College<BR>May 6, 1995</I></B><BR>
</CENTER>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for that gracious reception.<p>
I confess it is not the kind to which I am accustomed on most college campuses. But it is  truly an honor to be here, at Christendom. Both to congratulate the graduating seniors, and to pay tribute  to this college for standing as a beacon of Faith, Truth and Light amid the encircling gloom of our  troubled civilization.<p> 
A few years ago, in Houston, I gave a speech at the Republican National Convention. As luck  would have it, I spoke just after the irrepressible Alan Keyes, and just before my old boss, the Great  Communicator himself, Ronald Reagan.<p>
Sandwiched between two such speakers, I naturally wondered whether the world would little note or long remember what a once-and-future Crossfire host would say there. <p>
But near the end of my speech, I made a simple observation.<p>
"There is," I said, "a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America...a cultural  war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself." This war, I said, is "about who we are...what we believe...(and) what we stand for as  Americans.<p>
That first night, commentators from David Brinkley to John Chancellor were complimentary.  They said Buchanan had given an excellent speech, an outstanding speech. Sander Vanocur went so far  as to say my speech "was the most skillful attempt to remind the party faithful of the role that ideas have  played in American politics since Eugene McCarthy nominated Adlai Stevenson at the 1960 Democrat  convention." High praise indeed from a commentator who was a friend and admirer of John F. Kennedy.<p>
That night in the overnight tracking polls, George Bush soared 10 points  his best night of  1992. By the time Mr. Bush rose to speak, three nights later, he had closed the gap with Bill Clinton. A  deeply disconsolate New York Times was in mourning; the presidential race had suddenly become a  dead heat.<p>
Then, I began to hear what the poet described as, "dim drums throbbing in the hills half heard."  The Washington Establishment was marching as to war and they were coming after me.<p>
The counterattack began then, and it continues to this day. Why?<p>
Because what we said at Houston went right down the smokestacks of America's cultural elite. As the old saw runs: It is only the truth that hurts.<p>
My antagonists fought back with the customary high-minded and reasoned arguments."Buchanan Declares...Domestic Jihad," read one headline. "What If Ayatollah Buchanan Had His Way?" said another.<p>
A New York Times writer said I was an example of that "reactionary Catholicism," that had driven Mexican General Santa Anna to slaughter Davy Crockett and his friends at the Alamo.<p>
But it was my future colleague, Bob Beckel, who cut to the heart of the matter: "That was the most reactionary speech ever given in a televised convention," Beckel said, "and I believe the devil wrote it." We're making progress. Bob Beckel believes in the Devil.<p>
You know there is not one nasty political name that has ever been invented -that I have not been called. Lately, one of my rivals for the Republican nomination again charged me with calling for a "Holy War." Now, because this is a non-political occasion, that opponent shall remain nameless.<p>
But let me respond to Arlen this way by telling a story about a genuine Holy War long ago.<p>
A thousand years ago, following one of those rare upheavals in the Middle East, the Holy City of Jerusalem was closed to Christian pilgrims.<p>
The Vicar of Christ, Urban II, traveled out from Rome through Christendom, until he came to the French town of Clermont. There he held a council with his bishops. At the council's end, he gave a great sermon to a vast crowd of pilgrims.<p>
The Holy Father called on men of faith and courage to unite in the cause of opening the road to Jerusalem. All who joined this Crusade, the Pope said, must take an oath never to turn back, until they had reached Jerusalem . The Crusaders' oath was signified by a sign of the cross sewn into the shoulders of their tunics.<p>
The first great noblemen to take up the cross was Raymond, Count of Toulouse, followed by Bohemond a Norman prince of Italy. Together, Raymond and Bohemond marched across the Balkans to Byzantium, where their armies rendezvoused under the nervous eye of the Emperor Alexius of Constantinople.<p>
There, Alexius asked the Crusaders to take a second oath.<p>
The Pope's oath had been to God. But the oath of Alexius was to Caesar: All Crusaders must pledge allegiance to him, Alexius said.<p>
Bohemond took this oath. All the other crusading knights did the same, except Raymond of Toulouse.
Raymond hesitated because he wanted to make clear his first allegiance was to the Crusade -- to the oath he had made to God. He told the Emperor he would be his subordinate if the Emperor led the Crusaders in battle -- but he would not be the Emperor's vassal.<p>
So, the Crusaders marched to the borders of Syria, laying siege to, and recapturing, the ancient city of Antioch.  Here Bohemond broke his pledge to Emperor and Pope. He laid claim to Antioch, to establish his own tiny kingdom; then stayed with his army, as Raymond led the Crusade on to Jerusalem.<p>
Raymond captured the Holy City from the Turks. There, his Knight Crusaders offered him the  great title: King of Jerusalem.  But the Count of Toulouse refused: He did not wish to be a crowned king in the city where  Christ had worn a crown of thorns.<p>
Now, modern historians will tell you, in loving detail, of atrocities the crusaders committed; and  there were atrocities. And they ought not to be defended. For among the first things a Catholic learns is  that man is fallen, and human nature is unchangeable.<p>
But there is a theme in the story of Raymond and Bohemond that illustrates a fundamental lesson: Each of us faces this choice in life: We can choose the city. or we can chose the crusade. And it  is far better thing to choose the crusade. That is what we are taught in our Catholic schools to choose  the crusade. Each  of us, to take up the cross.<p>
Now, I can see the headline, when they get wind of this at the Washington Post: "Buchanan  Renews Call for 'Holy War."' But what does it really mean to "choose the crusade" in modern America; and what role do  Catholic schools and colleges play?<p>
Let me tell you what I believe:<p>
In every city in America there are Catholic parishes, Catholic schools and communities of  Catholic families that form around those parishes and schools. When it works the way it ought to, family,  church and school pursue a single, common goal: Raising up each generation to embrace the faith, and to  accept the moral code that allows children to lead good lives, to become strong adults, to merit  salvation. To go all the way to Jerusalem . <p>
That is the goal of a Catholic education: The inculcation of values, the shaping of  conscience, the development of character, the formation of souls. Whether a child is outstanding in  math, a whiz at computers, or a great athlete, these are secondary.<p>
We have a crisis in American education because educators have lost sight of their goal. They  have lost sight of their first purpose: to produce moral men and women whose lives will be an example to  their community, and country, no matter how successful they are in their secular vocations.<p>
And how can we ever again succeed in educating children to become moral men and women if,  in America's public schools, we consciously deny them all religious instruction, and deny them access to  that primary source of morality, God's own word. The Bible is the one book from which they are  expressly not allowed to be taught.<p>
One of the greatest of our Founding Fathers, John Adams, once wrote: "Our Constitution was  made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other." What Adams was saying was that religion and morality are the tap root of the Republic. Cut the tap root, and the Republic dies.<p>
Our struggle, then, is against, those who have been slashing away at that tap root for decades. For if they prevail, our beloved country will perish.<p>
And, the struggle must continue, for the rest of our lives.<p>
In a healthy society, the institutions of culture reinforce the values of family, church, school. The history of the West, the greatest civilization in human history, is the story of centuries of architecture and art, literature and music, that lift up the hearts of men and women and point them toward the Truth. That is what the Cathedral of Chartres does; that is what Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel does; that is what Shakespeare's Henry V  does; that is what Beethoven's 9th Symphony does. All, in their way, are songs of joy, because ultimately they teach the truth that Christ is Risen.<p>
But that is not what Heather Has Two Mommies, does; it is not what that film, The Last Temptation of Christ does; it is not what grunge rock and rap music do; it is not, excuse me, what Roseanne Barr is all about.<p>
When the book Heather Has Two Mommies, glorifying same-sex marriage, was going to be used to instruct First Graders in the schools of New York City, my friend, Mary Cummins, president of a school board in Queens, stopped the sewage at the schoolhouse door.<p>
Mary Cummins is a heroine of the cultural war. She was doing what all good teachers, all good schools do, acting in loco parentis. She was another good mom watching over her kids.<p>
Moms are the front line troops in the cultural war.<p>
She is the one who snaps off the TV set when the filthy show comes on. She is the one down at the school board when Outcome Based Education, or condom distribution, or some absurd new federal mandate on how to teach America's children is being introduced.<p>
And if there is any institution that has always been a trusted friend and partner of conscientious mothers and the families they nurture and hold together, it is the traditional Catholic school.<p>
I know this is so because it was true in my own family. My grandmother put her trust in Holy Trinity, a parochial school in Georgetown after her husband left her with two young sons to raise. My father grew up in what the  social engineers call a "broken home" but he did not grow up in a broken community. His was a Catholic community founded on a Faith could not be broken.<p>
But, when my father was 13, and graduated from Holy Trinity, he was to be sent to McKinley Tech, a public high. Then, one day, two Jesuits arrived at my grandmother's house.<p>
"Mrs. Buchanan," they asked, "Why is young Bill not going to Gonzaga?" "Because," my grandmother replied, "we don't have the money." The Jesuits answered back: "Mrs. Buchanan, we don't want your money; we want your son. <p>
My father would repay that loyalty all his life Indeed, one day very late in my father's life, I went into a Catholic bookstore in Bethesda, to find a copy of the Douey-Rheims version of the Bible, that might somehow have escaped the clutches of the thought police. You  know the type: The religious rewrite men, with the big egos and the tin ears, who are going to improve on the most magnificent prose ever written.<p>
When I came to the counter, the lady recognized me.<p>
"Oh, Mr. Buchanan," she said, "your father was in here just two weeks ago, and he said the most wonderful thing. I said to him 'Isn't it terrible what has happened to our church today, Mr. Buchanan?' And he replied, 'No, Do not be afraid. We have it on the authority of Christ himself: the Rock will not break"' My father's religious beliefs, inculcated in Catholic schools, permeated everything. In my father's household, whatever Mother Church taught, that was it; there was no more debate.<p>
When I was a boy, one of my father's favorite expressions was "Offer it up!" It was an all-purpose phrase that meant, "stop whining and offer up your pain for the suffering souls in Purgatory." Whenever we were hurt, injured or cried, we would hear a loud impatient, "Offer it up!" It was my father's way of saying: Choose the crusade.<p>
Incidentally, "offering it up" was advice I could have used one night when still in my crib back at our house in Georgetown.<p>
My brothers, sisters and I were all instructed on how to pray as soon as we could talk. Even in the crib, I caught on quickly. When my older brothers were still toddlers, on their knees stumbling through the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be--from my playpen would come an impatient, "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen!" My parents were elated with these early signs of precocity. They would show off to neighbors the indolent little boy they called "Paddy Joe," who, as they said, "could talk before he could walk." My older brothers, however, were not amused by all this cleverness.<p>
The four of us in those years slept in separate cribs, which were on stilts and rollers and could be maneuvered around the otherwise empty room. To start the crib rolling all we had to do was stand, hold firmly onto one of the horizontal bars, and rock back and forth in the direction we wanted to go. One night, after the older brothers had their prayers interrupted and corrected, yet again, from the playpen, my father heard horrible screams from our room.<p>
Rushing in, he found milk and blood all over my forehead, and glass strewn all over the crib. The perpetrator was at hand. One of my brothers had maneuvered his crib over next to mine, reached in, jerked the milk bottle out of my mouth, and smashed it over my head.<p>
He was telling me, in his own persuasive way, to shut up.  Unfortunately, the lesson never took.  Ask Michael Kinsley.<p> 
A few years ago I wrote that story, and many others, in a book titled "Right From the Beginning." My purpose was to show that the conservatism I embraced was not some abstract philosophical credo. It was not the sort of thing one settles upon after late-night bull sessions with self-absorbed graduate students at Ivy league schools. My conservatism was rooted in habits and dispositions ingrained in me from childhood and engraved on the hearts of millions like me, and, I suspect, like many of you by parents, schools and church.<p>
Aquinas tells us that the virtues are not ideas, they are habits and the greatest of the virtues are not habits of the mind, they are habits of the heart.<p>
The other day Mr. Clinton implicitly conceded this point in his heated speech contending that conservatives and talk radio are somehow responsible for that horrific atrocity in Oklahoma City.<p>
Yes, Mr. President, in one way, you are right: The images that abound in our popular culture what we say on the airwaves, what we depict on our television screens, in our movies houses can help habituate America to violence and can corrupt the soul of our nation.<p>
That is what we have been saying, since Houston, and before.<p>
But, no, it is not the conservative or traditionalist vision that leads to acts of violence. No one is going to go out and stalk the dark streets of the city after watching The Bells of St. Mary's. It is not traditionalism that has led to 4,000 unborn babies done to death every day, to public calls for legalized euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide. It is not traditionalism that has led to the collapse of the American family, where one in three children today are born without a father to go home to.<p>
No, the slow-motion suicide of American society is traceable to a philosophy of self-indulgence, to a New Age Gospel that declares: There are no absolute values in the universe; there are no fixed and objective standards of right and wrong. There is no God. There is no salvation. It all begins here, and it all ends here. Every man lives by his own moral code. So, do your own thing.<p>
And, doing their own thing, our countrymen are creating, in our great cities, a society straight out of Dante's Inferno.<p>
It we do not reject this fatal philosophy, if we do not turn back to the Truth, America will perish. Just as the people of a city where the water supply is contaminated, will sicken and die, so, too, will a nation whose culture has been polluted with falsehoods and filth.<p>
So, how do we win this struggle for the soul of America?<p>
In our Catholic tradition we have many heroes, who can serve as our models. In our history, we have many great souls who have spoken truth to power. We have seen in our own lifetime humble men and women bring down evil empires by giving witness to the truth.<p>
A thousand years after Urban II preached the First Crusade, his successor, John Paul II, brought another crusade to the East. Forty years after Stalin mockingly asked how many divisions does the pope have, the first Polish pope came to an altar set up in a field outside Krakow.<p>
There, he gave the answer for the Holy See. And when from deep inside the Soviet Empire, John Paul II stood in front of hundreds of thousands who had kept the fait h, and said, Sursum Corda, Lift Up Your Hearts, from a dozen captive nations, millions answered in their own hearts, We Have Lifted Them Up to The Lord.<p>
They had kept the Faith. More than any bomb or missile, that is why the walls came tumbling  down, why the Evil Empire collapsed. In the climactic battle of the greatest war ever fought in the history  of Western civilization, not a single shot was fired by the armies of the winning side. Truth, crushed to  earth, rose again as we were told it would rise again.<p>
For my generation, that 70-year Cold War between Western Civilization and Marxist  materialism was our defining crisis and struggle. For your generation, the great crisis is within Western  Civilization. As we sacrificed and saved, and some of our friends fought and died, to win our war to  preserve the body of Western Civilization, it is up to you to save her soul. For the great struggle today is  between the modernist materialism all around us, and the culture and civilization rooted in the permanent  truths of our Faith.<p>
To assure victory in this struggle you must emulate the good people of Poland. Never back down  from the truths you learned from your parents, the truths you have taken in throughout your life, the truths  you have brought to a fine understanding here at Christendom.<p>
Never back down in the biggest things you do; and never back down in the simplest things  you do. Remember that courage, like cowardice, is a habit of the heart. And when the choice comes  down to between the city and the  crusade, take up the cross and lead.  <p>

<h1>Wilson, Jackson swap sound bites<br>
in sparring over affirmative action</h1>
</center>
<br>
By SCOTT THURM<br>
Mercury News Staff Writer<p>
 Call it ''The Pete and Jesse Show.''<p>
   Gov. Pete Wilson and the Rev. Jesse Jackson -- representing 
polar opposites in the national debate over affirmative action 
-- sparred by satellite across two television networks Sunday, 
bringing far more heat than light to the difficult question of 
how America should treat women and minority groups.<p>
   Neither man said much new as they contested the fallout of 
Thursday's decision by the University of California regents to 
abandon considerations of gender, race and ethnicity in 
hiring, promotions and admissions.<p>
   Instead, each seemed to take perverse delight in 
antagonizing the other, all the while trying to score sound 
bites that might be aired on still other news shows.<p>
<h4>"Ethnic cleansing"</h4>
    Jackson called Wilson ''corrupt'' because several regents 
are among his largest campaign contributors. And he accused 
the governor of ''ethnic cleansing'' for pursuing policies 
that studies have shown will reduce the numbers of blacks and 
Hispanics at the university's nine campuses.<p>
   In response, Wilson chided Jackson for ''childish name-
calling'' and accused the civil-rights leader of 
''demagoguery'' in a ''pathetic effort to divert attention 
from the real issue.''<p>
   In fact, each was using the other as a convenient foil 
while addressing different audiences: Wilson is seeking 
support among Republicans for his presidential campaign; 
Jackson wants to rally defenders of civil rights, while 
encouraging speculation about his own presidential ambitions.<p>
<h2>Suited for each other</h2>
    ''No two people in America need each other more now than 
Jesse Jackson and Pete Wilson,'' Sam Popkin, a political 
science professor at the University of California, San Diego 
said last week. ''United they rise, and united they fall.''<p>
Amid the shouting, several Clinton administration officials 
said Sunday they will examine whether the UC system would 
violate federal law by dropping its affirmative-action 
programs.<p>
   Privately, federal officials have said they don't foresee 
any action, because federal law generally permits government 
agencies to use race, gender or ethnicity as a factor in 
hiring, promotion and admission decisions but does not require 
they be considered.<p>
   Wilson made that point on Cable News Network's ''Late 
Edition,'' where he criticized the Clinton administration for 
''shameful threats'' against the university.<p>
<h4>1996 ballot measure</h4>
    In his most sweeping statement to date, Wilson said Sunday 
that as president he would favor eliminating all federal 
programs that consider gender, race or ethnicity for hiring, 
promotions or contracts. Wilson supports a proposed 1996 
ballot measure that would abolish those considerations in 
California.<p>
   As Wilson and Jackson stake out the extremes, President 
Clinton may win favor from the public for his plea last week 
to repair the excesses of affirmative action while maintaining 
efforts to help women and minorities overcome centuries of 
discrimination.<p>
   Even Wilson concedes that discrimination still exists. But 
he claims that affirmative-action programs -- which Wilson 
supported for more than 20 years -- now divide Americans along 
racial and ethnic lines, penalizing whites and stigmatizing 
successful women and minority groups. The United States should 
achieve gender and racial diversity ''on the natural,'' Wilson 
argues, by improving health and education programs for 
everyone.<p>
<h2>Clinton on Jackson's side</h2>
   But Jackson -- and Clinton -- maintain that women and 
minority groups still need a helping hand from government to 
overcome ''glass ceilings and closed doors.'' For example, 
Jackson noted Sunday that Hispanic women with college degrees 
earn less than white men who have never been to college. And 
they contend that critics of affirmative action, like Wilson, 
are trying to divide Americans for selfish political reasons.<p>
It's ''divisive, hurtful and irresponsible,'' said the 
assistant attorney general for civil rights, Deval Patrick, 
who joined Wilson and Jackson on ABC's ''This Week with David

<h2>Alan Keyes: Statement of Purpose</h2>
</center>
<br>
<HR>
<BR>
These days almost everyone acknowledges that the root of most of America's
problems lies in the decline of our nation's moral identity.  Crime,
rampant illegitimacy, the deteriorating environment for education in too
many of our schools, even the cost pressures in our health care system can
be traced to bad actions and habits that result from the decline of respect
for decent values in our society.  Yet when our political leaders address
these issues, most still run away from their fundamental moral dimension.<p>
In a <cite>USA Today</cite> interview, for example, one Republican presidential
aspirant, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, addressed the welfare problem.  He
spoke of the need to put time limits on welfare and to encourage welfare
recipients to work.  He even addressed the issue of orphanages.  Not once
did he mention marriage.  Yet a significant portion of the welfare burden
comes from single, unwed mothers.  For forty years or more, the government
pursued welfare policies that mass-produced fatherless children.  If today
we impose work requirements without promoting marriage, we will turn the
fatherless children into <em>de facto</em> orphans.  Yet Senator Gramm is oblivious
to the need to make promotion of marriage a policy objective.<p>
We can no longer afford to follow leaders for whom the moral challenge this
nation faces is an afterthought, when it ought to be the primary objective
of national policy.  That's why the leaders who want to finesse or run away
from the issue of abortion are not good enough either.  Today the spirit of
violence in our society is so great that our children are literally killing
one another.  What else should we expect in a nation where mothers have been
granted the spurious "right" to kill their offspring at will?  The
mother-child relationship is the wellspring of trust and love in a society.
The paradigm of all peace and security  should be the peace of the unborn
child in the womb.  The pro-abortion doctrine poisons the wellspring.  As
long as our courts sanction murder in the womb, they will be filled with
the consequences of violence in our streets, schools, workplaces and homes.
Politicians who run from the issue of abortion declare by that moral
cowardice their unwillingness to confront the killing spirit of our times.<p>
We need leaders who are willing to confront the moral identify crisis in
our nation, who are able to articulate and discuss the vital questions of
principle that will determine the kind of people we are and want to be.
Yet in domestic affairs, too many of our leaders seem willing to surrender
America's identity without a fight.  That was the real significance of the
obscene haste with which a "lame duck" Congress passed the GATT/WTO
agreement.  Many Americans feel that this agreement grants excessive
authority to an international organization on terms that violate
fundamental American tenets of political legitimacy.  They feel that it
embodies a threat to our national independence and identity.  Yet our
supposed leaders stigmatized such concerns as evidence of "extremism," and
embraced an agreement that bore all the marks of the Clinton
Administration's negotiating incompetence.<p>
Others have criticized the voters of California for demanding, through
Proposition 187, that the integrity of residence and citizenship within our
borders be supported with effective enforcement of the distinctions between
legal and illegal immigration.  They have implied that this demand is
evidence of bigotry, intolerance and racism.  Since when is it racist to
insist that laws, which no one denies our right to make, be enforced
against foreign citizens who violate them?<P>

<h2>Arlen Specter: Political Philosophy</h2> <P>
</center>
I believe the core of the Republican Party, and the essence of American greatness, is respect for
freedom--freedom of the mind as well as the marketplace.  Reverence for the principle of human
freedom must establish the relationship between government and individuals--a relationship that
must be defined by the values of economic conservatism and social libertarianism.<P>
Economic conservatism means a recognition:  that prosperity and opportunity are the products of
free markets, not government bureaucracies or state welfare programs;  that economic growth
comes form low taxes and less government regulation;  and that we cannot continue to mortgage
our children's future with national debt.<P>
Social libertarianism means a recognition:  that human freedom must be spiritual as well as
economic; that our government must respect, absolutely and equally, the religious beliefs of all
Americans; and that the reproductive choices of American women are not a matter for
government intrusion.<P>
The principles of economic conservatism and social libertarianism mean limited government, but
not uncaring or do nothing government.  Consistent with these principles, government does have
a role to play in fighting crime, in expanding access to health care, in improving education and in
promoting economic opportunity--a role that government must play in partnership with the
values established in American homes, communities and places of worship.<P>
America's unique position in the world as its bastion of peace and beacon of freedom demands
the preservation of our nation as a self-reliant economic and military power second to none.<P>

<title>Dornan's Announcement Speech</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Dornan's Announcement Speech</h2><br>
<i>Presidential Announcement, April 13, 1995</i></center>
<br>   
   My fellow citizens of the greatest nation in all of recorded history,
   you know why I come to you today with my wife, Sallie, my beautiful
   family, my sons-in-law, my daughter-in-law, all nine of our
   grandchildren: I come to you humbly as a nine-times elected member of
   the people's house, the House of Representatives, the greatest
   legislative body in the world and, to quote George Washington, 'the
   theater of action'. . . especially given the last hundred and some
   days.<p>   
   This is an awesome quest for any man or any woman, to imagine that you
   could possibly lead a nation of over 264 million people with the added
   responsibility of being the commander-in-chief of what was just months
   ago over 2 million men and women serving in every corner of the world,
   let alone dealing with the title 'leader of the free world.' I don't
   know anyone ever in our history that has the perfect background, or
   even close to the proper background, to aspire to the highest
   executive post in this great land. But the sheer honor and humbling
   spirit of even beginning the quest to lead our nation is an
   opportunity that any American would treasure for the rest of their
   life.<p>   
   I chose this memorial because, like the Vietnam Memorial, it
   represents the commitment of brave men and women far beyond what is
   demanded of us in all other areas of public life, including the chief
   executive's job.<p>   
   I feel the spirit of my mother and father with me here today, and I'm
   dedicating my campaign to all those friends of mine whom I flew with
   in peace time in the happy innocent Eisenhower years who later
   disappeared into the mists of Southeast Asia.<p>   
   Dave Hrdlicka-no remains recovered, a known POW for over five maybe
   six years. He just disappeared in Laos-my best friend in the Air
   Force. Dave was the godfather of my oldest son, Bob, standing in for
   my uncle Jack Haley. Sallie and I, with Sallie holding their oldest
   son during baptism, we were the godparents of Dave's oldest son, David
   Jr., who's now flying with American Airlines with a great Naval
   Aviator career behind him. Dave Hrdlicka's name is on the Xrietnam
   Memorial, as is that of my classmates in pilot training who got their
   wings the same day in 1955 that I did-Bernie Conklin, shot down by a
   MIG while he was flying an old twin-engine EC-47. In the Pentagon
   file, I read his last words-';They've hit our number one engine. It's
   burning. I guess this is it for us." We finally got back Bernie's
   remains, decades later. We never had returned to us the remains of the
   only other redhead in my class; David Allison. I saw his ID
   card-serial number just a few numbers less than mine-returned by Hanoi
   in the Central Intelligence Laboratory in Hawaii-that was it. . . one
   small green plastic card. Then Wayne Fulham, lost on a mission over
   Hanoi, handsomest man I ever saw in an Air Force uniform. When he was
   shot down and the North Vietnamese claimed they operated on him for
   several hours in a Hanoi hospital, they referred to him in their press
   as an all-American Boy. [Bootsie], his widow, just helped in the
   November election to elect one of the new freshmen Congressmen from
   Tennessee.<p>   
   For all of those men and others that I served with, who joined all
   those names on the Vietnam memorial, I dedicate this race. I run also
   for everyone in the military service since right up to Mogadishu and
   those who died on October 3rd and 4th and then again the night of the
   6th when 19 of the finest men that this country could ever produce,
   from 20-year-old Rangers to 36-year old Delta Force commandos, and two
   young 10th Mountain Division troops-Bob Dole's division, the 10th-and
   the greatest helicopter pilots to ever fly, the 160th Special
   Operations Aviation Regiment Special Forces out of Fort Campbell. I
   dedicate myself also to all of those heroes, particularly the two
   Nodal of Honor winners, Randy Shugart, whose dad refused to shake
   Clinton's hand at the White House, and Master Sergeant Gary
   Gordon-they both left beautiful wives. Gary Gordon also left little
   Ian and Brittany behind. These men gave their lives so that others
   would live. It s in scripture, Saint John, 1 S 1 3-"Greater love than
   this no man has."<p>  
   [IMAGE] Warrant Officer Michael Durant, in embracing me at Fort
   Campbell a few days after his return, said, "I owe my life to those
   two men." I promised, "Michael, I'll fight that they get the Medal of
   Honor." They did.<p>   
   On the Medal of Honor, there is only one word- Valor. On this side
   wall of the Law Enforcement Memorial, it quotes the greatest historian
   of the Roman Empire, Tacitus. He said, "In valor there is hope." And
   it is at this memorial and at the Vietnam memorial where we can
   experience hope that America's days are not ending, that our third
   century can be our best, that the American dream can be restored. . .
   rebuilt.<p>   
   Opposite Tacitus' words about valor are the stirring remarks about
   this memorial by of the 41st president of the United States, my friend
   and a decent man, a Navy carrier attack combat pilot, George Bush.
   Listen to what he said just four short years ago when this memorial
   was dedicated. President Bush standing about here told our nation
   this, "Carved on these walls is the story of America, of a continuing
   quest to preserve democracy and decency and to protect a national
   treasure that we call the American Dream.<p>   
   Well, I stand her today because of that American Dream and this
   terrible and tragic conviction that it is disappearing before our
   eyes, that our culture is melting down, that moral decay is rotting
   the heart and the soul of our country, that Abraham Lincoln's worst
   fear for the nation he saved bay be unfolding. He had his only
   inaugural ball in this beautiful treasure of a building {National
   Pension Building} behind us and was dead within a few weeks in the
   morning hours of April 15, 1865.<p>   
   Lincoln said, as a young 38-year-old man to a service club in
   Illinois, that American will never be conquered from without, that no
   despot will ever take a drink out of the Ohio River, that if America
   collapses as a civilization it will be because we destroyed ourselves.
   And I believe right now, a century and half after President Lincoln's
   warning to the United States, that America is poisoning herself, that
   we are destroying this God-blessed nation of ours, and I'm going to
   carry that message of warning to as many states as I can, and make
   sure that my good Republican friends in our primary races, every one
   of them a noble competitor hear and address my concerns. The eight of
   them stand head and shoulders in character and integrity above the
   occupant of the White House, but I want my friends; Bob Dole, our
   World War II hero, Phil Gramm, Pat Buchanan and Allen Keyes; my
   governor in California; Lamar Alexander, excellent former governor of
   Tennessee; Dick Lugar, who like me, has a deep interest in foreign
   affairs, and Arlen Specter- I mean- I said Allen Keyes-Arlen Specter,
   who like me wants a flat tax. It's new to him, I've been for it for 27
   years.<p>   
   All these good men, I want them to focus in on the social
   issues tearing our country apart. Yes we have an impending financial
   disaster that we approach at an ever increasing speed. Six trillion
   dollars of debt is absolutely a moral issue, and the debt will reach
   $6 trillion, by anybody's fair analysis before we begin, through a
   painful discipline-probably a 30 year process-to eliminate that debt.<p>   
   The main focus of my announcement will be in New York City, on my 40th
   wedding anniversary, Sallie's birthday, this coming Easter Sunday.
   Before that we will be in that great Granite State with the wonderful
   motto 'Live Free or Die,' New Hampshire, on income tax day, Saturday
   the 1 5th. The Dornan family will visit two places where I will focus
   on moral decay at Exeter and economic collapse at Nashua.<p>   
   But today on Thomas Jefferson's birthday tomorrow Good Friday will be
   a travel day-I am humbled to announce my declaration for the
   Republican nomination for the presidency of the United States of
   America. [applause]<p>   
   Why do we go to New York City in three days? I was baptized in Saint
   Patrick's Cathedral the second month of FDR's first term. My parents
   were married at St. Pat's the June before Black Tuesday, the big Wall
   Street crash of 1929. I love my home town of my birth. I truly was
   born in Harlem-llOth Street. It gives me excellent bragging rights
   with my friends in the Black; Caucus.<p>   
   And I don't mind jumping Sallie's Easter birthday on this day because
   I want to take this opportunity on Thomas Jefferson's birthday, his
   252nd birthday, to read for you a few perfect Jetferson quotes, before
   I briefly discuss our half hearted war on crime, in which not all
   Americans are fully engaged...not by any, measure. Most Americans are
   not in the fight at all We should always turn to our founders and
   framers in times of great change.<p>   
   Thomas Jefferson, born April 13th, 1743, and one of the
   greatest intellects during of our first revolution, any changes I
   think has much to say to us in our current bloodless revolution. Quote
   One: "We must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must
   make our election"-meaning choice-';between economy and liberty or
   profusion and servitude. If we run into such debt"-(and we're
   trillions beyond Thomas Jefferson's worst nightmare)- "that we must be
   taxed in our meat, in our drink, in our necessities and our comforts
   and our labors"-that's what we call income tax- "and in our
   amusements" that's what we call an amusement tax-"and our calling and
   our creeds"-that's the effort to drop the tax deduction for religious
   or charitable contributions-"we will have no time to think, no means
   of calling our managers"-the U.S. Congress- "to account, but only be
   glad to obtain sustenance by hiring ourselves"-to the IRS or to the
   Clinton administration-"to rivet the chains on the necks of our fellow
   sufferers"-that of course means us the U.S. taxpayers.<p>   
   "And this tendency of all human governments, a departure from
   principle becoming a precedent till the bulk of society is reduced to
   mere automatons of misery. And the forehorse of this frightful team is
   public debt. And in trainwretchedness and oppression.<p>   
   We finally have the focus of the Grand Old Party on this massive debt,
   on our deficit spending, on oppressive tax increases. America is
   living through such a new day that I not only finally speak proudly of
   my 27 years of support for the concept of a flat tax, but now chairman
   Bill Archer of Ways and Means-(who in 1970 won George Bush's seat in
   the U.S. House)-says ';The flat tax can be a plateau,"-a flat tax
   plateau period-"Until we can turn to a tax on consumption so we can
   abolish the IRS and send almost 11,000 agents if they want to continue
   to serve their country into other pursuits, or preferably into the
   private sector to help create jobs."<p>   
   By finally making drastic changes in our tax collection, we will save
   our citizens billions of dollars in lawyers and tax accountants as
   high as $30 billion. And we can run our government with a consumerism
   tax, where the rich will pay more because they garner unto themselves
   more goods, more services, more products. And with our poor-we can set
   a level of protection from taxation.<p>   
   But I'm not here at this memorial only to discuss Thomas Jefferson's
   powerful words about oppressive big government. I'm here to discuss
   what those words of George Bush meandemocracy and decency, the two
   pillars of civilization. Any civilization worthy of the respect of its
   citizens and worthy of being recorded in history as a great culture
   where families feel safe and secure is established those
   pillars-liberty and virtue.<p>   
   You cannot have true liberty unless people are virtuous. You cannot
   possibly hire enough men and women to wear blue and khaki to police
   effectively a land devoid of virtue. You can't hire enough U.S.
   attorneys or district attorneys or marshals or prison guards to keep
   peace in a country if a people has lost virtue. If the majority of
   citizens steal from one another and lie, and a handshake means
   nothing, and contracts mean nothing, then your culture has decayed
   past the point of no return.<p>   
   You must have a virtuous people or a free marketplace doesn't work.
   Capitalism is a failure up and down the line. But conversely you
   cannot have virtue unless a people are truly free to make decent
   choices, to choose a moral path in life. Our forefathers-again Thomas
   Jefferson concluded our Declaration of Independence with the ringing
   words "With a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we
   mutually pledge to each other our lives"-and some paid that full
   price-'our fortunes"-they were all bankrupted at the end of the 61/2
   year struggle"and our sacred honor." This is the noble commitment that
   U.S. senators and men and women in the House of Representatives should
   make over and over.<p>   
   When I was 19, during my first week on active duty; I took a ball pen,
   and in the soft vinyl of a cheap Air Force folder, dreaming about
   becoming an F-86 "Saberjet" pilot, carved those words into my
   binder-"With a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence."
   Tourists are visiting Jefferson's beautiful memorial across the Tidal
   Basin at this moment during Easter vacation. Inside, around the rime
   of the rotunda's dome they read: 'I have sworn upon the altar of God
   eternal vigilance against every tyranny over the mind of man."
   Powerful? Yes, our founders Were committed to a nation of virtue, to
   the spiritual, to a respect for religion.<p>   
   The First Amendment is not, a rejection of religion; religion-"the
   free exercise thereof' is mentioned in the amendment before freedom of
   speech, of the press, of the right for people to peaceably assemble
   and redress their government. The First Amendment starts off stating
   that Congress-that's me-shall respect no establishment of religion-no
   favoritism-and then the amendment says "or abridge the free exercise
   thereof." Clearly our founders and the framers of our inspired
   Constitution respected religion. Now we suffer a horribly polluted
   marketplace, a debased culture in Hollywood ridicules and assaults
   religion, tears valor and hope and virtue out of our country.<p>   
   I'm very pleased that Bob Dole is reading over some of my speeches
   delivered on the House floor over the last 19 years. Bob was brilliant
   in Iowa this week, a wonderful kick off speech in his beautiful home
   Bible Belt-state of Kansas. A day later, he was excellent in Ohio, the
   state of presidents. I think I'm already having an effect on my
   competition, and I hadn't even declared until right now. [applause]<p>   
   In this campaign, I'm going to insist we candidates discuss the
   morality crisis in our beautiful country. We are living through a
   meltdown of our cultures I repeat-we are witnessing advanced cultural
   meltdown-And we conservatives are going to reverse this tragedy. I'm
   an optimist about this challenge, because one of my political heroes,
   Winston Churchill, an inspiration to all politicians in republics?
   never apologized for saying that Western civilization was an example
   for the whole world with our representative government. And in a
   republic, the people rule, and can change anything, even meltdown.<p>   
   [IMAGE] Ronald Reagan's last wonderful public appearance was in that
   building behind me, Lincoln's Pension Building. That's where he made
   us all laugh when he talked about "looking down at the White House,
   the beautiful home, the Ellipse, David Gergen-nothing has changed."
   That's when Margaret Thatcher reminded us again what a gift to the
   world Ronald Reagan was. He helped to break apart the evil empire. And
   isn't it beyond irony, beyond comprehension that in the same
   generation that conquered most of Communism, we begin to poison
   ourselves with rampant hedonism in the popular culture. Today's
   contradictions simply does not make sense.<p>   
   I ask this of my fellow Republican primary voters, the focus of our
   primary process: please don't pick a candidate this early. Keep your
   powder dry. Keep your options open. Listen carefully to all nine of
   us. We do have a badly front-loaded primary process. The 1996 race is
   more like a 50-yard dash, unfortunately, than a longer more revealing
   contest. A long marathon would give more of a chance to the seven of
   us back in the pack. My pal Phil's got the early big money. Bob Dole
   has the name identification and big money from a wonderful, long
   federal career starting in Congress in 1961. They're both millionaires
   as are five of the remaining six. But now and then-message trumps
   money. Prayers are answered.<p>   
   And what I say to my fellow candidates, let's make Americans proud of
   the Republican Party. Let's reach out, as it says in Proverbs, to the
   poor and to the helpless. Let's not let the media spin everything our
   fine Speaker Gingrich says, everything the nine of us say on the
   campaign trail. For example, let us explain the glory of our 10th
   Amendment in the Bill of Rights and fight hard to restore power back
   to our governors...or to the people.<p>   
   In Europe they refer to this country as "the States,?' not United, not
   America. To them, greater America is Canada, Mexico, it's all of South
   America. What fascinates Europeans is our concept of federalism, the
   power invested in our regional governors, the uniqueness of our
   States. Children in European schools memorize the names of our 50
   states and love to recite them. Our children rarely learn the names of
   the nations of Europe with equal enthusiasm.<p>   
   Our states are unique. Our presidential power is unique throughout all
   the governments of the world because every other county has opted for
   a parliamentary system.<p>   
   Let's show our youth and let's show the world that the United States
   of America has its best years ahead of us. Let's try to be an
   inspiration to the world. Of course there is hope for our country, to
   stop the meltdown and recover. We honor these men and women in police
   work who give up their lives not just to protect our lives, but to
   protect our property, to give us the domestic tranquillity that was
   mentioned in the Preamble to the Constitution, to help us reestablish
   the justice that is again mentioned in the Preamble as the reason to
   ordain and establish the Constitution. <p>
   I will walk around these beautiful grounds again today and answer your
   questions. There are brochures available that tell the historical
   background of this great memorial. May I point out that point out that
   my beautiful golden state of California has over 1,100 names of peace
   officers killed on duty on these walls. We will be adding 13
   California officers' names next month. I hope the press will come to
   the ceremony here you'll learn something about that middle class
   kinship around the kitchen tables in those small villages or farms
   across America where a family will say to a young son or daughter
   ';yes, go for a career in the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Coast
   Guard, the Army, the Navy. It's a fine way to serve your country. Or
   the family may decide a great career is serving as a marshal, a deputy
   sheriff-"the khaki line,X' or as a police officer-the "thin blue
   line." We owe a great debt to the middle class of this country, those
   people who are living quiet productive lives, yes lives, of virtue,
   the solid family people of this country. That's who I intend to reach
   for. I want their support so that I can proudly serve as their
   president.<p>   
   What' s our battle cry in this campaign-it's on the signs around here?
   Faith. . . Family. . . Freedom.<p>   
   Without faith what does a people have?<p>   
   Family. That's what I'm going to accentuate and why I'm proud to have
   my beautiful extended family with me here today.<p>   
   And Freedom. And I don't mean just freedom for this country. I
   say to my friends in this primary process, we have an obligation to
   try and extend liberty-freedom where we can, where we are able to
   assist, even at some loss of life to our young men and women if we can
   explain the vital interests involved. We must impart democracy,
   freedom, and virtue wherever we can around the world. But remember
   this-when terrorist countries refer to the United States as The Great
   Satan and point out our frightening crime rate, our venereal disease
   rate, our children shooting children, our pornography, the hedonist
   filth on the soap operas, the filth on the talk shows, and the
   blasphemous language, the debasement of our language on most of the
   situation comedies and on the made for TV movies, and cable
   television. When I spoke to the CEO of one of America's greatest
   communications networks last week and asked him why as an Irish
   Catholic he couldn't stop the filth on his own network. I explained
   why I wouldn't let my grandchildren watch his network. Well, here's
   all this Irishman could say to me with his millions of dollars,
   private jet, country club memberships, gated communities and special
   lounges at airports and railroad stations: he said to me,
   "Congressman, things have sure changed haven't they?"<p>   
   Well, yes sir, Mr. CEO, they have. And we're going to roll this decay
   back. We're going to restore the American dream. [applause] I am not
   going to watch as things fall apart. My favorite poet, William B.
   Yeats, wrote these words in 1939, the year Hitler began the world's
   most devastating war "Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. The
   blood-dimmed tide is loosed. And everywhere the ceremony of innocence
   is drowned. The best lack all conviction and the worst are full of
   passionate intensity.<p>   
   Well, ladies and gentlemen here's one congressman that has the
   conviction and is passionate about it. But don't let my passion
   mislead you. I have never yelled at my staff and I've tried to
   motivate my children by example, not by harshness; I have never in
   subcommittee or committee or at a press conference ever shown a mean
   streak, only passion. On the floor of the House, in the Well, yes,
   I've been a tough debater, but no tougher than Patrick Henry
   exclaiming, "Give me liberty or give me death." I apologize for
   nothing when it comes to conviction or where I have been indignant in
   House speeches. It's not easy to be in the minority for 40 years
   forsaken in that political desert. My heart goes out to all my friends
   on the other side of the aisle who are having a little difficulty
   getting used to minority status.<p>   
   But let me advise you; if someone today is not publicly indignant
   about the bankruptcy policies of the government of this, the richest
   country ever- a government destroying the American dream economically,
   and if somebody in office is not publicly indignant saying "Let's stop
   this," about our cultural meltdown-our moral decline, I'll show you
   somebody who doesn't understand the facts. I'll show you somebody
   who's a pathetic bystander watching the destruction of their country
   before their eyes.<p>   
   While I fear for our country's future, I have a fighter's heart...
   come with me. At least wish me well, watch me, and help me participate
   in this great debate. Bob Dornan will probably never retire. I'll
   probably die with my boots on, so I don't ever apologize for being
   part of a pension system that I never voted for by the way. I want to
   meet St. Peter still swinging. Like Teddy Roosevelt, I love the
   arena-the political arena George Washington called "the theater of
   action." I love the dust. And yes, I have I bled for my country. When
   I was smashed in the face by a jet fighter's canopy ejecting. I came
   as close to death as Bob Dole did but without suffering his
   pain-there's no pain involved with drowning, just fear and sadness. <p>
   I have offered to put my life on the line for South Korea, for Israel,
   for Hungary, for Berlin, for the Dominican Republic and for Vietnam.
   But God never willed it so that I would have to fire at another
   mother's son.<p>   
   This is why I have a bond of love with cops and with the men and women
   in the military. I know the weight of that role of leadership and what
   it means to be Commander-in-Chief.<p>   
   My grandsons over her to my right, Kevin and Colin, helped me fly on
   the roof of the Capitol, 194 flags for every man killed in Somalia,
   44, 30 of those killed in action. I met with the families of the two
   Medal of Honor winners.<p>   
   I asked Randy Shugart's dad, Herb why he refused to shake Clinton's
   hand at the White House Medal Of Honor ceremony. Clinton told Mr.
   [Herb] Shugart he didn't even know the about the operation in which
   Randy was killed. . . that he didn't know Addid had been flown by a US
   Army aircraft to Addis Ababa. And Herb Shugart, the father of a Medal
   of Honor winner, told me, "Mr. President, you're not worthy to be
   Commander-in-Chief. I have nothing else to say to you." [applause] I
   know what is entailed with the Commander-in-Chiefs job. It's
   disgraceful Bill Clinton doesn't even have a clue.<p>   
   I'll close on this. One of my adversaries in the press-and brother, do
   they love their adversarial role-said ';Congressman, your passion in
   the Well, is that too strong for the White House? Might you not get us
   involved in a conflict" I pointed out to him that warriors or those
   trained to be combat ready warriors do not endanger the precious lives
   of their brothers and sisters in uniform unless, if all other means
   are exhausted, we can look their parents, their brother and sisters,
   their widows, their children in the eyes and tell them why their young
   heroes was asked to risk their young lives. Clinton cannot do that
   because he doesn't understand the careful, moral use of the power
   entrusted in the presidency. If you want to see tragic American
   history unfold be fore your reading eyes in one heartbreaking chapter
   after another about evil civilian leadership, I suggest you read
   Robert Strange MacNamara's rotten book, as I'm doing. Never again,
   will a war criminal like MacNamara soil our nation's honor.<p>   
   Thank you for coming today and God bless you, everyone. It's
   going to be a lot of fun out there on the campaign trail. If someone
   can't enjoy this election process, they shouldn't declare. I think the
   door will close next month after Senator Lugar and Governor Pete
   Wilson enter the race.<p>   
   We've got all nine grandchildren with us to head north to New
   Hampshire and we're going to have a good old time. Here's my Clinton
   countdown watch showing 572 days until the election. Sallie, what's
   your counting down until the inauguration? 648! Just add 76 days to
   mine and you have the inauguration day. I'm counting the hours and the
   days until we send the Clintons packing. This is going to be a great
   quest and a great American experience for our family and friends.<p>

<h2>Testimony of U.S. Senator Richard G. Lugar
House Ways and Means Committee
Hearings on Tax Reform
June 8, 1995</h2>
</center>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
Mister Chairman, I thank you for your strong leadership in the tax 
reform arena. Your often quoted comment that our current tax system should 
be "pulled out by the roots" has been an inspiration as I have traveled the 
country advocating the elimination of the federal income tax.<p>
 What I have found during my travels is that American families are 
frustrated, and even angry, with their economic predicament. They feel like 
they are running on a treadmill and that the treadmill is wining.<p>
The problem is that many Americans suspect that there is diminishing 
hope for a better future. The economic facts justify these beliefs.  From 
1950 through 1973, hourly compensation --including both wages and benefits-- 
increased an average of 3.0 percent per year.  Since 1973, the average wage 
increase has been less than one half of one percent.  During the past two 
decades, economic growth has been cut in half, averaging only 2.4 percent 
annually. And if this isn't depressing enough for the average American 
family, limiting growth to 2.5 percent is the stated economic policy of the 
Federal Reserve Board.<p>
This we must change. The American public is demanding it.<p>
The cause of America's economic doldrums is twofold: the huge federal 
budget deficit that robs us of the capital we need to grow, and a federal tax 
system that not only discourages, but confiscates our savings and investment.<p>
Our net national savings rate has reached alarmingly low levels.  After 
averaging close to 9.0 percent in the 1960's, we recently saw our nation's 
savings rate bottom out at 1.1 percent in 1992.  Because of this low rate of 
savings, capital to fuel our economy has become increasingly scarce.  As a 
result, productivity has averaged just 1.1 percent from 1974 to 1994.  The 
Concord Coalition estimates that had our productivity held its  pre-1974 
annual rate of 2.9 percent, the median family income would now be $50,000 a 
year instead of the current level of $35,000 a year. <p>
Americans celebrate that both houses of Congress have now passed budget 
resolutions that will bring us to balance in seven years. We now face the 
more difficult task of actually implementing this budget guide in our 
spending measures. We must be resolute in this endeavor and not fall victim 
to business as usual in Washington.<p>
As part of the effort to balance the budget, I support providing the 
American public with tax relief. But I strongly believe it is time to stop 
working around the edges of the tax code.  We must transform it completely.<p>
The federal income tax system is inherently flawed.  By taxing savings 
and investment at least twice, it has become the biggest impediment to 
economic growth in the country . It represents the worst form of big 
government intrusion into the lives of all Americans. Each year it costs 
Americans more than 5 billion hours of time to comply with it. That is equal 
to the total worker output of my state of Indiana. It is unfair. It is 
riddled with loopholes.   It has been changed 31 times in the past 41 years. 
And finally, it doesn't work. By its own admission, the Internal Revenue 
Service fails to collect from nearly 10 million taxpayers, with an estimated 
$127 billion in uncollected taxes annually.<p>
 Anything this bad, this broken and this ineffective should be ended 
decisively, and that is what I propose. I want to scrap the income tax 
completely and replace it with a national sales tax.  Mr. Chairman, you have 
outlined the criteria for evaluating an effective tax system.  It must be: 
(1) simple, (2) the least intrusive, (3) fair, (4)  border adjustable, and 
(5) friendly to savings and investment.  I have added that it also must be 
transparent.  I have studied all the recent tax proposals with these six 
factors in mind.  Many are better than the current tax system. But if we are 
going to overhaul our tax system, we should choose the one that meets these
criteria. I have concluded that a national sales tax is the best alternative.<p>
The first factor in choosing an effective tax system is its simplicity.  
Under a national sales tax, the burden of complying with the income tax code 
would be lifted.  There would be no records to keep or audits to fear.  The 
money a person makes is his or her own. You don't have to report it. You 
don't have to hide it. You may decide if you want to save it, invest it, or 
give it to your children. It is only when you buy something that you pay a 
tax. Although I applaud the efforts of flat tax advocates to simplify tax 
forms, nothing could be more simple than no forms at all. <p>
The national sales tax is the least intrusive of the tax proposals.  The 
IRS would be substantially dismantled under my proposal.  The IRS would no 
longer look over the shoulders of every American. There will be no audits.  
Americans would not waste time and effort worrying about record keeping, 
deductions, or exemptions that are part of the current tax code.  Although
the flat tax proposals tax consumption, they do so by giving the income tax 
a facelift and leaving the IRS largely intact.   You have stated, 
Mr. Chairman, "If the roots remain, the tree will grow back."  <p>
The national sales tax is the fairest.  Everyone pays the tax including 
wealthy individuals, criminals, illegal aliens, and others who currently 
avoid taxation.  Wealthy Americans who consume more would pay higher taxes 
under the national sales tax.  Individuals who save and invest their money 
will pay less.  Gone are the loopholes and deductions.<p>
The national sales tax would also tax the underground economy.  When 
criminals and illegal aliens consume the proceeds of their activities, they 
will pay a tax.  Foreign tourists will pay the tax.  Tax systems that rely on 
income reporting will never collect any of this revenue.  <p>
Of course, the fairness test must likewise consider those with limited 
means to pay taxes.  An integral part of my plan is protection for Americans 
who need it--senior citizens, the unemployed, and Americans with low paying 
jobs.  <p>
One strategy for addressing this problem would exempt a threshold level 
of goods and services consumed by each American from the federal sales tax.  
Each citizen who has a Social Security number will receive this exemption.  
For example, if the exemption level were $5000, a family of four would have 
its first $20,000 of spending exempt from the sales tax.  This figure is 
approximately 33 percent above the 1994 poverty threshold for a family of 
four.  <p>
Another strategy might be the exempting of items such as housing or 
medicine.  This is the method the majority of states have chosen and the one 
advocated by this Committee's Chairman. Americans understand and are 
comfortable with this practice. In the end, it will be up to this Committee 
and the Finance Committee in the Senate to decide the most desirable path.<p>
The national sales tax is the most transparent of the tax reform 
proposals.  A federal tax that is evident to everyone would bolster efforts 
in Congress to achieve prudence in federal spending.  There should be no 
hidden corporate taxes that are passed on to consumers or withholding 
mechanisms that mask the amount we pay in taxes.  Every year the public and
Congress should openly debate the tax rate necessary for the federal 
government to meet its obligations. If average Americans are paying that rate 
every day, they will make certain that Congress spends public funds wisely.  <p>
American exports would also benefit from the enactment of a national 
sales tax.  In January, the United States registered one of the largest trade 
deficits in our nation's history.  We must adopt a tax system that encourages 
exports.  Most of our trading partners have tax systems that are border 
adjustable.  They are able to strip out their tax when exporting their goods.  
In comparison, the income tax, and for that matter the flat tax, are not 
border adjustable.  American goods that are sent overseas are taxed 
twice--once by the income tax and once when reaching their destination.  
In comparison, the national sales tax would not be levied on exports.  It 
would level the playing field with our trading partners.   And best of all, 
foreign imports would be taxed when they are consumed in the United States.<p>
Mr. Chairman, the last and most imperative reason for replacing the 
income tax with a national sales tax is that it would liberate our economy by 
encouraging savings.  For the first time in the modern era, the next 
generation of Americans may be economically worse off than the previous one.  
Despite robust economic growth over the past several years, the average 
income of families has fallen.  They feel trapped in a box with diminishing 
hope of escaping.<p>
The bottom line is that as a nation, we do not save enough.  Savings are 
vital because they are the source of all investment and productivity gains--
savings supply the capital for buying a new machine, developing a new product 
or service, or employing an extra worker.  According to a recent poll, 
seventy-two percent of Americans realize that they are not saving enough for 
the future.  Our net national savings rate in the 1990's has been 1.8 percent 
of Gross Domestic Product compared with a rate of 8.1 percent in the 1960's, 
7.2 percent in the 1970's, and 3.7 percent in the 1980's.  <p>
The Japanese save at a rate nine times greater than Americans and the 
Germans save five times as much as we do.  Today, many believe that 
Americans inherently consume beyond their means and cannot save enough for 
the future.  Few realize that before World War II, before the income tax 
system reached its present form, Americans saved a larger portion of their 
earnings than the Japanese.<p>
A national sales tax would reverse this trend by directly taxing 
consumption and leaving savings and investment untaxed.  Economists agree 
that a broad-based consumption tax would increase our savings rate 
substantially.  Economist Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University estimates 
that our savings rate would more than triple in the first year.   The 
implementation of a national sales tax is expected to create one million new 
jobs over a ten year period and a three percent rise in wages over that same 
period of time.  Economist Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University has concluded 
that had a consumption tax like the national sales tax been put into place
in 1986 instead of the current system, the United States would have 
experienced one trillion dollars in additional economic growth!  
Mr. Chairman, our citizens and our economy cannot afford to wait any longer.  <p>
 As I have outlined here today, I believe the national sales tax is the 
best tax system to replace the income tax.  It is simple.  It protects 
privacy.  It is fair and transparent.  And it promotes economically 
beneficial behavior.  For these reasons, I encourage its enactment.<p>
Mr. Chairman, we live in an exciting time when the world is opening its 
arms to free enterprise.   The Uruguay round of GATT significantly lowered 
the barriers to trade.  Congress will soon open the telecommunications 
industry to competition, better enabling individuals and companies to 
interconnect across the globe. Goods and information are able to flow freely
between countries with few obstructions.  One of the last remaining barriers 
between countries is their tax systems.   We must face the fact that America 
is competing with other countries whose tax systems are more friendly to 
investment than is our income tax.<p>
If we enact a tax system that encourages investment and savings, 
billions of dollars of investment will flow into our country.  During a 
recent poll taken by Princeton Economics International, executives of the top 
twenty Japanese companies stated unanimously that they would bring 
manufacturing to the United States if our country enacted a broad based 
retail consumption tax.  It makes sense.  America has the most stable 
political system, the best infrastructure, a highly educated workforce and 
the largest consumer market in the world.  Our economic growth and prosperity 
would be unsurpassed.  <p>
There will be complex transitional  issues to address. But in the end, 
our country will be stronger and more prosperous.  That has to be our focus. 
Our vision must be for an America in which the American family enjoys better 
job prospects and more real income. Our paychecks will be bigger, our savings 
will be greater, and our hopes will abound.  Let's give Americans this 
chance. <p> 
<br>
Thank you.<p>

<title>The Flat Tax in Our Future</title>

<h2>"The Flat Tax in Our Future"</h2>
<b>Address by Congressman Dick Armey<br>
on Reintroducing the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act<br>
National Press Club<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
July 19, 1995<br></b></center>
<hr>
<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you'll forgive me for being in such a cheerful mood.  But to paraphrase that old Ethel Merman song, "Everything's coming up flat tax."  
<p>
One of my rules of thumb is when Dick Gephardt is singing out of Dick Armey's hymnal, you know something important is going on out there.  And it's not just Dick Gephardt.  These days it seems you can't swing a dead catfish in this town without hitting the author of a flat-tax plan, or at least a major tax overhaul.  Clearly, the lessons of the Contract with America are being heard loud and clear by the Washington establishment.  The American people are clamoring for a dramatically different kind of government -- one that's smaller, more open, and more accountable.
<p>
As I said in my new book, The Freedom Revolution, I believe the most enduring revolutions bring about the simplest reforms.  The moment the polls closed on November 8th, 1994, today's mindlessly complicated, growth-stifling tax code began tumbling toward the waste-paper basket of history.  And that's why my friend Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama and I are proud today to reintroduce the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act.  
<p>
This legislation features a tax system so simple you could do your taxes on a postcard, and so fair, it might just restore people's ability to trust their government.  Wouldn't that be a nice change?  Rather than tinkering, Senator Shelby and I scrap the entire code, corporate and personal, and replace it with one flat rate that applies to all Americans.  We leave just one exception: a family allowance to ensure that every family has the first claim to its own income sufficient to support itself.  A typical family of four must earn $33,300 before it owes a penny of federal income tax.  Beyond that, everyone pays a flat 17 percent on all income.  No deductions.  No loopholes.  No tax breaks.  No tables.  No schedules.  No nothing.  
<p>
Each year, you calculate your income, fill out a postcard-size form like the one blown up on this chart, make out a check, and drop it in the mail.  End of process.  You're done with the IRS until next year.  It's as simple as an income tax gets.
<p>
If you have business income, the process is almost identical.  Whether you're IBM or a mom-and-pop grocer, you still fill out a postcard-sized form.  Just subtract expenses from revenues and pay 17 percent on the remainder.  That's it.  Instead of taking eleven hours to do your taxes, as the average family does today, you could do it in eleven minutes.  Maybe less.
<p>
Imagine the new world that will dawn.  Gone will be today's 480 different tax forms, and the 280 forms that explain how to fill out the 480 forms.  Whole armies of tax attorneys and lobbyists will be out looking for more productive work.  And as for all those IRS agents and auditors?  Well, instead of harassing you, they'll be sitting silently at their desks, like Maytag Repairmen, feeling bored and, I suspect, just a little lonely.
<p>
There is an important change from last year's bill.  We've added a new provision that requires a three-fifths supermajority to raise the rate, add additional rates, create loopholes, or shrink the family allowance.  We are absolutely determined that the flat tax stay flat.
<p>
And I can tell you, this idea is catching fire.  You can feel it.  The flat tax is in America's future.  Why am I so confident?  Well, for one thing, over the past year, I've received more than 5,000 intensely enthusiastic letters praising the bill.  And in just the past month, I've received nearly that many messages over the Internet.  Yes, the flat tax has gone "third wave" with its very own home page on the worldwide web.  The address is armey.flattax.
<p>
From this mail, I can tell you there are four basic reasons why people like the flat tax.  They know it's simple, it's honest, it's pro-growth, and it's fair -- four virtues notably lacking in our current system.
<p>
First of all, as I've said, it's incredibly simple.  No longer will the American people spend anything like 5.4 billion man-hours figuring their taxes each year, which incidentally is more man-hours than it takes to produce every car, van, and truck built in the United States.  By one estimate, this needless time and paperwork costs our economy a staggering $232 billion a year, more than the entire federal deficit.  That's a potential savings of $900 for every man, woman, and child in America.
<p>
Second, unlike today's code, the flat tax is honest.  By sweeping away all the special-interest loopholes, it shows us right up front how much government is really costing us.  And by eliminating the code's social engineering and economic tinkering, it shifts power from politicians to private citizens.  It has the decency to respect our ability to make our own financial judgments.
<p>
Third, the flat tax is incredibly pro-growth, planting the seeds for rapid rises in output and wages.  Any professional economist worth his Ph.D. will tell you the chief cause of stagnant wages is our nation's anemic saving rate.  And the chief cause of our low saving rate is today's destructive policy of taxing savings twice -- once when a dollar is earned, and then again when it produces a return.  The flat tax wipes out this perverse bias against saving in a single bold stroke.  As a result, savings will rise.  The pool of capital will grow.  Workers will be better equipped and trained.  And their output will expand, leading to bigger paychecks.
<p>
But a higher saving rate is not enough.  We also need greater rewards for work and risk-taking, the true engines of wealth-creation.  Instead of punishing entrepreneurship with steeply progressive tax rates, as we do today, the flat tax slashes the top rate from 40 percent to 17, enabling America to unfetter her would-be Thomas Edisons and Bill Gates to create the inventions and industries and high-paying jobs of tomorrow.  Today, people rightly ask themselves why they should invent the proverbial "better mousetrap" when the government is going to take away half their earnings anyway?  The flat tax would make such risks worthwhile, while making America a magnet for foreign investment capital.  As a result, as you can see from this chart, the income of the average American family of four would be approximately $4,300 higher in 2002 than it would if we retained the current system.  Higher savings, more risk-taking, higher wages.
<p>
The fourth and final reason people like the flat tax is also, in my view, the most politically powerful.  It's fair.  Let me tell a quick story.  I was walking out of a hotel in Dallas one day, and the fellow that parks the cars approached me, and he said, "Congressman, I love your flat tax.  And the reason I love your flat tax is it treats everybody the same."  I think that gentleman revealed something very profound, something very American, in his view of fairness.  In America, we define fairness as treating everybody the same.  Rich or poor, black or white, we're all equal.
<p>
That's why liberals ought to love the flat tax.  When you tax everyone at the same rate, the rich pay a lot more in taxes than the middle class or the poor.  With three times the income, you pay three times the taxes.  Ten times the income, ten times the taxes.  And so on.  Now if you ask me, that seems pretty fair.  But even beyond that, by the traditional liberal definition, our flat tax plan is "progressive" -- as progressive as the code we had under President Kennedy.  As the chart shows, thanks to the generous family allowance, even with a flat rate, a family making $33,300 a year would pay no federal income tax, while a family making $50,000 would pay six percent of its income, and a family making 200,000 a year would pay 14 percent of its income.  This means about 20 million lower-income Americans would be dropped from the tax rolls altogether.  What's not for a liberal to love?
<p>
So there you have it.  Simplicity, honesty, growth, fairness -- four reasons people love the flat tax.  But now allow me to take a few minutes to address the four most commonly heard concerns about our plan.
<p>
The first concern comes from the class-warfare crowd -- and, I'm sad to say, a few careless reporters -- who are asserting that the Armey flat tax does not tax investment income.  They say we're letting wealthy stockholders off the tax hook.  This is completely untrue.  Our plan taxes investment income at exactly the same rate as wages.  What we don't do is tax it twice.  
<p>
Take a dollar of corporate-generated earnings.  Today, it's taxed at the business level, and then taxed again when it's paid out as a dividend.  That's double taxation, which, as I've said, depresses the saving rate.  Our bill, by contrast, taxes every dollar of business-generated income at the business level, once and only once.  And it does so far more efficiently than today's system, because it eliminates the need for taxpayers and businesses to keep billions of pieces of paper for reporting purposes.  So let me repeat.  Under our plan, all income is taxed at the same 17 percent rate with no exceptions.  To suggest or imply that we do not tax investment income is a misrepresentation of the plan.
<p>
A second question of concern comes from people who ask, "Will eliminating the home mortgage interest deduction hurt the real-estate industry?"  The answer is "Not as much as lower interest rates will help it."  While our plan does end the interest deduction, it also ends the tax on interest earnings.  As a result, nothing changes.  Both borrowers and lenders are held harmless.  What the homeowner loses in deductions, he gains in lower interest rates.  And in fact he comes out ahead on the deal, because the flat tax ends the bias against saving, causing the capital pool to swell and driving interest rates down even further.  That's good news for the housing industry.
<p>
And frankly, homeowners are not as wedded to this supposedly "sacred" deduction as you might think.  By a three-to-one margin in a recent poll, homeowners said they're willing to forego the mortgage deduction if that loss is offset by a reduction in their tax bill by a similar amount, which our plan does.  So I'm confident homeowners, homebuilders, Realtors, and lenders will all support our approach, knowing they're not losing a tax break -- they're gaining a new and better tax code, and a bigger economy.
<p>
And that leads me to an observation.  Ladies and gentlemen, the American dream is not just owning your own home, it's getting your kids out of it.  We want a high-growth, low-inflation economy with opportunities where our children can get out of school, get a good job, raise their own family, and be able to afford their own home.  And the flat tax goes a long way to helping them realize that dream.
<p>
The third major concern about our plan comes from some of our conservative friends who are worried charity would suffer without the charitable deduction.  My guess is they won't even miss it.  For one thing, almost half of charitable contributions today are not even claimed as deductions, so ending the break would have no effect on that giving.  But more tellingly, during the 1980s, the so-called "decade of greed," charitable giving actually went up even as its value as a tax break declined dramatically.  Because President Reagan cut the top marginal rate from 70 percent to 28 percent, the deduction became far less valuable for tax purposes.  And yet total charitable giving doubled.  Religious contributions nearly tripled.  Why?  Because people had more money in their pockets.  Their taxes were lower, and their incomes higher.  The American people responded to greater freedom and prosperity as they've always done, by opening their hearts and their wallets to their neighbors.
<p>
And finally, the fourth major concern with the flat tax is that it will explode the deficit.  Those who want to preserve the current, complicated tax structure have been repeating an estimate of "$200 billion dollars a year" like a mantra.  Well, as Ronald Reagan used to say, "The trouble with our opponents is not that they are ignorant, but that they know so much that isn't so."  I've said from the beginning that I want our proposal to be debated on its merits, and not on the issue of revenue loss.  I've designed it to provide a $40 billion tax cut, paid for by spending cuts.  I've asked the Joint Committee on Taxation to score our bill.  And I'm confident Joint Tax will find it to be deficit neutral.  When it does, the red herring of revenue loss will be laid to rest for good.
<p>
What, then, is the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act?  It's a tax plan so simple you could do your taxes on a postcard.  But it's more than that.  It's also a vision of what America can be again -- a formula for rejuvenating our economy, freeing our entrepreneurial talent, and reviving stagnant family wages.  It's a common-sense plan for returning to a government that is simple, honest, and fair to all our citizens.  And who knows?  It might just restore people's ability to trust their government.  And this is why I believe the flat tax is in America's future.
<p>
Thank you.

<h2>Toast by Congressman Dick Armey</h2>
<b>American Spectator Tribute to Ronals Reagan<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
May 17, 1995</b><br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
Thank you, Ed Crane, for that kind introduction.  I was just thinking to myself ... if only this were a fund-raiser for the Reagan '96 campaign.<p>
But thank you all.  I'm honored to be here tonight to help you celebrate my hero, Ronald Reagan.  Thinking about Reagan's life, I'm reminded of what Yogi Berra said when informed that the City of Dublin had elected a Jewish mayor: "Only in America!"  Think of it.  Here was a former movie actor who brought down the most wicked regime the world has ever known, largely through the power of his words.  Only in America.<p>
They called him a far-right extremist -- said he was too conservative to be president.  And yet he won two landslides.  And when he left the Oval Office, he was one of the most truly beloved men ever to have held that high office.  Only in America.<p>
You know, that great lady, Clare Booth Luce, once offered the theory that American presidents are remembered by a single sentence.  Thus we say "Washington was the father of his country," "Lincoln saved the Union and freed the slaves," "FDR led the nation through depression and war."  And so naturally the question arises: How will Ronald Reagan be remembered?  Back while he was still president, Clare Booth Luce suggested: "He restored our pride and revived the economy."  Later, Margaret Thatcher would offer a pithier assessment: "He won the cold war without firing a shot."  Well, I hope it's not too presumptuous of me to add my own suggestion to the list.  I would simply say, "He liberated the world."  Yes, the world.  And not just from Soviet communism.  No, it goes deeper.  He liberated us from the peculiarly 20th-century notion that human progress depends on planners and experts.<p>
He had an abiding faith in ordinary people, because, unlike so many of this century's so-called wise men, he could see the inherent dignity of the human spirit.  Endlessly and eloquently, he reminded us that "democracy is the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man" and that the free market is the greatest engine of prosperity ever conceived.  He was the sort of person who really believed, as he said in his first Inaugural, that "you can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates," and "you meet heroes across a counter -- and they're on both sides of that counter."
Because this humble, optimistic man of conviction was our president -- because this former actor dared to love freedom more than peace -- we stand tonight on the verge of an era of unimagined peace, prosperity, and personal liberty.  Only in America.<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast.  To Ronald Reagan, the man who liberated the world.<p>

<title>Dick Armey Speech at Cato</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Address by Congressman Dick Armey</h2>
<b>At the Dedication of the Hayek Auditorium<br>
Cato Institute<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
May 9, 1995<br></b>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
Thank you, Ed Crane, for that kind introduction.  It's not just a pleasure, but also a tremendous honor, for me to be here this evening to honor the memory and ideas of Friedrich Hayek.<p>
Fifty years after The Road to Serfdom, the closing thought of Hayek's great treatise still rings true: "The guiding principle of any attempt to create a world of free men is this.  A policy of freedom for the individual is the only truly progressive policy."<p>
Sometimes we forget how radical this statement was in 1944.   Hayek's little book evoked contempt from his fellow intellectuals.  To suggest, in the midst of the Second World War, that central planning does not work and is generally self-defeating and dangerous -- this was a dramatic statement which the political class could not accept.  To argue that government should be so limited as to be able to do little beyond protecting life, liberty, and property -- this was antiquated, eccentric, even bizarre.  And yet, today, looking back over the decades, who would say that the socialists and central planners were right, and Hayek wrong? <p> 
Events, of course, have proved him prophetic.  Indeed, he had the good fortune to live long enough not only to see National Socialism smashed, but also to see Soviet Socialism relegated to the ash heap of history.  And I'd like to think he is up there somewhere tonight, smiling down on us, as big government liberalism follows those two great, tragic "isms" into oblivion.<p>
What was it that so enraged left-wingers about Hayek?  It was the assertion that liberal paternalism is just as dangerous to humanity in the long run as fascism or communism.  Liberalism, he argued, differs from those evil systems only in degree, not in kind.  Hayek was a humble man, genuinely humble before Reality.  And this humility gave his words the boldness of honesty and the audacity of truth.  And the liberals could not forgive him.<p>
Reading back over The Road to Serfdom, I could not help thinking that a conservative is someone who says, "I'll believe it when I see it," and a liberal is someone who says, "I'll see it when I believe it."  While Hayek always called himself a liberal in the classical sense of "one who is for liberty," he was truly conservative in the sense I'm talking about.  He never thought human nature or the constitution of reality could be changed or reshaped by force of will.  He was that rarity, the intellectually honest man in an intellectually dishonest age.  What an ideal namesake for an auditorium dedicated to the promotion of human freedom.<p>  
And what an ideal think tank to have helping our new majority transform Washington.  Your devotion to truth, like that of Hayek, has cast you as mavericks.  It has put you at odds with the received opinions of the conventional left and right.  But it is this principled consistency that has made the Cato Institute so "hot" these days.  I mean, who would have imagined, a year ago, that the leaders of Congress would be looking to those"extremist libertarians" over at Cato for advice?  Who could have imagined we would be discussing abolishing whole programs, turning others back to the states, repealing ill-conceived laws, and dismantling cabinet agencies, just as you've always recommended?<p>

You have been successful because you believe what Hayek never ceased to point out -- and indeed what the entire twentieth century makes plain -- that freedom, and only freedom, works.<p>

What a hopeful time this is.  Socialism is finished.  The liberal welfare state is passe.  And I'm more optimistic than I've ever dared to be that we are entering a new era of limited government.  Congress is run by Americans who believe ordinary people can be trusted to spend their own money and make their own decisions.  We will send power back from the hallowed halls of Congress to the more hallowed kitchen tables of America, where night after night families bow their heads in thanks and make decisions about education, charity, jobs, spending, debt, and personal behavior with a wisdom and a compassion that no agency, no cabinet, no Congress could ever match.<p>

Just today, we shook the foundations of Washington by doing something that hasn't been done for a quarter-century.  We proposed a balanced budget.<p>

True to our word, and despite the skeptics, we've produced a specific, detailed plan to balance the budget in seven years.  And we get there with real spending restraint.  No accounting gimmicks.  No tax increases.  In Hayekian fashion, we ask basic questions: Does the typical American family really need a Department of Commerce?  Could our children learn without an Education Department?  Could the Republic survive without a National Endowment for the Arts?  Would the economy grind to a halt without an Interstate Commerce Commission?<p>
While this budget faces a tough road, we believe the American people demand no less, for the sake of freedom.  Americans want, not just a smaller government, but the government of the Framers of our Constitution.  And that's what we intend to restore.<p>

Can I give you a peak at where we're headed?  Just look at Estonia.  Three years ago, that tiny republic was a typical, ex-Soviet basket case, with negative growth, staggering unemployment, and skyrocketing inflation.  But in late 1992, Prime Minister Mart Laar's reform government decided to throw the dice.  They abolished all tariffs.  They privatized 90 percent of state-owned enterprises.  They scrapped every last subsidy, right down to farm subsidies.  To create a sound money supply, they threw out the worthless ruble and created a new local currency, pegged to the Mark.  Here's my favorite part: They established a flat tax.  And yes, they balanced their national budget.<p>
What's the result?  Today, the Estonian economy is growing at a vigorous 6 percent a year, twice America's growth rate.  Unemployment is just two percent.  Inflation has collapsed from 1,000 percent to forty.  Sixty thousand new private businesses have sprung up, in a population of only two million.<p>

Mart Laar came to my office the other day to recount his country's remarkable transformation.  He described a nation of people who are harder-working, more virtuous -- yes, more virtuous, because the market punishes immorality -- and more hopeful about the future than they've ever been in their history.  I asked Mr. Laar where his government got the idea for these reforms.  Do you know what he replied?  He said, "We read Milton Friedman and F. A. Hayek."<p>

Ladies and gentlemen, if Estonia is not a vindication of everything we believe in -- from free trade to privatization to sound money to balanced budgets -- I am at a loss as to how else one could validate our ideas.  To quote my friend and hero, Thomas Sowell, we don't have faith that freedom works.  We have evidence.<p>

And by the way, if I can advertise for a moment, it turns out Estonians love their flat tax.  They like the postcard-size return.  Compliance has actually gone up.  People are willing to pay their taxes voluntarily now, because they feel the system is fair.  Their only complaint: They think the rate is too high.  But of course, there's an easy way to cure that.<p>  

And speaking of taxes, isn't it amazing that the debate over how we restructure America's tax system for the next century is coming down to a contest between a flat tax and a consumption tax?  How far we've come.<p>
As I say, I'm hopeful for the future of freedom.  But I do have concerns.  Let me just mention one.  More and more these days, immigrants are being viewed as if they were the source of America's problems.  It seems the old Malthusian notion that people are a drain is making one of its regular revivals.  Well, it's good to know Cato has always held fast against this misguided teaching.  At a time when some are turning against immigrants, you continue to view human beings, in Julian Simon's beautiful phrase, as the ultimate resource.<p>

Anti-immigrationism has always been ironic, because throughout our history, newcomers have been a source of strength, not weakness.  America still attracts the world's best talent.  And surely that is no liability.  Think of it.  We can avail ourselves of much of the world's intellectual wealth simply by opening our doors.  America need not grow old and tired.  We can always take in new talent and new ideas and new blood.  No ruling elite can dominate us for very long, because we always have younger, smarter, more entrepreneurial spirits willing and eager to move up.<p>
The impulse to limit immigration is really a manifestation of the protectionist impulse.  And it's misguided for the same reasons.  It's a desire to use government's monopoly of coercive power to benefit oneself at the expense of somebody else.  And that, as Hayek taught us, is self-defeating.  But the biggest problem with the closed-border idea is that it embraces the liberals' world view.  And thus it leads logically down the path to bigger government.  Should we have an orderly immigration policy?  Of course.  Should we give the Border Patrol appropriate tools?  Yes.  But in so doing, should we infringe on the personal liberties of law-abiding Americans?  Absolutely not.  We need immigration reform.  But our goal should be to make immigration more orderly, not more restrictive.
<p>
We have too many immigrants coming here to get on welfare.  But the reasonable response is not to build a police state.  It's to shrink the welfare state.<p>
We have an educational system that no longer promotes assimilation.  But the sensible response is not to exclude foreign children.  It's to scrap multiculturalism in the schools and give parents real school choice.<p>
Should we reduce legal immigration?  Well, I'm hard pressed to think of a single problem that would be solved by shutting off the supply of willing and eager new Americans.  If anything, in the spirit of Hayek, we should be thinking about increasing legal immigration.<p>
Should we turn private employers into auxiliary border guards?  I think unfunded mandates are bad enough without that.<p>
And as for a national ID card, which I understand the Administration is considering, let me just say this.  I oppose it.  And I will fight it.  Let me be clear here.  What some are calling a "national computer registry" is just a euphemism for a national ID card.  And any system in which Americans would be forced to possess such a card, for any reason, is an abomination and wholly at odds with the American tradition of individual freedom.<p>
Lest I close on such a defiant note, let me just leave you by saying how much comfort it gives me to know that when it comes to this issue, as with so many others, we'll be able to count on our good friends at Cato.<p>
The coming months promise major battles with the liberals over spending, taxes, crime, education, the environment, welfare, property rights, and a hundred others.  And as always, Cato will be there for us, arming our legions of righteousness with facts, statistics, policy briefs, and four-color charts.<p>
For like the great man we are celebrating tonight, you have the boldness of honesty and the audacity of truth.  You believe, as he always reminded us, that true human progress lies not in power or planning, but in markets and the Rule of Law.  It is in these safeguards, and these alone, that we may dare hope to avoid the road to serfdom and "create a world of free men."<p>
Thank you.

<h2>Address by Congressman Dick Armey</h2>
<b>Conservative Political Action Conference<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
February 10, 1995</b><br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
Thank you, Wayne La Pierre, for that kind introduction.  What a pleasure it is to be here with all of my old friends at CPAC, the real heroes of the Second Reagan Revolution. And what a special pleasure to be a conservative at this exciting time in history.<p>  
Something dramatic is happening in this town.  I've never seen anything like it.  Democrats are falling all over each other to vote for smaller government, middle class tax cuts, the line-item veto, even a balanced budget amendment.  Dick Gephardt is talking about the flat tax.  And President Clinton is reportedly going to name an aircraft carrier the "USS Ronald Reagan."<p>
It all reminds me of that old liberal protest song, "The times, they are a-changin'."  Well, the times are changing, all right.  But not in the direction the liberals were hoping.<p>
America is moving forward, forward to the freedoms envisioned by our Founding Fathers.  Far from being some antiquated, outdated idea from the past, smaller government is really the newest and most radical idea in the long history of human politics.  And thanks to your grass-roots efforts, it's undergoing a long-overdue revival.<p>
I believe we are witnessing one of those great historical transitions when one era sets, and a new, more exciting era dawns, heralding undreamed-of possibilities.  It's a time when the American people are willing to rethink all the old assumptions and dare to entertain the most sweeping change, the kind of change contained in our Contract with America.<p>
Our Contract is based on a simple realization.  Big Government as an idea is finished.  Big Government does not work.  Only freedom works.  Whether the issue is poverty, crime, health care, education, or the environment, freedom offers a better outcome than does government.  How do I know freedom works?  Because you can't help noticing a difference between the Post Office and Federal Express.<p>  
How do I know freedom works?  Because in the 1980s this nation spent one-third more, in real terms, on government monopoly schools.  And test scores went down.  Meanwhile, private schools and even home-schooling parents are turning out Harvard material on shoestring budgets.<p>
How do I know freedom works?  Because 30 years and five trillion dollars in welfare spending have produced a permanent underclass, fatherless families, skyrocketing crime rates, and one out of every three babies being born out-of-wedlock.  Meanwhile, churches and charities are out there actually solving these problems and changing lives, at a fraction of the cost.  To paraphrase my friend and hero, Thomas Sowell, we don't have faith in freedom,
we have evidence.<p>
If you think about it, the Founding Fathers are still the world's only true progressives.  The socialists, the environmentalists, the multiculturalists, the labor-union monopolists, the so-called consumer advocates, the central planners of all stripes, these are the real reactionaries of our day.  Their idea of progress is more government control.  But George Washington's idea of progress was more freedom.  And that's the philosophy behind our Contract with America.  We firmly believe what Ronald Reagan said so many years ago:  "There is no such thing as a left or right.  There is only an up or down: up to man's age-old dream, the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order -- or down to the ant-heap of totalitarianism."<p>
Well, tonight, I'm happy to report that in these first, busy 38 days, America has begun slowly moving upward.  We've racked up win after win on our Contract.  We've picked up 50 to 70 Democrats on almost every bill.  Meanwhile, the left-wing liberals are, to quote that old Frank Sinatra song, "bewitched, bothered, and bewildered."<p>
On Day One, the longest opening day in the history of the House, we overhauled our rules from top to bottom.  To ensure accountability, we made Congress obey the same laws it imposes on the private sector.  We banned closed-door committee meetings and put an end to ghost voting.  To promote efficiency, we abolished dozens of committees and subcommittees,
cut out hundreds of staff positions, and swept away all those frivolous commemorative bills like "National Asparagus Day" and "Pizza and Pasta Week."  To keep ourselves honest, we reformed our budget terminology, so that from now on, the term "spending cut" will actually mean a cut, and not just a smaller increase.  And best of all, to safeguard the American taxpayer, we passed a rule requiring a three-fifths supermajority to raise income taxes.  And that was just Day One.<p>
Being federalists, naturally we've moved quickly to restore the proper balance of power between Washington and the states, with a bill that effectively bans unfunded federal mandates.  From now on, if Congress wants the sovereign states or private citizens to do something, Congress is going to have to provide the funds or just not do it.<p>
And because we believe the federal government should limit itself strictly to those activities which are truly national in scope, it was a distinct pleasure for us this week to present to President Reagan a very special birthday gift, the line-item veto.<p>
Perhaps the most deeply held conviction we conservatives cherish is a belief in self-restraint, national as well as personal.  We disdain government borrowing.  We reject President Roosevelt's famous quip that "we merely owe it to ourselves."  The truth of the matter is we're spending our children's inheritance.  Today's deficit is tomorrow's tax increase.  Right now, every child in America is carrying $18,000 in federal national debt.  And that's why, in my view, the crowning achievement of these first 38 days has been our passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution.<p>
Without this amendment, the focused and well-organized special interests will always be able to combine to defeat the widely dispersed and unfocused public interest.  Only if members of Congress have no legal choice but to set priorities, accept tradeoffs, and cut spending, can we resist the temptation to raid our posterity's piggy banks.<p>
Now, as you know, in passing the amendment, we lost the tax-limitation clause.  I was very, very disappointed.  But let me assure you.  We will return to fight another day on this issue.  We have already scheduled April 15, 1996, as the day we will vote on a tax-limitation amendment to the United States Constitution.<p>
And we've got plenty of other votes scheduled, too.  We have 62 more days to go.  And there are plenty of exciting changes in store.  Allow me to mention just a few.<p>
The crime problem is caused by criminals , not impersonal social forces.  So we'll pass a crime bill that funds more police and prisons, not basketball and ballet classes.<p>
Families are the fundamental unit of society.  They should have the first claim on their own hard-earned dollars.  So we'll vote to let families lower their yearly tax bill by $500 per child.	The economy is being strangled by excessive regulation.  So we'll vote on a sweeping regulatory reform bill to, in effect, legalize capitalism in the United States.<p>
The nation is saddled with too many lawsuits pleasing too many trial lawyers.  So we'll vote on a strong legal-reform bill that I call "Dan Quayle's revenge."<p>
The welfare system has become a source of out-of-wedlock births and family breakdown, which in turn promotes social breakdown, gangs, drugs, violence, and despair. We've been so busy imposing our idea of compassion, we've never bothered to stop and think of what effect our actions are having on young children.<p>  
So we'll vote on a sweeping Personal Responsibility Act that will abolish upwards of 70 existing federal welfare programs and entitlements, including the big one, AFDC.  Then we'll take the money this saves, cut it by ten percent, cap it, and send it back to the states with virtually no strings attached.  The only restrictions we'll put on the money are as follows: "You must spend it to help the needy.  You cannot give cash to unwed teenage mothers.  And you cannot give it to able-bodied people who refuse to work."  And that's it.  This is a "tough love" solution that really will end welfare as we know it.<p>
Finally, because the Founding Fathers would be shocked and dismayed by a Congress of politicians-for-life, we will hold the first-ever vote on term limits.  Now, I have to tell you this is going to be a tough fight.  Making term limits a reality will take all of our resources, and all of our energies, and every last drop of commitment we can muster.  And, as in the past, we do count on your help.<p>
Obviously, the Contract with America is not a timid document.  In fact, the Contract will do more to dismantle the welfare-regulatory state in 100 days than anything I've seen in my ten years in Congress.  But as President Reagan used to say, "You ain't seen nothin' yet."  It's after the first hundred days that the fun really begins.
<p>  
Come May, you will see some of the most dramatic changes in government anyone can remember.  We'll pass a huge 1996 budget resolution and 13 appropriations bills that I think you'll find very pleasing.  I can't give you all the details tonight, but, for starters, how does defunding the National Endowment for the Arts sound?  Not just cut, defund.  And what would you say if we privatized the Corporation for Public Broadcasting?  And let me ask you this.  What if we dismantled the Department of Education?  How about if we turned off the lights at the Department of Energy?  How about Commerce?  How about HUD?  How about the Post Office?  
<p>
And ladies and gentlemen, I would be remiss if I didn't mention farm subsidies, helium subsidies, Amtrak, mass transit, Davis-Bacon, Legal Services, the REA, the TVA, the EDA, the ICC, and the MPP.<p>  
And I'm not through yet.  Allow me to ask your opinion on one last thing.  Ladies and gentlemen, are you interested in scrapping the Internal Revenue Code and replacing it with a flat tax?<p>
As I've said all along, the Contract with America is merely the shakedown cruise for the Counter-Revolution.  Of course, in order to make the voyage, the ship must first make it safely out of port.  If we're going to achieve these sweeping reforms I just mentioned, we must first win the lasting trust of a rightly suspicious public.  And to do that, we must fulfill our Contract with America.  All our dreams, all our hopes for our children's future, hang on these next 62 days.<p>  
These are amazing times, when a whole new era is cresting the horizon.  And sweeping change is in the air.  Tonight, the course of freedom runs more swiftly, and our future shines more brightly, than we dared imagine just yesterday.<p>
Many years ago, when we conservatives were on the fringes of political life, in a speech that still rings in my memory, Barry Goldwater urged our fledgling forces to fight on, "until our cause has won the day, inspired the world, and shown the way to a tomorrow worthy of all our yesteryears."<p>
Well, my friends, we have won the day. We have inspired the world.  And tonight we have it in our power to make real, the tomorrow Barry Goldwater could only dare to dream.  So let us renew our resolve.  Let us quicken our pace. And arm in arm, we will secure the rebirth of freedom.<p>
Thank you, and God bless you.

<h2>Address by Congressman Dick Armey</h2>
<b>Conservative Leadership Conference<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
December 3, 1994<br></b>
</center>
<hr><p>
Thank you for that kind welcome.  What a pleasure it is to be here tonight, and in the company of such good friends.  And seeing you all here reminds me of that old Gene Autry song.  We're "back in the saddle again."<p>
Morton is too humble to tell you this, but my staff and I first began planning our strategy for a Republican majority last year down at Briar Patch, his mountain cabin.  I don't know whether it was the woods or the fresh air or Morton's well-stocked larder, or what -- but all I can say is: "Keep throwin' us in that Briar Patch."<p>
I hope you'll pardon me for looking tired.  As you might imagine, Newt and I are getting a lot less sleep these days.  It's not easy taking over the Congress, streamlining the House, and planning for the first hundred days -- when you can't have even a moment to fish.<p>
Of course, as exciting and gratifying as our victory is, we need to remember -- and this is important -- we didn't win power, we gained responsibility.  We have a lot of hard work ahead of us.  And so tonight, I want to spend a few moments with the people who have worked so hard to make this majority come true, reflecting on the meaning of what's happened -- and what we need to do.<p>
In this first midterm election of the post-Cold War era, Americans made it dramatically clear what they want.  They want a return to normalcy.  They want a restoration of the good, solid old values that made this country great: limited government, economic opportunity, and personal responsibility.  And so we have a clear mandate.  We go into this exciting new era with a very clear idea of which values are going to guide our actions.<p>
We also have a clear agenda.  The American people expect us to fulfill our end of the Contract with America.  And we will.  In the first hundred days, we will bring to the floor of the House ten very specific pieces of legislation, debate them, and vote on them in a fair and open process.  And let me say, I take this obligation very seriously.  I am fully aware that the future of my political Party depends on our performance between January 3rd and Good Friday of 1995.<p>
I've found that, in politics, you can either be a bitter disappointment or a pleasant surprise.  Well, we intend to be a pleasant surprise.  We intend to produce a persistent, steady stream of good news coming out of Washington for the average American.<p>
Instead of raising taxes, we're going to cut taxes.  Instead of writing new regulations, we're going to repeal old ones.  Instead of producing more dependency, we're going to encourage self-reliance.  Whether the issue is poverty, crime, education, the environment, or even equality of incomes, we believe freedom offers a better solution than does government.  My hope is that, as our solutions are enacted, and the good news gets out, it's going to start sinking in.  People are going to find themselves looking at one another in amazement and delight and say, "Wow, what's going on up there?"<p>
I know, Paul Weyrich, you've expressed concerns that the Contract doesn't go far enough.  And if the Contract were the extent of our agenda, I'd say the same thing.  But the Contract is just the beginning.  I call it the shakedown cruise for the counter-revolution.<p>
After all, the welfare-dependency state took more than a hundred days to build.  And replacing it with a conservative opportunity society will also take more than a hundred days.  Doubtless there will be setbacks.  Sometimes we'll lose a few yards.  Sometimes we'll score.  Sometimes we'll have to throw long.  But with discipline and hard work, day in and day out, I'm confident we'll reach our goal and move beyond big government.<p>
You know, the liberals are already giving away their game plan.  They obviously take us for rubes.  They think we're going to come in like Attila the Hun and try to sack the place in a massive frontal assault -- and, they hope, get ourselves thrown out in '96.<p>
Well, in a former life, I was a marathon runner, and I learned the painful way that sprinters don't finish marathons.  A good steady pace wins the prize.  So I hate to break the bad news to my liberal colleagues, but we do not view ourselves as a temporary strike force -- we are a permanent presence.<p>
We will wage a patient, well-planned, well-coordinated campaign to replace the welfare-dependency state with a conservative opportunity society, not in one futile assault, but brick by brick and stone by stone.<p>
Our source of strength is this.  We trust people.  We respect the sense and know-how of the American citizen.  We trust people to spend their own money and make their own decisions.  We trust the typical American family more than we trust a bureaucracy to know what is best for that family.  Just look around.  Ordinary men and women are capable of extraordinary things, if only we let them.  After all, America itself offers the most eloquent proof that free people can do great things.
But just as we respect people's freedom, we also understand that freedom requires personal responsibility.  It is character that makes freedom work.  And the essence of character is a love for the truth.  Truth, honesty, integrity -- these things matter.  Unfortunately, one of the reasons Americans are so disappointed with their elected officials is that, for too long, Washington has been a city in which powerful people could not be trusted with either words or numbers.<p>
Take, for example, the eighties.  In the 1980s, we were a successful and generous people.  As our incomes rose, so did our giving -- a record decade for personal philanthropy.  For the revisionists to call it a "decade of greed" is not only untrue, it robs us of our most precious possession -- our understanding of our own experience.  It's hard to make good public policy in the nineties unless we understand the truth about the eighties.<p>
Another example: "compassion."  When conservatives look at the facts and conclude that government-created dependency may be hurting people and tearing apart families and communities, many of whom are poor African Americans living in miserable circumstances, we're often told we lack compassion.  Well, compassion without understanding can be the cruellest thing of all.<p>
Back when I was still a professor at the university, we had a janitor named Charlie.  And although he was slightly mentally retarded, Charlie was a good man who did his job faithfully, and to my knowledge without complaint.  Well, one day they raised the minimum wage, and Charlie lost his job.  Doubtless they thought they were being compassionate.  But it seems to me part of having compassion for people is seeing their potential.<p>
Our first tool, then, will be our honesty.  Our second tool will be discipline.  For years, we conservatives have tried to reduce the size of government by taking on one program at a time, only to suffer huge casualties in a kind of budgetary trench warfare.  What we need is a new strategy that enables us to outflank the special interests entirely.<p>
And that's why, by February 6, I hope to dedicate to President Reagan two very special birthday presents: the balanced-budget amendment and the line-item veto.  These powerful new tools -- together with a ban on unfunded mandates and a constitutional requirement for a super-majority to raise taxes -- will transform the fundamental question Congress asks itself from "whether to cut" to "what to cut."  Having to set priorities will do more to shrink big government than a hundred individual floor fights.<p>
And because the biggest source of spending pressures is the desire of incumbents to ensure their reelection, we will move swiftly to hold a first-ever vote on term limits.  The American people overwhelmingly support term limits for a very sound reason.  Term limits are the surest way to prevent lawmakers from building personal empires with other people's money.<p>
Now, there's been some confusion about this in the press, so let me just clarify.  With Newt Gingrich as our Speaker, we will schedule a vote on term limits.  And I will do all in my power to persuade two-thirds of our colleagues to vote "yes."<p>
One of the least publicized, but most exciting, parts of our Contract is our prescription for reining in what I call the "invisible foot" of government.  Federal regulations cost the American economy six hundred billion dollars a year -- more than we spend on national defense and social welfare combined.  Yet you won't find these costs counted anywhere in the budget.<p>  
Well, our Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act includes three major reforms which strike fear into the heart of every radical environmentalist.  I'm speaking of the so-called "unholy trinity" of mandatory cost-benefit analysis, a regulatory budget, and compensation for "takings."  I don't want to make your eyes glaze over with the details, but the upshot will be a lot fewer harmful federal rules.
To give the economy a much-needed infusion of risk-taking, our job-creation bill cuts the capital gains tax in half and then ends the tax on illusory gains due only to inflation.  This policy is being called a sop to the rich.  But the truth is, any family that sells its home at a profit realizes a capital gain.  Most of the families that see a capital gain each year are firmly middle class.  Personally, I think we should leave capital gains untaxed altogether, as our international competitors do.  But this cut is an affordable down payment that will create jobs right away.<p>
And that's just the first of our proposed tax cuts.  Today, the typical American family pays 40 percent of its income in taxes -- more than it spends on food, shelter, and clothing combined.  To ease this burden, we want to let families keep a little more of their own money, with five hundred dollars per child taken off their yearly tax bill.  Incidentally, that five hundred dollars is the functional equivalent of a school choice voucher, because parents could use it to send their children to a non-government school.<p>
We'll also let folks save tax-free for that first home, a child's college tuition, or medical expenses.  And to further strengthen families, we want to provide generous tax relief to families who adopt a child or care for an elderly relative at home.<p>
But perhaps the most important thing we can do next year for America's families and for the future of our society is to address the growing crisis of out-of-wedlock births.  Today, three out of every ten births in America occur outside of marriage.  By the year 2000, four out of every ten births will be illegitimate, and among African Americans the rate will be a heart-breaking 75 percent.<p>
Our Personal Responsibility Act would try to end the perverse incentives we've created through our welfare system by channeling welfare and housing benefits away from unwed teenage mothers into block grants which the states would use to give assistance -- but not cash -- to young, fatherless children.<p>
What would this mean?  It would mean young people will tend to exercise more personal responsibility.  And those who find themselves in a difficult situation will be more likely to turn to the traditional "safety net" institutions -- family, friends, churches and private charities -- which will grow stronger when no longer displaced by government charity.  But the biggest beneficiaries will be the children themselves, who will be more likely to have the blessing of two loving parents in the home.<p>
And as I said before, the first hundred days is only the beginning.  We envision -- and we will work for -- a day when every family can send their children to the school of their choice.  We will work for a day when consumers can buy food without having to pay a special surcharge to the government.  And we will work for a day when any young person, of any color or creed, can grow up to fulfill his or her God-given potential in an America with the freest, the most open, and the most productive economy on earth.<p>
Well, I could go on all night, but I know Morton would have my hide.  So I'll just conclude with this thought.<p>
Some of you here can trace your roots to the Goldwater campaign.  And others came in with Ronald Reagan.  And still others of you have joined our ranks only recently.  Well, no matter when we came to the cause, we are all in this room tonight because we've devoted ourselves to a vision.<p>
We see Ronald Reagan's shining city on a hill as more than a fanciful image or a bygone way of life.  It is always before our mind's eye as the America we cherish and dream of, the America we want for our children, the America we strive to be.<p>
This election has given us the best opportunity in our lifetimes to build and strengthen that shining city.  If we do our jobs right over the next two years, if we show determination and discipline and courage and sacrifice, we will not only succeed, we will have redeemed all those years of patient labor spent working for this day.  With your support, with your patience, and with your prayers, I know our ideals will be "back in the saddle" for a good long time.<p>
Thank you.

Today the craft  of film-making is awe inspiring, but the sensibility is often pernicious.  Take three leading contenders for Oscars, The English Patient, The People  vs. Larry Flynt and Evita. All three films display adroit writing, acting  and editing. And all three use the bedazzling tricks of Hollywood to gain  audience sympathy for scoundrels.</P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  The English Patient presents us with a handsome count in North Africa who,  as World War II approaches, seduces a friend's wife (and much of the theater  audience). When they are nearly killed by her jealous husband, the count  leaves her wounded in the desert to get help. He is arrested mistakenly  by the British, kills an innocent guard and then, to get a plane to return  him to his lover, offers precious maps of the desert to the Germans, helping  to doom thousands of British soldiers. The person after whom the story  is modeled, Count Almasy, was in fact a spy for the Nazis and later the  Soviets. Yet there were many wet eyes at the end of the film about this  irresponsible relativist. After all, who are we to judge such a romantic  figure?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  A hero's mantle from the costume racks also magically transforms Hustler  magazine publisher, Larry Flynt. No pander was ever half so endearing as  actor Woody Harrelson portrays Flynt. Gloria Steinhem for once has it right:  The real-life Flynt earns his millions by degrading women, in some cases  celebrating violence done to them. In an apparently successful effort to  disarm viewers, the film almost admits as much, but we are supposed to  be charmed.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Businessman Flynt uses the First Amendment strictly to protect his production  of salable sex, but the film offers him up as a rustic champion of a robust  Constitution, just a little left of Tom Paine. Could manipulated theatergoers,  like the woman seated behind me, who exclaimed loudly that the film was  the &quot;best movie I have ever seen,&quot; be made to feel the same about  a film toasting pedophilia or bestiality?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Very possibly so, because the point of the Flynt film is that the First  Amendment is absolute and that those who constantly extend the plumbing  of its depths deserve not just legal toleration and fat bank accounts,  but also the public's thanks. Understandably, the real Larry Flynt, however  rich, is used to being a social pariah. But a few days ago he was invited  onto a national TV talk show and was delighted--and amazed-- by the immense  ovation that greeted him. Hollywood has lionized another skunk.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Then there is Evita. This is the film with a screenplay co-authored by  Oliver Stone, who has done so much for bogus history in JFK and Nixon.  It arguably is the worst film of the three exactly because its lying is  the most persuasive. Stuffed with rolls of cinematic gauze, the satirical  bite of Andrew Lloyd Webber's original stage musical is reduced to gumming.  In the lyrics of Tim Rice an echo of sarcasm remains, but it is lost in  the visual schmaltz. Imagery and music easily drown out words in a film  whose makers have fallen in love with the villains.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Oh, people are shown getting beaten up by the Peronistas and there is a  sly allusion (but only that) to Juan Peron's similarities to Benito Mussolini.  But you would have to guess that the Perons themselves were responsible  for the beatings and murders, and you would hardly imagine that the Italians  who pelted Eva with eggs during her visit to Rome did so because Juan Peron  had been an outspoken admirer of Il Duce and Der Fuehrer. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  In the film there is no disclosure that the Perons were anti-Semitic or  that they welcomed up to 15,000 escaping Nazis at the close of World War  II, raking in untold millions in gold from them. The Perons' economic policies--in  the film, an amusing redistribution of wealth from the stuffy privileged  classes--resulted in long term financial desolation for all classes. At  one time living standards in Argentina rivaled Canada's. Thanks largely  to the Perons, Argentina sank to third world status.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  But in today's Hollywood, Eva Peron's sins are washed away and restored  as 90's virtues. Her sexual power-seeking warrants admiring chuckles; what  pluck! On screen, she is a Latin feminist, seizing authority from hidebound  men who don't realize that glamour has a right to rule. Her propaganda  lines and staged humility (&quot;I only bring the people to the heart of  Peron!&quot;) no longer ring hollow, as in Andrew Lloyd Webber's play.  They chime cheerily to a generation of movie-goers who know little of fascism.  The film's violence is just an exotic backdrop for Webber's operatic themes  and Madonna's fashion parade.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Indeed, Madonna is the perfect vehicle for Oliver Stone's mock-populist  revisionism. Perhaps we can see her next as poor, misunderstood Lady Mac  Beth, and after that the noted &quot;Renaissance woman,&quot; Lucretia  Borgia. Then she can rehabilitate that suffering citizen of revolutionary  France, Madame Lafarge.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  There are so many historical and fictional rascals left, each of whose  appearance needs to be uplifted by Hollywood's celluloid implants.<BR>  <BR>  </FONT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Bruce Chapman is president of Seattle-based Discovery  Institute.

At least one early morning  a week, you will find George Benson, 78, down on the waterfront picking  up trash along the tracks or over at the car barn shining glass lenses  on the headlamps of the city's vintage streetcars. <BR>  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Why such devotion? &quot;It's my baby!&quot; George  exclaims. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Indeed, it is. Back in 1974 Councilman Benson had the idea that Seattle  should retrieve part of its abandoned transportation heritage, streetcars.  Not &quot;trolleys&quot; that run on wires, mind you, but real streetcars  that run on tracks. Like other American cities, Seattle once had an intricate  web of them, including an &quot;Interurban&quot; that could take you to  Everett or Tacoma in about the time you can make it now in an auto at rush  hour. The automotive lobby long ago seduced Seattle and most other cities  into abandoning streetcars, and only in recent years have modern variations  on the old theme begun to return to fashionability. But rare are the lucky  burgs with old fashioned, strap-hanging, bell-clanging streetcars. New  Orleans. Philadelphia. San Francisco, of course.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  And, thanks to George Benson, Seattle. On one short line from the Myrtle  Edwards Park at the north end of the waterfront, along Alaska Way to Pioneer  Square and on to the International District, Metro operates five beautifully  restored vehicles that together carry nearly 500,000 passengers a year.  Many passengers take advantage of Seattle's general policy of free transit  within downtown (a policy also dating to the '70's). But another large  group--177,971, to be exact--are paying customers, most of them tourists  taking in the sights.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  There were other municipal advocates of a new/old streetcar route back  in 1974. But it was George Benson, the enthusiast, who persevered with  such detailed attention that all obstacles (lack of local car stock, the  need for businesses to support a local improvement district, safety concerns,  and on and on) gradually were overcome--after only eight and a half years  of effort.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  I was one of George's colleagues on the Council, and now I am an occasional  customer of his streetcars, which I find ideal for showing visitors our  town. So when we talked at a recent dinner for former and present Council  members, I told Geroge I had a dream that I bet he shared: to extend the  current one-way, back and forth route into a loop. With a loop line, passengers  could expand the current trip to the waterfront, Pioneer Square, the Kingdome  and the International District into a grander tour of downtown, adding  the Municipal and County buildings, the financial district, the art museum,  the forthcoming symphony hall, hotels, and shopping opportunities around  Westlake Mall and the Convention Center, followed by a jaunt across the  newly trendy Denny Regrade to Seattle Center before heading back to the  waterfront for another loop.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  I was right. George lit up like a streetcar beacon. A loop route is his  secret passion. We have been talking precise routes ever since. It's a  game anyone can play, so readers are invited to share their concepts, too.  But in this game there are a couple of rules. For one, these streetcars  cannot go down a steep incline, so east-west routes in the center of our  hilly downtown won't work. For another, many motorists are made nervous  by the strangeness of a streetcar next to them, so a new route should not  cram streetcars and autos too closely together. Beyond all, safety must  prevail. People are used to dodging cars, but not streetcars--despite the  ringing bells.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  It isn't hard to find fault with the idea. Because so many passengers travel  free, the present route doesn't pay for itself directly. (Of course, neither  do buses downtown.) A loop route might attract still more passengers, but  it is hard to see it breaking even under present pricing arrangements.  Also, the Engineering Department, which must guide any new development,  is anxious about congestion that may eventuate as new tracks head back  through busy north/south avenues.<BR>  A little imagination and Bensonian grit in the current city leadership  might help at this point. Perhaps the streetcar route could go through  the bus tunnel under Third Avenue. Perhaps a little longer trip at the  north end of a loop, along Denny Way past the Pacific Science Center to  Bay Street, would provide a sufficiently gradual grade to assure streetcar  traction. Perhaps the relatively high ridership of the system would allow  its integration into the new regional and intermodal transit plan and help  cover startup costs.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Certainly a streetcar loop would be popular with visitors, and, in fact,  maybe all of us who use it should--on this one downtown run--pay the going  cost. To have the pleasure of getting from one attractive destination to  another on an easy-to-comprehend streetcar loop would make Seattle's downtown  even more appealing, especially in the rain--for locals as well as tourists.  Starting, of course, with George Benson.</FONT></P>  <P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  <B>Bruce Chapman is president of Seattle-based Discovery Institute.

<H2>WHY WE NEED TO OVERHAUL<BR>
OUR ADVERSARIAL LEGAL SYSTEM
</H2>
<H4><I>By Roberta R. Katz<BR>
(Copyright 1996 by Roberta R. Katz)</I>
</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It's a great honor for me to be standing up here today. I've spent several
years now thinking, and then writing, about legal reform, but this is the
<B>first </B>time I have publicly shared some of my thoughts with such a
large audience of businesspeople.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here's a short preview of what I will spend the next 20 minutes talking
about. I intend to show you why legal reform issues are deadly serious for
this country, why the adversary system of justice is no longer a fully functional
system, and why you -- whoever you are -- need to get personally involved
in the resolution of these legal refon-n issues.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My own interest in this topic goes back to my law-firm days, when the anthropologist
in me began to sense some kind of shift taking place. It was not just that
clients had become so vocal about high legal costs. Or that lawyers were
now the butt of so many jokes and cartoons. Or even that many of my fellow
lawyers had become so aggressive and crude in how they practiced law. No,
what I was sensing was far more troubling to me. It was an awareness that
an increasing amount of the high-priced work we lawyers were doing was just
about process, and not about substance. In other words, the clients were
paying for more and more icing, and less and less cake.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It has taken me several years to figure out the real cause of this problem.
The easy answer would have been to say that it's all the fault of greedy
lawyers. During the 1980s, when the money was rolling into the law fin-ns,
a relative few lawyers did get greedy. I'm sure you've read articles about
lawyers who prolonged cases, padded bills, exploited the system and otherwise
adopted dishonest means of bilking their clients and society. But contrary
to the popular view, in my experience the majority of lawyers are honest
and hardworking. And they are as confused and troubled as nonlawyers over
what is happening to their profession.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Confused and troubled. That could describe just about everyone these days.
And this is because we are living in revolutionary times. Remember in your
student days, when you learned about the Industrial Revolution? The move
off the farms, the break-up of extended families, the grimy factories, the
blight of the cifies? This history generally evoked pity for our forebears,
and relief that we were living in more stable times. But the fact is, that
with the dawning of the Information Age we are going through just as much,
if not more, change in our lives as were those troubled souls in the early
19th century. Because we are living it, putting one foot in front of the
other each day as we try to raise our children and do our jobs, it's hard
to put our individual problems in the broader context. This is big-time
social change we are experiencing, but big-time social change, when you
are living it rather than reading about it, necessarily comes slowly, in
stages.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recently there has been an acknowledgment of the need for fundamental changes
in many of our social institutions. Our businesses were the first place
these fundamental changes were accepted. Following the widespread introduction
of computing technology into private businesses, it became clear that we
needed to organize workers differently. Teams began to replace top-down
management structures. Bosses began to come out of their offices and manage
by walking around. Restructuring and reengineering became the norin rather
than the exception.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now it's also become clear to most people that our schools need fundamental
changes. It no longer sounds radical to speak about individualized learning
using the computer, or about changing the classroom setting to have greater
focus on teamwork, and less focus on the teacher as the only source of learning.
These organizational changes in the educational context, like the organizational
changes pervading businesses, are directly the result of our bigger move
as a culture from a factory-based mindset to an infonnation-based mindset.<BR>
<BR>
So what kind of similar organizational changes are happening in the legal
context? Very, very few. It seems that while we can accept major change
in our businesses and our schools, we consider our legal system to be more
sacrosanct. The courts are, after all, a key part of the bedrock foundation
of our society. Fundamental organizational change in our legal system feels
like it could threaten the core of our democratic ways.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But here's the irony. It's actually our refusal to implement fundamental
change in our legal system that could bring down the whole house. Let me
explain why.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Until this decade, I think most Americans considered their courts to be
places where justice would generally be served. There was a basic belief
that if a wrong had occurred, our court system would redress that wrong
and restore a balance. In the popular media, Perry Mason was the personification
of that faith in our court system. We believed that through incisive questioning,
a good lawyer could ferret out the truth, expose the bad guy, reward the
good guy, and serve justice. Yes, sometimes there were mistakes, but by
and large, for most people the system worked.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, today, a growing number of people believe that our justice
system is unreliable at best and a total farce at worst. Moreover, among
those who are con-fing to share that belief are people who see the system
from the inside: lawyers, judges, and legal scholars. For example, two years
ago, Bill Ide, who was then the President of the American Bar Association,
said this to the ABA membership (and I quote):<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Legal institutions created many years ago weren't designed to handle
the complex issues and burdensome caseloads we routinely see in our courtrooms.
What is needed today is nothing short of a revolution in our administration
of justice.... We must remember that it is the existence of and public confidence
in the legal system that has kept our nation at peace with itself. ... Should
the public confidence be lost in the government to be fair and equitable
through our justice system, we will only be sowing and nurturing the seeds
of a real revolution that no one wants.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Those were strong words stated over two years ago from an influential person.
And yet, as far as I can tell, they have inspired virtually nothing in the
way of &quot;revolutionary change&quot; in our legal system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a cultural anthropologist whose research focussed on social change, I
have observed that serious social change issues typically smolder quietly
until there is an unexpected event that sparks a bigger fire that results
in change. It may well be that the O.J. Simpson trial has been that event
as applied to changes in our legal system. If nothing else, that trial allowed
a wide spectrum of Americans to see what life inside our court system is
like today. And many of those who watched were appalled, not necessarily
by the outcome but by the process. The endless bickering. The game playing.
The withholding of important infon-nation from the jury. It just didn't
seem right, when all was said and done.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problem, as ABA-President Ide realized, is that when people no longer
believe that their justice system will reliably dispense justice, they take
matters into their own hands. And that is exactly what is beginning to happen
today. At one end of the spectrum, we have the growth of what is called
&quot;alternative dispute resolution,&quot; or &quot;ADR&quot; for short.
ADR is basically a private justice system. Under ADR, two disputing parties
will agree to avoid the courts and go to a private decisionmaker to end
their dispute. It is growing dramatically in popularity, especially in the
business context.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the other end of the spectrum, however, a more frightening event is occurring.
Some groups, such as the militias, have simply written off our established
justice system and substituted their own &quot;peoples' courts.&quot; Similarly,
even within our established courts, a growing number of j@es are simply
ignoring the confusing evidence presented to them and making their decisions
on bases that have little or nothing to do with the facts of the case.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate cure for this problem is not easy. In my view, to cure the
problem in our legal system we will have to do a substantial overhaul of
the adversary system. Yes, I said overhaul. I know this sounds bold, maybe
even heretical, but stop to think about it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The adversary system is about two sides of a dispute being able to tell
their respective stories to a jury. In other words, it's all about information.
That's why we haveinterrogatories, depositions, and testimony at trial --
the purpose is to get information to the decision-makers so that they can
make an infon-ned decision.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the adversary system in practice today is remarkably similar to the
adversary system that was created in England at the dawning of the Industrial
era. (And let me add here that the adversary system was itself the result
of a legal reform movement that occurred in response to abuses occurring
in pre-Industrial England, when defendants were not allowed to testify in
their own defense.) Now, as then, there were a plaintiff and defendant,
each <B>with </B>their lawyers, a judge, and jury, and the various rules
of procedure and of evidence.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But think how different the rest of our lives are. When the adversary system
was bom, information was simple and relatively sparse. This was before the
time of widespread publishing or broadcasting, before the time we became
specialized into so many different types of business endeavors. This was
also a time when communities were small and relatively cohesive, unlike
today, when we often don't even know the names of our next-door neighbors.
It was certainly before the days of technical expert witnesses (especially
hired technical expert witnesses), laboratory tests, statistical analyses,
and all the other exhaustive and exhausting paraphernalia of modem trials.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To our collective credit, I believe the adversary system served us fairly
well throughout the Industrial era. But now that we are well into the Information
Age, now that we are participating in a global economy fueled by high tech,
that system is clogging up. That's why we now find interrogatories over
100 pages long, and jurors that are hopelessly lost in the face of highly
technical evidence, and depositions that last for weeks, and trials that
are delayed for years. That's why we have come to a point that our legal
processes, far from serving justice, are actually thwarting justice.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Please don't misunderstand me. My criticism in this respect is not directed
at the new technologies. Far from it -- as you might guess from my present
employment, I am genuinely excited about the changes that the Information
Age is bringing us. Rather, my point is that the legal system is not employing
the new technologies in an intelligent maimer. Just because we now have
word processors and copying machines instead of typewriters and carbon paper
doesn't mean that it is wise for us to be drafting 100 page legal documents.
An excess of information, especially when that excess leads to manipulation,
is every bit as harmful to justice as is a lack of information.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
How might we overhaul the adversary system? Here are a few examples that
would apply with respect to civil disputes. First, let's make sure that
civil disputes involving highly technical information are decided by jurors
who themselves are experts. This would avoid the junk science and battles
of the experts that today thoroughly confuse lay jurors.<BR>
Second, let's create more systems that are designed to resolve certain harms
without any adversarial process -- much like we treat workers' compensation
and no-fault insurance claims today.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And, third, let's acknowledge that in the age of specialization, our courts
of general jurisdiction are inefficient. We need more specialized courts,
which will be staffed by judges and administrators who are knowledgeable
in the court's subject matter. Today we have the Tax and Bankruptcy Courts.
Why not create a Business Court? Or a Personal Injury Court? Or an Environmental
Court? For lawyers, the era of the general practitioner ended at least 10
years ago, and today the bar is divided into well over 20 different areas
of expertise. If law and lawyers have had to specialize to reflect our society's
broader reality, why haven't we demanded that our courts and our legal procedures
make the same adaptation?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I know that overhauling the adversary system is not something to be undertaken
lightly. The effort must begin at the highest levels of our state and federal
judiciaries, and constitutional principles must be protected. This is a
most serious job for our courts, but I believe that there is no choice.
To ignore the ugly realities of our present-day legal system is to assure
the ultimate breakdown of that system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To cure our problems, it is also high time to rethink the professional role
of lawyers if lawyers are going to be useful to our society in the Information
age. We need to dramatically revise our law school curricula, starting right
now, in order to teach our young lawyers to be problem solvers rather than
problem creators. In a world of diverse cultures, which is where we inevitably
will be spending more and more of our time in the future, an adversarial
mindset is a liability, not an asset. We need to teach our lawyers how to
facilitate communication, and we need to stop teaching them that human affairs
are always win/lose. In the Information age, we will need our best thinkers,
many of whom are lawyers, to be focussing on how to create win/win solutions
to problems.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And that's where each of you also comes in. Don't forget: as paying customers
of lawyers, you have a right to make things better. And I think you also
have a responsibility to make make things better. Are you using the legal
system as a competitive tool, sort of for blackmail, trying to defeat your
foes through weak legal claims? Do you assume that the only way to solve
your problems is through your lawyers, or do you try to solve things more
creatively, without threatening a lawsuit? Do you instruct your lawyers
to be aggressive and overreaching or do you urge them to be pragmatic and
cooperative on your behalf? Most importantly, do you stay involved when
you use a lawyer's services, or do you just let the lawyer dictate the outcome
of your case?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My point here is that lawyers don't operate in a vacuum. They work for you,
and not vice versa. As the client, it is your interests, not your lawyer's,
that are at stake. And every time you misuse -- or condone the misuse --
of the legal system, every time you take advantage of the sorry state of
our adversary system today, you exacerbate the problem. So take this as
a reminder that there are often many better -- and cheaper -- ways to solve
problems than through lawyers and courts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I also urge you to support legal reform efforts. The securities-abuse legislation
that was recently passed over President Clinton's veto is one exwnple, but
there are many other tort-reform bills still before our federal and state
legislators. The media has positioned these bills as business-versus-consumer,
but this misses the whole point. These bills are about stopping some of
the procedural excesses I talked about before. In that respect, they are
only temporary fixes to the adversary-system problems, but they are fixes
nonetheless. Until we can overhaul this old, tired adversary system to meet
the needs of the Information Age, the best we can do is put some temporary
fixes in place. Without them, our faith in our legal system to deliver justice
will surely be further eroded. So these are the ideas I am working on in
my project at Discovery Institute. These are the marching orders I think
we need to give our society if we are to change the adversarial system before
it self-destructs and takes us with it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To judges: participate in streamlining the adversary system. We need a major
overhaul of our procedures, all the way down to revamping the way our courts
of general jurisdiction are organized.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To legislators: set up new incentives in law to promote prompt and more
just resolution of disputes, including through passage of tort reform legislation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To law schools: revise the law school curricula, so that the emphasis is
placed on dispute resolution rather than on adversarial combat.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To lawyers: recognize that these changes are necessary if the profession
is going to play any kind of useful role in the Information Age. One reason
so many lawyers are unhappy today is that even they are already questioning
the value of what they do.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And to all of us in general: take personal responsibility for helping to
restore justice and balance to our legal system. Stop condoning the use
of the system for extortion and abuse, and participate in the transition
that is ahead of us. Legal reform is not something to fear; it is something
to welcome. Given the legal system's foundation role in our culture, there
is simply no way to have profound technological and social change occurring
all around us and not change the legal system to adapt to those other changes.
Our mutual goal is to make that change as painless as possible.<BR>

Lewis Perelman, a Senior Fellow of Discovery Institute, is one of the nation's
top authorities on education and training. His advocacy of high technology
in the restructuring of what he has called <B>The Learning Enterprise</B>
is expressed in his book, <A HREF="schlsout.html"><B><I>School's Out: Hyperlearning,
the New Technology and the End of Education</I> </B></A>. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman, president of Kanbrain Institute, has provided strategic consulting
advice since 1983 to public and private policymakers concerned with technology,
institutional change, human resource, and economic development issues. His
private consulting clients have included IBM, Apple Computer, National Computer
Systems, Hay Group, Ashton-Tate, L.F. Rothschild, National Education Corp.,
the Edison Electric Institute, and other companies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman is the author of the best-selling book <I>School's Out</I> (William
Morrow &amp; Co., 1992; Avon Books, 1993) a study of restructuring education
and training sponsored by twelve U.S. corporations and foundations. He has
produced several other publications on training and education, including
the widely discussed Briefing Papers, <I>&quot;Closing Education's Technology
Gap&quot;</I> (November 1989) and <I>The Acanemia' Deception</I> (April
1990). His report for Hudson Institute's Workforce 2000 project, <I>The
American Learning Enterprise in Transition</I>, was published by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (1990). <BR>
<BR>
Perelman coined the phrase <B>The Learning Enterprise</B> to describe the
total universe of education and training in a report with that title published
by the Council of State Planning Agencies in 1985. And his study for the
Western Governors' Association, Human Capital Investment for State Economic
Development (1989), was the first attempt to chart the entire &quot;portfolio&quot;
of a state's many investments in human resource development. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman's work in education, training, technology, and economic policy
has been widely discussed in the national press, cited in legislative testimony,
and used in university courses. He has made speeches and presentations of
his work before numerous audiences throughout the United States and in Europe
and Pacific Asia, both live and on radio and television broadcasts. He also
has testified before Congressional, state, and local legislative committees
as well as executive boards and commissions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Currently an adjunct fellow of the Discovery Institute, from 1981 to 1983
Perelman was a director in the corporate planning department of Holiday
Corp. in Memphis. From 1979 to 1981, he was a senior scientist in the Social
Systems Group at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In 1980 he was a visiting
scientist at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. Previously
he held positions at the federal Solar Energy Research Institute, and at
the Colorado Highway Department. He taught physics and mathematics in public
schools in New York and California, and has taught graduate courses at the
Harvard Graduate School of Education and the George Mason University School
of Business Administration. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman's first book, <I>The Global Mind</I> (Mason/Charter, 1976), was
cited one of the year's best scientific-technical books by the Library Journal.
Perelman's writing has appeared in such major publications as <I>Business
Week, Forbes ASAP, WIRED, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The
Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, Success, Insight, </I>and
the <I>French magazine ACTUEL, a</I>s well as professional journals such
as <I>TIMS Studies in the Management Sciences, New Management, Strategic
Planning Management, Planning Review, Human Capital, and Ethics</I>. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman earned his doctorate in administration, planning, and social policy
at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. He graduated cum laude with
a B.S. in mathematics from the City College of New York, where he was elected
to Phi Beta Kappa. He did graduate study in space and atmospheric physics
and applied mathematics at the Goddard Institute and at the Harvard Division
of Engineering and Applied Physics. Perelman resides and works in Washington,
DC. <BR>

Thank you for coming. My name  is Philip Gold. I do Discovery's defense and national security work. In  fact, I'm the only person at Discovery who does defense work, so it's always  a treat when I get a chance to talk to somebody besides myself.</P>  <P>As you know, one of the special things about Discovery is that nearly  all of us have multidisciplinary backgrounds and many of us work in more  than one field. Mark Plummer, whom you just heard, does our environmental  work, but he's also an economist. Roberta Katz, who will do the next presentation,  is a high-tech lawyer with a doctorate in anthropology. I also have two  fields: national security and American culture, specifically, life after  the Culture Wars. So when I'm not worrying defense, I'm the resident feminist,  deep ecologist, psychobabble expert, and general purpose postmodernism  guru. I used to think it was kind of a schizophrenic way to make a living,  but now I realize it's more manic-depressive . . . manic referring to the  Pentagon, depressive describing the state of our culture. Or perhaps depressive  describes the Pentagon, and manic refers to the culture.</P>  <P>In any event, I've been asked to predict the next four years in defense  and national security. In one sense, that's impossible. Four years is an  eternity in this Age of Instant Everything, of policies too often based  on CNN inputs and MTV outputs. And, of course, nothing ever gets done unless  it's a crisis or a scandal, preferably both, and nowadays the American  people have hundreds to choose from. In fact, if you believe the surveys,  more Americans are worried about space aliens than national defense.</P>  <P>But in another sense, predicting the future of defense is the easiest  thing in the world. Just think of it as a Seattle weather forecast &shy;  more of the same unless it changes, rain turning to showers, and if you  don't like what you see, just wait fifteen minutes. Something else will  come along. For those preferring a less rosy scenario, I refer you to Mr.  Murphy, and to the First Codicil of Murphy's Law:</P>  <P>Murphy was an optimist.</P>  <P>But at a more serious level &shy; and defense is a serious, a deadly  serious business &shy; I would suggest that, absent a war or a major catastrophe,  these are the years the locust are going to eat. We will waste them arguing  secondary to non-issues, on infighting and turf battles at home, and abroad  on that peculiarly American version of the Politics of Feeling Good about  Yourself, Global Style . . . that odd array of activities, from military  social work to shooting cruise missiles, by which we periodically demonstrate  our resolve to demonstrate our resolve. And I don't think the situation  would be much different, were Bob Dole getting ready to move into the White  House.</P>  <P>We need to get beyond this. So I'd like to take the Discovery approach  &shy; looking farther into the future and farther into the past, in order  to get a better sense of what's happening and what needs to be done. Such  a look, farther into the future and farther into the past, yields the central  proposition of this talk:</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>The Age of the Wars of Ideology is over. The Age  of the Wars of Terror and Identity has begun. What are we going to do about  it, and how do we prepare for it?</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>To get at this, I would like to look generally at three sets of propositions  and recognitions:</P>  <P>1) American national security policy is decadent. And again, this is  not a partisan issue. It wouldn't be that different under a Dole administration.</P>  <P>2) There is now a conceptual basis for a nondecadent security policy,  and sufficient coherence to turn that policy into strategy.</P>  <P>3) That nondecadent strategy can be supported militarily, provided certain  long-term trends and opportunities are recognized.</P>  <P>After that, I should like to make ten recommendations for the funding  and structuring of the 21st century military.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>American National Security Policy Is Decadent.</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>I use the word here in two ways. First, in the literal Latin meaning,  <I>decadere</I>, a falling-away, with the implication of a falling-away  from some previous standard. I also use the word in the way Robert Adams,  a literary critic, used it in a few years ago in a book entitled, <I>Decadent  Societies</I>. He defined lowest-common-denominator decadence as &quot;the  deliberate neglect of the essentials of self-preservation.&quot; In both  senses, the word describes the state of American security policy.</P>  <P>The falling-away here is from a previous standard of coherence and purpose.  Through most of the 20th century, American security policy has been both  coherent and purposeful. Sometimes it was not especially realistic &shy;  making the world safe for democracy didn't quite come up to code &shy;  but as for the unconditional surrender of the Axis and the containment  of Soviet communism: Missions Accomplished.</P>  <P>But today, we are told, incessantly told, no such coherence is possible.  This is the New World Disorder, everything is crazy, we have to wait until  it sorts itself out. But it already has sorted itself out. It is very coherent.  To repeat:</P>  <P>The Age of the Wars of Ideology is over. The Age of the Wars of Terror  and Identity has <I>begun.</I></P>  <P>Of course, parts of this new era may not affect or concern us. And American  foreign policy should not be militarized. Our overall policy should be  based upon that supplication in the 1928 Episcopal <I>Book of Common Prayer</I>  where we ask to stand ready &quot;to do good to all men, according to our  abilities and opportunities.&quot; Promoting democracy and human rights,  women's rights and responsible environmentalism, advancing American trade  and strengthening the community of nations, these should be our goals.  Nonetheless, two clear and present dangers have emerged. And if they have  not taken traditional nation-state forms, they are still far from incoherent.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><UL>  <UL>    <LI><I>Weapons of Mass Destruction</I> (WMD) nuclear, biological, chemical,    and high-power conventional, in the hands of those who wish us ill, whether    nation-states, subnational groups, supranational movements, criminals,    terrorist organizations, even individuals. The people I talk to who work    in this field, at both the policy and operational levels, tell me it's    no longer a matter of if WMD will be used against the American homeland.    It's a matter of when. And that use may well occasion the greatest carnage    on this continent since the Civil War.    <LI><I>Violent Expansionist Islamic Fundamentalism</I>. And let's be very    clear here about what we mean. The enemy is not Islam, which is one of    the world's great faiths. Islam has its gracious and humane side, and has    given the world countless cultural treasures. Nor is the enemy the people    of Islam, any more than the Russian people were the enemy during the Cold    War. Nor is the enemy Islamic fundamentalism <I>per se</I>, even though    many of its practices, especially regarding women, may strike us as ludicrous    to abhorrent. Islamic fundamentalism only becomes the enemy when it turns    expansionist and violent, when it spreads its violence across the globe,    alone and in concert with other nations, groups, movements, and criminal    elements. And we must understand that the enmity of Islamic fundamentalism    is now based upon more than American support of Israel, or our historic    (and not always comfortable) relations with &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;modernizing&quot;    Islamic regimes. It is also based upon a profound detestation of much of    American culture. Some weeks ago, the Iranian government announced the    development of an &quot;Islamic Barbie Doll,&quot; wearing Islamic clothing    and accompanied by a &quot;Ken&quot; doll, dressed as a clerical student.    It sounds ridiculous, but I wouldn't want to be debating a devout Muslim    and have to defend some of the values associated with old Ken and Barbie.    And we do well to remember that some of the condemnations thundered forth    twenty years ago (Has it been that long?) by the Ayatollah Khomeini were    also being voiced by Alexander Solzhenitsyn.  </UL></UL><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>A Nondecadent Security Policy Is Now Possible and  Necessary.</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>In his history of the Second World War, Winston Churchill called the  1930s &quot;The Gathering Storm.&quot; A storm is gathering again. In fact,  any nondecadent security policy begins with recognition of two gathering  storms: one related to the global proliferation of WMD, the other to violent  expansionist Islamic fundamentalism. Recall those maps so popular during  the Cold War, showing the spreading of communism &shy; the areas shaded  red, the arrows thrust outwards. Imagine such a map of violent Islamic  fundamentalism. The countries already gone (Iran, Libya, Sudan, Afghanistan),  the violent allies (Iraq, Syria), the countries endangered and pressured:  Algeria, Egypt, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the Islamic areas of Russia.</P>  <P>This recognition of gathering storms, however, can lead in two directions.  One points, as it did in the 1930s, toward denial of the coherence and  imminence of the threat. It points toward a multiplicity of evasions: endless  studies and commissions, counter-terrorism by press conference, business-as-usual,  and the spurious either/or's &shy; defense versus civil liberties, for  example &shy; by which we too often manage to avoid the obvious. The other  way points toward the making of a decision which Americans have made three  times in the 20th century:</P>  <P>Not to withdraw from the world's violence. Not to try to live, as the  theologian Reinhold <I>Niebuhr once put it, as an &quot;island of relative  security in the middle of a global</I> hell.&quot;</P>  <P>But this time, there is a difference. When America made this decision  in the World Wars, the continental homeland was safe. When Americans made  this decision in the Cold War - certainly in the Cold War's second half  - the threat was so overwhelming that little could be done save to trust  in deterrence and hope for the best. This time, the American homeland is  vulnerable. And if the United States chooses to continue to exercise global  leadership, and especially to act in Islamic areas, <B>we're going to get  hit</B>.</P>  <P>If the American people wish to remain engaged with this planet, the  decision must be made in full knowledge of the terrible vulnerability involved.  Nor can there be doubt that, in the struggle against WMD, pre-emption,  prevention, and reprisal will be necessary and legitimate uses of power.  True, the criterion of military success will be what doesn't happen. But  things can &quot;not happen&quot; in many ways. And reprisal of a quality  to deter future attacks will be horrific.</P>  <P>To turn this purpose into policy, and this policy into strategy, two  other recognitions are necessary.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><UL>  <UL>    <LI>The defense of the homeland must come first. A truly isolationist America    would have scant need for defenses. Many would hate us, but few would have    reason to attack us, so long as we left them alone, bought their oil on    their terms, and ignored their crimes. Only an activist America requires    homeland defense. Further, this defense consists of an aggregate of activities,    from ballistic-missile and air defense against limited strikes to counter-terrorism,    drug interdiction, border security, information warfare, and protection    against violent domestic extremists. Currently, these activities are neither    conceived nor pursued as a coherent whole. They need to be.    <LI>The United States must choose its military commitments very carefully.    This excludes the use of the military for global social work, save in very    special circumstances. This also requires a considerable quantity of often    distasteful <I>ad </I>hoc arrangements, from alliances and technology sharing    to acceptance of the fact that (to borrow an Arab proverb) &quot;My enemy's    enemy is my friend&quot; . . . at least for today.  </UL></UL><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Turning Policy into Power.</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>A coherent, nondecadent military component of American security policy  must be based upon four recognitions.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><UL>  <UL>    <LI><I>Today, the United States is involved in a unique, historically unprecedented,    </I>asymmetrical arms race. Historically, arms races involved discrete    political entities, i.e., nation-states, empires, or other political structures,    and were easily quantified. Ten tanks were better than five tanks, walls    could defend against chariots, x number of anti-aircraft guns could be    expect to bring down y number of enemy bombers. Today, however, the United    States concentrates on precision-guided weaponry, while the planetary bad    actors &shy; a category which includes far more than nation-states &shy;    build or acquire WMD along with crude but serviceable delivery systems,    from missiles and aircraft to tug boats and trucks. The problem is to make    American power effective against these threats. American conventional forces,    properly maintained and modernized, can defeat any conventional force on    earth. Everybody knows it. But that's only part of the task, and perhaps    not even the most important part. And a lot of people who wish us ill know    that, too.    <LI>However, modern technology provides an astonishing array of new options.    To understand this, it's necessary to go beyond the buzzwords: &quot;Information    Age Warfare,&quot; &quot;Digitizing the Battlefield,&quot; &quot;Third    Wave,&quot; etc. Go back a century. Things were simple. If it happened    on land, the Army did it. The Navy pursued its role at sea. Then the airplane    began to blur the distinction between land and sea combat. Hundreds of    new weapons and systems entered the forces. And a remarkable mixing and    matching began. You could put airplanes on ships: aircraft carriers. You    could put soldiers on airplanes: paratroops and airmobile operations. You    could put armies on ships and land them on defended beaches: the Marine    Corps and the great Army amphibious operations of World War II. You could    put missiles on submarines. The result of all this invention has been that    systems have proliferated, but effects have converged. The &quot;Microprocessor    Revolution&quot; in targeting and command, control, communications, and    intelligence has increased this convergence by orders of magnitude. For    example, in World War II, the best weapon against a tank was another tank;    there were only a couple other ways, none very effective, to do it. Today,    there are over a dozen different ways to fight tanks. It is now possible    to fight tanks with submarines &shy; submerged craft hundreds of miles    from the battle, firing cruise missiles with precision-guided submunitions.    It is now possible, as a recent Naval War College simulation showed, to    sink entire fleets without ever putting a hull in the water. This means    that systems are vulnerable. But it also means that power can be made relevant    to the tasks at hand in many ways.    <LI><I>Think multi-use</I>. Future weapons and systems procurement must    emphasize versatility. In one sense, this is nothing new. A fighter-bomber,    for example, is a good buy because it can attack ground targets or ships    and also fight other aircraft. But today, multi-use means more than different    roles on the battlefield: It means operating in different environments,    from conventional combat to homeland defense. The systems that protect    troops in the field from enemy missiles should be adaptable to protect    the homeland. Ships and aircraft protecting, say, Saudi Arabia, should    also be able to protect Puget Sound. Multi-use now means environments as    well as tasks.    <LI>Finally, this is an age of blurring boundaries. In security policy,    hitherto tidy distinctions between military and law enforcement functions    may begin to break down. Nobody wants a domestic security state; nobody    wants the military on every street corner. Nobody wants massive violations    of constitutional rights and civil liberties. Still, it may be necessary    to make some new divisions of labor for that twilight zone where terrorists,    guerrillas, and the homegrown demented operate. Fortunately, civil liberties    and homeland defense are not either/or, provided the challenge is met honestly,    openly, and publicly.  </UL></UL><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Now to ten specific recommendations The first five pertain to money,  the second five to changes in force structure, roles and missions, and  design philosophy:</P>  <P><B>1)</B> Don't cut the defense budget. Real spending is less than half  what it was ten years ago. Five years ago, two years ago, a case could  be made for further cuts. No more. In fiscal 1997, the Defense Department  appropriation is about $264 billion. $275 billion, in real dollars, should  be an adequate base.</P>  <P><B>2)</B> Stop raiding the accounts. Stop using operating money to pay  for peacekeeping, especially. Keep the procurement and R&amp;D accounts  strong.</P>  <P><B>3)</B> Privatize and outsource whenever possible. As a general rule,  if a function doesn't have to deploy anywhere, it can probably be done  better by civilians. This includes everything from aircraft depot maintenance  to mowing the lawns.</P>  <P><B>4) </B>Another round of base closures and realignments. These may  produce greater &quot;cost avoidance&quot; than real savings, but are necessary  nonetheless.</P>  <P><B>5) </B>Downsize. Cut uniformed end strength from the current 1.5  million to one million. Defense must become capital intensive. The days  of cheap &shy; and unskilled &shy; conscript labor are over. This is a  professional force. It is also older and more married; dependents are becoming  an increasingly expensive burden, expecially in medical care.</P>  <P><B>6) </B>Realign roles and missions. This means revisiting the National  Security Act of 1947 and subsequent legislation and agreements. Everything  should be on the table.</P>  <P><B>7)</B> Aerospace first. Aerospace in all its aspects is the great  American comparative advantage. It must be kept. As a general rule, whatever  can be done from the air, probably should be done from the air. Militarily  as well as economically, what's good for Boeing is good for America. And  it may not be too much of a stretch to suggest that, militarily, what's  good for Boeing is good for the world.</P>  <P><B>8)</B> Maintain a robust fleet of 400-450 ships, a 180,000 strong  Marine Corps, and a smaller but modernized Army and a revitalized National  Guard. Yes, &quot;boots on the ground&quot; &shy; the ability to take and  hold territory &shy; will always be necessary. But this tells us little  about how many boots, or how often they'll be used in the WMD era.</P>  <P><B>9) </B>Think multi-use always. This includes both systems and organizations.  The National Guard, for example, is a classic multi-use organization. Its  possibilities along the entire threat array, from homeland defense and  disaster relief to providing the nation's combat reserve for major war  should be explored and enhanced anew. The Guard, too often and too easily  dismissed as archaic, should be viewed from a &quot;clean slate&quot; perspective.  Only then will its enormous potential begin to become apparent.</P>  <P><B>10)</B> Homeland defense. Begin to consider whether and how, at some  point, it might be necessary to create a unified Home Defense Command with  military and civilian elements, subject to rigid civilian oversight and  protection of civil liberties. This isn't necessary now; hopefully, it  will never be needed. But the current arrangements, in which homeland defense  is parcelled out among literally hundreds of agencies and services, working  groups and task forces, may not be adequate to the threat ten or twenty  years from now.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Conclusion</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>Will any of this come to pass, short of a major catastrophe? Hard to  tell. At the moment, in the think tank world certainly, working in defense  is time in the wilderness. Nobody's interested. Nobody's funding it. Perhaps  it will take a major civilian-military movement, akin to the defense reform  movement of the 1970s and 80s, or the airpower advocacies of the interwar  years, to bring it about. They too had their time in the wilderness.</P>  <P>Still, the wilderness can be a challenging place. You meet interesting  people there. And, sometimes, you get to do some good. If the current time  in the wilderness generates a movement that accomplished what the defense  reform and airpower people did, it will be time well spent.</P>  <P>Thank you.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="52%" SIZE="4"></CENTER></P><BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Philip Gold is director of defense and  aerospace studies at the Discovery Institute, a Seattle-based think tank,  and director of &quot;ReVisioning Defense: Protecting the People, Defending  the Defenders,&quot; in co-operation with the Heritage Foundation in Washington,  DC.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><A HREF="aboutdis.html"><FONT SIZE=-1><IMG SRC="aboutdis.gif"WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></FONT></A><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="current.html"><IMG SRC="image45.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><A HREF="front.html"><IMG SRC="image46.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="ggindex.html"><IMG SRC="image47.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><A HREF="crsc1.html"><IMG SRC="crscbttn.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><AHREF="whatsnew.html"><IMG SRC="image49.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A></FONT></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</BODY></HTML>

<P>&quot;We disapprove of the measures adopted by a certain party, styling
themselves the Christian party in politics,&quot; declared the petition
from a citizens' group. The document went on to indict Christian political
activists for advocating policies that were &quot;infusing a spirit of religious
intolerance and persecution into the political institute of the country,
and which, unless opposed, will result in a union of church and statte.
...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Given present controversies, the petition could have been written last week.
Instead, it was issued in 1831. Those who believe that religion in politics
is somehow a recent phenomenon in America should re-examine their history
books. Religion has been an integral part of the nation's politics from
the early years of the republic. This book tries to explain why. It also
seeks to illuminate both the opportunities and the dangers religion poses
for politics in a representative democracy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a political scientist interested in current affairs, I initially considered
writing about contemporary conflicts over faith and politics in America.
The more I studied the early years of the United States, however, the more
I realized that present controversies are simply a continuation of arguments
that have been going on since the nation began. The questions debated during
the early years of America are hauntingly familiar: Does religion have a
political role, and if so, what should it be? What are the advantages of
religion in politics? What are the dangers? And how can people of faith
bring their religious beliefs to bear on public issues without dividing
citizens along religious lines and infringing on the liberty of conscience
of those who do not share their religious views? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Exploring how these questions were answered in the past can help clarify
what is at stake at present. Indeed, examining the debate over religion
and politics more than a century-and-a-half ago may provide more illumination
than looking at current conflicts over abortion, school prayer, gay rights,
or any number of other issues. Contemporary controversies often cloud our
judgment because we have a direct interest in their outcome. When we are
able to examine the same fundamental disputes at a distance, however, we
are more likely to grapple with the real merits of the respective arguments.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That is what I hope can happen here, for there is much we all can learn
from the way religion became involved in politics in the early United States.
Those who criticize the role of faith in politics today might gain a better
understanding of how and why religion can play a beneficial role in our
politics; and those who champion religion's political role might gain a
deeper appreciation of the dangers as well as the possibilities of religious
political activism. Finally, evangelical Christians might rediscover part
of their heritage, for much of the book is the story of how their forebears
first became involved in politics in America. Politically-active evangelicals
of today might profit from both the mistakes and the successes of their
nineteenth-century predecessors. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Evangelical political activisim in America has a long history
behind it, and present-day evangelicals might learn much from both the triumphs
and the failures of those who came before them. For example, evangelicals
in the early 19th century -- like their counterparts today -- were harshly
criticized for mixing religion and politics. In response, they appealed
to the twin ideas of religious libe4rty and common moral standards articulated
by America's founders. The purpose of this project is to reacquaint today's
evangelical reformers with the wisdom of their forebears. The project includes
public onferences, books, and an historical reprint series of classics of
American evangelical political thought.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Current welfare debate revolves almost exclusively around the
question of how to motivate young women to get off, or stay off, the dole.
Completely ignored are the young men in their lives, except as they are
identified as candidates for child support. Yet establishing the conditions
that will encourage young men to marry the women who bear their children-and
for young women to accept them as husbands-is the central challenge of social
policy today, according to Discovery Senior Fellow George Gilder.<BR>
<BR>
Current laws and regulations are biased against family formation and have
created a blighted underclass, Gilder says. However, even today's reformers
continue to think the problem is simply one of impelling young mothers to
forgo child-bearing or to get a job if they already have children.<BR>
Fortunately, Gilder's view is about to re-enter the debate through publication
of a revised version of <I>Visible Man, </I>his 1978 book edited by Midge
Decter. The book<I> </I>tells the true story of Sam, a black youth of the
Albany ghetto, and the women in his disconnected life. In a tribute to Ralph
Ellison's classic <I>Invisible Man</I>, Gilder portrays the Sams-the <I>Visible
Men</I> of the American inner city - as the all-too conspicuous victims
of government policy, as well as the frequent victimizers of society. Black
males' income is actually below that of black females', so is educational
attainment, and black males are the only demographic group in American to
suffer a declining life expectancy rate in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
The problem, Gilder insists, is not racism, but a failure of government
policy at all levels to reward family life and to discourage deviations
from it.<BR>
The tragedy of Sam is compounded by the passage of time, Gilder notes in
his new introduction to the book. A young man with several illegitimate
offspring when he appears in <I>Visible Man</I>, Sam is now, 17 years later
most likely a grandfather.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Visible Man, </I>billed as a &quot;true story of post-racist America,&quot;
originally sold only 800 copies, though it has become a kind of cult book
for close Gilder readers. Its insights helped inform Gilder's following
book, <I>Wealth and </I>Poverty, which became a world-wide best seller (500,000
copies) and, in revised form, is still in print from ICS Press. (Copies
are available through Discovery's office.)<BR>
This spring Discovery plans to co-publish <I>Visible Man </I>with ICS Press,
placing the original Sam in the context of all that has been learned-and
all that politicians, academics, journalists and philanthropists have failed
to learn-since the first version. </BLOCKQUOTE>

CALLED &quot;A MUST READ&quot;</CENTER>
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If members of Congress are not already up to their armpits in
alligators, they soon will be (along with California gnatcatchers, spotted
owls and burying beetles), for the Endangered Species Act (the ESA) is coming
up for the first serious review since the controversial bill was passed
a generation ago. And suddenly gliding deep into the political maelstrom
is <I>Noah's Choice: The </I>Future of Endangered Species (Knopf, N. Y.),
the powerful new book by Discovery Senior Fellow Mark L. Plummer and Charles
C. Mann.<BR>
<BR>
Publication date is February 25, but the book already is attracting eager
interest. &quot;Must read&quot; is the pre-publication judgment of the <I>Kirkus
Review</I>, a journal used by bookstore owners and newspapers assignment
editors, while <I>Publisher's Weekly</I> calls the book &quot;timely, provocative
and reasonable.&quot; Sen. Slade Gorton, who read the book immediately after
his re-election campaign and is a leader on the endangered species debate
nationally, says<I> Noah's </I>Choice is &quot;written with the drama and
emotional impact of a novel. It will make a wonderful contribution to the
debate over how best to steward our natural heritage,&quot; he wrote for
a dust jacket endorsement. &quot;It shows, compassionately and wisely, how
we should weigh values when none can be met in their entirety.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Word apparently is travelling, because other Congressional offices and journalists
have begun asking for advance copies of the book. An article derived in
part from the book graces the cover of the current <I>Audubon</I> magazine,
and other pieces will appear shortly in <I>Science</I> and <I>The Atlantic
</I>Monthly. Discovery Institute and the publishers, Alfred A. Knopf, New
York, will introduce the book in Washington at a press conference and reception,
tentatively scheduled for February 28. A later book party will be held in
Seattle, and the two authors will make appearances in various other cities.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Noah's Choice</I> has been in preparation for three years, with research
taking the authors coast to coast, from limestone caves to sand dunes. During
the last year and a half Discovery Institute has built several conferences,
seminars and dinner forums around the endangered species topic, with attendees
ranging from members of Friends of the Earth to the Wise Use movement, with
government and industry representation as well. Besides Mark Plummer, participating
Discovery Fellows have included former Congressman John R. Miller, whose
<I>Policy Review </I>article on the topic has been widely disseminated,
and Albert Gidari, Jr., author of several scholarly legal monographs on
the constitutional difficulties of the ESA. (See article in box.)<BR>
<BR>
One reason for the broad appeal of <I>Noah's Choice</I> is its manifestly
even-handed account of endangered species and of human beings forced to
deal with the consequences of the draconian Endangered Species Act. More
controversial are sure to be the book's stern prescriptions, which entail
a major rewriting of the act - to share the burden of conservation more
equitably between individual land owners and society at large and to shift
the law's focus from punitive legal sanctions to voluntary incentives.<BR>
<BR>
Nobel prize winning economist Robert M. Solow of M.I.T., reviewing the book,
praised it as &quot;knowledgable, thoughtful and sympathetic.&quot; He expressed
hope that &quot;it may help keep rationality from becoming an endangered
species too.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Plummer and Mann collaborated on an earlier book, <I>Aspirin Wars</I>, and
have been personal freinds since a childhood shared in Bellevue, WA. Mann,
a contributing editor of <I>The Atlantic</I>, now lives in Western Massachusetts,
while Plummer resides in Seattle. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Restoring Hope In America: The Social Security Solution<BR>
<BR>
</I></B><IMG SRC="barrwb.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<P>Suppose you are 20 years old and earning $10,000 a year. You and your
employer are paying $1,240 a year in Social Security taxes. That's 12.4
percent of your hard-earned income, for benefits that you will never see.
<BR>
<BR>
Suppose instead you could invest that same $1,240, as well as an additional
$2.50 a week. By the time you are 65, thanks to the magic of compound interest,
you would be a millionaire. You would be assured a comfortable retirement.
<BR>
<BR>
This isn't a game-show fantasy. This isn't a lottery jackpot. It is a realistic
goal. But unlocking this economic opportunity means revolutionizing Social
Security. Every American who earns $10,000 a year or more can become a millionaire
over the course of one working lifetime&oacute;45 years. By the year 2000,
there will be over 100 million Americans who fall in this category. <BR>
<BR>
In a recent survey, Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 reported they
are more likely to see a UFO (46 percent) than their Social Security benefits
(28 percent). They're right. The Social Security trust fund starts running
out of money, under current projections, in the year 2013. If you're 20
today, that's when you turn 38. By the year 2030, when you turn 55, the
fund will be short $200 billion a year and be unable to meet one quarter
of its obligations. By the year 2042, when you turn 67 and reach your so-called
normal retirement age, the fund will have an accumulated debt of $4.7 trillion.
I'm not making this up. This isn't science fiction. These numbers come from
the 1994 report of the trustees of the Social Security system. <BR>
<BR>
You could get all your benefits, of course, if there were an enormous tax
increase for your children and grandchildren. According to the Social Security
trustees, honoring existing promises for Social Security and Medicare benefits
will require a rise in payroll taxes from the current level of 15.3 percent
to 25.7 percent in 2030. But that simply isn't going to happen. Americans
are already overtaxed. Do you think they'll put up with 25 percent payroll
taxes, and federal income taxes, plus state and local taxes on top of that?
<BR>
<BR>
Some politicians will tell you not to worry: Social Security is building
up a big trust fund that will take care of all those promises. By the end
of this year, the trust fund will have $475 billion in assets&oacute;on
paper. By 2020, there will be $3 trillion on paper. The trouble is, when
the program needs the money, the money will already have been spent on everything
the federal government spends money on. To redeem its IOUs to the trust
fund, the federal government will have to borrow money or raise taxes&oacute;by
over $36,000 per family&oacute;just as if the trust fund had no assets at
all. <BR>
<BR>
So you and your employer are now paying one eighth of your income to pay
for the Social Security benefits of current retirees, and to build up an
illusory trust fund. Meanwhile, your own retirement is in jeopardy. <BR>
<BR>
No wonder younger Americans fear they are on a treadmill. No wonder there
is so much trepidation about the future of the country. No wonder we have
a savings crisis: our savings are being spent. No wonder most Americans
now say their children will enjoy less opportunity than they do. <BR>
<BR>
It doesn't have to be this way. Social Security can be saved without raising
taxes, and without lowering the benefits or cost-of-living adjustments of
existing retirees. Social Security can be saved in a way that will open
up opportunity for younger people&oacute;so that their standard of living
will be better than that of their parents and grandparents. If we use the
principles of democratic capitalism to reform Social Security, the 20-year-old
making the minimum wage can become a millionaire by the time he or she retires.

Most Americans are on a treadmill because they have but one source of income:
wages. The way to get ahead is to earn income from capital. Money makes
money. With capital, you can retire in comfort and bequeath a nest egg to
your children. <BR>
<BR>
Here is the beauty of capitalism. Any American currently earning $12,580
or more pays $30 a week, or $1,560 a year, into Social Security. Imagine
that, beginning at age 20, you invest that $30 a week at market rates. When
you retire, you'll be a millionaire. Whoever earns at least the minimum
wage can become a millionaire in 45 years. <BR>
<BR>
The secret is compound interest. Let's assume a long-term return on your
investments of 8 percent a year. (This is a prudent assumption; the annual
return on the Standard & Poor's 500 over the past 70 years, including the
Great Depression, is actually 10.19 percent.) If you can save $30 a week
($1,560 a year), after 10 years the value of your portfolio is $29,000.
After 20 years, it is $110,000. After 30 years, it is $318,000. Forty years&oacute;$822,000.
And 45 years&oacute;the normal working lifetime&oacute;$1.3 million. After
50 years, if you work until age 70, the value of your portfolio crescendoes
to an estimated $2 million. <BR>
<BR>
You wouldn't exactly be a millionaire in today's dollars. If we adjust for
inflation of about 4 percent a year, your portfolio of $1.3 million after
45 years would be closer to $230,000. That's still a larger nest egg than
most working Americans even dream of. With that amount of capital, you could
purchase an annuity at age 65 that would give you $18,256 a year (in today's
dollars) during your retirement years. <BR>
<BR>
The way to save Social Security is to make the magic of compound interest
work for its beneficiaries. I've been developing a proposal that will save
Social Security&oacute;and enable 100 million Americans to become millionaires.
The plan keeps Social Security as a mandatory, redistributive savings program,
but it converts the program from the current pay-as-you-go system to a funded
system, in which individuals own retirement portfolios at Social Security
and choose private investment managers. Individuals would be allowed to
set aside portions of their Social Security payments, together with additional
voluntary contributions, in their own personal accounts. They could use
their accounts for retirement income and pass on the capital tax free to
their children. The plan has four basic elements: <BR>
<BR>
Pay existing obligations to all current retirees. Social Security benefits
would be paid to all existing retirees, as promised, without changes, and
without reductions. <BR>
<BR>
Divide Social Security into two tiers. If you are working now, you and your
employer would continue to pay existing Social Security taxes of 12.4 percent
on the first $61,200 of your income. Some of that would go to pay the benefits
of existing recipients. Some of your payments would go into your own personal
account. Payroll taxes would not rise from their current level. They would
be cut by 2 percentage points around the year 2040. <BR>
<BR>
The benefits of current retirees would be paid out of the first tier&oacute;current
payroll taxes. When they retire, current workers would draw benefits from
two Social Security sources: income from future payroll taxes and income
from their personal retirement accounts. <BR>
<BR>
Create personal investment and retirement accounts for the second tier of
Social Security. Every worker who earns at least $4,000 would have his own
IRA-like account with Social Security. (Unlike an IRA, you could use your
account only for retirement, and could not withdraw from it earlier.) The
first $500 that you and your employer pay into Social Security every year
would be automatically deposited in your personal retirement account. You
could increase the deposit in your personal retirement account by up to
$3,000 per year by making voluntary contributions that would be matched
by Social Security taxes you are already paying. The size of the match would
vary according to income. <BR>
<BR>
Here's an example: If you earn $10,000 a year and you contribute $1,240
per year, the first $500 of this money would be paid into your personal
account. If you add a savings match of $130, the Social Security program
will deposit an additional $610 of tax money you are already paying into
the fund into your personal retirement account, for a total of $1,240 per
year. In 45 years, your portfolio will be $1,026,524 and you're a millionaire.
<BR>
<BR>
If you are making $50,000, you might wish to put the maximum of $3,000 per
year into your personal account at Social Security; $1,500 of the $3,000
comes from taxes you are already paying, and $1,500 comes from additional
funds you save from your income, that is, from a personal-savings match.
In 45 years, your portfolio would be $2.5 million. <BR>
<BR>
This money would be in your name, you would own it, and you would be in
charge of picking an investment manager to invest it for you. Social Security
would set up a corporation whose only purpose is to certify and approve
private-sector money managers. (Criteria would include performance and experience
in money management, years in business, and certfiably good character.)
You would pick your investment manager from this list, and could switch
to a different one any time you wanted. This sort of system is already working
well in Chile. <BR>
<BR>
Use your capital account to increase your retirement income, and pass on
your assets tax free to your children. When you retire, you would have two
attractive choices of what to do with your capital account. One would be
to use income from your capital (5 percent a year) for your retirement benefits&oacute;and
then, when you die, to pass on your entire capital account tax free to your
children or heirs. The second would be to purchase an annuity with your
capital account, and receive higher retirement benefits during your lifetime
but not pass any assets on to your children or heirs. <BR>
<BR>
Based on current life-expectancy charts, when you reach 65 you can expect
to live, on average, to age 83, an additional 18 years. With an annuity
you could currently receive an estimated 7.9 percent return per year. <BR>
<BR>
If you have a small portfolio when you retire, your Social Security benefits
would be paid as promised out of the income from your capital (5 percent
a year), as well as payroll taxes from future workers. Suppose, for instance,
you have $100,000 in your personal account, and promised Social Security
benefits of $10,000 a year. You would receive $5,000 in Social Security
income from your capital, and $5,000 through the regular payroll-tax base.
When you die, you would then be able to pass your retirement assets on to
your children or heirs. <BR>
<BR>
As portfolios grow through compound interest, however, tens of millions
of retirees would have the opportunity to increase their benefits. Twenty-year-olds
today earning $10,000 a year will retire at age 65 in 2040. If the wages
keep up with expected inflation, their final wages will be $15,236. Their
promised present-law Social Security benefits will be $9,121 per year (a
59.9 percent replacement level). If payroll taxes are not increased, Social
Security benefits would be reduced 24.4 percent&oacute;from $9,121 to $6,892
per year. <BR>
<BR>
Under the Beard system, these retirees would have $1,026,524 in their personal
accounts with Social Security ($182,769 in today's money). If they choose
an annuity, their Social Security benefits will be $14,511 per year&oacute;$5,390
higher than present-law Social Security promises. If they wish to pass the
$1,026,524 tax free onto their children or heirs, their benefits will be
$9,138. <BR>
<BR>
It would be enormously expensive to move from a pay-as-you-go to a funded
Social Security system. Annual deposits into personal capital accounts would
begin at over $100 billion per year and climb to over $200 billion per year
(in today's dollars) by 2040. And this would be in addition to the massive
deficits already projected for Social Security beginning in 2013. How can
America possibly afford these expenses? The money would come from five sources.
<BR>
<BR>
Over time, the largest increase in Social Security revenue would come from
the income of the new capital accounts. By 2040, after 45 years in operation,
the estimated value of retirees' capital accounts in today's dollars would
be $8 trillion, almost double the current value of the private pension system.
If we assume 5 percent income from capital to pay retirement benefits, retirees
would receive over $400 billion every year from their capital (in today's
dollars). <BR>
<BR>
Social Security payroll taxes currently exceed payments by about $25 billion
a year. This surplus would go into the personal capital accounts. So would
the $475 billion in assets that have supposedly accumulated in the Social
Security trust fund. Those assets don't really exist, but workers have paid
extra taxes on the federal government's promise that the surplus would go
to a trust fund. Amortized over 20 years, the trust fund could be drawn
down at the rate of $30 billion a year. In practice, this will mean that
other federal expenditures will have to be cut by the same amount, bonds
of $30 billion will have to sold to the public, or taxes will have to be
raised by $30 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Some $60 billion a year would be saved through a special debt instrument
we call the Liberty Bond. The Liberty Bond would be a voluntary 30-year
interest-paying instrument. After 30 years, heirs and designees would receive
principal and interest tax free. It would be marketed to retirees who do
not need all their benefits to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and would
gladly forego some of their benefits if they were sure this would help their
children. <BR>
<BR>
I anticipate that five to 10 million Americans would purchase Liberty Bonds.
Millions of retirees would gladly set aside $1,000 per year to create a
$25,000 tax-free education fund for their children and grandchildren. Many
would even set aside their full benefits&oacute;$10,000 to $15,000 a year
for their remaining lifetime&oacute;to build a nest egg for their children.
The government could create a cap of $95 billion per year on the sale of
Liberty Bonds, so that no more money is deferred than necessary. <BR>
<BR>
To make the numbers work, benefits will also have to be reduced for future
retirees. There are two fair ways to do this. One is to raise the normal
retirement age from the current 67 to 70, a change that can be phased in
gradually. We are all living longer and we are in better health as we age.
It is fair to extend the normal retirement age as our own lifetimes are
extended. And in any case, with individual capital accounts in Social Security
and the power of compound interest, Americans will want to work longer&oacute;because
they'll have the opportunity to build up even larger nest eggs. <BR>
<BR>
The second way to reduce Social Security benefits fairly is to reduce indexation
for real wage growth. It is important to index Social Security for inflation.
Once you retire, the cost of living continues to rise as a result of inflation.
Without cost-of-living adjustments, the purchasing power of your benefits
will decrease an estimated 4 percent per year. But Social Security is indexed
again for real wage growth&oacute;about 1 percent a year. This is icing
on the cake for retirees. It is not necessary, and it could be reduced by
50 percent. <BR>
<BR>
The current pay-as-you-go system is an economic, political, and cultural
dead end. It will force us to raise taxes, and then raise taxes again to
pay promised benefits, or to cut benefits and then cut benefits again to
avoid mammoth tax increases. It will create no new capital opportunities.
It will drain a growing amount of America's resources&oacute;our savings
and investment&oacute;out of the private sector. A shrinking private sector
damages our ability to create new jobs and new industries&oacute;our future
strength. <BR>
<BR>
The current system is also a recipe for conflict. If America is a shrinking
pie, the young generation and older generation will fight over the crumbs.
<BR>
<BR>
Under a funded, two-tier system, we would cut payroll taxes 2 percentage
points in 2040 and then cut them again. As the system matures, we would
increase retirement benefits by 25 to 35 percent. We would create 100 million
millionaires. We would amass unprecedented savings and investment in America
by opening the doors of capital ownership to most Americans. We would create
a capital pool that no other nation in the world can equal, and use this
investment to finance the high-paying jobs and new industries of tomorrow.
<BR>
<BR>
By making every American a capitalist, a funded Social Security system would
unleash new economic growth, raise the standard of living of our children,
and return America to its historic role as the country of tomorrow, with
its best days yet to come. <BR>

Summary</I> </H4>
America needs passenger rail service as an economical and ecological alternative
to endless road and airport construction. Unfortunately, Amtrak cannot (and
probably should not) survive as it is presently structured and funded. Perpetuating
the status quo will burden America with a lame, government-run passenger
operation, limping along on the nation's freight rail rights-of-way, operating
under outdated federal rules from its 1970 authorization, and surviving
on Congressional handouts. <BR>
<BR>
But, the solution is not to throw Amtrak on the market, accepting whatever
happens. What would happen is, Amtrak would die. The proper course is to
reorganize the system, privatizing whatever can be privatized, building
new public-private alliances and compacts around the set of rail corridors
that link cities 100-500 miles apart-which is the functional core of the
national system-and then reconnecting this reorganized nation system to
other forms of transportation to create a true intermodal passenger network.
<BR>
<BR>
But before dealing with Amtrak, we need to understand its true circumstances.
Since its birth in 1971, Amtrak has been a neglected stepchild. The government
had no interest in its success. Neither did the freight railroads, over
whose tracks it ran. Labor made certain Congress burdened it with uneconomical
work rules; politicians picked the routes; bureaucrats ran the place like,
well, a bureaucracy. In retrospect, the wonder is that Amtrak succeeded
as well as it did. <BR>
<BR>
Amtrak's 1994 fiscal crisis coincided with the rise of budget cutting as
a national political priority. Following the election of the new Republican
Congress in November 1994, Amtrak's new president, Tom Downs, tried to adjust
to this priority, cutting 22% of its train miles and 1500 employees and
developing new, flexible strategic business units. Unable by themselves
to save the system, these measures did help reduce the financial crisis,
while improved marketing and a few new routes actually led to a small increase
in ridership. The cuts also alerted ordinary people to the value of passenger
train service. As a consequence, a number of states have offered subsidies
or have committed revenues to help save local service. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Presently, the unwillingness of many Congressmen to buck the opposition
to reform from the rail labor unions, the trial lawyers and commuter rail
states led Rep. Bud Shuster, Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure to declare, &quot;Amtrak is dead.&quot; His pronouncement
may prove to be prophetic, but it is premature. Amtrak's continuing financial
crisis still can be turned into an opportunity if the public's interest
is sustained and if a government reform process can be formalized. Toward
that end, Discovery Institute proposes the following measures: &#183; 
<UL>
  <LI>Approve three years of interim Amtrak operating support, tied to a
firm schedule for transition to a new system. &#183; 
  <LI>Pass a comprehensive Amtrak Privatization and Revitalization Act that
gives management power to eliminate all costs that do not improve service.
This will lift prohibitions against contracting out services, repeal excessive
labor provisions and resolve the legal liability questions between freight
and passenger rail.. &#183; 
  <LI>Establish a public-private commission to develop a new national system.
This Rail Alliance for Passenger Services (RAPS) will analyze proposals
for privatizing various corridors. These proposals should come from compacts
among local and state governments, private entrepreneurs, and the freight
railroads over whose tracks the passenger trains run. 
</UL>
<BR>
It is vital that the freights become stakeholders in passenger service.
RAPS will seek ways to upgrade passenger service, infrastructure, technology
and safety. And, RAPS will study development of a truly intermodal passenger
system, closely linking rail to bus service, airports, ferries and other
modes of transportation, with coordinated ticketing. At the end of this
period RAPS will recommend which corridors become part of the new National
Passenger Rail System, and will preside over the transition. <BR>
<BR>
The new National Passenger Rail System will be composed of corridors in
every region of the country, with a national organization setting safety
and service standards. To help justify the cost of long distance trains
that make the national system truly national and which assure service to
rural areas where air service is often lacking, passenger trains should
be allowed to carry mail and packages once more. Further, as in the National
Highway System, there should be a Federal commitment to provide infrastructure
capital-possibly through states and interstate compacts. After all, the
government provides the roads and airports over which the trucking and air
transport industries operate. Indeed, given the congestion in many parts
of the country and the ecological harm inherent in road and airport expansion,
passenger rail may turn out to be one of the bigger transportation bargains
in the federal budget. Why are we in this situation? 
<H4><I>A Little History </I></H4>
<BR>
The United States has not always neglected its railroads. Far from it. In
the 19th century, railroads were closely allied with the government. Land
grants, state loan programs, and other subsidies facilitated rapid expansion.
By the 1890s, indeed, the so-called Rail Barons had achieved incredible
influence and wealth, and some railroads employed more people and took in
more money that the government itself. But power and arrogance triggered
trust-busting and aggressive regulation. The railroads found themselves
fighting against an intermittently irate government, while the press and
populist politicians inflamed voters. <BR>
<BR>
Once the railroads' servile ally, government eventually became their effective
enemy in an era of social experimentation, imposing stifling regulation
and unnecessarily costly labor rules. All rates, routes and service were
under the rigid control of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Shippers
became a privileged class in commerce. Railroad workers received a special
Federal retirement program, a Federal unemployment program, and a Federal
tort-based workers compensation program. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, railroads often headquartered in far-away cities saw their rights-of-way
become targets for ever-increasing taxation revenues by state and local
governments. <BR>
<BR>
But even as government presided over the slow strangulation of the railroads,
it began starry-eyed love affairs with the automobile and the airplane.
Upon creation of the Highway Trust Fund and under the general guidance of
the Bureau of Roads in Washington, DC, a great bureaucratic auto constituency
was built in the states. The motor industry and its allies saw the government
as a potential partner, and one of the most powerful lobbies in history
was created. General Motors, the trucking industry, asphalt producers, road
contractors, dealerships, and the American Automobile Association (AAA)
became the &quot;Road Gang&quot; that worked effectively through the Association
of State Highway Officials (AASHO) and the Congress. A similar combination
of &quot;Airmen&quot; pressed for airports in every community and for a
fail-safe air traffic control system. <BR>
<BR>
A bi-partisan political team transformed America. Many of the results benefited
the average citizen and community, but rail transportation was left out
of the new dispensation. Private railroad operators found that cars, buses,
trucks and airplanes operating over government-funded superhighways and
aviation infrastructure became virtually unbeatable. The economic and social
effects were tremendous as cities emptied and people and industry moved
to the suburbs. Freight and passengers were increasingly diverted from the
rail beds to the interstate freeways and the airports. <BR>
<BR>
By 1980, the competition seemed to be over. Much of the railroad industry
was insolvent. Salvaging passenger rail was beyond the capabilities of private
companies. Led by the once mighty Penn Central, Northeast railroads tumbled
into receivership one after the other, followed in the Midwest by the Rock
Island and the Milwaukee Road. At the low point, 25% of America's railroads
were bankrupt, with the Chicago North Western, Illinois Central and Southern
Pacific nearly so. Rail market share continued to fall; debt was staggering,
the physical system was breaking down. A national system failure was probable.
Liquidation or nationalization were serious alternatives. <BR>
<BR>
From the beginning, saving the freight lines received top priority. Passenger
service was an afterthought. The first step toward recovery came in 1971
when Congress created Amtrak as a relief measure for freight railroads.
In 1973, Congress authorized a Northeast rail restructuring process and
a rebuilding of the freight infrastructure that produced Conrail. Congress
then authorized some repayable loans directed primarily at rebuilding midwest
freight lines. The Staggers Act of 1980 eliminated decades of over-regulation
and freed the freights to compete. Profitability soon followed. Unfortunately,
over in the new public sector, service did not fare as well. <BR>
<BR>
It need not have been this way. Although passenger service had been deteriorating
for a half century, experiments in the depths of the Great Depression had
demonstrated that revival was possible. In 1930, Ralph Budd, president of
the Burlington Railroad and his ally, railcar maker Edward Budd (no relation),
committed massive capital to high-speed, light-weight, state-of-the-art
rail technology. In a few years, modern diesel engines were pulling art-deco,
air-conditioned cars at over 100 miles per hour. Consumer response was enthusiastic
and profitable. American passenger trains, such as the California Zephyr
and the Santa Fe Chief, were the best in the world. During World War II,
passenger and freight railroading boomed. <BR>
<BR>
At war's end, the country had a great opportunity to create a balanced transportation
system that included rail. But the government chose to subsidize rail's
air and automobile competitors. Perhaps no one fully understood the long-term
implications for America. Western Europe and Japan, on the other hand, committed
to balanced systems and today enjoy high speed and, in some cases, profit-making
passenger rail operations. <BR>
<BR>
In 1971, the U.S. government finally committed to maintaining passenger
rail. In an exceedingly thoughtless law, no attention was given to restoring
American rail passenger service to a world standard. While Europe and Japan
invested billions in passenger rail to create true modal balance, Congress
directed Amtrak to become a self-sufficient, independent passenger operation.
Government funding was always minimal and no long-term capital commitment
was planned. The results of this policy are now apparent. <BR>
<BR>
The Amtrak Act created several counter-productive conditions. A government-owned
(and ill-financed) passenger system now operated over privately-owned tracks
and infrastructure-the exact opposite of the air and automobile and trucking
systems, where privately owned vehicles utilize government-provided facilities.
Further, the freights had no self-interest in seeing Amtrak succeed, since
the government paid them less-than-market rents for the use of their facilities.
Amtrak trains interfered with the freights' own operations and created unwelcome
insurance and liability problems. They agreed to the arrangement only as
a way of getting passenger service off their backs. Since the establishment
of Conrail, the freights have concentrated on their own core businesses.
<BR>
<BR>
Amtrak never really had a chance. The government didn't care and the private
entrepreneurs were out of the game. And, from the beginning, the Amtrak
Board was dominated by the Department of Transportation. Increasingly, Amtrak
behaved like a government bureaucracy. Middle management, with no incentives
and salaries capped by Congress, became rigid. There was continuous rancor
between management and the 16 rail labor unions, making highest quality
service impossible. The Washington, D.C.-based bureaucracy was nearly blind
to potential state and local community efforts for rail improvement. Further,
Amtrak inherited an ancient fleet and received little capital for modernization.
<BR>
<BR>
Both the Reagan and Bush administrations thought that Amtrak should be zero-funded.
In fact, Amtrak survived largely because senators and congressmen protected
trains running through their districts, enabling Amtrak President Graham
Claytor to maintain limited subsidies. Unfortunately, this meant that Congress
effectively controlled the national route system, which it froze in place
regardless of growing route losses. Congress became a de facto Board of
Directors, albeit a Board that paid attention to Amtrak's business only
sporadically. Statutory labor protection continued to guarantee Amtrak employees
up to six years' salary if they were moved more than thirty miles because
of a route change. Contracting car maintenance or any element of the passenger
operation to lower cost providers was forbidden by Federal law and union
contract. <BR>
<BR>
Under the circumstances, it is remarkable that, for many years under Claytor,
Amtrak arrived as well as it did. A good system was built in the Northeast
Corridor, and new rail cars were acquired. For a period, ridership improved,
creating an illusion that all was well. But decline could not be staved
off forever. By 1994, with a recession and fare wars in the airline industry,
ridership fell, while costs and capital needs increased. By fall, Amtrak
was confronting a cash crisis. In November, Americans went to the polls
and elected the first Republican Congress in 40 years. &quot;Deficit reduction&quot;
became the political battle cry. For Amtrak, the crisis had ripened at the
worst possible moment. <BR>
<BR>
American political debate in the aftermath of the 1994 elections set the
tone of a pseudo-debate. Aggressive freshman and senior budget-cutting Republicans
suggested that Amtrak has no modern function in an age of planes and automobiles.
They proposed &quot;Zeroing Amtrak&quot; in the Budget. Amtrak did make
cuts. But, then, from around the Nation, complaints of those affected quickly
found their way to mayors, governors and Capitol Hill. <BR>
<BR>
The crisis, however, created new interest in Amtrak. Several states, especially
Wisconsin and Vermont, offered subsidies to preserve threatened services.
Amtrak, Washington State, Oregon and British Columbia began incremental
development of high speed rail service along the Cascadia Corridor from
Eugene and Portland, through Seattle to Vancouver, BC. Initial ridership
has been higher than expected and a recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted
the new service and its special emphasis on regional cuisine. North Carolina
inaugurated its new Piedmont Service. Florida and California have committed
revenue streams to high-speed rail development. Amtrak, New York State and
the Federal Railroad Administration developed an experimental 125 mph turbine
train retrofit which is now in service between Albany and NYC; the state
is studying the re manufacture of additional trains to establish a fleet
capable of regular 125 mph service. At the suggestion of Senator Trent Lott,
Amtrak conducted a series of outreach meetings throughout the country. These
meetings produced broad recommendations and also demonstrated popular and
local government support for passenger rail. Passengers have increased four
percent so far in 1995. Maybe, then, passenger rail has a future. 
<H4><I>The Role of Congress </I></H4>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration has called for a continued Amtrak and has pushed
for labor provisions to be negotiated through collective bargaining. But
the Administrationcannot or will not advocate immediate cost savings that
cross the rail labor unions. Key Republican Representatives and Senators,
however, have made a clear that substantial savings must come from such
reforms. Further, they insist, Amtrak must have total flexibility to contract
operational functions to low cost, sometimes non-union, providers. To the
Republican leadership, these changes are a pre-condition for continuing
subsidies, even for an interim period. <BR>
<BR>
At the beginning of the 104th Congress, veteran Pennsylvania Congressman
Bud Shuster was named chairman of the newly organized Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure (T&amp;I), and that committee and its Rail Subcommittee,
chaired by Representative Susan Molinari of Staten Island, New York, were
given authority of Amtrak. In the Senate, jurisdiction stayed with the Senate
Commerce Committee where Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota is Chairman.
The Subcommittee Chairman is Trent Lott of Mississippi. Lott also serves
as Majority Whip of the Senate, putting him in a powerful position within
the Leadership. All four key chairmen have expressed support for saving
Amtrak-if it can be reformed. <BR>
<BR>
Hearings began in Congress in the Spring. The popular outcry resulting from
service cutbacks brought new focus. The Committees took a hard look at the
real problems of Amtrak, and of passenger rail in general. First came the
battle of the budget. It was a solid win for proponents of a national rail
passenger service-at least in the short term. During a transition period
through fiscal year 1998, the combined capital, operating and other payments
can total $712 million a year under the Republican-passed budget. <BR>
<BR>
However, Representatives Shuster and Molinari also promised the budget hawks
on the House Budget and Appropriations Committees that they would wring
maximum savings out of the existing system in exchange for these relatively
generous appropriations. Whereas current law prohibits any contracting by
Amtrak, other than for food service, the Shuster/Molinari bill (the Amtrak
Reform and Privatization Act, H.R. 1788) would repeal all anti-contract
law and permit subcontracting of all rail operating functions. H.R. 1788
reduces labor protection payments from 6 years to 6 months for an employee
whose job is eliminated. In addition, the bill places stringent limits on
liability exposure for freight and passenger carriers in intercity (including
high speed) and raises the rent for commuter passenger rail in the Northeast
Corridor. <BR>
<BR>
In the face of these proposed House reforms, rail labor mounted an intensive
lobbying campaign to overturn the contracting and labor protection amendments
which are the heart of the bill. Trial lawyers mounted an effort to remove
the liability limitations, while commuter rail states fought the move to
increase rental rates. When, June 14, the full T&I Committee markup on the
Shuster/Molinari bill was held, opponents caught the bill's backers off-guard,
prevailing on two vital reform votes. Chairman Shuster adjourned the Committee
mark-up without &quot;reporting out&quot; the bill to the House of Representatives.
It was the next day that he announced in the press, &quot;Amtrak is dead.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Action moved to the Senate. On June 16, the Senate Commerce Committee held
a substantive hearing on Amtrak. Interest for the next few months has shifted
to this Committee, where it will remain unless the House deadlock can be
broken. <BR>
<BR>
Prospects are certainly unclear. Amtrak has a large enough base in Congress
that is likely to receive some level of financial support for the coming
year-if it is tied to significant reforms. But the base is now more fragile
than in some time. And it is not realistic, in any event, to expect federal
subsidies adequate to restore or improve service over the longer term. But,
the need for inter-city and regional rail is still conspicuous. This means
that now is the time to establish a long-term comprehensive strategy for
our national rail passenger system. 
<H3><CENTER>Making Rail Passenger Service a Success<BR>
The Discovery Proposal </CENTER>
</H3>
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio361661" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
1: </I>Cut All Administrative Costs Permitted by Law </H4>
Amtrak must take all necessary steps within existing law to cut costs. Under
Tom Downs' leadership, remarkable progress has been made in a short time.
Business-oriented operating units have been established. Service on major
routes has been reduced while reinvigorated marketing has prevented a matching
decline in ridership. In fact, passenger revenues are 4% ahead of last year.
If passenger rail service is to be saved, more can be done within the existing
Amtrak framework. 
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio361901" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
2:</I> Cut All Extra Costs Imposed by Law </H4>
The contracting and labor reforms, as well as liability provisions of Shuster/Molinari,
must be adopted to give the system any real chance of survival. Second,
Railroad Retirement, the worker liability statute known as FELA, and all
of the other costly and non-productive Federal mandates that are unique
to railroads (described earlier) should be ended, or at least sharply reduced.
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio363876" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
3:</I> Maximize Resources </H4>
There are several laws which allow funding for elements of intercity passenger
service. The Swift High Speed Rail Act authorizes grants for development
of high speed rail technologies and corridor planning. The massive Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) allows limited funds for technology
development (section 1036) and grade crossing protection in emerging rail
passenger corridors (section 1010). All of these provisions should be integrated
into a comprehensive intercity rail program. This is a good job for the
Federal Railroad Administration. 
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio364695" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
4:</I> Design a National System Plan</H4>
<BR>
A blue ribbon federal commission should be charged with development of an
overall passenger system analysis, leading to a new national system plan.
The commission, which, for convenience, we shall call the Rail Alliance
for Passenger Service (RAPS), also should be responsible for overseeing
implementation of the plan. While Amtrak should be represented on RAPS,
membership should be heavily represented by the rights-of-way owners, states
and communities, the general business and labor communities and consumers.
<BR>
<BR>
Some believe that Amtrak itself could take on the functions of RAPS, obviating
the need for a new entity. However, Amtrak never has had a planning capability
and, as a bureaucratic organization with rail operating responsibility,
has a corporate culture and an altogther understandable urge for self-preservation,
that might complicate its performance of the role envisioned for RAPS. <BR>
<BR>
RAPS should be charged with market-driven development of a National Rail
Passenger System that provides incentives for Amtrak and other operators
to make money. Once the new national system is in place, the Amtrak monopoly
for providing intercity passenger service will pass to RAPS. Operations
over the new national system then will be re-distributed to Amtrak or other
qualified passenger rail operators. <BR>
<BR>
<B>RAPS will: </B>&#183; 
<UL>
  <LI>Analyze corridors as candidates for inclusion in the National Rail
System. It will contract with a major accounting firm to review Amtrak's
financial and operating records and make findings as to the fully distributed
cost of each Amtrak route. That firm also will make findings about the most
likely shortfalls between revenue and cost on each route. &#183; 
  <LI>Make a special study of the unique Northeast Corridor (NEC) between
Washington and Boston to determine its role in the National System. The
NEC has taken a large share of Amtrak's federally provided capital and is
presently faces an estimated five billion dollars of needed repairs. Amtrak
owns the tracks (which are also used by many commuter trains) and must maintain
the NEC to an exact standard to achieve high speeds. Yet the NEC is a popular
service and the only rail corridor where Amtrak is competitive with airlines.
RAPS would investigate transferring ownership to an interstate compact.
Privatization options, as well as Congress might well designate the Corridor
as a highly controlled &quot;interstate highway,&quot; making it eligible
for trust fund spending, with private users paying a fee to operate high
speed rail service over its lines. &#183; 
  <LI>Analyze the cost and feasibility of upgrading designated routes throughout
the national corridor system to 125 mph. Swift Act planning funds and ISTEA
section 1010 funds will be used to hire engineering firm consultants for
this purpose. Freight/passenger interface problems will be addressed as
will estimates of infrastructure improvement costs. RAPS, further, will
analyze potential funding sources and cost-benefits. &#183; 
  <LI>Over an 18 month period, solicit proposals from multi-party compacts
for corridor route operations and intermodal connections. These pacts should
be composed of: an entrepreneur who proposes to operate the trains, the
host railroads (who may choose to operate the trains themselves), the states
and communities served, and possibly other private stakeholders. Transition
employee interests must be considered. Proposals should include both a realistic
operating budget and financial plan, identify specific funding sources and
ways of overcoming financial shortfalls. Although it is probable that some
long-term federal financial support for infrastructure will be necessary,
each plan should be based on realistic assumptions-not on the hope of a
bottomless well of federal money. 
  <LI>See to it that issues involving host freight railroads are resolved
in compact negotiations. These issues include: grade crossing protection;
liability; operational interface; rent for use of track; and financing capital
improvements (such as higher rail speeds) for passenger operations. Through
the RAPS corridor, the freight owners in each will have a long-term role
in the governance of the National Rail Passenger System. &#183; 
  <LI>Recommend the specific routes that will become elements of the National
Passenger Rail System and approve the operating plan. This concept assumes
that there will be competition for the right to operate these routes. Different
contractors, freight carriers, and/or state/local authorities may operate
trains on different routes, so long as they meet RAPS' standards,which must
be approved by the Federal Railroad Administration and the track owners
for safety and operating compatibility. &#183; 
  <LI>Permit Amtrak itself and its employees, if they so decide, to privatize
and compete as a member of compact coalitions. In the interim, a residual
&quot;public Amtrak&quot; will need to operate during five-year analysis-and-transition
period. This public Amtrak will continue to operate the existing basic system
but with complete flexibility to achieve cost savings provided in the Shuster/Molinari
legislation. &#183; 
  <LI>Address in this planning process the distribution and ownership of
Amtrak passenger equipment. &#183; 
  <LI>Establish a plan for a national intermodal surface passenger system.
This will include a national system of reservations and ticketing, with
links to bus and even air. Intermodal bus/rail stations will be encouraged.
RAPS will set standards and principles of service, including equipment design
and compatibility for the National Rail Passenger System. &#183; 
  <LI>Provide a permanent residual national authority for oversight and
coordination with the National Passenger System. The RAPS Board will provide
for arbitration of disputes and administration of whatever federal funding
is ultimately authorized. It also will serve as residual holder of the right
to provide passenger service as a part of the National Rail Passenger System.
The RAPS Board will ultimately be privatized. 
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>
Funding for the plan Funding for the implementation of the National Rail
Passenger System envisioned in this proposal will be provided in three parts.
<BR>
<BR>
First, Amtrak will be given a general fund operating subsidy for the &quot;interim&quot;
planning period of three to five years. (The 1996 Congressional Budget allows
adequate funding for 3 years.) <BR>
<BR>
Second, the states will be given flexibility to commit discretionary ISTEA
trust funding to &quot;National Rail Plan&quot; rail projects. Currently,
states may not use highway trust fund money for rail. However, in considering
a highway bill recently, the Senate passed an amendment offered by Sen.
Anthony Roth (R.-Delaware) and Sen. Joseph Biden (D.-Delaware) to provide
some highway trust fund flexibility for Amtrak projects. The vote was a
persuasive 64 to 36. Coincidentally, a recent national poll indicated that
63% of the public support the concept of committing gas tax revenues to
Amtrak projects. Nevertheless, Roth-Biden has fierce opposition from the
highway lobby and will face great difficulties in the House of Representatives.
The opponents, unfortunately, include Transportation and Infrastructure
Chairman Bud Shuster. However, if Roth-Biden becomes law, chances for a
passenger rail revival will become greatly improved. At the very least,
it will quickly become clear how much priority the states are willing to
give passenger rail when confronted with a real choice. Besides, in many
corridors, federal capital improvements mean highway/rail grade separation
and improve port access, which benefit community safety, trucking and sea/air
traffic. <BR>
<BR>
The National Rail Plan adopted by RAPS for transmission to Congress will
include a statement as to whether any additional Federal funding is necessary
on a temporary or permanent basis. <BR>
<BR>
Needless to say, the more detailed the plans developed by RAPS, and the
more solid the state and local commitments, the easier it will be for Congress
to respond with long-term capital funding. Government has traditionally
provided infrastructure investment capital when public benefits are substantial.
For example, on congested or higher speed routes that are shared with freight
trains, double tracking, passing tracks, and state-of-the-art signal and
separation systems (as well as fencing), may prove necessary. Once a rational
planning process has been completed, the Congress will have a solid foundation
on which to allocate national transportation dollars to competing intermodal
priorities. 
<H4><I>Creating a National System </I></H4>
<BR>
A large issue will be how to deal with the long distance overnight trains
that make up much of the current national system. Nostalgia and romantic
names out of the past have political appeal. The question is whether they
make economic sense. Should the Sunset Limited ride into the sunset? Or
can such new (and old) ideas as combined passenger and mail service help
make the longer runs viable? Perhaps states and communities at location
stops along the route could maintain stations and underwrite part of the
cost of service. The answers must come out in the factual analysis and should
not prejudiced at the beginning of the process. <BR>
<BR>
Under this Discovery Institute proposal, the National Passenger Rail System
will be based on the building blocks of corridors in every region of the
country. Only after the corridor compacts have been submitted, analyzed,
and implemented-and costs are known-will it become clear whether national
connectivity should be a system goal. No doubt, the entrepreneurial imagination
of rail and bus operators will see opportunities where bureaucratic thinking
has seen only problems. 
<H4><I>Conclusion</I> </H4>
It is possible and desirable for this country to have a world-class passenger
rail system once again. But what priority will Congress and the people give
to saving and exploiting this asset? There must be a serious debate in Congress-a
debate informed, not just by political pressures from constituents and economic
interests, but by proof of cost-effective readiness to enter new partnerships
and try new arrangements. <BR>
<BR>
Today's new federalist philosophy seeks to return decision-making power
to the people. It seeks to give resourceful, customer-oriented capitalism
a chance. Saving passenger rail falls into this overall challenge. Privatization
is not a magic answer, but it can be a key part of a successful long-term
solution. <BR>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Coming Jewish Conservatism</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><I>From The Washington Times Tuesday, September 26, 1995:</I><H1><CENTER><BR>The Coming Jewish Conservatism </CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>by <BR><I>Adam Pruzan </I></CENTER></H3><IMG SRC="rainbow.gif" WIDTH="793" HEIGHT="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom><BR><BR>For most of this century, American Jews, liberalism and the Democratic Partyhave gone together like bagels, lox and cream cheese. At the present, wecan expect this cozy relationship to continue. However, to borrow PresidentClinton's favorite word, Jewish liberals will increasingly have to contendwith change - and it will not be an easy task. <BR><BR>Liberalism has already changed. From a broad national consensus, in favorof equal opportunity, individual rights, popular sovereignty and economicgrowth, modern liberalism has become a minority ideology, supporting equalityof income, groups rights, the rule of the elite, and redistributionist economics.<BR><BR>Judaism continues to change. The Orthodox community, the largest potentialsource of Jewish conservatives, remains relatively small, but it is growingand vibrant. At the same time, the liberal denominations (including Reformand Conservative Judaism - the latter not to be confused with Jewish conservatism)have sadly become little more than comfortable exit doors through whichgrandchildren, if not the kids themselves, leave the faith. With intermarriagerates over 50 percent we can readily understand Rabbi Alexander Schindler,leader of the Reform movement, when he calls for proselytizing - the firstsuch appeal in Jewish history. <BR><BR>And, of course, the Democratic Party has changed. Others have chronciledand catalogued those changes far better than I could do; for our presentpurpose, it will suffice simply to restate the post-November bottom line:minority party. While our liberal coreligionists deal with these changes,Jewish conservatives should be prepared for an eventual shift within ourfaith that will mirror what has already occurred in the country as a whole.Such a transformation may not happen for decades, but we should understandits underlying dynamics, and do whatever we can to advance the process.To that end I offer the following guideposts. <BR><BR>First, let us steel ourselves for a long and difficult struggle. Jewishdemographics illustrate the problem. Reckoning conservatively (as conservativesshould), we estimate that America has 4 million voting Jews, that only 20percent vote Republican and that only 20 percent of those are real conservatives(the other 80 percent might be Jacob Javits types). This leaves us withonly 160,000 Jewish conservatives. <BR><BR>That number should both sober and encourage us. Although a minority withina minority, we can still comfortably fund an influential national organization,plus a periodical or two. We can partner effectively with far larger Christianconservative groups, benefiting from their size and influence while helpingto guard their flanks. We can offer the major media interesting &quot;manbites dog&quot; stories, potentially gaining exposure disproportionate toour numbers. (The radical feminists have done this for years). <BR><BR>Second, realize that an imbryonic Jewish conservative movement has muchmore intellectual firepower at its disposal than did the original conservativeleadership at a comparable state of development (say, 1955). This newspaper,the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, National Reviews, Commentary andthe American Spectator have all published Jewish conservatives by the score.<BR><BR>Third, get comfortable with putting religion into politics. We must do asour liberal brethren do, not as they say. The Reform movement calls itsWashington office, headed by a rabbi, the Religious Action Center. <BR><BR>Liberal Jews, unabashadly proclaim the religious authority of our sacredtexts, liberal Jews invoke the Talmudic principle of tikkum olam, the repairof the world. For them, &quot;repair&quot; includes active support for thehomosexual, feminist and abortion-rights agendas, the welfare state, andthe NEA. At the same time, liberal Jews vilify conservative Christians forsimilarly acting on their religious beliefs. <BR><BR>By definition, any religious-based attempt to repair the world must involveimposing on others. Modern Jewish liberals do this, so did President LIncoln.In his second inaugral address, a speech of fewer than 700 words, Mr. Lincolninvoked God six times and quoted the Bible three times. Lincoln put religionin politics to justify the Union imposing its values on the Confederacy.<BR><BR>Lincoln acted &quot;with malice toward none, with charity for all and withfirmness in the right as God gives us to se the right.&quot; That is thekind of whole-hearted, noble conviction our conservative Christian friendsshould bring into politics and we should follow their example. <BR><BR>God made our ancestors wander in the desert for 40 years before they couldcross into the Promised Land. Generations inured to slavery and sin hadto pass on before we could fulfill our destiny. Likewise, the Jews who newRoosevelt, Kennedy and Johnson may never turn to conservatism; it couldtake a generation or more for our community to catch up with the Americanelectorate. So we should be patient, but we should also move as far in theright direction as we can. As Rabbi Tarfon said two thousand years ago,&quot;it is not upon you to complete the task, but neither are you freeto withdraw from it.&quot; <BR><P><CENTER><B><I>Adam Pruzan is Vice President of Toward Tradition, a Seattle-based coalition of Jewish conservatives, and an adjunct fellow of DiscoveryInstitute. <BR></I><IMG SRC="rwbline2.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR></B></CENTER><H2><CENTER><A HREF="front.html">Discovery Publications</A></CENTER></H2><P><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="discoimg.gif" WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="50" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Discovery Home</A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Can a Virtual School Help Improve Learning?</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by Tom A. Alberg<BR>
Chairman, Discovery Institute</CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="zigzag-3.gif" WIDTH="394" HEIGHT="6" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<P>BILL Gates said several years ago that &quot;on a scale of one to ten,
if a mediocre teacher is a three and Socrates was a nine, computers and
software are about a four, with prospects of someday being a six or seven.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It probably is true, indeed, that computers and educational software, by
themselves, will never equate to a great or even a good teacher. But if
today's networked computing is enlisted, the possibilities become more promising.
Networking connects the calculating, storage, retrieval and display power
of electronic machines with people who have ideas, creativity, questions
and emotions. It is a means of asking others for their opinions and of expressing
your own. Its instantaneous reach is around the school or around the world.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The components of high-tech leaming already in use are impressive; from
the increasingly popular and powerful Internet to the expanding corpus of
educational software and CD-ROMS. Distance leaming video broadcasts have
the power to bring the best lecturers to all students. Adding interactive
techniques including wireless and Internet facilities-can create a much
enriched personal experience for students, especially for those living a
long distance from large schools.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we hope to approach the &quot;nine&quot; of Socrates, however, we need
to combine and organize such resources into a coherent program of leaming.
We need to find out how emerging technological possibilities comport with
human nature in practice. We must find out how the new technology works
and how it can be made to work better if we are to know how to encourage
its appropriate development and dissemination. It took generations to create
the traditional classroom; the high technology leaming center of the future
can and should be created in one: ours.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One way to concentrate progress in high-technology leaming, while avoiding
disappointments and waste along the way, would be to organize a demonstration
project that tested out new hardware, Internet services and software for
varying kinds of learners. Call it a virtual school. In addition to combining
different high-tech leaming techniques (both Internet and software, for
example), it would pull together the lessons of existing experiments that
operate solely with one kind of technology or in one kind of leaming environment.
Today these experiences are scattered in n-tany homes, public and private
schools, universities and high tech firms.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The virtual school project is not a job for govemment acting alone, nor
for any one school, foundation or corporation. It should, however, collaborate
with all levels and kinds of existing educational systems and educators-from
state officials to home schoolers, from software manufacturers to telecommunications
companies, from computer scientists to educational television stations,
and with much attention to the actual students and their parents.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A virtual school is not one without human teachers. We may talk about the
virtues of self-leaming, but even the greatest scholars usually operate
within a community, and almost all fledgling students must have a structure
and human guidance. But the nature of the teacher/pupfl relationship may
well change as high technology is introduced.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the experiments in the virtual school, therefore, would seek to discover
what kind of teacher/student interaction works best in a high-tech leaming
environment. We mostly abandoned rote leaming years ago and yet we have
found that total reliance upon student spontaneity does not yield measurable
progress in knowledge and skflls-which is one of the major concerns of school
refon-ners. With new hardware and software technologies, it should be possible
to develop both new kinds of group interaction and self-directed learning.
Accordingly, the job of the teacher is sure to be different, and it will
take experience to discover how to teach in the high tech environment.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Likewise, what it means to be a student will change. For certain, it will
not be appropriate to give each pupil a computer with CD-ROMs filled with
great literature and hope that he or she will stumble across Nfilton or
The Federalist Papers. Nor should we consider it sufficient to give students
a connection to the Internet, which is a wonderful tool, but often referred
to as &quot;chaotic.&quot; They will need some kind of guide-and some reliable
accountability for results. It may be that the teaching model will be closer
to the tutor of yore than to today's classroom instructor. The &quot;tutor&quot;
guides his or her pupil, suggests certain inquiries and requires a demonstration
of increased knowledge and skill. Sometimes the tutor meets with the pupils
as a group, sometimes singly-sometimes over the Internet and sometimes in
person.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The virtual school, then, would be an association of educational tutors
(teachers) and participants of all ages (students), organized and equipped
to make maximum use of existing and new educational software and the Internet.
The tutors would work together to devise curricula, combining desktop software,
specific knowledge based resources on the Internet (such as the Harvard
files on Greek architecture for a fine arts or history course .... ), Internet
communication opportunities (pen pals in Italy for a course on Italian;
topical bulletin boards on whales .... ), interactive video &quot;classes&quot;
and personal meetings and field trips with students.<BR>
Assignments-and tests-in the virtual school would take place largely on
the Internet. Scoring of exams would be faster and easier than now, and
the whole idea of &quot;exams&quot; might change as learning patterns change.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Anyone could &quot;audit&quot; the experimental virtual school, but the
tutorials would require preliminary application and approval. Whether he
or she was a home schooler or someone attending a standard public or private
school, a student would sign up with the virtual school for an actual course
and be assigned a tutor. C)n the other hand, a tutor with his or her own
group of students could also enter.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Imagine, for example, how a Garfield High School student who wanted to study
Italian@r some other language not now available in the Pubfic school system-might
sign up for a beginning course with the virtual school. The curriculum for
Italian would carry the student as far as he or she desired, with measurable
milepost results satisfactory not only to the student but to his or her
parents and Garfield advisor. The curriculum would be flexible enough, moreover,
that a hundred students taking Italian through the virtual school could
each learn in his own way and in varying real times, with wide choices of
content to permit instructional custon-dzing. The students also would be
part of an on-line, interactive, real time class. All would have some opportunity
for face-to-face interaction, as desirable.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The tutors would be drawn from existing teachers at schools, supplemented
by other people in the community. For example, the Garfield High School
student who wanted to study Italian, n-dght have a knowledgeable language
teacher at Garfield as the tutor or someone else in the community who was
qualified to monitor his progress. Math and science teachers might be supplemented
by Boeing engineers serving as tutors on the Internet. Lawyers might tutor
constitutional law or environment and public policy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While the virtual school would not bear any resemblance to the large physical
structures Of today, it would probably actually exist in physical space
as well as cyberspace and etherspace. There would be meeting rooms at an
otherwise modest virtual school office where you occasionally could meet
your tutor and probably other participants, as well. Rooms would be flexible
in size and also would include the latest high quality video broadcasting
and teleconferencing screens, as well as virtual reality facilities.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most students would use the virtual school as an adjunct to their regular
institutional or home school program. The dynamic of the school would be
such, however, that it would be constantly iinproving itself and expanding,
as the participants learned what worked and what didn't.<BR>
Nationwide, schools are investing literally hundreds of millions of dollars
in high technology products, often for school office improvements, but increasingly
for student learning. The future is likely to see such investments expand
exponentially. But planning for this development currently is sparse (Washington
State is further along than most), and discouraging waste, therefore, is
inevitable unless better information is available on what works and what
does not. Teachers will need to be trained when they are still attending
schools of educationonly a small fraction are computer literate nowand existing
teachers need to be retrained. But trained to do what? A comprehensive virtual
school experiment that is not beholden to any interest can help shorten
the learning curve in the high-tech educational future.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we want to pioneer in creating a virtual school in the Puget Sound area,
we must build a constituency that believes, first, that the use and deployment
of computer software, hardware and networks can measurably improve the learning
process, and, second, that the new system should be able to justify itself
in terms of measurable results for students and for the educational system
as a whole. Technology should not become just another expensive addition
to the present system. It should help transform education, facilitating
the real reforms in productivity and cost-effectiveness.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But it can't happen without some experimentation, some trial and error me
use of high technology, in other words, to learn more about high tech learning.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Microsoft suddenly sees itself beset by broadband rebels and
its own middle age</CENTER>
</H3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BR>
GOLIATH IN THE VALE of Elah roared his contempt at the weapons and zeal
of David: &quot;Do you think me a dog that you contest me with sticks and
stones?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bill Gates, the Goliath of software, sees himself simi-larly beset by zealous
rivals with risible weapons. Entering his modest second-floor office on
the edge of the Microsoft campus on a twilight evening in late November,
I find him irked and addled by what he sees as a siege of slingshots from
irrational media and capital markets in his industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft entered November on an autumnal blaze of upside news-earnings
up 53%, sales up 63%, a double gi-gabuck quarter. But now, amazingly, people
were speaking of a &quot;crisis&quot; at Microsoft. &quot;That's an emotional
word,&quot; says Gates, twisting uncomfortably in his chair. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IT WAS BAD ENOUGH when Netscape came on with 9,000 lines of code for a World
Wide Web browser that took six weeks to build and that was given away free,
and people began talking of his company's downfall. Gates had pulled that
trick himself in 1976, with a few thousand lines of code for the Basic programming
language for the PC and then again in 1980 with MS-DOS. But to do it to
Goliath seemed l&eacute;se-majest&eacute;. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then comes Sun Microsystems with a new program-ming language called Java,
and people like me, who by Mi-crosoft standards don't know anything about
programming, who have never written a single line of code, presumed to tell
him about its virtues. It's safe, secure, interpreted, plat-form independent;
it collects your garbage (automatic garbage collection). It compiles as
if by incantation. It builds market cap as by magic. Give poor Bill a break.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; says Gates. &quot;I have to wonder who screwed
your head around....&quot; Oh, he knows, he knows. &quot;The In-ternet&quot;
makes everything different. You can make any claim you want, however bizarre
or ludicrous, that would ordi-narily be laughed off the stage, and if you
add the mantra &quot;on the Internet&quot; at the end you can morph yourself
from a typical media clown into a visionary, a prophet, a guru. &quot;Nobody
pauses to say, 'Huh?' &quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the analysts will nod and the market will bow. It's &quot;on the Internet.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One day in November, three days before my visit, Rick Sherlund, the Goldman
Sachs analyst who helped bring Microsoft public in 1986 and had touted the
stock for a decade, downgraded Microsoft's shares from buy to &quot;mod-erately
outperform&quot; on the basis of Internet incantations from Sun and Netscape.
Sherlund also replaced Microsoft with Netscape on his recommended list.
Indeed, Goliath's net worth was shrinking by the minute as Microsoft's mar-ket
cap sank by $9 billion, and Sun's and Netscape's surged by $9 billion in
a matter of weeks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Does Bill Gates know Rick Sherlund, by any chance? Sure, Gates answers,
&quot;extremely well.&quot; &quot;He's your man, he's great,&quot; says
Gates, &quot;if you want to run a spreadsheet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this world of manias and emotions, &quot;I have to make rational decisions,&quot;
Gates says, glaring at me. &quot;Somebody who thinks that because of a browser
that anyone can clone, because of a language that is magic, they [Netscape
and Sun, the unmentionables] can overthrow the world-that person can't even
think two chess moves ahead. You're not even in the game I'm playing.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Okay, thinking forward a couple of moves, what is the big thing bearing
down on Microsoft on that road ahead? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It's middle age. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No, in Redmond, they have another name for it. Throughout the company, wherever
you go-from hum-mus on pita bread at the cafeteria with a glib former Holly-wood
agent hired to handle publicity, to a Starbucks latte at the Microsoft model
&quot;home&quot; with software sage Rick Rashid incandescent on a couch,
or off to Rover's Restau-rant where Nathan Myhrvold spiels refulgently at
a cor-ner table through 12 courses of rococo &quot;fatware&quot; and my
two missed flights-the word is middleband. From the top down, Microsoft
is becoming a middleband company. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates, Myhrvold, James Allchin, Craig Mundie- nearly anyone in Redmond will
step you through it. The future is not broadband, not narrow-band; it is
some middle way. It takes Excel and Word and Pow-erPoint presentation graphics
and multimedia CD-ROMs and the new Video ROMs-indeed all the front and back
Office suites that are the core of the company, all the teeming tow-ers
of legacy code-and attaches that to the Internet. It's Encarta and Baseball
and digital TV all tied to the Web over middle-band circuits. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates explains: &quot;We will translate Encarta into many lan-guages and
make it a front end to the Internet, so that when-ever you look up a topic
in the encyclopedia, we can link you into what there is in the Inter-net
on that topic. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now the Internet is not fast enough when you just want to go pure
Internet, so every year you can buy the CD that holds the bulk of the material.&quot;
It will be a middleband world. I see the millennium at hand: People are
all queu-ing up at Egghead for their Encarta update CDs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From Gates on down, however, Microsoft leaders do grasp the essence of the
change. Myhrvold trenchantly points out that communications standards no
longer rise from the center out, from the LAN to the WAN. They be-gin on
the Net and move inward to the LAN and transform it. &quot;The LAN is dead,&quot;
as Myhrvold says. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But these same Microsoft leaders seem to believe that the transforming power
of the Net stops short of the PC and operating system. Sun will set, but
Windows will open wide on the World Wide Web (up to ISDN speeds). After
all, as Allchin puts it, &quot;We see the Internet as an extension of the
operating system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I ask Gates how we can have a middleband world in the face of a rising tide
of bandwidth. Gates in the past has spo-ken of virtually &quot;infinite
bandwidth.&quot; But he does not see it today. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Twenty years from now we will have broadband in homes, he explains, but
until then middleband is the best you can expect. Indeed, in his presentation
to the press the week after my visit, on December 7, he strangely declared
&quot;broad-band is the holy grail, [but] it's much further away than ever
before.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I ask about cable modems. But to Gates, cable modems are mere middleband:
&quot;Don't get me wrong-you can do a lot in middleband. But cable is a
shared medium. Cable modems are middleband. You get 10 megabits per second
and share it with 500 homes and you are back to ISDN speeds.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, I protest, Netscape has a different view. It has joined with @Home
(the Kleiner Perkins-TCI joint venture) to supply browsers and servers for
a new scalably broadband Internet based on cable. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates's voice reaches a new pitch. &quot;I assure you Netscape has no relationship
with @Home that Microsoft does not have. I didn't spend three years talking
with John Malone for nothing three years with Bruce Ravenel [Tele-Communications
Technology Ventures' senior vice-president and chief operating officer].
In the first place, browsers are trivial. We will have cable browsers. And
we will have cable servers. We will do anything with @Home that Netscape
does.&quot; After all, TCI Technology Ventures invested $125 million in
MSN (Microsoft Network). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So it went in the Redmond gloaming. I deeply admire Gates. The guts to leave
Harvard at the end of his junior year and launch a new industry; the tenacity
to build it into a planetary utility; the audacity and ingenuity of the
original deal with IBM; the entrepreneurial confidence to cut loose from
OS/2. The vision to be the only major software company to embrace Macintosh
and save Apple by en-dowing the Mac with the leading GUI spreadsheet and
word processor, Excel and Word, while at the same time gaining the graphics
skills to create Windows. The bold challenge to Unix through Windows NT.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
THERE IS NO DOUBT that Gates has been the exemplary business leader of our
era. Compared with the leaders of IBM, heavy with &quot;NIH&quot; (not-invented-here)
and degrees in business administration and finance, who could not even grasp
the concept of sunk costs or the rule of self-cannibalization well enough
to burke OS/2, who could not even see the huge opportunity to embrace the
Mac OS, Gates is indeed a giant. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A week later, in an announcement emblazoned in Com-puterworld as &quot;Capitulation,&quot;
Gates showed his superiority to the NIH syndrome at IBM. He declared that
he was licensing Sun's Java Internet animation language, in which he seemed
suddenly to have discovered new virtues, and was essentially abandoning
Microsoft Network as a proprietary paid service. It would serve as an attractive
Inter-net entry point, open to all, with content and advertising prepared
with anyone's available software. Beyond that, Microsoft announced an array
of impressive-sounding new Internet products: Blackbird publication tools
for the Net; Gibraltar Internet server products four times as fast as Netscape's;
Visual Basic as a scripting language for the Net already far easier and
more familiar than Java; upgrades of current Word versions that allow direct
creation of HTML documents; and an array of other announcements. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But all the brave talk, the bestselling book, the stilted TV appearances,
the an-nouncement of a news channel with NBC, the stream of new products,
the bold embrace of an In-ternet strategy, the spread of Windows 95, could
not disguise the rising confu-sion in Redmond. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All of a sudden, Gates seemed to have lost his bearings. The man who elbowed
aside an on-air Connie Chung as if she were a bothersome gnat and shunned
NBC as a nuisance, now was clutch-ing the old network, of all things, as
a source of news and investing in it, as if it had a future. It was as if
old NBC with its Max Headrooms of smiling anchor faces and two-minute splashes
of &quot;news&quot; could morph into an in-formation resource simply by
invoking the mantra &quot;on the Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As in his long romance with Warren Buffett, Gates seemed to be reaching
out to old money, power and pres-tige to bolster his company as it whirled
in the vortex that he had described as the &quot;Internet tidal wave.&quot;
It was as if he no longer trusted the PC to sustain his growth as an $8
billion revenue company, as if he needed sustenance from mass media. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Netscape, Sun, @Home and other firms, Silicon Valley is in the ascendant
again. But the software colossus is still losing ground on the road ahead,
so Gates pivots on his peerless pinnacle simultaneously at the summit of
the New York Times bestseller list and the Forbes 400 and looks back with
a Macaulay Culkin smile from the cover of a book that is mostly news of
yesterday. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I N T E L   O U T S I D E ? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks later, back in Silicon Valley from the Vale of Elah, I visit Goliath's
prime mover, Andrew Grove of Intel. With revenues more than twice as large
as Micro-soft's and a price/earnings ratio less than half as high, and commanding
the world's most awesome manufactur-ing facilities for the world's most
complex and portentous product, Intel seems to stand on firmer foundations.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove opens the meeting with jokes about the &quot;tunnel of death&quot;
that perpetually menaces his industry in the pages of the media. Ensconced
in a small open cubicle on the fifth floor of the Robert Noyce headquarters
in Santa Clara at the heart of Silicon Valley, with &quot;Intel Inside&quot;
inscribed on the roof to enlighten the planes from nearby San Jose In-ternational
Airport, Grove effervesces wit and irony and bonhomie where Gates seethed
sarcasm and defensiveness. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Grove, there is no longing for canonization by old money, no sell-sign
craving for the sickly glamour of Hol-lywood and TV, no fashionable yearning
for business in &quot;content.&quot; Grove grasps that the PC is the ascendant
force in the global culture of capitalism and that the Internet consummates
the PC. Nonetheless, asked about the possibility of the teleputer-the $500
Internet PC-freed from the coils of Wintel, he echoes Gates in a cele-bration
of current PC culture that somehow misses the point. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove associates the teleputer with dumb or static appliances, from set-top
boxes to PDAs, in the catalog of PC sub-species that emerged in hype as
substitute PCs. Most of them sold a few hundred thousand units, and then
expired. &quot;The new device will be produced and it too will sell a few
hundred thousand units. But not 10 million units,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Forbes ASAP editor Rich Karlgaard and I prepare to leave his office,
he asks us to guess the cycle rate of the up-coming '96 basic home-based
PC. I suggest 100 megahertz. Grove shakes his head. He confides that he
is headed for a meeting to decide whether the 1996 PC will bear a 120- megahertz
or a 133-megahertz Pentium. &quot;Everyone un-derestimates the progress
of PCs,&quot; he says with satisfaction. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You could fix on a special-purpose device today, to satisfy Larry
Ellison's mother [who wants a simpler PC], but by the time it came out,
the PC will have moved on, powered by incomparably more potent microprocessors,
leaving the new machine trivialized and obsolete in its wake.&quot; In other
words, evolutionary products will suffice in this revolutionary time of
exponentially expanding Nets and peripheral CPUs. Nonetheless, moving a
few miles north on California's Route 101, out of the hypergravita-tional
fields of Philistea, one can still feel a radical shift-ing in the spheres
of possibility. &quot;And David took his staff in his hand and chose him
five smooth stones.&quot; I Samuel 17:40 <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
FOR THE NEW ORDER, the ultrawideband wireless Sand Hill slingshot-the capitalist
conjurer of the forces causing new sleeplessness in Seattle-is John Doerr
of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. Shunning Herb Allen's summits of
schmooze, where the entrepreneurial big-time is an &quot;au-dacious&quot;
investment in Coke or NBC, Doerr epitomizes the venture capitalist as industrial
demiurge. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As technology investor Roger McNamee puts it: &quot;While other venture
capitalists say, 'Let's start a company,' John says, 'Let's start an industry.'
&quot; So far, beginning at Intel in the early years, he has played a key
role in launching in-dustries in electronic design automation, RISC workstations,
personal computers, financial software, multimedia and wire-less pen appliances
(well, let that last one pass). His current new industry will be the biggest
yet. It is broadband Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From the vertiginous launch of Sun, Lotus and Compaq in the early 1980s
to a fund gush-ing Go at pens, his career has seen several peaks and valleys.
Doerr has even dallied with middle age. He once weighed a mid-life retreat
from the madding bustle of Silicon Val-ley to contemplate the Tantra or
the Tao: &quot;I sometimes think,&quot; Doerr told the New York Times in
1987, &quot;I would like to become a Buddhist monk.&quot; Sure, John. But,
tell me, what yoga discipline was he brewing two years ago in Palo Alto,
at breakfast at Il Fornaio head-to-head with Jim Clark? What karmic rites
was he conjuring with Clark and Bill Joy in the winter of 1994 on a three-hour
conference call among wildernesses of Marriott on the road? What karass
was he kenning in December 1994 among the tacky booths and bins, the barkers
and indoor bikinis at the Western Cable Show in Anaheim? What tables were
tipping in January 1995 in his Woodside home, among pizzas and pastas with
his wife, Anne, and Marc Andreessen, Bill Joy, Andy Bech-tolsheim, Jim Gosling
and Rick Schell (Netscape's VP of engineering)? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why, in early 1995, was he lurking around the NASA Ames Research Center
at Moffett Field in Mountain View, Calif.? Is he seeking evidence of alien
IPOs, or just some hard-core Unix Christian libertarian netbender from outer
space to levitate a new industry in Palo Alto? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
AT&amp;T venturer Thomas Judge told Forbes ASAP's Nancy Rutter in 1993:
&quot;You have to be on the fringes to make money in [Doerr's] business,
and that's where he is.&quot; Follow Doerr, however, from day to day, call
to call, from Sun to Oracle to America Online to Netscape to Macro-mind,
and you will find yourself at the fringes just as they invert into the Zen
center of the sphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A lean figure, with blondish hair, a cowlick and horn-rims, Doerr at 44
is as bashfully all-business and freneti-cally bitwise as Gates whom he
resembles, but he is still flouting the gravity of middle age. On a crisp
Sunday in mid-December, I catch up with him at Buck's restaurant, near his
home in Woodside in Silicon Valley. Wearing a dark suit from church, he
checks for messages on his Skytel pager, greets fellow venturer Bill Davidow
passing by and then opens a black briefcase full of technotoys. From across
the restaurant, this venture colossus looks to be a frowsy salesman perhaps
a little desperate to present his wares. He removes a Mac Power-Book 5300
and Sony speakers and lays them out on the table. Amid empty latte glasses
and plates of ravioli pesto and his own half-eaten hamburger, Doerr is ready
to give a demo of the new industry-a fore-cast for next year's Netscape-style
IPO. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It takes a minute or so to boot up the Mac, checking through the 32 megabytes
of RAM (teleputers, Doerr says, will boot up instantly from flash ROM).
But from there on out, it is all immediate grati-fication. Click to ignite
a Java Web page with streaming stockmarket data, a c/net talking- head newscaster
and a vocano video from Venezuela. &quot;Wow, look at that new PowerBook
go,&quot; exults a jolly woman observing from the next table. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But Doerr is on a rush through a world of his own. Click again and you have
the Sunnyvale Sun, efflorescent with vivid speech, sports clips and classified
personals. Newspapers will be hot on the broadband Internet. Click on the
classifieds and you can presumably meet their makers in living color. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is a glimpse of @Home, a mere demo of Doerr's new broadband Internet
company. As the service develops you will soon be able to download movies
and other pro-grams on demand. Over 28.8 modems or even 128-kilobit-per-
second ISDN lines, all such dynamic fare would be ag-onizingly slow to access.
By contrast, Doerr says, in @Home everything is instant, full motion and
always on. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
How can this be, you ask, on an essentially middleband Internet? &quot;That's
the genius of Milo Medin, @Home's net-work chief,&quot; he explains, &quot;linked
to the genius of Marc An-dreessen of Netscape.&quot; NASA Ames's network
king, Medin is now building a scalable, extensible architecture for a cable-based
World Wide Web. With some help, I might add, from John Doerr and his five
smooth stones. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
B R E A K I N G   W I N D O W S   A N D   B O T T L E N E C K S <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, four of the five companies-Sun, Netscape, Macromind and Intuit-Doerr
estimates, &quot;have added more than $10 billion to their market cap in
the last six months because of their Internet initiatives,&quot; this new
model of computing based on the Web, while Microsoft lost a similar total
by briefly resisting it. Now @Home is on target to generate another multibillion
market cap by exploding the current bandwidth bottlenecks of the Net. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At Intel, Doerr worked at a desk down a corridor from Bruce Ravenel. Then
an architect of the 8086 and the 8087, Ravenel is now TCI Technology Ventures'
influential chief of technology. Igniting the fuse for @Home were words
between Doerr and Ravenel as the two old grads from &quot;Noyce-Moore U&quot;
wove their way through the Western Cable Show in the first week of December
1994. &quot;I dare not call it an epiphany,&quot; Doerr says, &quot;but
Bruce and I were at the Motorola booth where they were showing off a sleek
little $300 box the size of a modem that would enable telephone calls over
a cable line. 'What would it cost,' I asked, 'to add an Ethernet port to
the device, so you could link a computer to the Internet through it at up
to 10 megabits per sec-ond? ' When the Motorola guy guessed, 'Maybe $30,'
our eyes got as big as saucers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Doerr sees a hole in the line, he hits it hard and fast. Two weeks
later, four days before Christmas 1994, he was in John Malone's office in
Denver presenting a plan for a Silicon Valley startup to bring broadband
Internet over cable. Likely IPO market value in two years? $3 billion. Malone
also hits hard and fast. After a three-hour meeting, the TCI chief signed
off on the venture with-out a qualm. Doerr's chief job was to &quot;line
up some unique Silicon Valley technical genius to make it work.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Tapping Internet experts at Sun and around the Valley, Doerr found only
one name popping up on every list. It was that hard-core Unix Christian
libertarian netbender from outer space, Milo Medin. A 32-year-old wunderkind
manager of the multiple networks converging at NASA Ames Research Center
in Mountain View, Medin had spent the last 12 years making increasingly
crucial contributions to the Internet's growth. But uh-oh. For a week or
more, Medin refused to answer any calls from Kleiner Perkins. He says, &quot;I
thought they were a bunch of lawyers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
DOERR WAS ATTACKING the key problem of the Internet. With the number of
host computers doubling every year since 1970 and the power of the computers
doubling every 18 months, the Internet had mastered every challenge of capacity
by multiplying cheap local routers and servers. The Net has already overtaken
the U.S. Postal Service as a carrier of mail (by one estimate, a trillion
e-mail messages compared with 180 billion postal deliveries). And the Net
similarly has pushed the number of digital data bits ahead of the total
of voice bits on the phone system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last two years, however, the traffic has taken a turn toward GIFs
and graphics, doubling the number of bits every few months. As the Internet
careens toward its destined collisions with television and telephony as
the prime sources of information, entertainment and commu-nication for the
public, the prime obstacle is bandwidth. Many in the industry have begun
to blink and bluster in the bright light of optical media and other broadband
pipes. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Led by Bill Gates, they believe in middleband and ISDN. They dabble defen-sively
in TV. As a shared medium, even cable, so Gates contends, will dwin-dle
to ISDN rates as the number of customers on the system rises. But at 128-kilobit-per-sec-ond
or even at 1.54- megabit-per-second T1 rates, ISDN means picture quality
inferior to NTSC television. A shared medium linked to slow routers means
bottlenecks throughout the system if cable modems yield a thou-sandfold
increase in bit traffic beyond existing modems (up from 28.8 kilobits to
close to 30 megabits per second). On-line services will bog down in slow
access, sticky searches, jerky movement, blurred faces. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such a middleband net will not be able to maintain its current momentum
of growth and power. It will not be able to challenge television and telephony.
Yet the valuations of Internet companies depend on a continued exponential
ascent. Thus many people believe the Net is overhyped, overvalued, starved
for &quot;content.&quot; They believe Doerr's broadband revolution will
fail. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Milo Medin is Doerr's weapon to break the bottleneck. He has spent most
of his adult life overcoming crises on the Net. Medin's fast rise began
in 1987 when he led the creation of NASA's Internet and almost came to an
end in 1993, when the swarthy Serb with the spruce mustache and the piping
voice and broadband gush had barged into Washington to persuade the entire
government to em-brace the Internet protocols (TCP/IP). Fueled by this uni-versal
language, the Net had grown exponentially up a wall of worry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problems did not reach critical mass until 1994, however, when its traffic
began doubling every couple of months. Andreessen's Mosaic browser had spurred
the World Wide Web into a multiterabyte cyclone of growth and expansion,
concentrated in California. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here the entire Internet converged in one room in one building at Ames.
On one side of the room were the Cisco 7000 routers and Digital gigaswitches
and Northern Telecom add-drop multiplexers of the FIX (the Federal In-ternet
Exchange), the government peering-and-exchange point, managed mostly by
Medin. On the other side was MAE West, the Internet access exchange point
for most of the private Internet, including the pullulating college and
university Nets, the regnant Internet service providers such as ANS and
Sprint, and the budding local fiefdoms of Netcom and The Well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then in April 1994, the government ended its $25 million in annual Internet
subsidies and arranged for a private takeover. Among the winning bidders
were Pac-Bell and Ameritech, assigned to run two key network ac-cess points
(NAPs). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Long expecting the withdrawal of government subsi-dies to throw the Net
into chaos, many observers would welcome the ensuing crash. The private
sector would flub the job. There would be a tragedy of the commons. As in
feudal Britain, when the commonly owned lands were overgrazed and ruined,
the commonly owned Internet would suffer a glut of graphics &quot;GIFraff&quot;
and traffic jams. Sure enough it was happening. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PacBell's ATM switches from Newbridge Networks, with skimpy buffers designed
like a PBX for voice-traffic pat-terns, choked. California, the source of
two-fifths of In-ternet traffic, was down. The Western NAP jammed, and Ameritech's
Chicago NAP was also largely out of commis-sion. Bay Area e-mail from a
student on Netcom to a small business on BBN's BARNet had to steer clear
of the Ames hub and pinball through routers all the way across the country
to Sprint's NAPs in Pennsauken, N.J., or Reston, Va., and then all the way
back again. As a result, the Eastern Inter-net hubs also began to tilt.
An obvious solution seemed to be to have FIX West, the government hub at
Ames, take over the traf-fic that was fleeing the Pacific Bell NAP. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Savvy residents of Silicon Valley, the Ames management was sympathetic.
Then Medin gained the blessing of NSF networking chief Steve Wolff and enlisted
Jack Waters at MCI, a crucial Internet backbone supplier that no longer
used its PacBell connection. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Within two weeks, Medin created a system comparable in capacity and reliability
to the original FIX, with expanded Net management capabilities, power supplies,
communications ports and routing facilities. The result was a broadband
national peer-ing- and-exchange point, with a cumulative capacity of some
10 gigabits per second. It combined traffic from all the major commercial
Internet suppliers with the bitstreams from government laboratories and
agencies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, throughout this period of crisis and turbu-lence, no ordinary
Internet customer experienced any un-toward deterioration of service. Although
Medin's contri-bution was only part of a major national effort, he became
the talk of the Net. Doerr had to sign him up. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
AS DOERR SUMS IT UP, &quot;Milo was running the largest IP net in the federal
government. When they decided to set up a White House.gov Web site, they
asked where to put it. They put it on Milo's server. Milo helped run the
fiber ring around Moscow. Internet connections for Australia and Antarctica
and for deep space probes ran through Milo. He was supplying IP connectivity
for the entire Scandinavian subcontinent. He had some 200 remote nodes.
And he ran it all with some 99.98% uptime.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
@Home CEO Will Hearst of Kleiner Perkins likes to tell a story that gives
some clues as to how this young Net nerd from NASA became a legend in his
own time: &quot;In 1988, a Finn-call him Lars-hacks his way into Milo's
comput-ers. Ticks Milo off. He does a trace route and finds his way back
to the administrator of the domain in Finland. It's an academic site. Milo
already knows Lars's IP address. You can't hide from Milo. He says to the
administrator, 'We have a problem. Please have a conversation with Lars.'
That upset the Finns, who say, 'We are not going to do that! We respect
civil liberties here! You can post a complaint if you like, but we can't
tell the guy what to do.' So Milo goes into a slow boil. Says, 'I'll give
you about 30 minutes to get that guy's files off our machine.' <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nothing happens. So Milo issues an order: 'Take down Scandinavia.'
The switch is pulled. Three countries go dark. They don't notice it immediately,
but pretty soon e-mail messages are not getting returned. At last, three
senior administrators go to Lars, so the story goes, and they say: 'We don't
care if you hack into the CIA; we don't care if you bring down NSA; and
we don't mind if you abscond with all the financial bits in the Federal
Reserve. But don't mess with Milo at NASA.' <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Finns called back Milo, said the situation had been taken care
of. Milo said fine and put the service back up.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
NOW DOERR and Medin are again confronting the perennial doomsday adven-tists
who gather on mountaintops of slightly older money and disparage the future
of the Net, talking crisis, over-load, overhype, overvaluation. Tragedy
of the Commons. The experts are chiming in. From Howard Anderson of the
Yankee Group to Andrew Seybold and Bob Metcalfe, lead-ing analysts are prophesying
a crash in 1996. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Medin has been there before. The answer to traffic jams on a narrowband
Net is creation of a broadband Net. Don't tell him it is not technically
possible. Who are you kidding? This is the age of the telecosm. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bill Gates, though, thinks it is the age of middleband. It is obvious beyond
cavil to Gates that his regime, ruling 80% of the world's computers, is
destined to prevail. He commands a market share so overwhelming that Wash-ington's
antitrusters see it as a monopoly in need of gov-ernment dissolution. For
Gates, among the most ludicrous claims to be validated by the mantra &quot;on
the Internet,&quot; is the idea that Windows machines are an inferior minority
system difficult to digest in the prevailing habitat of Unix and TCP/IP.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To Medin, however, it is a matter of simple fact that Win-dows and NT are
awkward systems, hard to incorporate in his domains except as mere terminals.
To Medin, Unix is the heart of the Internet, the matrix of creativity in
net-working, the bearer of thousands of programs and services and tools
and scripts and languages that together comprise the pullulating fabric
of the rampantly growing Web. So far, Medin has a strong case. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sixty percent of the managers of Internet host comput-ers use Macintoshes
as their preferred personal machine. On the Internet, as a platform for
servers, whether for the World Wide Web, e-mail, FTP, Telnet, Gopher or
NeWS, Microsoft's favored NT now ranks seventh, with a 4% share, behind
Sun, which commands a 56% share, Apple, Silicon Graphics, IBM, Digital Equip-ment
and Windows 3.1. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Around the time that Gates was assuring me of Microsoft's impregnable position
with @Home, Medin was reviewing the Seattle company's software concepts
for his new network. The @Home people wanted to adopt Microsoft's Explorer
browser if they could (TCI fa-vored its interactive TV ally), but it was
simply impossible. Explorer ran on neither Unix nor Macs, and could not
handle mul-ticasting. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netscape's browser already worked with all the existing systems, including
the various Windows. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Under the influence of Marc Andreessen, who had learned net-working in the
broadband 45- megabit-per-second environment of the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), Netscape had long ago left behind all
the comforts of middleband. Andreessen was eager for broadband con-nections.
Gates was not even in the game that Medin and Andreessen were playing. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All right, suppose that &quot;browsers are a trivial tech-nology,&quot;
as Gates told me dismissively. It was servers that Microsoft really wanted
to sell to @Home. Their Gibral-tar system was running Microsoft's somewhat
balky inter-nal Internet at a pace some four times faster than Netscape's
server might. Here, Microsoft benefited from its homogeneous cam-pus environment.
Netscape had to employ the &quot;union&quot; code-using the lowest-common-denominator
instructions to coordinate several varieties of Unix, Mac and Windows NT.
Meanwhile, Microsoft could optimize Gibraltar for all the most powerful
instructions in Windows NT, so it was much faster. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the @Home people were perplexed. How could they use Windows NT, an alien
system on the Internet, unfa-miliar to their employees or to the Internet
service-provider personnel who would work the @Home headends and oth-er
nodes? Microsoft was behaving in the Internet environ-ment as if the company
were still safe in the imperial realms of Windows desktops. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So @Home, which promises to be the most important force in the next phase
of Internet evolution, and Medin, the intellectual firebrand at the heart
of @Home, seem un-likely to embrace Microsoft's offerings. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
MILO'S DARK SHADOW OVER MICROSOFT <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As for TCI, its enthusiasm was dented a bit by the collapse of the MSN project,
in which Malone invested $125 mil-lion. But TCI has recouped its loss. Jim
Clark was persuaded to offer TCI a small share of the Netscape IPO. After
the initial public offering and the subsequent boom in Net-scape shares,
TCI's holding was worth $125 million, leav-ing TCI quite comfortable with
its new allies in Moun-tain View. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A deeper look at Medin's plans casts darker shadows in the path of Microsoft.
Asked about the notion of an Internet computer being free of Windows and
other Mi-crosoft levies, Gates stops rocking on his chair and gets to his
feet. He turns and paces urgently back and forth across his office. He gestic-ulates,
summons the history of past challenges, refers repeatedly to dumb termi-nals
and other unappetizing machines, and hurls forth rhetorical questions: &quot;Do
you want to go onto the Internet when you are doing word pro-cessing, do
you want to go on the Internet when you are using PowerPoint or Excel?&quot;
In other words, do you want to forgo all the wonderful new OLE interactions
among Microsoft programs and all the new Microsoft hot links and other forthcoming
tools when you go on the Net? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Under the pressure of Gates's energy and conviction and hypotheticals, I
answer, &quot;Of course not.&quot; But the real answer is, &quot;Sure, if
in exchange I can have a computer that outperforms a current Wintel machine
on the Net and con-tains linking capabilities comparable to OLE for one-third
the price.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates himself sketched out the answer in his famous In-ternet Tidal Wave
memo, issued in May to galvanize his company in the face of the new threat.
He pointed out that not only could he access far more information on the
In-ternet, he could also find, search and browse it more read-ily on the
Net than on a LAN or, for that matter, he might have pointed out, Gates's
own hard drive or CD-ROM. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The error of all the critics of the $500 teleputer is their assumption that
it will be inferior to current PCs. It will be, they claim, a PC minus a
fast CPU, short a high-reso-lution monitor, without a fast memory or large
drive. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This assumption misses the compounding impact of mi-crocosm and telecosm.
The advance of chip technology through Moore's Law, together with the advance
of net-work bandwidth, will endow a machine not inferior but hugely more
powerful, than the most supercharged Pentium workstation on a local-area
network linked to the Internet at ISDN speeds. The Law of the Microcosm
ordains that one-chip sys-tems will be better, not worse, than intersecting
boards strewn with devices linked by wires and buses. As Wilf Cor-rigan,
chief of LSI Logic, observes, &quot;From calculators to cellular phones,
every time a system has moved onto a sin-gle chip, it has wreaked havoc
with the existing industry.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IN PREPARING THE WAY for one-chip teleputers, Medin con-cedes that the current
Inter-net will not support broadband services. &quot;You link a broad-band
modem to the existing Internet and what you get is an impedance mismatch&quot;-a
bunch of fire hoses attached to a network of garden hoses. In order to accommodate
the fire hoses of @Home, Medin will have to enlarge the band-width of the
Net, from the humblest service provider to the NAPs at the top of the net-work
hierarchy, where the leading service providers join to &quot;peer and exchange&quot;
data. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Leasing capacity from the telephone companies, @Home will create a new broadband
network linking to the existing NAPs at MAE East in Tyson's Corner, Va.,
at the Sprint NAP in Pennsauken, N.J., and at MAE West in Mountain View.
This will expand the capacity of the so-called Internet back-bone (in fact,
an ever-shifting array of virtual vertebrae), which currently works with
maximum pipes running at 45 megabits per second. Over the next two years,
Medin plans to upgrade his backbone to 622 megabits a second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important and revolutionary, though, are Medin's plans for the local
loops and service providers of the Net. Contrary to the claims of many critics
that the Internet PC implies a return to the now-discredited model of the
main-frame and dumb terminals, @Home resolutely distributes intelligence
and memory through the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of the @Home system is ingenious hierar-chical memory management
and caching to conceal the mazes of slow routers, sluggish switches and
narrowband wires that lurk treacherously among the higher reaches of the
Internet. Indeed, when Doerr finally got through to Medin and, with Will
Hearst, first proposed cable modems to him, he said they wouldn't work.
There would be &quot;im-pedance mismatches&quot; with the hardware and software
in the rest of the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This kind of blew the air out of their tires,&quot; says Medin. &quot;But
then I told them how the system could work.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You have to think of it as a distributed computer sys-tem. In such
systems, every processor cannot access memory at once. You build caches
and shared-memory pro-tocols and you mirror and replicate a lot of the data
so that it's always available locally. That's what you're going to have
to do on the Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In other words, the Internet is a computer on a plan-et. Like a computer
on a chip, its raw bandwidth cannot handle the necessary throughput. Thus
its communica-tions depend on ingenious hierarchical memory manage-ment,
with registers, buffers, latches, caches and direct-memory access controllers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Studies of Internet use show that some 80% of the traffic is still local.
If a particular Web page is popular in a particular locality, you have to
have that page in the hard drive or even in RAM on a local server. You have
to use the multicast ca-pabilities of cable to broadcast popular information
to all ad-dresses. Above all, you have to make the system scalable. You
have to phase in bandwidth, moving fiber links and nodes deeper into neighborhoods
as demand rises. All this is per-fectly possible technically, Medin assured
Doerr. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;After I was through, they decided they had to hire me. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I still thought we would have to build all the software ourselves.
I didn't know Netscape was thinking the same way. But I went down to Netscape
and got together with Marc Andreessen, who is a friend, and we had a real
mind-meld on all this stuff. They were doing the software already. Netscape
became our main software partner. It turned out that their browser is de-signed
for multicast. And their proxy server is great for caching information and
delivering it to users on demand.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Medin thinks that a key to making the system work is to distribute lots
of cache through all the local points of presence. With this kind of network,
the teleputer might become not only far cheaper but also far superior to
today's PC. A now famous Gartner Group study shows that the average office
PC costs $40,000 over five years when you factor in software and network
maintenance. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps 75% of cumulative PC costs now come from staff support. @Home will
supply tech support, mainte-nance and storage more efficiently, whether
centrally by phone or at local headends. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a glimpse of the future, visit Boston College, where cable modems supplied
by Continental Cablevision are already becoming &quot;addictive&quot; to
many students and professors. On the basis of this experience, Forrester
Re-search is now predicting sales of some 7 million cable modems by the
turn of the century. Medin thinks this es-timate is conservative. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With cable modems you will come to demand wireless connectivity throughout
your home or small office, so that your teleputers can link to the Net wherever
they are with-out plugging them in to a connector or dialing up a connection.
Only cable can accomodate such demands. &quot;Internet PCs fit with @Home
like ice cream and hot fudge,&quot; sums up Medin. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the big question: Is it possible to build such a machine? &quot;Sure
it is,&quot; says Medin. &quot;Just take a Sony PlayStation, essentially
based on a one-chip ASIC, and re-place the CD-ROM connec-tor with an Ethernet
adapter. You'll get 3D graphics, Dol-by III sound, a 30-megahertz CPU controller,
a memory-access controller, and a 10-megabit-per-second 10BaseT link to
your cable headend.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
C O N S T E R N A T I O N    I N S I D E    I N T E L <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here the new paradigm be-gins to threaten the cause and complacency not
only of Bill Gates but also of the other master of Wintel, Andy Grove. When
I ask him about such an ASIC so-lution to the problem of the $500 PC, consternation
breaks briefly through the surface of his bonhomie. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
He snaps: &quot;I won't comment on the fantasies of Brian Halla,&quot; the
former Intel manager now executive vice-president of product marketing at
LSI Logic. Yet LSI Logic offers precisely Medin's PlayStation so-lution
to the problem of cheap teleputers, free of Wintel code. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
LSI Logic is the supplier of the workhorse chip for the PlayStation. Using
some 2 million transistors, this integrated chip combines a 30- megahertz
Silicon Graphics MIPS processor, a 60-MIPS geometry transfer engine, a direct-mem-ory
access unit, and Sony's proprietary MDEC device (for hybrid MPEG and JPEG
decompression) for full-screen video playback. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a Netstation, the MDEC would be replaced with the appropriate decompression
engines, and added to those would be Reed-Solomon and Viterbi error correction
to-gether with a cable modem module that receives 64-QAM signals and sends
QPSK. Based on its experience with the PlayStation chip, which LSI Logic
will be producing in volume on the world's first commercial 0.25-micron
fab-rication lines, LSI Logic estimates that it could sell a tele-puter
on a chip for around $50 in volume. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This machine is the consummation of a long LSI Logic strategy. In the mid-1980s,
the company suffered a serious crisis as NEC, Fujitsu and Toshiba all opened
fast-turnaround design centers in the U.S. to deliver high-speed, high-density
gate arrays. At the same time, LSI launched a spinoff, Headland Tech-nology,
to make chipsets for PCs in competition with Chips &amp; Technologies and
VLSI Technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Supporting Headland,&quot; says Halla, &quot;was like walk-ing around
with an open artery. Intel remorselessly sucks out all the margins in PC
hardware.&quot; Chastened by the Japanese in gate ar-rays, LSI learned from
Grove not to take on Intel in PC markets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To a company special-izing in gate arrays and chipsets, these lessons were
not inspiring. Then Wilf Corrigan, LSI's salty founder and CEO-a Silicon
Valley legend from Liverpool who previously played key roles at Fairchild
and Motorola-underwent a triple bypass. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
People talked of retiring him, giving him a title with a new consortium,
U.S. Memories, where he might have learned not to compete with the Koreans
in DRAMs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks after surgery, however, Corrigan returned to work at LSI and developed
a new strategy that would transcend the strategies of both Intel and the
Japanese. Under the new plan, LSI built state-of-the-art fabrication facilities
and design tools that could enable creation of a software library of &quot;Core-Ware.&quot;
CoreWare programs would generate a large variety of key functions, from
CPU kernels to signal processors and graphics engines, that could be deployed
in weeks on single special-purpose chips tailored to high-volume applications
mostly outside the Wintel ambit. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By 1995, this strategy was bearing rich fruit. The com-pany announced it
had developed a fab process that could place some 49 million transistors
on a single sliver of silicon some 200 millimeters square. LSI released
a series of bellwether high-volume devices that moved the company beyond
the path of the PC, out into the network and into the consumer appliance.
The Sony PlayStation chip ran 1995's most successful CD game machine. LSI's
MPEG-2 decoder will go in the next version of RCA-Thomson's hugely successful
direct-broadcast satellite receiver. LSI also sup-plied the first ATM segmentation
and reassembly chip for several key equipment companies, and the first 100-megabit
switched-Ethernet solution for a fast Ethernet pioneer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Looking beyond Intel, this experience led Corrigan and Halla to conclude
that their company commanded all the crucial CoreWare ready to deploy a
teleputer on a single device manufacturable in volume for about $50. Attesting
that Halla's view is not fantasy is the success of the Sony PlayStation,
now on sale for $299, leaving room to buy a monitor and still stay under
$500. LSI also has several as-yet-unannounced design wins for cable modem
chips aimed at the markets to be opened by @Home. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Intel's response to such capabilities is its currently embattled program
for native signal processing. NSP allows software implementation of real-time
functions performed in special-purpose hardware under the &quot;CoreWare&quot;
model. As Grove points out, DSPs and com-pression chips may be getting cheaper
all the time, but from Indeo video to Proshare teleconferencing to Intel's
new Vertical Blanking Interval webware, NSP comes free of charge-if you
are already buying a Pentium (and you prob-ably are). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But no sooner will the CPU suck in another real-time role than a new virtual
temptation will glimmer on the hori-zon. For reaching the ever-receding
real-time goals-from continuous speech recognition to 3D rendering-the Core-Ware
approach will prevail, at least until the arrival of the new super broadband
mediaprocessors from MicroUnity and other Silicon Valley firms. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS on these far frontiers of tech-nology, John Doerr
will launch his five smooth stones as the foundation for a new industry.
With Intuit leading the move to Internet financial services, Netscape pioneering
Internet software, Macromind supplying the authoring tools for multimedia,
@Home providing the bandwidth and Sun offering Java and UltraSPARC, the
entente is on its way. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But perhaps Doerr's most important stone is Sun. Asked to name the key influences
in TCI's shift toward the Net, John Malone mentions Doerr first, hesitates
and then stress-es the role of Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems.
Relentlessly, year after year, McNealy would travel to Denver and give his
pitch to Malone: Buy sets of Sun servers and link them to your headends
in order to supply data services. At first Malone resisted. &quot;Two-way
data,&quot; he used to say, &quot;is not a business that I want to be in.&quot;
But as the Internet grew, McNealy's argument gained new force. In late 1994,
it triumphed. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Malone now believes that two-way broadband com-munications is the heart
of his business. For a total in-vestment of less than $188 million, Doerr
claims @Home can launch a business yielding at least $500 million in cu-mulative
revenues by the year 2000. Later this year, the Sunnyvale system will be
up and running. Weeks later, depending on cooperation from other cable companies,
the entire state of Con-necticut will move onto broadband two-way cable.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At that point, all the other cable companies will accelerate their dri-ve
to upgrade their facilities to ac-commodate the gold rush. By the turn of
the century, @Home hopes to extend service to all the major urban and suburban
centers. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Sprint, TCI leads a cable group that is paying $2 billion for wireless
personal communications service (PCS) spectrum across the country. Through
New York-based Teleport Communications and other bypass providers, TCI and
other cable firms already command fiber-optic rings through most major metropolitan
areas. With cable providing broadband backhaul for PCS, @Home's founders
think the company will emerge as the backbone for a full-service digital
communications network, including high-resolution teleconferencing, on-demand
films and other pay-per-view video, local news and school listings, classi-fied
advertisements, World Wide Web resources, and mul-timedia programming. TCI
itself is furiously upgrading and streamlining all its billing systems to
accommodate this rich transactional environment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Z E R O   M A R G I N A L    M A G I C <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important, as Nathan Myhrvold ex-plains, is the extension of
the computer model of flat-rate pricing into the field of communications.
When you buy a PC, you purchase its MIPS and bits essentially at a flat
rate. The average cost per MIP or bit of memory you use is de-termined by
how much you use the machine. The marginal cost is zero. As a result, people
have a powerful incentive to use computers as intensively and creatively
as possible. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This flat-rate pricing effect-where incremental costs are essentially zero-largely
explains the huge success of the general-purpose PC and the companies supplying
it with software and peripherals. Faced with a zero marginal cost of incremental
use, PC owners channel as much of their information processing, education
and entertainment as possible through the PC. Flat-rate pricing makes the
PC a dire threat to all contiguous industries and related functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, on the Internet model, you will pay a flat rate for bandwidth.
Again marginal costs will be zero. Average cost will respond to the extent
of usage rather than to a Public Utilities Commission tariff or some per-minute
charge. As Myhrvold points out, this approach will give you a tremendous
incentive to exploit bandwidth as fully as you can, channeling as much communication
as possible away from systems that charge incrementally and toward flat-rate
systems. In the end, nearly all communications will gravitate toward the
Internet model, and companies will prosper to the extent that they can ally
themselves with this tremendous force of creativity and economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Myhrvold now says that bandwidth is growing at the same pace as Moore's
Law. Gates, too, though long alert to the effects of exponentials in semiconductors,
is strange-ly blind to the faster trajec-tory of communications. He finds
the Internet a big sur-prise: &quot;Who predicted it?&quot; he asks. &quot;Let's
find the guy and make him king.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But by any measure- nodes, total bandwidth, traf-fic- the Internet has been
dou-bling every year since 1970, and many people have pre-dicted that it
would come to dominate communications. I prophesied in 1989 that it would
usurp television. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today I believe the band-width tidal wave will sweep away the notions of
Gates and Myhrvold of a smooth middleband transition for Microsoft and its
boob-tube collaborators. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Increasingly released from regulatory restrictions, band-width is now expanding
far faster than MIPS and bits (see <I>Forbes ASAP</I>, &quot;The Bandwidth
Tidal Wave,&quot; Dec. 5, 1994). Over the next five years, for example,
@Home will increase the bandwidth to home- and small-business computers
by a factor of thousands. While Moore's Law doubles com-puter power every
18 months, the law of the telecosm, by the most conservative possible measure,
doubles total band-width every 12 months. This adds up. Over the next decade,
computers will im-prove a hundredfold while bandwidth will expand a thou-sandfold.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Until this year, the computer and software industries have drafted behind
Moore's Law, while hiding behind what Roger McNamee has dubbed &quot;Moron's
Law&quot;-the telecom regulations that stifle bandwidth expansion. The industry
thus has thrived by employing MIPS and bits as a replacement for bandwidth
by using compression, de-compression, switching speed, and logic circuitry
to make up for the constrained bandwidth of public networks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove capped off this tradition in early October, in a memorable keynote
address, following South African pres-ident Nelson Mandela to the podium,
at the Telecom 95 quadrennial exposition in Geneva. Grove wowed the large
audience of telco potentates with an on-stage real-time demonstration of
Intel's Proshare teleconferencing tech-nology. And yet, what chiefly struck
the viewer was the mediocrity of the partial-screen facial images. They
were far lower in resolution than ordinary television. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As long as the pictures are inferior to TV images, PC teleconferencing will
remain chiefly a niche or a stunt. As bandwidth expands powerful-ly over
the next decade, it will seem increasingly perverse to substitute processing
for band-width, and more and more inviting to substitute band-width for
processing. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The logic of MIPS and bandwidth works both ways. Not only can processing
make up for bandwidth, but bandwidth, as Claude Shan-non pointed out in
1948, can serve as a substitute for switching and other comput-er functions.
With bandwidth now expanding faster than processing speeds, new ar-chitectures
will prevail by substituting bandwidth for MIPS and bits. Today, the bulk
of bandwidth to homes is coaxial cable laid over the last 25 years by the
cable tele-vision industry. Exploiting that bandwidth for the Inter-net
is the single greatest opportunity in the history of in-formation technology.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
HAVING ASCERTAINED that Doerr had been meeting reg-ularly with all the pioneers
of the new paradigm that Andreessen was &quot;mind-melding&quot; with Medin,
and that Mal-one had been consulting with Doerr and McNealy, I ask McNealy
whether he has talked to Medin. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No,&quot; he answers, &quot;I have not talked with Medin at all ...
since lunch on Wednesday. But back then he and I had sore necks from basically
agreeing with what the other was saying. We're fighting like crazy to become
the standard platform for Medin's environment. Our companies are in-credibly
well aligned. We have a list of about 12 engineering efforts that we are
undertaking and driving at Medin's request. The power of a network comes
from the number of nodes times the bandwidth. By this measure, the @Home
opportunity is as big as there is.&quot; McNealy revealed that the day before
in his office at Sun, he saw the demo of &quot;a diskless, CD-less, floppyless,
OS-less computer, and it was great. It had just about every bus, serial
and parallel and S-bus, and every kind of interface you can imagine. With
connectors on all four sides, it was a model for what I call a zero-administration
client. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Consider: If you give a user a disk drive, a CD, a floppy, an OS and
16 megabytes of memory, you have made him, whether he wants it or not, a
system administrator. He has so many resources to manage. What they showed
me yesterday was a virtual machine written in Java, and it booted up instantly
off flash ROM and ran like crazy be-cause the virtual machine rides so close
on the hardware.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Echoing Medin and Corrigan, McNealy evoked the future of the teleputer:
&quot;Put a touch screen on it and make it a kiosk, put a large screen on
it and make it a worksta-tion, put in an infrared detector and make it a
set-top box, put a joystick on it and make a game machine, put a cable modem
or an ISDN port on it and make it a PC or a digital phone. You never run
out of disk space; you never have to back it up; it's mirrored so you never
lose your files. You have an uninterruptible power supply. Your phone or
cable line is much more reliable than your hard drive on your PC. You get
used to the security of the system with no disks to corrupt and with Java
programs that execute only in a virtual machine and cannot invade your system.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
McNealy might have added, in ecumenical concern for Larry Ellison's mother,
&quot;Put in some Oracle code and you have a terrific, cheap database client
in an emerging world of far-flung databases.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All the participants in the new regime agree. Combined with a broadband
network, the teleputer will be more flex-ible and powerful than existing
PCs. Rolling out both the network and the teleputer will be the central
activity in the industry over the next two years. Responding to it will
be the principal challenge to Gates and Grove, and possibly a route of redemption
for their companies. All the leading figures in this Silicon Valley renaissance
have endured recent periods of trial and failure. Malone suf-fered the collapse
of his Bell Atlantic merger in 1994 and the long stagnation of his stock.
Corrigan suffered physical collapse and the slump of his company. McNealy
endured a long tunnel of shrinking market share as his SuperSPARC processor
proved too complex to keep pace with rivals. Clark of Netscape lost influence
at Silicon Graphics, the company he had founded, and finally had to leave
in order to retain his self-respect. Even Doerr lost his touch for several
years. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For Bill Gates, however, business life has been an al-most unrelenting ascent
toward riches untold for one so young. In the end, his success has made
him seem a bionic business leader leached of his humanity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
His company has appeared to government and to competitors alike as a monopoly
threat, targeting existing rivals and systematically suppressing them, rather
than creating new products and industries. Much the same is said of Intel.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps this is the time for the Wintel team to face a domestic challenge.
From it they may well emerge stronger. Without them, it is clear, the Internet
will be weaker. Only from the crucible of competition between paradigms
can emerge a robust and redemptive new economy of information. <BR>

<H3>In 1995, Internet stories trumped even O.J. The Net will have a far
happier ending. </H3>

<BR>
Well, it had to happen. As the Internet emerges as the central nervous system
of global capitalism, the Luddite left is bursting into &quot;flames&quot;
against the microcosm and telecosm, against interlinked computers and the
global radiance of electromagnetic communications. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This rising resistance resonates with the press coverage that has long lavished
attention on the excesses of the Net. Richard Shaffer of the Computer Letter
counts 39,158 Internet stories during the first three quarters of 1995,
beating O.J. by some 15,000 citations. Much of the coverage has been lurid.
For psychedelic visions of virtual reality, the media have exalted Jaron
Lanier in dreadlocks and bankruptcy above Bob Metcalfe, creator of Ethernet,
or Gordon Moore, inventor of IC processing, or Charles Kao, father of fiber
optics, all of whom reshaped the boundaries of human possibility. Computer
viruses and Net porn win headlines and magazine covers that elude the creators
of vast new computer powers, such as RSA encryption or the World Wide Web
or new tools of chip fabrication at the quarter-micron level. Last August,
Windows 95, a modest advance in operating systems, exploded across the press
and the airwaves as if the entire media had been preempted for a Microsoft
infomercial. No wonder befuddled academics, politicians and book publishers
gain a grotesquely distorted view of the industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Tom Peters's first Forbes ASAP interview (March 29, 1993), he predicted
that the '90s would see a fabulous unfolding of new technology, accompanied
with increasing outbreaks of technophobia, Ludditism and Marxism. Alvin
Toffler greeted the initial readers of Wired with a similar dual prophecy
of networked marvels, foiled by a multifront war against the Third Wave.
Once again, Peters and Toffler may well be right, as from Hollywood to Harvard,
America's brainlords rebel against computer technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In his pungent new book War of the Worlds, Mark Slouka joins the rising
chorus of resistance. Slouka finds it all a &quot;kind of lie.&quot; Like
a &quot;speech of Ronald Reagan&quot; or a spiritual vision from the &quot;religious
right,&quot; the virtual world is increasingly usurping reality and identity
itself. &quot;Rather than doing away with the couch potato, the telecomputer
has actually created a new, more tenacious variety of tuber: the individual
who swivels from the television screen to computer monitor without missing
a beat . . . .&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, Sandra Bullock writhes in anguish in the sinister clutches of The
Net, with a blond, predatory, arachnoid Bill Gates (using &quot;Gateway&quot;
software) masterminding the Web. Similar chimeras recur in antitech crusades.
Bathed in the ultraviolet frequencies of sunlight, humans throughout the
history of the species have raced through a planetary magnetic field of
half a gauss in power on a terrestrial sphere charged by worldwide lightning
strikes a hundred times a second to a capacitive level of 100 volts per
meter of height. Yet Paul Brodeur and other electrophobes panic at power
lines, power plants, cathode-ray tubes, microprocessors, cellular antennas
and other high-tech oscillators with an impact on humans measurable only
in millionths of a gauss. They defy the fact that around the world use of
electricity correlates almost perfectly with greater longevity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, despite the higher longevity and the globally spreading jobs
and riches springing from high technology, pseudoeconomists prattle endlessly
about the growing gap between the &quot;information rich&quot; and the &quot;information
poor.&quot; Publishers sign up other disgruntled nerds to write hymns to
noble savagery and gardening. And from the fever swamps, a Marxist enrage
posts bombs through the mail and addled editors detonate them in the pages
of the Washington Post. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such fears and fantasies have always afflicted the course of human innovation
and progress. With life expectancies rising eight years in the developed
countries and 22 years in the Third World since 1950, people have more time
to lash out at industrial benefactors who gain wealth and create it from
sources hard to comprehend. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Misconceptions about the Internet, however, also abound in more savvy circles.
From Stewart Alsop's Agenda conference to the Internet Society, serious
critics are emerging to predict that the network itself will bog down and
degrade, jammed by traffic and trivia. Often unconsciously, these critics
feed upon a spurious vision of capitalist ecology. Constantly recycling
Garrett Hardin's &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&quot; as a theory of the
Internet, writers such as Clifford Stoll in Silicon Snake Oil, and others
from publications such as the New York Times to the National Review and
the Atlantic, predict that the Web, as a public good, will be overgrazed,
like the commonly owned fields of feudal Britain. Each herdsman or entrepreneur
gains from adding to his herd or bandwidth, beating rivals to the remaining
grass or spectrum, until congestion ruins the common space. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the epitome of a capitalist commons, the Internet, according to the critics'
predictions, will collapse under the impact of this law, clogged with traffic
and polluted with porn and violence. As a precursor, the same writers cite
citizens band radio, an earlier fad that rose meteorically and collapsed
ignominiously when, as they see it, millions of middle- and lower-class
hoi polloi rushed in and polluted the bandwidth without renewing it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Overall, the resistance converges many streams of reaction. In general,
the &quot;humanist&quot; opponents mistake the Internet for a continuation
of television technology. Thus they ascribe to the Internet the very flaws
that they find in TV -- crudeness, violence, porn, entertainment for &quot;diverting
ourselves to death&quot; -- and extend to the computer the old and mostly
valid arguments of Neil Postman and Jerry Mander against the idiot box.
Some of the other critics of the Internet benefit from TV and fear the Web
will replace their familiar tube. The executives of media companies are
mostly baffled by the new technology. Paralyzed by market research, as Jim
Barksdale, CEO of Netscape puts it, &quot;They are trying to build bridges
by counting the swimmers.&quot; A Washington lobbyist for a long-distance
carrier wonders poignantly if &quot;America is ready for all this bandwidth.&quot;
Baby Bells spurn the Internet to fund Hollywood films and TV. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Blinded by the robber-baron image assigned in U.S. history courses to the
heroic builders of American capitalism, many critics see Bill Gates as a
menacing monopolist. They mistake for greed the gargantuan tenacity of Microsoft
as it struggles to assure the compatibility of its standard with tens of
thousands of applications and peripherals over generations of dynamically
changing technology (avoiding the dialectical babel of the more open Unix,
for example). They see the Internet as another arena likely to be dominated
by Microsoft and a few giant media companies, increasing the wealth of Wall
Street at the expense of the stultified masses of consumers and opening
an ever-greater gap between the &quot;information rich&quot; and the &quot;information
poor.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Focused on the summits of the industry -- CEO s&eacute;ances among media
conglomerates and software kings -- all the critics can foster the impression
that the Internet is a questionable, unpromising venue, vulnerable to monopoly
and trash, thereby vindicating the Luddites and the Cassandras. From the
beginning of its civilian eruption, however (see Forbes ASAP, &quot;The
Issaquah Miracle,&quot; June 7, 1993), the Net has risen from the bottom
up rather than from the top down; by nature, it is a heterarchy rather than
a hierarchy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To get a view of the future of the Net, let us turn aside from Herb Allen's
golfing groves and Bill Gates's mansion and Louis Gerstner's &quot;net-centric&quot;
revelation, and visit some of the fertile bottomlands where the Web is growing
fastest. Here no robber barons or monopolists come into view and there are
no signs at all of an impending slide toward tragedy and decline. Here the
negative externalities of the degraded commons fall before the huge positive
externalities of Moore's Law and Metcalfe's Law, the microcosm and the telecosm,
where smaller transistors yield exponentially more efficient machines and
the value of networks rises by the square of the power of all the computers
attached to them. Governing the positive externalities of the Internet is
the convergence of these forces, compounded by the creativity of entrepreneurs.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps such a combinatorial explosion explains the mind of Avi Freedman
of Net Access. Among the vanguard of the armies of the Internet, Freedman
is a classic American entrepreneur, entirely alien to the megalithic visions
of the critics. As an Internet service provider (ISP), Freedman supplies
the Philadelphia area with access to the goods and services of this global
ganglion of networks at a flat rate of between $12.50 and $20 per month,
depending on the services chosen. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Net Access still operates chiefly out of his cellar in a marginally middle-class
suburb of Wyndmoor. The street bristles with wires, transformer nodes, terminal
boxes and power lines, many of them converging on the duplex red-brick bungalow
where Freedman lives with his wife in an apartment above a basement crammed
floor-to-ceiling with multiplying racks of electromagnetic conversion and
processing gear for computers and telecom. These technologies are all oscillating
and radiating like crazy in the spirit of their hyperkinetic owner, who
is multiplexing Internet insights between his cellular phone and an attentive
audience of aspiring ISPs from western Pennsylvania and geek students visiting
from the University of Pennsylvania, gathered at his door next to the power-line
link. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is this an entrepreneurial dream, or a carcinogenic nightmare out of the
muddled pages of Paul Brodeur? Avi is too busy to give the issue much thought.
Extending business service to New York City, Washington, D.C., and Chicago,
overflowing his basement, he is now moving his operations to a collocation
cage at the Philadelphia central office of MFS (Metropolitan Fiber Systems)
where he has just turned up a T-3 fiber circuit (45 megabits per second)
direct to MAE East, the major East Coast Internet exchange point. From Seattle
to San Jose, top companies are besieging him with multimillion-dollar buyout
offers, but looking to the future and its promise, Freedman calculates that
he can't afford to sell. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With only 4,000 customers, however, Net Access hardly seems to pose a threat
to such local colossi as Bell Atlantic and Comcast, now searching the world
for &quot;content&quot; opportunities and looming ever larger on Rodeo Drive.
Yet Ray Smith and Brian Roberts should pay attention to what is going on
in Freedman's teeming mind and basement. Millions of PC owners may well
become part-time Internet service providers in the future -- as their home
and small-business PCs supply content for others, perhaps beginning with
teleconferencing and telecommuting activities that will soon dwarf Hollywood
in volume. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the students hanging on Freedman's words, for example, is Meng-Weng
Wong, whose personal Web page at Penn attracts some 35,000 hits a week with
its restaurant reviews, film criticisms, Philadelphia maps, technology insights
and other delectations. Drawing wide media attention, from Forbes ASAP to
Scandinavian TV (a crew is visiting this very day from the Netherlands),
Wong has now established a server at Net Access, pobox.com, which supplies
his clients with a permanent Internet address wherever they may go, and
he is developing a Web-page design business. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Responding to the onrush of innovative customers like Wong, the configuration
of Freedman's bottom-up operations offers clues to the future shape of the
industry. A portly, perspiring, blond, balding geek-genius bursting with
monologic humor and street smarts -- hardly full-duplex (scant signs of
upstream flow) -- Freedman has just hustled past his 26th birthday. He has
been deep in computers since age eight, when a prescient uncle gave him
a book on the Basic programming language at a Seder. Within months he was
entrenched among the information rich, opening an unbridgeable gap in computer
savvy between himself and nearly all of the other five billion inhabitants
of the planet. If you think you are going to catch up, forget it. By the
age of 12, in 1982, he was an active user of e-mail and Usenet news and
familiar with the abstruse command codes of the Unix operating system that
ran on his father's DEC PDP-11. Freedman senior, a pulmonary physician,
inherited the machine indirectly from Bell Labs, where it had been employed
as a Usenet news hub until displaced by a VAX. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1986, still a teenager, Freedman began exploring the uses of Unix machines
for commercial databases and discovered to his surprise that serious businessmen
would give him gouts of money to get help with their computers. Eventually,
he was earning &quot;lawyers' rates&quot; (his mother is a Philadelphia
tax attorney) for work he found &quot;amazingly routine&quot; and &quot;even
fun.&quot; Nonetheless, after high school, his parents sent him off to college
in Massachusetts, where his computer skills were underappreciated. He returned
after a few weeks to get a job at the National Software Testing Labs in
the Philadelphia suburb of Conshohocken before enlisting at nearby Temple
University, which he chose because it offered more freedom for computer
experiments and consulting work than the more prestigious Penn a few miles
away. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After arriving, he discovered that Temple's computer lab also commanded
a superb resource: bandwidth, in the form of a nearly empty T-1 line linking
to the Internet at 1.544 megabits per second. Already computer rich, he
was becoming communications rich as well. In Avi Freedman, Temple's department
of computer science got rather more than it bargained for. Realizing that
the available PCs were network hostile and the lab's MicroVAXes ran VMS
rather than Unix, Freedman used his savings to buy five secondhand Sun 3
workstations for $600 apiece. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In short order, Freedman began his career as an Internet service provider
and &quot;professional geek,&quot; albeit unpaid. Soon he had some 100 students
as users, mostly cavorting through games of Multiuser Dungeons (MUD). Temple's
address, supplied by Freedman -- bigboy.cis.temple.edu -- became known far
and wide as a hive of MUD activity. Temple's computer science professors
began to rebel at this untoward distinction, particularly when they found
that lost in the crypts and catacombs of the Net, their charges were virtually
unreachable for assignments in higher-level languages. Freedman was forced
to close down local access to the game portions of the server during daytime
hours. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman has given some thought to the problem of &quot;how to civilize
young, intelligent teenage males.&quot; He concludes, &quot;You have got
to get them interested.&quot; He says the students playing MUD at least
were learning Unix commands, &quot;a better way to get a job than mastering
the Pascal programming language,&quot; which was then being taught in the
regular classes. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a student, working with Prof. Yuan Shi and other Temple professors, Freedman
developed a toolkit for distributed processing on Suns and presented a paper
in London in 1989 at a conference on computer-aided software engineering.
As his time at Temple drew to a close, he began contemplating graduate school.
&quot;Everyone was very surprised that anyone who could do anything on the
outside was going to graduate school,&quot; he says, &quot;but Stony Brook
on Long Island offered me a nice job as a research assistant in the lab
and I went up there.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After graduating from Temple, Freedman also encountered the harsh facts
of life in the world beyond college computer laboratories. With their local-area
networks and T-1 links to the Internet, universities offered a revel for
budding cybernauts. Marc Andreessen of Netscape discovered a similar disjunction
between college lab and residential communications. At LAN's end was a communications
cliff and a bandwidth scandal. Most homes and offices connected to the world
only through twisted-pair, four-kilohertz, copper telephone wires. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In October of 1992, Freedman became an ISP chiefly to continue his college
revels by chasing bandwidth. Twenty-three at the time and engaged, he could
still recall his days in high school and remembered how much he had learned
from the Internet through his father's PDP-11. He began to fill up his basement
with second-hand Sun machines, mostly at prices well below new Pentium levels,
all using Berkeley Unix, equipped by Bill Joy with fast TCP/IP (Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) for Internet access. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beginning with 40 customers from local bulletin board systems, Freedman
provided access through the serial ports of a single SPARCstation IPC with
a 200-megabyte hard drive and 12 megabytes of memory that he purchased secondhand
for $1,500. The serial ports ran up to 38.4 kilobits per second, linked
to 14.4-kilobit-per-second Zoom and Supra modems connected to POTS (plain
old telephone service) outside lines running from the phone company's central
office. Costing a total of some $4,000, the system worked well enough until
his clientele began to multiply and the modems balked at continual resetting.
In April 1992, he bought a 16-port Iolan terminal server that answered the
phones and connected subscribers to the Sun servers, which supplied e-mail,
Usenet news, Gopher searches, Telnet and file-transfer services in a Unix
environment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In June of 1992 emerged the menace of competition. A local entrepreneur
launched Voicenet by simply linking a 386 PC with a modem to each phone
line through a terminal server. Charging fees several times higher than
Net Access's, Voicenet thrived through the device of hiring two full-time
people to scan in pictures from porno magazines for what Freedman describes
as the &quot;sticky keyboard set.&quot; Eventually the &quot;adult&quot;
bulletin board service enlisted some 5,000 members paying $4 per hour to
peruse images. Nonetheless, Voicenet protested what it called Net Access's
predatory low pricing, a $12.50 to $20 flat rate per month with no full-time
employees to pay. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the early years of the Net's development, the late '80s, the Internet
business outside campuses and corporations was a small-time and sometimes
tacky trade. In 1992, the entire Net comprised a million linked computers,
many of them in university and government labs. It wasn't until November
1993 that Net Access acquired a dedicated 56-kilobit line for direct connection
to an official network access point. Costing $400 per month, it multiplexed
22 dial-up modems among 250 users. With the Mosaic World Wide Web browser
yet to catch on outside the universities, Net Access did not even have to
supply SLIP (serial line interface protocol) or PPP (point-to-point protocol)
accounts, which shield the user from the details of Unix. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman, however, saw the need for new technology to link people to the
full resources of the Net without having to know abstruse Unix commands.
&quot;As a professional geek, writing code is my true calling,&quot; he
says, adding that he threw himself into this work. Although the program
was eclipsed by Mosaic, Lynx and other approaches, he still believes that
his software provided easier access to the Internet, complete with the ability
to trace routes and &quot;ping&quot; remote machines. Enabling users to
log in to the program in 1992, he put Net Access on the technological forefront
of ISPs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The largest challenge for an ISP, then and now, is managing the floods of
bits engulfing a Usenet news server at a rate of some 500 megabytes per
day, five news articles per second, each with a unique identification that
has to be scanned to assure that the news is fresh and not duplicated. The
heart of the Internet until the arrival of the World Wide Web -- and still
cherished more than the Web by many Internet veterans -- Usenet is the huge
collection of textual bulletin boards and other information troves and exchanges
from which the communities of the Net exfoliate. As Steve Willens of Livingston
Enterprises puts it: &quot;This is the real source of the Internet as we
know it and the challenge that forced the development of technology specialized
for the Net&quot; -- notably Livingston communications servers that linked
modems to the Net through fast comports functioning with compression at
115.2 kilobits per second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, Freedman recognized he had a major business on his hands. He decided
to lease a T-1 line from PREP-NET (Pennsylvania Research and Economic Partnership
Network), which required a prepayment of $1,000 per month. With 50 phone
lines and modems and 500 users, he broke all ties with Stony Brook and began
hiring people to handle a rising tide of traffic and a surging demand for
technical support. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That summer, he had three full-time people: &quot;Myself, my wife, Gail,
and my 20-year-old brother, Noam. Working with him made me realize why people
pay me so much money as a consultant [up to $150 an hour]. He served as
a kind of Avi echo, intuitively knowing what I wanted and when.&quot; A
student in computer science at the University of Chicago, Noam is in the
process of extending the business to that city, while Avi has established
points of presence in New York and Washington, D.C. He has hired five Net
Access customers, none with college degrees, to provide technical support
full time as the number of users has climbed at a pace of some 15% per month
since the end of 1994. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For links to other cities, Freedman relied on advice from telecommunications
consultant Gordon Jacobson, a Penn alumnus who maintains close links to
the Penn school of engineering, where his father graduated. With Jacobson's
help, Freedman is ending 1995 with a fiber circuit connecting him to MAE
East at 45 megabits a second, a 10-megabit-per-second link to Sprint's network-access
point, and more than half a dozen point-to-point T-1 lines, all for well
under half of the normally tariffed prices for these services. With increasing
broadband connectivity, Net Access commands more than half as much bandwidth
at the nerve centers of the Net as Netcom, which has 50 times more customers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Though indispensable, technology alone cannot sustain a successful ISP.
It is people that make the vital difference. If Freedman had originally
hired people to perform the work that he did himself part-time -- &quot;keeping
the machines running, maintaining software, recovering from disasters, installing
and tuning equipment and circuits&quot; -- he would have incurred expenses
of some $100,000 per year and his financial model would have collapsed.
The reason many corporations are so slow to develop Internet programs is
not the lack of equipment but the dearth of personnel. The large companies
pursuing Net Access did not care about Freedman's rooms full of gear. They
were after Freedman himself. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman's entrepreneurship and technology ride on a tide of other enterprise
by the suppliers of Internet gear. These, too, are not huge telephone company
equipment manufacturers or rising software monopolists but mostly small
or medium-size companies, led by young entrepreneurs, fighting to survive
in the most intensely competitive arena of the world economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
An Internet service provider must begin by supplying modems through which
the outside world can connect to his offerings. With millions of home customers
who dwarf the ISP modem volumes, U.S. Robotics is currently ascendant in
most ISPs, but Freedman spurns them for cheaper devices from Multi-Tech.
These modems connect to a Xylogics terminal server that authenticates the
name and password combination entered by the user and validates the caller
as legitimate. Then the customer enters Net Access's local-area network
linking a set of Sun Microsystems servers that supply World Wide Web, Gopher,
Usenet, e-mail, file transfer, Telnet and other Internet services. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Net Access is unusual for an ISP, since few use Xylogics equipment. Recently
bought out by Bay Networks, Xylogics supplied nearly all the terminal servers
for the university market, and it still shies away from the tumultuous world
of ISPs. These customers mostly use Livingston products that run a security
protocol named Radius (remote authentication dial-in user services). Channeling
the bits around the ISP's internal net and on to other networks are banks
of routers, also often built by Cisco or Livingston (although Freedman originally
chose Morningstar because it was cheaper). Linking a particular ISP to other
ISPs and network access points are T-1 cables running at 1.544 megabits
per second through multiplexing and demultiplexing and conditioning equipment.
These functions are performed by DSU-CSUs (data service units-channel service
units) made by such companies as TxPort, Adtran, General DataComm and ADC
Kentrox. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman insists on the Law of the Microcosm in choosing all his equipment
and in making all his projects for expansion. Since his study of distributed
computing at Temple, he has everywhere cherished duplication and redundancy
and cheap components over centralization and scale economies. He at first
bought a nine-gigabyte drive from Micropolis. Now he regrets the decision
and is replacing it with five two-gigabyte drives (more I/O [input/output],
redundancy and reliability). &quot;The more spindles the better,&quot; he
says. He buys lots of cheap secondhand Suns rather than one powerful server.
He criticizes some of the larger ISPs, such as Netcom, for centralizing
their servers and technical support. It causes bottlenecks and delays, he
says, and opens the system to crashes if any of the communication lines
go down. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman's rule is to provide service as locally as possible. He believes
ISPs with fully equipped local network sites, rather than mere communications
nodes like Netcom's, will prevail. Like most small ISPs, Freedman is wedded
to flat-rate pricing, though his accounts of altercations with customers
who want to resell or overgraze his commons may undermine confidence that
this pricing regime can survive into the future. But managing flat-rate
prices is a core competence of the ISPs. Believing that bits will flee toward
flat rates, Freedman says MCI will fail in its plans to transform Internet
pricing models by adding some as yet unannounced scale of measured usage
based on time, packets or both. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is Freedman's model scalable, or is it doomed as he grows? Could Freedman
be displaced by MCI or Sprint-Comcast or Bell Atlantic or Microsoft-UUNet
or AT&T in a siege of merger-monopolization? He believes that up until a
threshold of some 25,000 to 50,000 customers, meaning revenues of between
$5 million and $10 million net of more lucrative business clients, his economic
and technical model can trump all comers. At that point, he will face the
usual entrepreneurial crisis of transition: Freedman will need business
partners, routinized technology management schemes and expensive accounting
to maintain operations as Net Access spreads across the country. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But he does not fear competition. His problems, he says, are servicing the
flood of new customers and anticipating the depredations of &quot;Congresscritters&quot;
who want to make him liable for any vagrant flasher who strays onto one
of his hard drives. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still a small force in the global matrix of telecommunications, Freedman
now dreams of exploiting available resources of fiber, dark and lit, to
acquire major new bandwidth, linking cities up and down the East Coast and
across the U.S. Helping Freedman move this project toward reality is his
telecom guru Jacobson, an entrepreneurial dervish from Portman Communications.
With financiers on the line to supply some $5 million in startup capital,
Jacobson is planning to launch a national IRamp network. The service will
ultimately open fully staffed Internet access facilities in 30 cities nationwide,
linked everywhere by fiber, at a cost of some $1 million per site. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such investment looms large compared to the rock-bottom base of Freedman's
operation, and easily eclipses a national ISP's point-of-presence facility
that can cost upwards of $70,000. But David Farber, gigabit-testbed guru,
recently told a New York audience at the Penn Club that, spurred by business
needs, the marketplace is seeking higher-end, stable-broadband ISP services
that can handle millions of hits a day at a Web site with no access delays
or congestion and that provide local access and custom software configuration.
For these high-end customers, the SPARC 20 servers and T-1 and 56-kilobit
links of the many small ISPs will no longer suffice. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pioneering the kind of broadband channels that will eventually become ubiquitous
on the Net, IRamp's planned facilities will command OC-3 fiber (155 megabits
per second) links to a national network of both dark and lit fiber, available
from utilities, pipelines and other unusual sources. Such bypass strategies
will become increasingly common in coming years. The 10 million miles of
fiber currently installed in the U.S., after all, is exploited to approximately
one-millionth of its potential capacity -- and much of it is unused &quot;dark
fiber.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For key ISP server and security functions, Jacobson plans to use fully fault-tolerant
Tandem S4000 servers running the new ServerNet multibus scheme. It was conceived
by venerable Tandem designer Robert Horst as a new-generation architecture
explicitly optimized to substitute bandwidth for switching speeds. Fully
scalable, ServerNet was licensed in October by Compaq, yet it commands a
theoretical throughput limit of an unprecedented petabit per second (a million
billion bits). For graphics-intensive applications, Jacobson envisages Silicon
Graphics WebForce Challenge S servers using Irix software. Even with as
few as 5,000 subscribers per site paying a competitive nonusage-based rate,
Jacobson projects a high rate of return. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, at Netcom, the nation's largest ISP, David Garrison, the CEO,
is undergoing the stresses that Freedman foresees for himself as he expands
his business. During his previous stint at the helm of the meteoric paging
company, SkyTel, Garrison, a rangy dark-haired entrepreneur with a slight
uneasiness in his ready smile of prosperity, thought he had approached the
ultimate in entrepreneurial excitement. But nothing in his career in the
wireless industry prepared him for his first nine months as head of Netcom.
Here is a company that during the last three quarters grew from 400 to 1,200
employees, from 58 to 201 points of presence, from 72,000 to more than 200,000
customers, and from revenues of $12.4 million in 1994 to a $50 million run
rate in 1995 and to a market cap of some $400 million, while the traffic
in bits grows at an even faster pace -- impelled by the graphic demands
of the World Wide Web, itself expanding at the rate of more than 1,000 new
servers per week. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netcom pares down its points of presence to simple communications nodes
and handles all the technical support and Internet services for them at
the company's headquarters. This operation fills up a high-rise in San Jose.
Some floors teem with desks manned by earnest engineers in jeans, many of
them Asian, working the phones. Other floors are replete with row upon row
of racks filled wall-to-wall with Cisco routers, Sun servers, Livingston
PortMasters, Ascend ISDN pipelines, Cascade edge switches and U.S. Robotics
modems. Walking through these ever-expanding mazes of machinery, Garrison's
entrepreneurial smile at times moves from the ready to the giddy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this environment of riotous growth, the telcos move their slow thighs
like trolls under the bridges and routers of the Internet. Currently commanding
perhaps 2% of the traffic, AT&amp;T, for example, has declared its ambition
to capture 60% of the Internet business over the next two years. But Garrison
demurs: &quot;From the Olympian perspective of a McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant,
AT&amp;T could take over any business. They have one of the greatest brand
names in the world, they've got more money than God, a billing relationship
with some 40 million people, a global network and alliances and consortia,
Internet pioneer Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman in their fold, and they have
perhaps the world's largest internal World Wide Web on their own Unix servers
among their 300,000 employees.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But like most of the telcos, AT&amp;T lacks focus. As Netcom marketing chief
John Zeisler explains: &quot;Phone companies have their 700 numbers, 800
numbers, corporate customers, their Hollywood links, their leased lines,
their frame relay, their ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line), their
cable aspirations, their huge wireless opportunities, their bureaucracy,
their regulatory tariffs, their pricing confusions. Should voice be priced
as data or should data be priced as voice? They are great at laying fiber
and wire, connecting it to switches and bringing signals to the central
office and to the curb. But the Internet is a second thought, just another
business to them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As in the PC industry, focus and agility are crucial. In an arena where
the technologies ride a remorseless onrush of exponential changes, no prolonged
bureaucratic process can succeed. Even the maps and schematics of rapid
convergence among media industries miss the point. Dominating this arena
is the computer industry -- with its millions of piranha processors and
entrepreneurs -- and it doesn't converge with anything; it eats everything
in its path. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now ascendant is the Internet computer industry. Most of these new companies,
from Livingston to Netscape, focus on the Internet. Using personal computer
components to reduce the price of ISP infrastructure far below the price
of telco installations, these companies endow the ISPs with a further advantage
in a dynamic industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Livingston Enterprises epitomizes the success of the new companies creating
this new industry. Secreted in Pleasanton, Calif., and financed by corporate
cash flow, Livingston has grown up with the Internet at a pace not far in
the wake of its more illustrious rival, Cisco Systems. Livingston PortMasters
crowd Netcom's headquarters, as they do most of the other ISPs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Launched in 1989 under the leadership of Steven Sillens, then a manager
of multiprocessors at Sun Microsystems, Livingston's networking drive began
by creating a cheap router and communications server based on a new operating
system, ComOS, specifically developed to help ISPs meet their Usenet burdens.
Livingston quickly became a dominant force in Internet terminal servers
and routers, and grew at a pace of more than 50% per year until engulfed
by an explosion of demand in 1995. In August of this year, Livingston launched
cheap low-end routers to serve both ends of an Internet connection: a $1,395
two-port PortMaster to link small offices to the Net at up to 230.4 kilobits
per second and a sleek space-saving $3,495 PortMaster with 24 ports for
ISPs. In October, Livingston announced a series of ISDN remote-access machines
that will compete with the currently dominant Ascend ISDN pipeline system,
if ISDN becomes the preferred mode of Internet access. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now, everywhere in the Internet industry companies are resigning themselves
to ISDN as the next &quot;modem&quot; (though, in fact it just brings into
home and office the 64Kbps digital channels long used by the telcos between
central offices). The scandal of U.S. telecom, however, is that the telcos
could just as easily be bringing video capable T-1 service (1.544 megabits
per second of bandwidth, equivalent to CD-ROMs) to homes if regulations
permitted a reasonable tariff structure. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, new access technologies are emerging, such as cable modems and
AT&amp;T's new SDSL (symmetrical digital subscriber loop). Available this
year and under test by Bell Atlantic, SDSL modems promise to bring T-1-Line
capability to homes on twisted-pair copper wires for about $10 a month.
SDSL follows many such copper prosthetics announced over the years (notably
HDSL) [high bit rate digital subscriber line] from Level One, PairGain,
Brooktree and others), all largely spurned by the telcos on pricing grounds,
but capable of transforming the entire world of Internet access before ISDN's
niggardly pipes catch on with the public. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While Internet hardware rushes ahead, Netscape, Sun and other providers
of Internet software make the ISP a fast and elusively moving target for
the telcos that wish to compete. With eight million browsers in the field,
all upgradeable to the new 2.0 system--with the Java interpreter and Java
multimedia programming language and toolkit--Netscape expects to attract
some 100,000 software developers to its platform over the next year. There
are already some 400 Java applications available, including word processors,
spreadsheets and games that can play on any machine with a browser running
a Java interpreter, regardless of operating system or microprocessor instruction
set. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netscape's expected army of 100,000 developers compares with some 10,000
developers for Apple's Macintosh and perhaps 3,000 for Microsoft's network,
MSN. Emerging from a company that did not even exist two years ago, such
a juggernaut will further empower the ISPs in their competition with the
large invaders of the territory--not only the telcos but also the on-line
services such as American Online and MSN. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The ISPs, however, are not usually in direct competition with the large
phone companies. ISPs bring them new customers and new business users, and
the ISPs also depend on them for home connections and for potential fiber-trunking
services. The American telcos are currently laying some 1,300 miles of fiber-optic
line every day. Moreover, beginning with TCI's and Kleiner Perkins' @home
system, which functions with cable modems and new software from Netscape,
the ISPs also may end up using cable plant. As cable modems become available,
cable companies will likely turn to the ISPs to supply Internet services,
local content, technical support and point-of-presence technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of these whitewater torrents of change, the some 4,000 ISPs
and their increasing armies of supporters represent a serious threat to
many of the established empires of telecom. Not only can they move much
faster and more resourcefully, but they also have the key advantage of having
bet exclusively on the PC and the Internet as the platforms of the future.
However smart and powerful, Ray Smith, Mike Ovits of Disney, Gerland Levin
and Ted Turner, Sumner Redstone and other aspiring Kings of the Road still
entertain crippling visions of set-top boxes and interactive TV sets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andrew Grove of Intel had the last word for these efforts when he told Forbes
ASAP last year: &quot;By the time the set-top people reach the price points
and form factors of consumer electronics and penetrate 30% of homes, the
personal computer will be everywhere, controlling the TV like a minor peripheral.&quot;
Bill Joy elaborated on this point in the October issue of Red Herring: &quot;By
the time [they] bring digital TV to the home, you will be able to take your
Super Netscape version 4.0 Web browser with Super-Ultra-HotJava-Burners,
and that will be your animated user interface. [The TV people tried, but[
it's like the Internet happened in the meantime. Right?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Distracting most of the large companies (seen by the Internet's critics
as impending monopolists), the pursuit of the set-top not only misses the
point and begs the question but it also blows the key new hardware opportunity
of the epoch. Although the PC will not be dislodged for most office applications,
there is a real and rare chance today to create a new home architecture
and software optimized for the bandwidth rather than for installed base.
Together with the Java language, the Web browser breakthrough allows creation
of new network PC and software architectures at price points that take advantage
of the &quot;hollowing out of the computer&quot; caused by the impact of
the Internet. Sun, Apple, Oracle and Jean-Louis Gass&eacute;e's BeBox are
all focusing on this target today. All are trying to take advantage of the
elusive opportunity of creating cheap machines optimized for bandwidth and
graphics rather than for legacy software baggage (the storage can be supplied
on the Net). That opportunity follows the PC and Internet model--the microcosm
and the telecosm--into the cornucopian digital future of the information
age, with the old analog TV and telephone left far behind. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>AMID ALL THESE TORRENTS</B> of futuristic technology and prophecies of
a tragic denouement in a wasted commons, it is comforting to return to the
man who began it all, Vinton Cerf of MIC. Coinventor of the Internet protocol
TCP/IP, developer of the once-pioneering and a philosopher of the Net, he
is now in charge of MCI's data network, which includes MCI's Internet backbone
network. A rare combination of technical grit and visionary enthusiasm,
he faces resistance from forces within the company that still lust for the
glamour of Hollywood and see the Internet as the CB radio of the 1990s.
Nonetheless, Cerf at 52 is leading MCI toward a new Internet-centric strategy
that is more likely than the MCI lobbyists to save the company from the
grave perils of long-distance deregulation. The company is already creating
a new backbone for the National Science Foundation part of the Internet,
connecting supercomputer centers and other high-bandwidth applications at
speeds of up to 622 megabits per second. MCI also is a major supplier of
Internet bandwidth. Its network connects to all six NAPs (national access
points) through which the ISPs link to one another. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Cerf observes that the national phone network grew at a similar pace through
much of its history and regularly met ever challenge. The telcos, for instance,
surmounted the predicted crisis of the NAPs early this year, when--following
the withdrawal of government funds--the network was expected to collapse
under galloping increase sin traffic. But the NAPs, despite unsuccessful
struggles with the remaining instabilities of ATM (asynchronous transfer
mode), ultimately rose to the challenge, saving the Net by using fiber optics
and digitization, as well as transparent silicon and opaque silicon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, new entrepreneurs are rising up to shape the future of broadband
networks and possibly seize the market from the incumbent backbone suppliers.
Silicon, both see-through ad solid, remains at the heart of the solution.
One of the ways MCI is meeting the challenge of the future is by purchasing
eight &quot;gigarouters&quot; from NetStar, a startup in Minneapolis that
is exploiting Moore's Law to bring IP (Internet Protocol) switching and
router technology into the microcosm. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Launched five years ago by a group of veterans of the Minneapolis supercomputer
scene--Lee Data, Cray and other companies--NetStar went public this fall
at a $83 million valuation. It is pioneering an elegant routing architecture
that gets eight times the throughput of a Cisco 7500 at a 20% lower price.
While existing routers run bits down shared backplane buses, NetStar's IP
router reserves a full one gigabit per each of up to 16 media cards attached
to a single-chip TriQuint 16 gigabit-cross-bar switch. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ubiquitous on the Internet, Cisco remains an imperial force. But as the
microcosm advances, it too faces threats. Not only can it not compete with
NetStar at the top of the line but it also faces Livingston, Ascend and
possibly even Compaq at the bottom. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Critics of the Internet have long predicted that as ever-more-turbulent
floods of broadband data and Web images crowd the commons, the Net will
no longer be able to bear the load. The routers in the NAPs and other critical
paths will jam up and crash. But the microcosm enables a constant stream
of exponentially more powerful new architectures as functions that were
once spread out across entire boards collapse into single chips and multichip
modules. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For 1995 and beyond, MCI has bent on NetStar's feats of microchip integration
to countervail every population explosion across the network commons. Following
the laws of the telecosm rather than the megalithic visions of the critics,
the fast new networks are becoming constantly dumber and more entrepreneurial.
Ciena Corp., a small, venture-funded vendor of optical networks, is now
supplying the next generation of back-bone gear, a system that can carry
16 separate bitstreams on every fiber thread. The first application of the
new all-optical technology in public networks, is now Ciena's innovation
is a precursor of the terabit (trillion-bit throughput) networks that will
be filled with video teleconferencing, video on demand, virtual reality,
and other bit-thronging and polygon-shuffling applications of the future.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Only one competitor, Northern Telecom, might challenge NetStar and the others
providing the new superswitches dumb enough to prevail at the top of the
line. In early October, Northern's BNR lab exhibited a terabit-switch architecture
at the Telecom 95 show in Geneva. This machine, once again, illustrates
the triumph of dumb networks. The dumb terminals of the past, whether POTS
phones or mainframe 3270 panels, required smart networks, with central-office
switches from Northern and AT&amp;T containing no fewer than 26 million
lines of software code. But the new Northern terabit uses passive optical
components and virtually no software at all. It points to the evolution
of a fibershpere for broadband wire traffic that will function like the
atmosphere for wireless traffic. (See Forbes ASPA, &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot;
December 7, 1992). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While the critics of the new technology fix on the foibles of television
and the monolithic aggregations of old media, the Internet is emerging as
an entrepreneurial efflorescence. Comparing the Net to the decline of CB
radio and the tragedy of the commons misses the providential convergence
of the laws espoused by Moore and Metcalfe, with thousands of entrepreneurs
in tow, exponentially expanding the commons with streams of new invention
in a creative spiral of growth and opportunity. In seeing the technology
as a killer of jobs and family life and a polarizer of opportunities between
rich and poor, they miss the most radically egalitarian force in the history
of the world economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The critics seem oblivious to the most basic realities of the U.S. job miracle.
While the U.S. deployed three times as much as computer power per capita
as any other industrial region, this country created some 45 million jobs
in 25 years at rising, real incomes. Not only was the U.S. a world leader
in the proportion of its working-age population with jobs, but it also created
employment for some 12 million immigrants, while its corporations endowed
new work for people around the globe. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, a billion people, mostly Third World Asians, used the
technology to leap into Third Wave riches without ever having to endure
a heavy industrial phase. Gaps between the rich and the poor collapsed everywhere
that the networks reached, as former peasants around the world--from Bangalore
to Los Angeles--gained new freedom and opportunity from the information
economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Internet creates jobs by making workers more productive, and thus more
employable, regardless of where they live. By engendering more investable
wealth, it endows new work, providing the key remedy for the job displacement
entailed by all human progress. By aggregating distant markets, the Internet
enables more specialization, and more productivity and excellence. It will
help all people, but most particularly the poor, who always comprise the
largest untapped market for enterprise. And the Internet will continue to
grow, transforming the global economy with its power and building a new
industry even larger than the PC's. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>FUELING THE TRANSFORMATION</B> are the laws of the telecosm. They begin
with Metcalfe's Law: The power of computers on a network rises with the
square of the total power of computers attached to it. Every new computer,
therefore, both use the Net as a resource and adds resources to the Net
in a spiral of increasing value and choice. This means that any limited,
exclusive or proprietary network will tend to lose business to a more open,
accessible and widely connected network. Metcalfe's Law dooms all the dreams
of the Time Warners of the world to create exclusive and proprietary combinations
of content and conduit. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a further rule, networks prevail to the extent that they feed on the
invention and creativity of their users, since the power of the computers
on the edge of the network will increasingly dwarf the intelligence of the
network fabric itself. For example, a 5ESS central-office switch from AT&amp;T,
commanding some 10 MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and linking
some 110,000 lines, once represented the most powerful computer in a local
phone network. Today those 10 MIPS are infinitesimal compared to the collective
computer power of the tens of thousands of personal computers, each commanding
20 to 100 MIPS, linked by modems to the switch. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lacking an entrepreneurial environment of inventive users, the government-run
PTTs (Post Telegraph and Telephone) of Europe have been rapidly losing ground
to the U.S.'s more rivalrous RBOCs (regional Bell operating companies) and
long-distance carriers, and all have been losing ground to the explosion
of interconnected private nets. The U.S. has some 700,000 private networks
compared to just 14,000 in Europe and some 75,000 in Japan. Private nets
that feed on the creativity of their users will always tend to prevail over
public nets, such as France's Minitel or American's interactive TV projects,
that try to supply their entire system from a central office. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Eric Schmidt of Sun offers a true parable of the Net. Back when the Internet
was the Arpanet, two routers were added to the system, but the routers'
hopping ratio (the number of hops to any destination) got struck at zero.
Because traffic always seeks out the optimal path, most of the traffic on
the Net rushed to these two machines, since they promised instant transmission.
Until the settings were corrected, the system was swamped. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the Net, traffic will always gravitate to the most efficient broadband
channels. If the telcos and software monopolists attempt to gouge customers
in a badly designed and costly &quot;top-down&quot; network, traffic will
migrate rapidly toward the freedom and bandwidth of a bottom-up solution.
In the engineering global Internet, these channels could emerge among bypass
suppliers using dark fiber; among low-earth-orbit satellite systems, such
as Teledesic and GlobalStar; among cable companies and renegade long-distance
suppliers; or among companies as yet unknown. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Guided by the valuations of the market, capital follows a similar rule:
It is routed rapidly to the channels where it can be used more productively.
At present, afflicted by perverse regulations that bar phone and cable companies
from collaborating in the same region, valuations of these companies are
low. Meanwhile, analysis complain of the excessive valuations for ISPs,
such as Netcom, and their suppliers, such as Cisco, 3Com and Netscape. Not
only traffic but also investment flows to the least regulated and most enterpreneurial
arena. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A further law of the telecosm ordains that, in an age of dumb terminals
and phones, traffic flows to smart networks full of intricate software.
In an age of ever-multiplying computer power, impelled b Metcalfe's Law,
traffic flows to the dumbest networks that gain their intelligence from
the variety of powerful machines attached to them. A corollary is that,
along with traffic, capital flows to the dumbest and most broadband nets
with the most computer intelligence on their edges. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important of all is the cultural law of the telecosm. Networks
promote choice, choice enhances quality and quality favors morality. Television
is culturally erosive because its small range of offerings requires a broad,
lowest-common-denominator appeal. Linking to millions of cultural sources,
global networks provide a cornucopia of choices, like a Library of Congress
at your fingertips. On the Net, as at a giant bookstore, you always get
your first choice rather than a lowest-common-denominator choice. A culture
of first choices creates a bias toward excellence and virtue. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The critics of the Internet are mostly skeptical about the value of choice.
But choice validates freedom and substantiates individuality. Choice accords
with the inexorable genetic diversity of humans. It makes possible individual
aspiration and creativity. It is the lowest-common-denominator offerings
of mass-broadcast media that lower humans to the animal level, eclipsing
the differences that make us human, cutting off the higher aspirations and
inspirations that elevate us beyond our appetites, reducing us to an impressionable
crowd, zapping through the channels looking for a splash of blood or flash
of nudity or demagogic spiel of hate. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In prophesying centralization and tyranny, the Cassandras miss the centrifugal
forces of the Law of the Microcosm, overthrowing all monopolies, hierarchies,
pyramids and power grids of established industrial society and endowing
individuals with the power to be transcendent and free. <BR>
