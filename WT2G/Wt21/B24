<h3> Making Regulatory Reform A Reality</h3>
<b>By <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a>, Hon. <a href="#mcintosh">David McIntosh</a>, <a href="#smith">Fred Smith</a>, and Dr. <a href="#graham">John Graham</a>.</b>
<p>
A Heritage Foundation Symposium, given January 31, 1996.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>ANGELA ANTONELLI:</b> For supporters of regulatory reform, 1995 was both frustrating and disappointing. What began as promise in the Contract With America became a series of reform bills that called for, among other things, the use of sound science and cost-benefit analysis in regulatory decisionmaking. These bills moved rapidly through the House in early 1995 only to wither and die in the Senate late last year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the Senate debates, supporters of regulatory reform found themselves losing the public relations battle, unable to keep themselves from being portrayed as extremists with a goal of rolling back decades of environmental, health, and safety protections, and desirous of a renewed effort to pollute America and make it unsafe. Alarmists succeeded in convincing the public that a reformed regulatory system would offer less protection -- for example, women would be denied life-saving mammograms and our food supply would not be safe from deadly <I>e. coli</I> bacteria. And legislators could not respond effectively. What we need to help the American public understand is that regulatory reform means more protection, not less. During 1996, the challenge for think tanks, like Heritage, and the academic and the business community will be to figure out how we can get this message out to the public and reclaim the moral high ground in this debate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American people have not stopped wanting regulatory reform, but we need to help them understand that the goals of reformers are not different -- we want cleaner air and cleaner water -- but we can do it with less money and less government intervention. Today, the federal bureaucracy supports elaborate programs aimed at reducing tiny risks at huge costs to the taxpayer, while more serious dangers go neglected. At the same time, this huge misallocation of resources means these resources are not available for other purposes -- for example, the local community that must spend millions of dollars to eliminate one chemical from its water supply that poses a negligible or non-existent risk to the public cannot spend this money to put police on the streets or build a school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Helping people put daily risks in perspective is one of the challenges we face in making regulatory reform a reality. As Dr. Graham points out, today people are suffering from what can be called a "syndrome of paranoia and neglect" about the potential dangers to their health, safety, and the environment. Risk regulation is responsible for the bulk of the nation's $600 billion in annual regulatory costs, particularly those rules affecting the environment. Dr. Graham's work with Dr. Tammy Tengs recently has shown us that a reallocation of resources to more cost-effective programs could save an additional 60,000 lives per year at no increased cost to taxpayers or industry. 60,000 lives!  And we can also save $31 billion. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 We need to help the public understand that the benefits of regulatory reform can be significant. Reformers need to point out that their reforms and solutions actually save more lives. The challenge now is to get reform back on track to accomplish this. And our distinguished panelists can help us understand how we can do this.

<b>THE HONORABLE DAVID MCINTOSH</b>: Thank you, Angela. I appreciate it, and I appreciate the hard work you have done in this area, both while you were in the Administration and now at Heritage. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I wanted to share with you my perspective on where we've been recently and where we should be going. Speaker Gingrich often uses military analogies to inspire us in the Republican Conference. If I can borrow one of his, I would say that we're somewhere between the Battle of Britain and getting ready to lay the groundwork for Normandy on the question of regulatory reform, which is to say we've come past the crisis stage and have every opportunity in front of us to lay plans for the major siege that will give us the final victory in eliminating unnecessary regulations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I think last year solidified the change in the debate. The Republicans, in the Contract With America, made regulatory reform a key part of their agenda, and the President returned to some of his discussions of the work he had done with Vice President Gore on regulatory reform in their government review. The question is no longer whether we should have regulatory reform, use cost-benefit analysis, or use good science, but how to do that. And that's a major victory for us; we should take stock and be glad about what we have accomplished. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton has done one thing that I think is throwing us off guard, and that is raising the issue of the environment and doing it in a very emotional way. His Clean Water Act statement over the summer is probably the classic: He pointed to something everyone who understood the bill knew would not happen -- that we would start having dirtier streams and waters in this country -- and said, "I'm going to stop that."  This made it appear as if there is more going on than what was really happening. Our job is to communicate with the American people and tell them where we want to take environmental protection in this country and our vision of how to do that. I'll talk more about that later, because I think it's a fundamental issue for us. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Politically, we have a very good coalition. We have the Republican majority, with even many of the moderates agreeing with us on the fundamentals of regulatory reform, and we have the conservative Democrats; the "blue-dog" Democrats are very much on our side on these issues and want to participate actively, to help write the bills and help carry them in the Congress. In the Senate, we're still evolving in that majority. I think we have a numerical majority of 50 plus, but they have different rules, and we do not yet have that supermajority of 60 votes to pass a substantial bill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I think we must return to the basic principles that have been successful for us. We need to explain regulatory reform in terms of what it does for the average American. Reform will help us create more jobs; it will help us get more products; it will lead to a healthier health system; it will help small businesses be more productive and be able to be competitive. I think we need to search out examples of how the current regulatory system works against us. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I talk with people back home in Indiana about working in a foundry. I put myself through college, and I point out that that foundry is now closed down because they could not afford all costs of compliance of the Clean Air Act Amendments. Two hundred people are out of a job, and their families are affected. It has had a terrible effect on the community. I talk about some of the people I have met in hearings, for example, when we looked at FDA's review process. We heard from a wonderful little 8-year-old girl who is a hydrocephalic child, and she is alive because of a miracle of science. They have a shunt that drains the fluid from the back of her head; it's made out of silicone, and the manufacturers are saying they're no longer going to make that shunt because FDA has still not said that silicone is safe for use in the human body. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These are real regulations having real effects on real people, and we need to continue to paint a picture for the American people about why regulation and regulatory reform are so important. We also need to articulate our principles about using free markets, return to private property rights, use flexible rather than the command-and-control approaches, and explain how our vision of those processes will lead to a better result, including better safety, better health, and a better record on the environment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This leads me to the key area -- the environment -- where I think we need to more effectively articulate our position. Republicans must lay out their vision of environmental protection. We should start by explaining that in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, as we turned towards the goal of protecting the environment in this country, we did what the Soviet Union did. It used a command-and-control approach, made tremendous strides forward, changed from a peasant economy into a manufacturing economy, but at great cost in individual liberty. And what we now see is that if we continue down that route of a command-and-control approach we run the risk of going the way of the Soviet Union, where the structure collapses in on itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So if we want to have a truly good record of protecting the environment, we need to follow the same principles we follow in the economic world, where you use free markets, you use property rights as the foundation of your policies. I think we can prove empirically that this will deliver a better result on the environment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Superfund is an example of how a command-and-control approach with significant litigation has failed. I often describe to people an example in Indianapolis of a company called the Heritage Group that has set up a manufacturing process that uses the waste product from Thompson Electronics' etching process. They etch copper and turn it into a computer board that they put in the back of their television sets. The waste product is a fluid highly enriched in copper. The Heritage Group takes that fluid, extracts the copper, and turns it into a food supplement that the pork producers in Indiana use. It's actually better than the existing food supplement for copper.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, EPA and the local EPA officials say they love this. They want to see more of it happening. Nationally, they say, "Well this looks like recycling, and our rule is if it's recycling you have to meet all of the federal requirements."  At that point, it's uneconomical, and the company says, "Sorry, we're not going to set up a plan."  Locally, officials say, "Well, maybe we'll take 10 percent of the waste stream, dilute it, and throw it down the drain, and then we don't have to meet the requirements because it's not really recycling."  Now that's nuts. It's nuts from a financial basis; it's nuts from an environmental basis; and I think we need to explain to people that our system is failing on its own terms to protect the environment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me mention what I think will happen in some areas in Congress this year. We have the Contract bills, which are essentially cost-benefit analysis and risk assessments. We've finished those in the House; we have a very good product, one we can be proud of. We had good support and sponsors from the Senate; Don Nickles worked hard, and Senator Dole took the lead on that bill. But getting to that elusive 60th vote has been nearly impossible, and I suppose it won't happen in this Congress because the opposing forces each time will find some reason to pull back on that 60th vote. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, what do we do?  Do we simply take that issue to the voters in the next election, or do we try to get some parts of our regulatory reform agenda through?  The leaning now in the House and the Senate is to get a consensus bill through and see what we can do. I'd like some of your input on this. The notions that they're talking about are the codification of judicial intervention in the small business protection bill and regulatory review, some form of a sunset bill, and some form of Senator Nickles's bill, which changes the Senate process for reviewing regulations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
All of those are good things. They put on the table cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, and I think we need to make an evaluation: Do we take these now and put them into law?  The President would likely sign them. The cost is a political one in that we allow our opponents to have a pro-regulatory relief vote. Are we able to do that and nonetheless articulate to the voters next year in the election that this is only part of the agenda, and there are many more fundamental things we need to do?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What about the agency-by-agency and program-by-program regulatory reform bills?  I think you're going to see more pressure for this Congress to deliver on an OSHA reform bill. Labor unions are fighting that very strongly, obviously, but that is the one area where I hear, particularly from small businesses, that they still have an increasing sense of frustration. In addition, I'm getting reports that FDA, in its administrative decisionmaking, has done an about-face, that they've been much more cooperative with medical device and drug manufacturers. I still believe there are fundamental flaws in the system that we have now, and it is because FDA has to have a checkoff at every step of the way in manufacturing in granting the approval of products. We need to keep the pressure up on that, but I think we also need to acknowledge that things are getting better than they were when there was no pressure from Congress. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On Superfund, I think there's a good chance for a bill that will make substantial reforms. I think this must be a key element of our Republican agenda on the environment. There are a couple of other important parts of this agenda. We have debated within the House Republicans on whether we should go forward with reform of the Endangered Species Act. I prefer Rep. John Shadegg's market-oriented approach, and it is one of the most principled approaches that has been supported by work that Heritage has done over the years. I can't tell you that it's going to be the majority view, however; at this point, it's very much up for debate. Also, Corrections Day will give us a pre-procedure to pull out some of these individual items, and I would like to have help identifying areas for Corrections Day, helping move them through the Senate, and publicizing the results. We have a record number of bills that were passed last year. We need to use the process and continue to show action on a case-by-case basis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, I wanted to preview with you where I think we're going to be active in our subcommittee. We've had strategic planning meetings in the last few weeks. I want our subcommittee to be the driving engine for regulatory reform and making the public case for it. The key mechanism we have for that is oversight to show how the agencies fail in their mission and create problems. We will strive to develop a report card on how the Clinton Administration agencies have performed on regulatory reform. I would like to incorporate in that a survey of the outside regulated community. We don't have the resources to do it, so it would have to be conducted by people on the outside. I think we need to be fair -- to acknowledge where progress has been made and commend people. You can get some things by rewarding people for good changes, but I think we also need to be fair in our assessment when we feel the agencies have not gone far enough.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We should adapt the concept Senator Proxmire made very successful for exposing government waste and spending -- the Golden Fleece Award -- for regulatory excesses. We should highlight agency enforcement or regulatory decisions that, when exposed to the light of day, the American public says is nuts. We've been trying to gather those in my subcommittee. Our most recent fax told us how, in New Mexico, a 14-year-old boy was lost with his scout troop when he was hiking and had been in the woods for two or three days. They sent out a search helicopter. The local police found him and radioed a request to land in the forest and pick up the boy and rescue him. Astonishingly enough, the answer came back negative: This is an area where we can't have any mechanized vehicles; you can't land to do this. What they did do is drop a note that said stay there, and we'll send somebody. When the search teams on land couldn't find him and did more environmental damage than the helicopter would have done, they finally sent back the helicopter and pulled the kid out of there. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is a ridiculous policy, and it's what the American public is fed up with in government regulations and in the administration of these programs. These are the types of policies we need to identify and expose to ridicule. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me just close on a note of optimism. I do think we are at the point of being able to have the fundamental change in the regulatory process that we've been searching for over the years, and I'm very optimistic that public support will be there if we do the right thing in terms of framing the issue in a way that is relevant for the average person. We are also going to need a forceful response to the environmental attack, and I think we can present one that says we can protect the environment better with our principles than the Administration can with its command-and-control approach. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thank you all for letting me come. I really appreciate your work.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>FRED SMITH</b>: When David was talking about the military analogies most appropriate to the debate that just took place on the Hill, he mentioned the battle of Britain and the Normandy invasion. Between those two events, as some of you know, there was the abortive incident in which several Canadian divisions were wiped out as we prematurely assaulted a position we were not in place to take. I think we learned from that, also. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A question we need to ask is why a modest bipartisan House bill bogged down in the Senate and then was filibustered to death. At best, the bill required only that government regulators state whether their regulations do more good than harm --sort of a Hippocratic oath for regulators. More important: Why did such a modest reform get such bad press?  Anyone who watches television or monitors the media knows the way this issue was characterized: Mad-dog Republican ideologists join with robber-baron capitalists to regain the right to add poison to baby food bottles. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
That was the bad news. The good news was that we got 58 votes in the U.S. Senate, which suggests two things. One is that the pressures to reform regulations are real and they are growing. We are on the right side of history in this area. The second is that we better become considerably more skillful at marketing and explaining what it is we're about. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I would argue that the environmental debate today is roughly where the welfare policy debate was, say, ten years ago. Then, most felt that the welfare state was cumbersome, costly, bureaucratic, even unsuccessful, yet still necessary. Private alternatives were regarded as largely inadequate to the critical task of helping the nation's poor. If you wanted to help the poor ten years ago, you had to accept and somehow improve the welfare state. The result was reform proposals largely limited to "good government," tinkering at the edges, trying to make the system work a little bit better. The conservative response to the welfare state was to make it more efficient, more effective. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Things have changed. Time and analysis by such scholars as Charles Murray and Marvin Olasky have made more evident the perversities of the welfare state and the value of private charity. Today, the rhetoric of the welfare reform debate focuses on moving beyond, not saving, the welfare state and revitalizing, not ridiculing, the voluntary sector. Our goal should be to accelerate the same shift in the environmental area, to begin to go through the same "re-paradigming" of the situation to make it possible to subject environmental policy to the same scrutinizing debate we're finally achieving in the welfare area. To that end, we must meet three challenges. First, we must move beyond good government reform measures; second, we must develop in much more detail the analytic basis for reform; and third -- and most important -- we must learn how to communicate in a political world. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first challenge, to repeat, is simply to recognize that tinkering is not enough, as you heard to some extent in the remarks of Congressman McIntosh. If federal regulation is not to destroy all our freedoms, we must find some way to discipline our regulatory leviathan. The bills that are pending in the Senate today, S. 343 and so forth, do not achieve that result. None of them really subjects regulation to the same level of scrutiny that we routinely subject spending bills to in the Congress -- and I don't think many of us are happy about the level of discipline we have on spending yet. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
An agency is created -- Interior, Agriculture -- and it goes forth and comes up with creative ideas on how to spend our money better. But that does not become public policy until those spending bills are sent to Congress and the Congress and the President positively affirm those decisions. Spending bills are subject to accountability; Congressmen have to decide whether to vote for or against these spending bills. Regulations are subject to none of that discipline. We create a new regulatory agency, we send it forth to think of good ideas about how to spend our money, and that's it. There is no formal vote by the Congress, and none really by the President himself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The problem is that there's a pro-regulation bias in our system that has never been addressed. It's a loophole in the system. No one, I think, among the Founding Fathers believed federal regulation would ever become the massive leviathan it has become today, and unless we require regulatory accountability, all the procedural reforms in the world are likely to do very little good. We're working on that, Heritage is working on that, and a number of organizations are trying to come up with substantive reform measures. We have a lot more work to do. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second challenge is advancing the analytic basis for reform. I'd like to call your attention to the deregulation battles in transportation in the 1970s. Those victories we did achieve were made possible by earlier analytic work that fell into roughly three areas. First, there were the traditional economic studies of the cost of regulation. Brookings and then AEI and a whole series of groups after that began to examine the cost of regulation, and their conclusion was essentially that government didn't work or was an extremely costly way to achieve sometimes important objectives. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second kind of study was public choice, rent-seeking analysis which, in effect, undermined the moral legitimacy of transportation regulation. A series of studies found that the ICC was too easily captured by special interests. Building on this approach, <a href="http://www.cei.org">CEI</a>, along with Michael Greve of the <a href="/cir">Center for Individual Rights</a>, produced a book called <I>Environmental Politics</I>, which looked at the way rent-seeking explains much of environmental behavior (although anyone who lives in a city with Archer Daniels Midland and Dwayne Andreas, I think, probably understands that pretty well already). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There also were case studies demonstrating the feasibility of a private alternative to the regulated transportation sector. California and Texas, as many of you know, had relatively deregulated air travel systems, and that provided some evidence as to what might happen if we moved to a deregulated environment. Private alternatives, the studies found, had been neglected and actually offered creative alternatives to the regulatory state. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There's been very little work of this sort on environmental issues, although the record of government failure is beginning to emerge. The wonderful book <i>EPA: Asking the Wrong Questions</I> is an example of what can be done, and we're doing a number of smaller studies. Superfund is a poster child of regulatory failure, but there has been far too little work demonstrating just how difficult it is to run an eco-socialist state as opposed to just a socialist state. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The research on rent-seeking as an explanation for much of our environmental policy is important because it affects the moral foundation of the regulatory state. In many ways, it is more important than the cost analysis done by think tanks and economist groups. But most important, and least adequately filled today, is the need for research on private alternatives to environmental regulation. Along these lines, CEI's Center for Private Conservation is developing case studies of how private people outside government -- although sometimes encumbered by government rules -- are playing extremely creative roles in expanding and advancing environmental goals. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The third challenge, and certainly the most important, is to develop a communication strategy which is relevant to the political marketplace. If we are to succeed, we must understand how people form opinions about political issues. I don't think this is well enough understood. As consumers in the private sector, when we buy a car, get married, purchase a house, or take a new job, we have every reason to gain some information about that decision, because the decision we make will directly affect our welfare. We are rationally informed in the private marketplace. We spend our energy to the point where the information we derive no longer makes our decision process more reasonable. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the political marketplace, we use that same calculus, but it leads to a quite different result. I can become informed about the Endangered Species Act; I can become informed about risk reform issues; I can spend a lot of time every night taking the <I>Federal Register</I> to bed with me to read laboriously. But whatever views I come to as an informed citizen have very little to do with what actually happens. The linkage between information and the opinions I form and what actually happens is very, very weak. I am one out of millions of Americans. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America is not a democracy; it is an interest group democracy. It's important to realize the distinction. Some of you have seen the series in the <I>Washington Post</I> where they're very confused about people's lack of enthusiasm for big government and are trying to sort it out. One of the articles that appeared earlier this week was subtitled "Don't Know, Don't Care."  In it was a quote by Jay McCraken, 34, a technical advisor and part-time college student in Clinton, New Jersey: "It's time-consuming becoming informed. Nobody has the time to sit down and read <I>Time</I> every week to find out what the government's doing."  And this is an informed consumer. People don't have the time to deal with the details of government everyday. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Well, guess what: Jay isn't alone in that. Virtually all Americans form their opinions about policies in ways that are very low on the fact component and very high on the other component, and it's perfectly rational for them to do that. In a world of rational ignorance, we do not need an information-rich campaign; we need another kind of campaign. Facts don't form opinion, yet people certainly have them. What does form opinions?  Aaron Wildavsky and others have argued that values dictate most people's views about most political issues, and therefore we need a value-based communications strategy. Reagan understood that very, very well, and Clinton is a genius at this. Why can't conservatives get it? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What values are we going to use in communicating?  Wildavsky, noting that very few cultures are homogeneous, suggested one useful framework. He had a category that some of you know: fatalist, hierarchalist, egalitarian, individualist. To understand, within this framework, what a values-based communication strategy might look like, let's look again at transportation regulation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Initially, most Americans probably viewed transportation regulation, the creation of the ICC, as a good thing. Regulation appealed to individualists, to free-market types; it would expand choice by keeping the big boys from hogging all the traffic. Regulation appealed to hierarchalist conservatives, the good science types; it would make possible scientific management of our transportation system, eliminating wasteful competition. And, of course, regulation appealed also to egalitarians, progressives, liberals; it would be fairer to the poor and to rural citizens. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Well, experience and time and analysis eroded those beliefs. Deregulation is now possible and popular among liberals as well as conservatives. It's very important to recall that the transportation deregulation fight was led by Ralph Nader and Ted Kennedy, along with a lot of our types. The changes that happened in the transportation area were vital to economic deregulation as well as to the current rethinking of the welfare state. Our challenge is to conduct the research, education, and advocacy work that will make similar change possible in the environmental field. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me briefly analyze how we did not follow this strategy in the recent risk debate in the Senate. We reform types talk largely to ourselves; we made very little effort to reach out to anyone who thought regulation was a good idea. Indeed, the reform message may actually have made it easier for the liberals to mobilize themselves and to become an effective stymier of reform. In contrast, the pro-regulation side targeted clever messages that undermined much of the initial support for regulatory reform. What are the arguments about?  Judicial review?  That will mean more lawsuits, more bureaucracy, as Clinton told us. We don't want big government. They use our language, our rhetoric, our arguments to weaken our support  base for regulatory reform and reform in a number of other areas. They were extremely clever at taking our vocabulary and using value-based arguments to weaken our belief that regulatory reform was a good thing. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The lesson is clear: We must develop and target messages that, while strengthening our troops, also challenge the support base for regulation. We must dramatize the creative strengths of private conservation, private stewardship, private risk management. We must challenge egalitarians by focusing not on cost, but rather on the unfairness and absurdity of the regulatory state, as David has started doing. The rhetoric for that kind of value-based campaign was advanced by the late Aaron Wildavsky. He was the one who told us to talk in terms of risk versus risk as opposed to cost versus benefits, and wealthier is healthier rather than the cost of regulation to business, and to define our goal as a safer, not safe, society. How poor we are because of his loss. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me conclude. My suggestions really come down to three points. We must adopt a strategic reform agenda. We're going to get hammered anyway; we lose little by being bold. Our focus must be on regulatory accountability, not on regulatory assessment. Good ideas are important, and we should put forth the best ideas we have, not some watered down version that can persuade the current thinkers to accept them. We must develop a coherent and coordinated plan to dramatize the failure of the regulatory state to rectify its inherent corruption and to publicize the advocacy and creativity of private-sector alternatives. Finally, we must mount an extensive educational effort, including image-based documentaries, to clarify how regulations harm the poor, minorities, women, and the Third World. Some of you know CEI has recently produced FDA television and radio ads, a Science Under Siege documentary, and a risk communication film. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These are a very small part of what we need to do in this area, and we even have an objective test of whether we'll be successful or not: When Senator Chaffee, Congressman Boehlert, and Greenpeace join Heritage and CEI in calling for the abolition of EPA, we will know we've won. But we have a ways to go. Thank you.

<b>DR. JOHN GRAHAM</b>: Thank you very much. I don't think there's any more passionate advocate of regulatory reform than myself, but I'm very worried about where we are right now in the debate on regulatory reform. I want to share some of my concerns and really focus my remarks on the next year -- what we have to do to get this issue back on track -- and leave discussion of longer-term ideas, such as some of the ones Fred has on the table, until after 1996. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I will start with my experience last weekend. I spent two days at a National Wildlife Federation conference in New Hampshire, a so-called presidential candidates' forum sponsored by the National Wildlife Federation, where all the candidates were invited to come and discuss their approach to the problem of environmental health and regulatory reform. There were only two Republican candidates who showed up -- Congressman Bob Dornan and Alan Keyes -- and Vice President Al Gore and EPA Administrator Carol Browner came and gave passionate speeches. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I make it a point to go and listen carefully to people who feel very differently from me about issues. From the Vice President, we got the message that these people who say they want regulatory reform don't really want reform; they want relief for polluters and special interests. They say they want a smarter regulatory regime, more science, and more analysis, but want to cut back the budgets of these agencies by anywhere from 10 to 30 percent. What they really want to do is roll back 25 years of progress and protection. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the heart of what the speakers were arguing is that there's a value difference: The President cares about public health and the environment, but people who believe in regulatory reform don't. I think we have to address ourselves to the question of whether they will be successful in the next year in reinforcing this imprint they've tried to put in people's minds, and there is some rhetoric that people are using in the regulatory reform community that I think is very unfortunate and contributes to this problem. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First is "regulatory relief."  I think that's a very unfortunate phrase. I think the public feels that we've had public health and environmental agencies at the federal level for 25 years, and we certainly want to have a very strong case before saying that they don't have a strong role to play. I think our message should be that we want smarter, more efficient regulation in order to get more protection at less cost; therefore, the word "relief" is entirely inappropriate. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, "free-market environmentalism" is an intellectually interesting and exciting concept, but in the next year I think it also will be too risky a concept, because I think it plays too much to the notion in people's minds that some of these reformers actually want to abolish EPA. I don't know whether it's true or not, but both of these speakers I referred to (Gore and Browner) named Congressmen in this town who had said they wanted to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency. Maybe we're going to get to that some day, but I don't think that's a helpful way to talk about these issues. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, we heard today about whether we should have the environment above people or people above the environment. I think this plays on the notion that somehow there's a big value difference between where they are and where reformers are: They really care about children's health more than reformers do, or they really care about the environment, about wilderness, about wildlife more than reformers do. I think that's a big mistake; reformers have to stay away from these kinds of generalizations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, what does this mean that we should do?  I think that if we're careful about our steps in the next year, we can make some very substantial progress in advancing the debate on this issue. On H.R. 9, we came through the House debate in very good shape, arguing on principle for sound science, comparative risk, cost versus benefit, and regulatory accountability, not only with Republican votes, but with 60 Democratic votes as well. In the Senate, we stalled, but look at what happened: We ended up with 54 out of 54 Republicans, but the Administration called up the troops and said, "Don't let it happen."  Then Senator Dole made a judgment, which seems to me a reasonable one, that we ought to let Democrats pay the price for that. How big the price is, frankly, depends on how this issue is managed in the next year. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What are the modest steps that we should take?  I think, first, that we need to design a couple of streamlined bills, not big regulatory reform bills, on a couple of key issues and get some more explicit votes on these issues. The first one is the basic concept of comparative risk: Do you believe that government agencies should put their resources on the biggest risks before the little ones and speculative ones?  We ought to make the case that if these agencies were smarter and more scientific, we could reallocate resources, save more lives, and do more for the environment at no increased cost to the taxpayer. As shown by the work of my colleague Tammy Tengs, we can save 60,000 additional lives per year at no increased cost. This basic principle of comparative risk, using our resources better, is one that I think we should force some votes on -- not linked to congressional review of regulations, not linked to costs and benefits, just that specific issue of comparing risks. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second thing I think we ought to do is take President Clinton's executive order as it exists now -- it has some flaws, and I'd like it to be stronger, but it also has some basic principles that are sound -- and have an up-or-down vote on this executive order as a piece of legislation, as a forerunner of a broader and more ambitious program of regulatory reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I think we should ask ourselves, What will Vice President Gore do when confronted with these two prospects?  There are two options: Either vote in favor of these, and have basically a bipartisan consensus behind comparative risk and cost-benefit analysis, or vote no and then recast the debate. I think this is the more likely outcome, and I think it's a good outcome for the people who believe in regulatory reform because it will be clear that reformers share the values of public health and environmental protection but want to use science and economics to achieve them in a more efficient fashion. Reformers have the same values as they do, but can be smarter and more efficient in the way they accomplish these goals. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are some things I think we should avoid and not do over the next year because they undermine our ability to focus a discussion around these two basic principles. First, I do not think we should cut back the budgets of agencies which are the targets of regulatory reform. I think a flat budget is the right way to deal with this in the next year or two, because we're going to be asking these agencies to do more with what they currently have in terms of budgets. In fact, I heard a rumor at this National Wildlife Federation meeting that President Clinton is hoping he can give in on a big cutback in the EPA's budget. Then someone in the campaign can claim, "Look, they want to have more responsibility for EPA, but then they want to cut them. Isn't that an indication that they really want relief, that they don't really want reform?"  I think some people are cynically hoping that these budget cuts will occur so they can claim that reformers caused a lot of blood-letting out there. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, on issues like OSHA reform and Clean Air Act reform, I think the basic message is that if we're smarter or more efficient, we can save more lives and protect the environment better. But the kinds of reforms that radical reformers have in mind require too much discussion in an election year to really get the point across. I don't think they're appropriate at this time. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, I think we should make concerted efforts on both the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Superfund law to get good, solid, incremental reform of these laws and, if possible, get them to the President's desk and get them signed. That gives the Republicans a clear record of passing pieces of environmental legislation that embody their principles of sound science, cost-benefit analysis, and risk assessment. By taking this incremental approach over the next year, I think reformers reinforce their commitment to fundamental public health and environmental values. We demonstrate the confidence of our leadership on issues that historically are not Republican issues, and at the same time we build momentum. We build our own morale as a movement to work for larger and more ambitious regulatory reforms at a later time. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In conclusion, I think that we are at a very important point in the movement for regulatory reform. The course we take at this point, and how we represent ourselves as a movement, will be very important in determining how we are portrayed in what we know will be a very vicious election-year campaign on these issues.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

The House-passed versions of several appropriations bills include a number of spending restrictions. While controversial, these limitations, commonly known as riders, in many cases are necessary to encourage federal agencies to act more responsibly in setting and enforcing regulations. They also are needed to encourage the Clinton Administration to work more assiduously with Congress to reform some of the most seriously flawed regulatory statutes.
<p>
As the Senate prepares to consider the Labor/Health and Human Services appropriations bill, and as Congress enters into a conference on other bills, including Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies, and Transportation appropriations, Members should make sure that several riders in the House-passed bills are preserved in the final legislation.
<p>
The most important deal with: <br><ul>

<b>AN IMPERFECT BUT NECESSARY SOLUTION</b>
<p>
Faced with a Congress intent on reducing unnecessary and expensive laws that cannot be justified on public health or environmental grounds, the Clinton Administration has spurned invitations to craft substantive bipartisan reform of existing law. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have persisted in implementing new regulations that are inflexible, expensive, and largely divorced from underlying scientific and economic realities. Congress has few tools to reshape this approach to regulation. 
<p>
The most promising short-term solution is to use the appropriations process to restrict the use of government funds to pursue questionable regulations until a general overhaul of the regulatory process can be achieved. Such riders not only would cool the regulatory zeal of federal agencies, but also would encourage the Administration to show more cooperation in negotiating substantive reform.
<p>

<b>WHAT CONGRESS SHOULD DO</b>
<p>
As the Senate and House-Senate conference committees consider the VA/HUD, Labor/HHS, and Transportation appropriation bills, most of the House riders should be retained, both to prevent federal agencies from promulgating ineffective and expensive regulations and to force the White House to focus on much-needed environmental and labor reforms. While most of the riders in the House-passed bills address important areas, several are particularly important, and including them in the bills sent to President Clinton should be a top priority.
<p>

<a name="epa"></a><b>Environmental Protection Agency (VA/HUD and Independent Agencies bill)<p>

The Delaney Clause</b>
<p>
The House provision would prohibit EPA from revoking or issuing regulations under Section 409 (the Delaney Clause) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act whenever a tolerance has been established under Section 408, which addresses standards for raw foods. The rider also would prevent EPA from simply changing the Section 408 tolerance to comply with Section 409.
<p>
The Delaney Clause was enacted in 1958 to ban any additive in processed food that has been shown -- in any amount -- to cause cancer in humans or laboratory animals. This seemed reasonable in the 1950s because, depending on the chemical, scientists could test only for traces of chemicals in quantities on the order of about one in a million. Today, however, with improvements in technology, scientists can test for many of these chemicals in quantities of about one in a quadrillion (a million billion). Indeed, some can be detected almost down to the molecular level. Thus, extremely small trace quantities that were undetectable -- and thus allowable -- 37 years ago now form the basis for a court order requiring EPA to eliminate the use of dozens of pesticides even though EPA's own findings have shown these same pesticides to be safe up to certain levels. Under Section 408 of the same Act, which relates to raw agricultural commodities, EPA has issued regulations setting the tolerance level deemed safe for consumption. Yet the strict language of the Delaney Clause means that there must be no trace of these same additives in processed foods, despite the finding by EPA that these chemicals can be consumed safely in small quantities. This prohibition is an enormous and needless drain on America's agricultural economy.
<p>
Even EPA Administrator Carol Browner has called for a change in the law. In the early days of the Clinton Administration, recognizing that the law was a scientific anachronism, she said that "right now the law says we cannot have these chemicals concentrated in processed foods. We have to accept what the law is. But at the same time we have gotten to a point where we have to say we know a lot more about these chemicals than we did 35 years ago when the law was passed."1  Unfortunately, the environmental lobby applied severe pressure to the new Administration, and Browner retreated from her initial position. Nevertheless, her early remarks demonstrate the reasonableness of this rider; spending billions of dollars to ban useful, safe pesticides to avoid negligible risks is bad public policy.
<p>
<b>Wetland Enforcement</b>
<p>
As passed by the House, the wetland rider would restrict EPA from enforcing the Section 404 permitting program. The EPA relies on Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to regulate landowners who wish to disturb wetlands on their property. The House rider would restrict EPA's authority to enforce Section 404; the Senate version would limit only its authority to override Army Corps of Engineers permit decisions. While the House rider may be overly broad, and thus may have unintended consequences, the Senate version does not go far enough. In addition to including the Senate provision, the final bill should be strengthened to at least restrict EPA from regulating "non-adjacent" (isolated) wetlands. 
<p>
There are three principal problems with EPA's current wetland policies.2 
<p>
First, the statutory authority itself is questionable. Indeed, authority for "non-adjacent" wetlands seems clearly to be lacking. Obviously, EPA should not pursue policies that neither the Constitution nor federal statute allows it to pursue, and Congress should not permit it to do so. 
<p>
Second, the EPA definition of what constitutes a wetland is too broad. According to the 1987 Delineation Manual, a wetland is any land that meets each of the following criteria:  inundated or saturated to 12 inches deep for at least seven consecutive days and 5 percent of the growing season, and more than 50 percent of dominant plant species are those found in marshes or swamps regardless of whether they are found elsewhere also. The language is so unnecessarily inclusive that land which is bone dry for almost the entire year can be deemed a wetland.
<p>
Third, the financial resources of many Americans are being destroyed in the name of protecting wetlands as landowners are forced to surrender, without compensation, their right to use their property. Because many affected individuals make their living or pay their mortgages from income derived from the land, their savings can be wiped out. For example, Bill Stamp's family in Exeter, Rhode Island, has been blocked from farming or developing its 70 acres of land for eleven years, yet has been assessed taxes at rates determined by the land's industrial value -- up to $72,000 annually. As a result, this fifth-generation farm family may lose its life savings. The government, however, appears unmoved. As one Army Corps of Engineers enforcement officer told Stamp:  "We know that this is rape, pillage, and plunder of your farm, but this is our job."3
<p>
The rider would give American property owners a temporary, partial reprieve from EPA's intrusive regulation while Congress enacts a new, sensible wetlands protection measure. The reform legislation currently in Congress (but under threat of presidential veto) would make wetlands protection legal, priority-based, and fair to those now forced to shoulder the financial burdens alone.
<p>
<b>Voluntary Environmental Self-Audits</b>
<p>
This rider would prohibit EPA from taking legal action against states or companies for environmental violations discovered during voluntary self-audits and disclosed in compliance with state law. 
<P>
Companies that conduct voluntary self-audits to identify and quickly correct any inadvertent violations are required to report their findings to the EPA, which then may fine them millions of dollars for past non-compliance. This policy obviously discourages responsible behavior by companies seeking to rectify environmental problems. If this barrier to voluntary compliance is eliminated, companies will be inclined to clean up pollution more rapidly, more thoroughly, and more cheaply. Numerous companies have indicated they would perform self-audits and correct violations if the threat of prosecution was minimized. Thus, restricting EPA from punishing past inadvertent behavior would benefit both the economy and the environment.
<p>


<a name="trans"></a><b>Department of Transportation (DOT bill)</b>
<p>
<b>CAFE (Fuel Efficiency Standards)</b>
<p>
This rider would prohibit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from further tightening Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards. 
<p>
CAFE rules currently require each automobile manufacturer to sell cars that average 27.5 miles per gallon (mpg) and light trucks that average 20.6 mpg. Enacted in response to the oil crisis in 1973, CAFE was designed to maintain stable, low oil prices by reducing demand. The primary support for continuing the program now comes from the environmental lobby, which sees CAFE as a permanent way to conserve energy. 
<p>
Experience indicates that the program has serious unintended consequences. Tighter standards yield little if any benefit but impose tremendous social and economic costs. The social costs include the additional deaths and serious injuries caused by cars that, while fuel efficient, are less safe because they are of lighter construction. Terminating the CAFE program would save thousands of lives. According to economists Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution and John Graham of the Harvard School of Public Health, 1989 model cars were about 500 pounds lighter than they would have been without the 27.5 mpg economy standard. Crandall and Graham estimate that this weight reduction is responsible for almost one-fifth of passenger fatalities and that the program results in an estimated 2,500 additional deaths and 25,000 additional serious injuries per model fleet year.4  This is a high price to pay for a government program that yields questionable benefits.
<p>
CAFE standards also reduce the affordability of new cars and encourage consumers to keep less fuel efficient cars for a longer time. A 1995 study by Charles Rivers Associates has found that increasing standards by 30 percent would raise the average price of cars by $1,500 and trucks by $2,100. This sticker price increase would lead consumers to keep their older, less fuel efficient autos longer, which in turn would increase pollution by an estimated 4 percent by 2010.5
<p>
Tighter CAFE standards could be devastating to average families. The reason the traditional full-size family station wagon no longer is widely sold is that car manufacturers found it difficult to meet the 27.5 mpg standard for cars with these "gas guzzlers" in their fleets. Consequently, the market for even less fuel efficient minivans exploded because minivans had to meet only the light truck standard of 20.6 mpg.6  But if standards for light trucks are raised, manufacturers will be forced to raise prices dramatically to cut sales of the minivan so that their fleet average is in compliance. Most families no longer could afford the only vehicle designed specifically for families.
<p>

<a name="labor"></a><b>Department of Labor (LABOR/HHS bill)
<p>
Ergonomics and Fall Protection</b>
<p>
These riders prohibit OSHA from developing or issuing any proposed or final ergonomics standard during fiscal 1996, and requires OSHA to revise its fall protection standard to adjust the height threshold for required fall protection equipment (e.g., railings) from 6 feet to 16 feet before it can begin enforcing the rule.
<p>
OSHA's proposed ergonomics and latest fall protection rulemakings are classic examples of how OSHA puts the search for completely risk-free workplaces above common sense. Although Congress intended that OSHA assure workers safe and healthy working conditions, overly burdensome regulations like ergonomics and fall protection present a significant barrier to job creation and increased real wages. OSHA estimates its proposed ergonomics standard will cost $4 billion per year, and the National Association of Homebuilders estimates the fall protection standard will increase the cost of a home by $1,000 to $5,000. The ergonomics standard alone is the equivalent of almost 285,000 entry-level, minimum wage jobs or 115,000 full-time jobs paying $12.14 per hour with complete benefits. Further, OSHA's draft ergonomics standard requires employers to alter work practices continuously to keep up with developments in ergonomics. It is difficult to imagine how employers can ensure compliance with a regulatory moving target without incurring substantial additional costs. 
<p>
OSHA should be looking at less costly alternatives, but it is not. A broad-based standard like OSHA's draft regulation would impose large and unnecessary costs on small business without necessarily reducing ergonomic injury and illness. OSHA's mandate to formulate an ergonomics standard is based on a subjective and unclear definition. The evidence of causation is unclear, and risk factor threshold levels are unsubstantiated. There has been too little scientific research on ergonomic disorders for anyone to know whether such research can provide adequate guidance for the development of a broad standard. 
<p>
<b>Striker Replacement</b>
<p>
This rider prohibits any executive order or rule that penalizes a contractor because it permanently replaced lawfully striking workers during fiscal 1996.
<p>
Executive Order 12954, issued March 8, 1995, requires that any federal contractor who hires permanent striker replacement workers be subject to termination of the contract or debarment. The $100,000 annual threshold effectively extends coverage to contractors receiving 90 percent of federal contracts and will raise the cost of federal contracts as employers are forced to take into account the potential cost of settling labor disputes. The Employment Policy Foundation estimates the annual economic cost of implementing the order at between $520 million and $2 billion.7  Further, the order will increase the likelihood of strike activity, hurting both union workers and employers through lost wages and output, and may discourage unionized employers from even bidding on federal contracts. It also will increase the incentive for businesses to set up nonunion subsidiaries and encourage the use of nonunion subcontractors, two moves that ultimately hurt union workers' income and job opportunities. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
While permanent labor and environmental policy reform should be pursued, many of the problems addressed by the House appropriations riders are so egregious that immediate relief should be granted. While these riders are an imperfect solution, Americans should view them as necessary to encourage recalcitrant federal agencies to work with Congress to reform some of the nation's most burdensome regulatory statutes.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The House-passed version of the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies appropriations bill includes 17 restrictions on the Environmental Protection Agency's use of appropriations to implement select environmental laws. These limitations, more commonly known as appropriations "riders," have proven to be controversial. But in many cases they are needed to encourage the EPA and the Clinton Administration to act more responsibly in setting and enforcing regulations. They also are needed to encourage the Agency and the White House to work with Congress to reform some of the most seriously flawed environmental statutes. 
<p>
The bill reported out of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, includes only one rider, which prohibits the EPA from requiring states, under Section 304 of the Clean Air Act, to enforce trip reduction efforts such as car pooling. As the Senate acts on the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies bill, however, there are important reasons why it should adopt most of the EPA riders in the House version. While they would limit the promulgation and enforcement of regulations under laws dealing specifically with air, water, waste, pesticides, and similar problems, most deal with the general application of law1 and represent an attempt to correct examples of excess or abuse by the EPA. <p>Both the EPA and the White House brought about this action by refusing to cooperate in substantive reform of existing law. Faced with a Congress intent on reducing unnecessary and expensive laws without sacrificing environmental quality, the Administration has persisted in spurning efforts to craft bipartisan reform. Indeed, the EPA has been assiduous in implementing new regulations that are inflexible, expensive, and pay little attention to the underlying science or economics. Congress has but few tools to reshape policy in this situation. The most promising short-term solution is to use the appropriations process to restrict the use of government funds to pursue certain goals. Environmental riders not only would cool the EPA's regulatory zeal, but also would encourage the Administration to show more cooperation in negotiating substantive reform.
<p>

AN IMPERFECT BUT NECESSARY SOLUTION
<p>
Appropriations riders are not a substitute for substantive reform. They can be useful as stop-gap measures, but changes are needed in the underlying statutes.
<p>
Nevertheless, using the appropriations process in most cases is still better than taking no action. The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) is a good example of why environmental riders can be an imperfect solution. As part of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act of 1986, TRI requires companies to report to the EPA any legal releases of chemicals officially listed as toxic, so that communities will know the types and quantities of these chemicals that end up as wastes. The requirement applies when waste is released into the air or water, and when it is disposed of properly at a landfill or incinerator -- even if that facility is federally run.
<p>
While no doubt well intentioned, TRI has not been a success. Industry experts estimate that it imposes nearly $1 billion in costs, and the list includes numerous chemicals that pose little risk. Particularly troublesome is the EPA's proposal to require that companies report their use of individual chemicals, regardless of whether these chemicals are released into the community or recycled during manufacturing. It is clearly inconsistent with the original intent of the law, which deals with releases into the environment, to require companies at enormous expense to catalog every instance of a chemical's use in its manufacturing. Indeed, the General Accounting Office concluded recently that the EPA's regulatory plan is too ambitious and too great a burden on the chemical industry.2
<p>
In order to make these and other critical environmental issues a priority for this Administration, Congress has been forced to use appropriations riders to force officials to address programs that do not work. In this context, using the appropriations process to restrict enforcement to the reporting of chemicals listed in the authorizing legislation is entirely reasonable. 
<p>
Unfortunately, the TRI rider is less attractive politically than other riders. President Clinton has chosen to politicize and obscure this issue and ignore the underlying problems. Rather than acknowledge the merit in Congress's effort to draw attention to a serious example of over regulation, the Administration falsely claims that the bill would allow firms to pollute communities with toxic chemicals. Unfortunately, proponents of the rider are hampered by the difficulty of communicating this complicated issue to the public. This difficulty underscores the limits of such riders, which must be categorical in their limitations and thus may be nearly as inflexible in the short term as the regulatory excesses they correct. This is why general reform legislation would be far better. Nevertheless, most of these riders are necessary short-term solutions to intractable regulatory problems.
<p>

WHAT THE SENATE MUST DO
<p>
As the Senate considers the EPA appropriations, it should keep most of the House appropriations riders to force the EPA and the White House to focus on much-needed environmental reforms. Congress also should make a concerted effort to identify these as important and communicate this effectively to the public. While many of the riders in the VA/HUD/Independent Agencies appropriations bill address important areas, several are particularly important, and including them in the Senate bill should be a top priority. Three of the most important riders not included in the Senate bill deal with: 
<p><ul>
<li> Wetland enforcement;
<li> Enforcement against states litigating Title V of the Clean Air Act (CAA); and
<li> Penalties against companies for acting responsibly.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Wetland enforcement.</b>
The wetland rider would restrict the EPA from enforcing its Section 404 permitting program. The EPA relies on Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to regulate landowners who wish to disturb a wetland on their property. There are three principal problems with EPA's wetland policies.3 
<p>
First, the statutory authority is questionable; indeed, for isolated wetlands, known as "non-adjacent" wetlands, authority seems clearly to be lacking. Obviously, EPA should not pursue policies that neither the Constitution nor a statute allows it to pursue. 
<p>
Second, the EPA definition of what constitutes a wetland is so unnecessarily broad that land which is bone dry for almost the entire year can be deemed a wetland. 
<p>
Third, the financial resources of many Americans are being destroyed in the name of protecting wetlands because they are forced to surrender, without compensation, their right to use their land. Because many of these affected individuals make their living or pay their mortgages from income derived from the land, their savings can be wiped out. 
<p>
The principal reason for this rider is to give Congress time to enact legislation. This legislation would make wetlands protection legal, priority-based, and fair to those now forced to shoulder the financial burdens alone.

<p>
<b>Enforcement against states litigating Title V of the Clean Air Act.</b>
This rider would restrict EPA from promulgating, implementing, or enforcing the federal permitting program under Sections 502(d)(2), 502(d)(3), and 502(i)(4) of the CAA against a state involved in Title V litigation with the Agency. This provision provides a strong tool against EPA regulatory zeal in the face of state government resistance. Currently, EPA has the authority and incentive to write further regulations under Section 502 and impose sanctions against states that, instead of completing their State Implementation Plans, are litigating Title V. Clearly, states that believe the EPA has overstepped its bounds and is pursuing inflexible and unnecessary regulations detrimental to their residents should have access to the courts without the harassment of sanctions.
<p>

<b>Penalizing companies for acting responsibly.</b>
This rider would prohibit EPA from taking legal action against states or companies for environmental violations discovered during voluntary self-audits and disclosed in compliance with state law. Companies that inadvertently violate environmental regulations now are discouraged from conducting voluntary self-audits to correct violations quickly because they must report their findings to the EPA, which may fine them millions of dollars for past non-compliance. This policy discourages responsible behavior. But if barriers to voluntary compliance are eliminated, companies will clean up pollution faster, more thoroughly, and more cheaply. Because numerous companies have indicated they would perform self-audits and correct violations if the threat of prosecution were minimized, restricting EPA from punishing this past behavior would be a win-win situation for the economy and the environment.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
While permanent environmental policy reform should be pursued, many of the problems addressed by the House appropriations riders are so egregious that immediate relief should be granted. While these riders are an imperfect solution, the Senate must view them as appropriate and necessary to encourage a recalcitrant EPA and White House to reform some of the most burdensome environmental statutes.
<p>
In addition to the one rider in the bill reported out of the Senate subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, the Senate would do well to include, at a minimum, the three riders in the House version relating to wetlands, Title V of the Clean Air Act, and voluntary environmental self-audits. Failing that, Congress should fix these problems when the House and Senate bills reach the Conference Committee.

<a name="intro"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></a><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
Congress likely will consider legislation this year to reauthorize the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Superfund, as CERCLA is popularly known, only is one of the most complex laws now in force, but also is widely regarded as both wasteful and ineffective.  Even the Clinton Administration admits the program does not work.  One reason for is that, despite expenditures of between $20 billion and $30 billion, Superfund has failed to clean up more than a small fraction of the nation's worst hazardous waste sites.  Under the current law, cleanup of the remaining current and potential sites could cost additional tens of billions of dollars.
<p>
Fortunately, there is an opportunity for substantive reform in Congress this year. Senator Robert Smith (R-NH), Chairman of the
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommitee on Superfund, Waste Control, and Risk Assessment, and Representative Michael Oxley (R-OH), Chairman of the House Committee on Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Hazardous Materials, early this session decided to undertake a top-to-bottom review of the program.<Font Size="-1">1</Font>  "If you recognize [Superfund] when we are done," declared Oxley recently, "we won't have done our jobs."<Font Size="-1">2</Font> 
<p>
Congress must correct the fundamental flaws in the current program,
not merely tinker with the statute as last year's bills would have done.<Font Size="-1">3</Font>  Reform should address the core elements of the Superfund structure that fuel litigation, slow cleanups, raise costs, and, most important, encourage the cleanup of sites that pose little risk to human health and safety and divert scarce economic resources from sites that may pose real dangers.
<p>
Specifically, Superfund reform should:
<ul>
<li>Encourage faster cleanups;
<li>Eliminate most of the need for lawyers and courts;
<li>Reduce total spending on CERCLA compliance;
<li>Be fairer to those who now pick up the tab for other people's pollution;
<li>Prioritize risks so that the most public safety possible is bought for the money spent;
<li>Encourage similar reforms at high priority state sites;
<li>Give states authority over a local problem;
<li>Give states funding to pay for their new responsibilities;
<li>Ensure public safety by continuing to allow immediate cleanup of sites that pose an imminent threat to human health;
<li>Reduce taxes on businesses;
<li>Encourage competitive bidding for cleanup work;
<li>Reduce total federal spending;
<li>Reimburse firms that have cleaned up sites under the current law for a portion of their costs; and
<li>Reduce potentially responsible parties' (PRPs)<Font Size="-1">4</Font> annual costs substantially.
</ul>
<p>
<b><a name="costs">LARGE COSTS AND FEW RESULTS</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
Superfund program was enacted after widespread press attention
to the exposure of residents to high levels of dangerous chemicals
Canal near Niagara Falls, New York.<Font Size="-1">5</Font>  Intended to force companies to clean up hazardous waste sites, the law also established a government fund to pay for cleanup of "orphan sites," which are contaminated properties where no responsible party exists -- where the polluter, for example, has gone out of business.<Font Size="-1">6</Font>  The law was hurried through Congress in the final days of the Carter Administration, and many provisions were ill-considered. Although estimates vary, most experts agree that the program has cost at least $20 billion while utterly failing to clean up most hazardous waste sites. Explains Carol Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "A lot of time and money is taken up with companies suing each other they owe to clean up a particular site."<Font Size="-1">7</Font>
<p>
Congress authorized $15.2 billion for CERCLA's trust fund during
the 1990 budget deal. Of this amount, $10.8 billion was spent
by the federal government through fiscal 1994.  The amount spent by companies and individuals to comply with CERCLA overall price tag by many billions of dollars.<Font Size="-1">8</Font>
<p>
Much of this cost has been spent not on cleanup, but on legal
fees and other "transaction costs."  And while program costs have ballooned, cleanups have proceeded slowly.  Only 291, or about 24 percent, of the 1,238 "worst" sites placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) -- have been cleaned up.<Font Size="-1">9</Font>  To clean up the remaining sites already on the NPL will cost the EPA alone an estimated $40 billion. A similar amount is estimated to be spent for state sites. If  the cost of cleaning up federal facilities is added to the equation, the total could exceed $750 billion, or about $7,800 per household.<Font Size="-1">10</Font>
<p>
<b><a name="super">SUPERFUND'S FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
Superfund's combination of heavy cost and modest impact results
from four fundamental problems with CERCLA:
<p>
<ol>
<li>As written, the law is designed to reduce chemicals in the ground, not reduce risks to people;
<li>The program's unreasonable standards require that hazardous waste sites be cleaned up to a pristine level no matter what the location, resulting in a poor return on the investment;
<li>Hazardous wastes by their very nature are local problems, but listings, cleanup decisions, and program federal bureaucracy; and
<li>The law's retroactive, strict, joint and several liability scheme results in endless legal battles as potentially liable parties fight EPA, then each other, and shoulder the costs of cleanup.
</ol>
Each of these characteristics drives up costs while blunting the
effectiveness.  The reauthorization legislation must correct these flaws.
<p>
<b>Flaw #1: Cleaning up chemicals takes priority over protecting health.</b>
<p>
The most important question that should be asked in the reauthorization has not been asked in Superfund debates:  What should be the basic intent of the law? CERCLA was enacted amid fears that some Americans were at risk from hazardous wastes.  Yet the law was not designed specifically to reduce risk to the public. Rather, the goal was cleaning up spilled chemicals.

To be sure, cleaning up chemicals does help protect public health
if the sites being cleaned would expose the public to real risks.
But if there is no threat of risk to the public -- and there would be none without a land use change -- then money is squandered
that could have been used elsewhere to save more lives. Policymakers
take into account such "opportunity costs" spending decisions. As Heritage analysts have noted, "Policy makers generally fail to recognize the simple truth that using resources one way means not using them in other ways that could results....[T]hey ignore the benefits, including much greater possible reductions in risks to individuals, that could be achieved by using these purpose."<Font Size="-1">11</Font>
<p>
From a public health perspective, poor choices are made routinely
in the Superfund program. According to the Office of Technology
Assessment, the listing of most Superfund sites is based on hypothetical risks.<Font Size="-1">12</Font>  Economists Kip Viscusi and James Hamilton found similar results.<Font Size="-1">13</Font> Their study found that hypothetical potential future risks account for 90 percent of "risk-weighted pathways"
at Superfund sites.  For one-third of the sites studied, there is no current risk but only future risks. Moreover, for most of these hypothetical future risks, future generations would be at risk only if homes are built on sites that are not currently residential.<Font Size="-1">14</Font>
<p>
While it would seem prudent to protect against such potential
occurrences as the likely loss of clean aquifers or threats to
human health, actions to avoid hypothetical threats to life should
not have the same claim on already scarce resources.<Font Size="-1">15</Font>  Unfortunately, because Superfund is designed principally to clean up chemicals, the program costs a great deal but achieves little improvement in public health.<Font Size="-1">16</Font>
<p>
<b>Flaw #2: Overly stringent cleanup standards divert resources from more effective uses.</b>
<p>
The extremely high cost of cleanup is closely related to the question
of reducing risk. For the average site, the estimated cost is about $25 million, even though, as a category, hazardous waste considered by EPA to be a medium to low health risk.<Font Size="-1">17</Font>  The cost is so unnecessarily high because of overly stringent and inflexible cleanup standards for hazardous waste sites.
<p>
In addition to requiring expensive cleanups of sites that pose
little or no risk to the public, the standards require that sites
posing a real risk be cleaned up to a level that goes beyond what
is needed to reduce the risk to acceptable levels. For instance,
polluted soil at industrial park sites must be cleaned up to a
level that makes it essentially clean enough to eat. But while
may ingest contaminated dirt accidentally, or even purposefully,
few are likely to be found playing in the dirt at an industrial
park. 
<p>
Cleanup standards should reflect the real risk to a person likely
to be found at the site based on expected exposure, not on some
hypothetical and very unlikely scenario. An industrial park does
not need to be as pristine as a playground.
<p>
 In other instances, no risk exists unless there is some change
in how the land is used.<Font Size="-1">18</Font>  Often, the owners have no plans for development or current use.  Yet
rather than simply require a deed restriction that forbids change unless the site is cleaned up to a level appropriate for any proposed
change in use, the Superfund program requires the PRP to clean
up the site even if it poses no real risk as currently used.
<p>
Real risks also are not addressed in the most cost-effective manner.
instance, CERCLA's preference for permanent cleanup, as opposed
to ongoing treatment or containment, drives up costs for remediation
by discouraging containment and isolation. Blanketing layers of
plastic and clay on the soil, surrounding the property with a
fence, and posting guards might eliminate exposure to the public
for a small fraction of the cost of remediation. But this option
usually is not used.
<p>
Moreover, Superfund is structured so that states have a strong
incentive to demand unnecessarily strict cleanup standards. States
pay only 10 percent of remedial construction costs at fund-led
sites, but the law requires them to pay 100 percent of the Operation
and Maintenance (O&M) costs of such Superfund sites. Even
though periodic, ongoing treatment may be cheaper and may reduce
public exposure equally well, therefore, the states have a built-in
incentive to demand one-time, permanent, and extremely strict
cleanup standards so they can avoid future O&M costs.  Meanwhile,
companies responsible for paying for cleanup needlessly pay more.
<p>
<b><h4>Flaw #3:  The law does not permit local problems to be handled locally.</b></h4>
<p>
Perhaps the most puzzling feature of Superfund is that it is a
federal program. Indeed, CERCLA is not delegated to the states,
unlike all other major environmental laws. But hazardous waste
sites are, at their core, a local problem. If there is any federal
environmental law for which a legitimate case can be made for
devolving authority back to the states, it is CERCLA. Contrary
to the usual argument put forth by those who oppose shifting to
jurisdiction -- that states cannot be trusted to protect their
population -- state and local officials are far more accountable for local risks under their control than are distant federal officials. It is highly unlikely that states would neglect public health and safety concerns, especially given the general awareness and level of knowledge that exist today.
<p>
To deal with any possible problems associated with devolution,
certain safeguards could be built into the system. For instance,
emergency removals that target sites posing immediate and substantial risks could continue at the federal level. Since the EPA has extensive experience and is relatively efficient at emergency response to sites that are truly hazardous, it could maintain the capacity emergency responses.  This is not to say that the EPA emergency program is without its critics, but experience with this program generally has been better than with other parts of Superfund. Of course, safeguards would be needed to prevent abuse of what constitutes an emergency and to curtail the well-known problem of "bureaucratic creep."
<p>
There is another very important reason for returning authority
over hazardous waste sites to the states:  The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution reserves to the states all powers not explicitly granted to the federal government.The federal government should assume responsibility only for issues that are national in scope and interest. Federal involvement in the cleanup of local hazardous waste sites does not meet this standard. In fact, it is hard to imagine anything better suited to the exercise of state leadership and authority than local problems associated with the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.
<p>
<b><h4>Flaw #4:  The determination of liability leads to endless legal battles.</b></h4>
<p>
One of the most damning, though inaccurate, criticisms of Superfund
is that 80 percent of the money has gone to lawyers rather than
for cleanup.  This figure, commonly cited in the press, overstates the litigation costs severalfold, but the substance of the criticism is correct: Superfund's liability scheme encourages litigation and other transaction costs. Further, numerous "horror stories" of individual citizens and small businesses subjected to millions of dollars in potential liability for what most people would consider innocent acts, some of them committed generations ago. For instance, Russ Zimmer was named a PRP for a Superfund site at a battery
cracking plant in Torrington, Wyoming. His contribution to the problem? He sold a bag of dog food in 1977 and a bag of seed in 1984, and took a third-party check as payment for the items. Since the checks had issued by the now-bankrupt company that had owned the battery cracking plant, Zimmer was sued as a PRP by another company caught in CERCLA's liability scheme. Zimmer decided, on advice of counsel, that he should settle to avoid even more in legal costs. He agreed pay $3,500.<Font Size="-1">19</Font>
<p>
One of the major causes of such legal woes is the concept of joint
and several liability, under which even minor contributors to
a problem (for example, someone who tosses a car battery into
a landfill) can be held responsible for the entire multi-million
dollar cost of cleanup.<Font Size="-1">20</Font>
<p>
The concept is designed to find somebody -- anybody -- to pay for cleanup of hazardous waste, even if the "responsible" person has only a tiny part in creating the waste problem. In practice, this means that a firm with "deep pockets" ends up paying for the cleanup of wastes created by someone else.  Naturally, any person or institution identified as a PRP has a strong incentive to show that others are liable as well, in order to spread the costs among more PRPs. Litigation is virtually assured.
<p>
Faced with large and uncertain liability, PRPs typically protect
themselves by hiring lawyers. Thus, rather than quick payments
from "polluters," the liability scheme encourages legal gridlock, cleanup delay, and enormous legal costs. A recent report estimated total government, PRP, and insurer transaction costs of about $1.3 billion at NPL sites.<Font Size="-1">21</Font>  Although EPA Administrator Carol Browner has admitted the need for reform, she also claims that "a lot of come from the program.  The polluter-pays
concept that was first adopted in the Superfund law has changed
the way businesses deal with their waste."  But, Superfund "polluter-pays" system.  Joint and several liability merely guarantees that people like Zimmer pay for cleanup instead of those who are really responsible. In short, it works against the idea of making polluters pay the that their actions impose on others.<Font Size="-1">22</Font>
<p>
Perhaps the most controversial part of the liability scheme is
its retroactivity.<Font Size="-1">23</Font>  Retroactive liability
means that owners, operators, and other individuals and companies
otherwise liable under the strict, joint and several standards
are held responsible for pollution that took place before it became
illegal. For example, a company could be held liable for any pollution
that occurred before the Superfund law was passed in 1980. If
company made jeep parts during World War II, and during production some chemicals seeped into the ground, it would be legally responsible for cleaning up those chemicals though the manufacturing activity was legal at the time. Because of a law passed more than 35 years later, the company may face tens of millions of dollars in cleanup costs.<Font Size="-1">24</Font>
<p>
While retroactive liability is considered by many to be a violation
that "No... ex post facto Laws shall be passed," it also is simply unfair. Under the law as enforced, for instance, a farmer his grandfather -- or even some intervening owner of whom he has
never heard  -- fouled the sub-soil 50 years earlier using then state-of-the-art equipment.  The farmer must fix the entire problem, no matter how much it costs. But if he caused the problem himself back in the he be expected to know that his actions -- considered
legal and time -- might destroy his children's inheritance of
the family farm? Both environmental sensitivity and environmental knowledge have increased exponentially since that time.
<p>
Retroactive liability has triggered an avalanche of litigation
which probably is the biggest contributor to Superfund's failure
to achieve its primary objective of cleaning hazardous waste sites.
Perhaps the most important practical problem is that retroactive
liability increases the number of PRPs for any given site. Numerous
individuals and companies may have owned the land over the decades, each owner typically dealing with others who might also be considered liable. Since many owners and other potentially liable parties have poor records or no records at all for activities several
decades ago -- it is little wonder that those already targeted by the EPA challenge EPA about the remedies selected to keep costs down, pursue other PRPs to spread costs, and sue insurers to recover costs under old policies. 
<p>
In all, transaction costs account for approximately $1.3 billion
annually from all sources. According to the Rand Institute for
Civil Justice, the average cost for PRPs varies from 17 percent
depending on the size of the party held liable.<Font Size="-1">25</Font>  Reform of the Superfund program, however, should eliminate most of these huge transaction costs.
<p>
<b><a name="craft">CRAFTING A PROGRAM THAT WORKS</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
The political key to real reform is to end the infighting between
industry sectors over which will win and which will lose with
changes in the law.  The focus should be on benefiting all government  industry sectors so that, even if the mix of benefits is uneven, the least benefited sector or company is substantially better off under the new law. And to encourage states to accept responsibility for the program, a state fund should be created that is sufficiently attractive to motivate them to extend these reforms beyond National Priorities List sites to high risk state sites.
<p>
An effective Superfund reform proposal should increase fairness,
accelerate cleanups, reduce costs across the board, and more fully
protect the public from real risks. It also should reduce costs
so that no tax increase is necessary to fund the new Superfund
law -- even though retroactive liability would be eliminated for waste disposal at NPL sites before 1987.
<p>
Congress can accomplish these objectives by incorporating certain
features into this year's reauthorization legislation:
<p>
<b>1)  States should have authority over current "orphaned"  sites -- with funding.</b>
<p>
Rather than have the federal government clean up sites for which
no one else is liable, state governments should be responsible
for these costs.These sites, by their very nature, are local problems. Moreover, state governments likely are far more efficient than EPA in conducting cleanups. 
<p>
A revolving loan fund -- or direct payment fund -- or direct payment fund -- should pay for most of the projected cleanup costs transferred
to the states. Initially, the federal share could be perhaps 90
percent, to be scaled down over time. A revolving loan would constrain
the natural tendency to require that sites be restored to pristine
conditions. A higher state share, however, likely would have the
same beneficial effect.
<p>
States should be allowed to dedicate the funds to any of their
most serious hazardous waste sites, not just NPL sites transferred
government.  The condition would be that they enact the changes specified below, the most important being that they prioritize sites without regard to who for cleanup and spend the funds according to that prioritization.  Moreover, they should not use retroactive liability for financing at those sites where federal funds are used. They could continue, of course, to use any liability system they chose for other sites.  This would encourage flexibility and prioritization of cleanup.
It would also help states reach what should be their main objective:
reducing health-threatening risks to their citizens as effectively
and comprehensively as possible.
<p>
A revolving loan fund also should be available for cleaning up
sites.  Typically, businesses locate at abandoned industrial sites -- or
brownfields -- because of their legitimate fear of having to bear the cost of cleaning up hazardous wastes they did not create. So they tend to locate their new facilities sites that have had no previous industrial activity.  This neither makes economic nor environmental
sense.  For sites not currently on the NPL, states could use the revolving to encourage development whenever the need for cleanup causes the land to have a negative worth. In addition, EPA should be
prohibited from second-guessing state remedy and liability decisions
at such sites.
<p>
<p>
<b>2)  EPA should retain emergency cleanup capacity.</b>
<p>
Since the EPA is both experienced and relatively efficient at
emergency response to truly hazardous waste problems, it should
to conduct emergency responses.  To prevent abuses, each state would have the authority to decide whether a site constitutes an emergency. Either the state or a liable PRP would be required to pay for such cleanups through a cost recovery action.
<p>
<b>3) Standards for cleanup should be determined by the states, limited only by certain provisions of law that would be required to adopt to qualify for funding.</b>
<p>
Remedy and site selection standards generally should be left to
the states.
<p>
The states would have to agree, however, to prioritize sites according
to their real risk of human exposure, and to prioritize spending
risk reduced for every dollar spent.  This would give them the "biggest
bang for the buck" in protecting public health.
<p>
The states would be required to not use retroactive liability
(discussed in the following section) for all sites for which federal
funding is provided. Otherwise, they would have an incentive to
transfer costs to the private sector.
<p>
The states should be allowed to spend the new funds on cleanup
of non-NPL sites, provided they agree to extend the new liability
standards to that class of sites.
<p>
Adopting flexible performance standards and other remedy selection
changes would mean enormous savings on the cleanup portion of
total costs. Cost savings of 35 percent typically are estimated
by industry, although some experts believe the real savings could
be twice this amount. Adoption of these standards, however, should
not be made a condition of funding; responsibility for cleanup
costs without the use of retroactive liability, combined with
the funding condition of site prioritization, would encourage
state flexibility without specific standards.
<p>
<b>4) Reform the liability system.</b>
<p>
A more rational standard for assessing liability would:
<p>
<b>Eliminate joint and several liability.</b>  The courts generally have interpreted CERCLA to mean that anyone who has even a slight interaction with the site is liable for the whole cleanup costs.  This
creates a situation where a person or company whose actions caused little or no harm can be pursued for the whole cost of cleanup. Reform would make clear that liability is not joint and several, but instead proportional to a PRP's contribution. This would send the right economic and behavioral signals to the market, and liability would harness fight market forces. For the first time, the "polluter pays" principle actually would be put into practice.
<p>
<b>Repeal retroactive liability.</b>  Retroactive
liability makes people or firms responsible for activities that
took place in the past when they were legal.  Thus, for instance, a landowner is responsible for cleanup of hazardous at the turn of the century by a previous owner.  While the U.S. Supreme Court has not found that retroactive liability violates the Constitution's prohibition of ex post facto laws, holding people liable for actions taken before 1980 is patently unfair to those caught in its web and contrary to American notions of justice. Moreover, it is largely unnecessary. Repeal of retroactive liability, however, need not interfere with a private party's rights to sue for damages. Under the common law, if an action causes harm to a neighboring property, or a party contributes to a public nuisance, the party is liable under tort.
<p>
The date before which no liability would exist could either be
1981, when the original Act took effect, or 1987, when substantial
changes took effect. Even though the fairness argument is not
as obviously compelling for disposals before 1987 as it is for
before 1981, 1987 is preferable for a number of reasons.  The most important is that CERCLA is only a liability statute. It does not set rules for disposal. That is done by RCRA and other laws. These laws primarily took effect or were modified from 1980 through 1986. For example, RCRA's disposal and record keeping rules were extended to 175,000 more entities in 1986.  Unfortunately, many, if not most, companies reasonably believed or were legally advised that if they were in compliance with RCRA and the other laws, they could continue their disposal practices.  Yet these same companies are now liable under CERCLA for their innocent conduct. The 1987 date also is preferable for the sake of efficiency and lowering society's total CERCLA cost burden.  Until 1987, disposal rules for all parties were not clear and records under CERCLA are scanty. If the 1981 date is adopted, protracted court battles and slow cleanups would remain at a large of sites. State governments -- with funding -- would become responsible for cleanup of old "orphan" sites where PRPs are not liable under the new standard.
<p>
<b>Exempt remediation firms and trustees from liability negligence or willful neglect.</b>  These firms can become liable for problems associated with cleanup, "construction" firms willing to assume the risk of cleaning up problems caused by others.  While these firms
should be exempt from strict liability as a matter of law (using the common law standard of gross negligence and willful misconduct), PRPs also should be allowed to contract a greater degree of liability to
those cleanup firms willing to take the additional risk for higher
pay.
<p>
<b><a name="pay">WHO SHOULD PAY</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
One of the most contentious issues in the Superfund reform debate
concerns who should pay for cleanups. If retroactive liability
and joint and several liability are repealed, some level of government
responsible for those newly "orphaned" sites where contamination occurred before the cutoff date -- 1987 under this proposal.  For sites that the government cleaned up, the costs no longer
PRPs, but by the government entity -- state government under
proposal -- that decided the site ranked high enough to merit timely cleanup.
<p>
Since few states would rush to embrace reform that saddled them
with hundreds of millions of dollars in additional costs, a federally
supported state fund would seem reasonable if the program is devolved back to the states.  Where would the federal government obtain this money, and how large a fund would be necessary?
<p>
Currently, the trust fund has about $1.9 billion in annual revenue
and a  prior, unappropriated balance of about $2.5 billion that
is not obligated.  This fund has been raised through a variety of mechanisms, including annual taxes on petroleum (%557 million) and chemicals ($250 million) and a Corporate Environmental
Income Tax of $653 million.<Font Size="-1">26</Font>  These taxes
are set to expire at the end of 1995. In addition, Congress generally
has appropriated $250 million annually for Superfund, and federal
agencies have significant PRP liability at these non-federal facility
NPL sites.
<p>
Covering the expected additional costs to the states for accepting
for this program will require more than the unappropriated
currently in the trust fund. One solution would be to reauthorize
collection of taxes at current levels for the next several years,
slow phaseout of the federal fund could begin.  The costs to states should reduce over time in any event, since the number of NPL sites transferred to them would be fixed.  But there is intense debate over whether current tax levels could finance cleanups with retroactive liability repeal for all current PRPs.  The question is important
because taxes are not likely to be raised. Nor should they be. Indeed,
reform eventually should phase out taxes. But that does not preclude
reexamining either the current mix of funding or the budgetary
vehicle for collecting and spending this revenue stream.
<p>
Lawmakers should note that current Superfund taxes have been used
to fund programs unrelated to Superfund. Funding substantive reform
will require using these revenues to clean up hazardous waste
sites. If the financial flows into and out of the fund are sustainable,
program should be able to "pay for itself," the budgetary process.<Font Size="-1">27</Font>
<p>
The financial implications of repealing retroactive liability and joint and several liability were analyzed by National Strategies,
(NSI).<Font Size="-1">28</Font>  The Barents Group of Peat Marwick, which the study independently, found the analysis to be "carefully conducted, well documented, and to represent a fair assessment of the financial flows...."<Font Size="-1">29</Font>  NSI's conclusions help make the case for a substantive overhaul of Superfund.
<p>
One of the NSI report's key conclusions is that repeal of retroactive
liability for waste disposal that occurred before 1987 is achievable
with the current revenue stream without using the unappropriated
$2.5 billion currently in the trust fund.  The main reason is that significant inefficiencies would be eliminated through reform.<Font Size="-1">30</Font>  The report does not factor in the substantial benefits to be realized through risk prioritization or remedy selection improvements. Savings estimates vary from about 25-70 percent of cleanup costs, but even the more conservative estimates indicate that the amount would be significant.  These savings, as well as about $2.5 billion now in the fund, could be used for other purposes, such as a revolving loan fund for cleanup of state sites that are not on the federal NPL list.
<p>
The NSI report's financial conclusions suggest that, far from
being saddled with additional costs, states could be given access
to a loan fund for addressing waste sites now handled and financed
solely at the state level, since the current fund and expected
future savings not factored into the report would create a significant
pool of funds.<Font Size="-1">31</Font>  Under the proposal here, the only strings attached to the funds would be that states would have to prioritize state sites according to risk and not use their onerous liability laws, if applicable, for the sites high on the list for which federal funds would be provided. Put another way, no funds could be used for sites lower on the priority list unless retroactive,  joint and several liability is not applied to sites higher on the list.<Font Size="-1">32</Font>  A revolving loan fund would be available for cleaning up old industrial sites as well.<Font Size="-1">33</Font>  
<p>
Although the level of funding required to support reform would
depend largely on its structure, the total needed to implement
fully the recommendations outlined in this paper would be around
$2 billion annually. After several years, however, taxes or user
fees could be reduced to reflect anticipated savings. It is critical
that Congress appropriate to the reformed program all Superfund
tax revenue, the current general revenues appropriation, and at
least the annual interest on the current unappropriated trust
fund balance.
<p>
<b><a name="conl">CONCLUSION</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
Superfund is broken. If it is to be repaired, it must be completely
overhauled. Federal agencies, state governments, municipalities,
and the private sector must be relieved of the ill-conceived,
unnecessary, and expensive burdens of the program. Specifically,
the reformed CERCLA should at least:
<ol>
<b><li>Turn authority for current NPL sites over to the states  -- with the necessary funding.</b> To qualify for funds, states should be required to meet two conditions.
<ul>
--Prioritize sites and expenditures based on real risks. <br>
--Eliminate joint and several liability completely and retroactive liability for wastes disposed of before 1987 for sites cleaned with federal funds.
</ul>
<b><li>Allow states to use funds for any of their most serious hazardous waste sites, not just NPL government.</b>  These conditions would have to apply, or states would be tempted simply to spend the money on sites for which they were responsible rather than on those that are most dangerous.
<p>
<b><li>Create a revolving loan fund for cleaning up old industrial sites.
</b>
<p>
<b><li>Allow EPA to retain emergency cleanup capacity.</b>
</ol>
If substantive reforms of this nature are not enacted, Superfund
will continue to be an ineffective and expensive drain on the
American economy. But if proper reforms are instituted, Congress
can achieve its original goal of protecting Americans from hazardous
wastes at reasonable cost.

<li>NSI, <i>The Costs of Superfund: A Financial Analysis</i>.<p>
<li>Budgetary barriers such as "pay go" should be avoided.  Since taxes expire at the end of the year, future revenues should be raised as user fees applied primarily to industries which have generated pollution.

<li>For instance, repealing the liability scheme as well as devolving authority back to the states would mean shifting the costs of cleanup to the government, but saving from this shift also would occur.  With repeal of retro active, joint and several liability for pre-1987 sites, PRPs could expect to save $1.8 billion per year, much of which would not be passed on to government because fully 32 percent of current expenditures -- ranging from 17-60 percent depending on the size of the firm -- are wasted on leagal and other transactionco.  Yet the vast majority of these transactions costs would disappear since they are caused primarily by the liability scheme.  Transaction costs amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars incurred by EPA and the Department of Justice could be reduced and redirected to cleanup.  Similarly, other EPA overhead could be cut and redirected to cleanup.<p>
<li>The amount of anticipated savings could be withheld from the initial fund payments, which is not done now.<p>
<li>Some 40 states adopted CERCLA's liability scheme.<p>
<li>The NSI analysis specificaly assessed and compared the "financial flows" of Superfund under current law and the proposal crafted by Superfund '95(SR '95), a coalition of 600 local governemnts, small and large businesses, and insurers.  The NSI reported simply examines the financial flow of of implications of repealing joint and several liability and retroactive liability proir to 1987, but its financial analysis aupports the more dramatic reforms proposed here because the costs indentified would decrease substantially after a few years with remedy selection reform.  However, the costs under SR '95 and the Heritage Foundation approach would not differ significantly since both propose repeal of the liability scheme, which is a driving cost factor, inaddition to sharing some other key components.  Indeed, the proposal here should be less costly.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	Facing a crowded legislative calendar, the Senate this week is rushing to complete work on landmark legislation that will reframe the process and analytical criteria that federal agencies must follow to issue regulations. For example, the bill includes a requirement that agencies should consider the costs and benefits of their regulatory actions. Remarkably, this common sense way of making a decision, used by people to make decisions in their personal lives, has been deemed too radical for the federal government to use regularly in making decisions about how to protect public health, safety, and the environment. 
<p>
	 Federal regulatory agencies are out of control, and Congress must impose discipline on the regulatory process. Today, agencies are interpreting regulatory statutes in ways that Congress never intended. If Congress understood in advance how much some of these regulations would cost to implement, many lawmakers would never have voted for them. Presidents also have tried but failed to rein in agencies. Every President since Richard Nixon has required this kind of cost-benefit analysis by executive order,1 but agencies have paid only lip service to the orders. Unlike the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the Clinton Administration has further weakened this effort because it actually uses Executive Order 12866 to appear to support sensible, rational rulemaking while doing little in reality to accomplish that objective. Indeed, the Clinton Administration seems to believe that federal regulatory agencies have done a fine job and should be left alone to continue to exercise discretion that thwarts the will of Congress and costs the American economy billions of dollars.
<p>
	Congress must give federal regulatory agencies a rulemaking road map that includes well defined, analytical standards that all rules must meet. Abuse of agency discretion is the heart of the problem that Congress is being asked to solve. Leaving the door wide open for agencies to continue business as usual is not acceptable.
<p>
	Unfortunately, the leading Senate bill, a compromise drawn up by Senators Robert Dole (R-KS) and J. Bennett Johnston (D-LA), is seriously -- and perhaps even fatally -- flawed. The goal of the bill should be to achieve real reform. But, as Senator Johnston recently explained, "this is a huge and vitally important bill where each word carries tremendous meaning.... "2 Senator Johnston understands this well because he has worked tirelessly on behalf of the Clinton Administration to introduce technical language to weaken the key provisions of Senator Dole's original bill,      S. 343, The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, through important word changes.
<p>
	The problem now is that these seemingly arcane choices of language so severely change the legislative effect of the bill that its intent will not be achieved. Indeed, such a law might actually give individual regulatory agencies greater statutory protection from citizen and even Executive Branch efforts to end ineffective or burdensome regulation. The bill contains some useful reforms. But thanks to the careful    inclusion of certain language by those who generally do not support regulatory relief, the bill as it now stands could turn out to be a setback for regulatory reform. 

<p>
<b> THE DOS AND DON'TS OF EFFECTIVE REGULATORY REFORM</b>
<p>
	The current process for making regulatory decisions does not work. It allows agencies routinely to promulgate expensive rules, where the cost to individuals and businesses far outweighs the benefits. The time is ripe for legislation to make sure that regulatory policies in the future are based on sound data and analysis of the costs, benefits, and risks of regulation and create regulatory decisionmaking processes that are more open and accountable to the American people.
<p>
	To achieve this objective, legislation would need to incorporate certain key elements. But it would also need to avoid certain other seeming "reforms" which would actually make the regulations more burdensome and bureaucratic. In order for legislation to achieve reform, it must include strong provisions that:
<p><ul>
<li>Require agencies to use sound data and analysis on the costs, benefits, and risks of regulation and then apply effective criteria to this information to make sound regulatory decisions; 

<li>Enhance public involvement by empowering citizens to petition agencies to review rules to see whether they meet these tests; and 

<li>Hold agencies accountable for their actions by subjecting their actions to judicial review.
</ul><p>
	Specifically, regulatory reform would be characterized by the following "Dos" and "Don'ts" (section references are to the bill as published in the June 21, 1995, Congressional Record).

<p>
<b>1) DECISIONAL CRITERIA</b> (Section 624)
<p>
	DO require that benefits "outweigh" or "exceed" the costs. This key element of reform would force agencies to place the appropriate emphasis on developing unbiased or expected value estimates of both the costs and benefits. Neither costs nor benefits can be known with certainty, particularly in a regulatory context where agencies are, in effect, forecasting or predicting future events involving risk. However, agencies should have to place a value on these costs and benefits that can then be reviewed.
<p>
	DON'T allow agencies simply to contend that benefits "justify" the costs. The use of the word "justify" by agencies today to finesse the process of weighing the costs and benefits is largely subjective. Agencies simply declare that according to their own value criteria the benefits are greater than the costs. But the whole purpose of establishing a cost-benefit standard should be to create a more <i>objectively</i> based, fairly balanced evaluation of all the competing interests involved. Legislation must do this.
<p>
	DO require that agencies choose the regulatory alternative that will "maximize net benefits."  This is perhaps the most critical element of the regulatory reform discussion. A "net benefit" standard is far superior to a "least cost" standard. Even the Clinton Administration, in Executive Order 12866, includes among its principles that an agency "maximizes net benefits... unless a statute requires another regulatory approach."3  Only if the statute does not allow a rule to satisfy the "net benefit" standard should the agency be permitted to select the "least cost" alternative.
<p>
	When an agency is allowed or required to choose the least cost alternative, it may do so without ever stopping to consider whether the regulatory action is worth taking or maximizes benefits. 
<p>

	The table above (not available) illustrates what could be an undesirable regulatory outcome from applying the "least cost" standard. Alternative One is the lowest cost option, but actually costs more per life saved than Alternative Two. However, the agency must choose Alternative One over Alternative Two at a cost of an additional 80 lives per year. In this case, the agency should be allowed to select Alternative Two, the more expensive rule which has the greater "net benefits."  The "least cost" standard precludes this. In addition, if an agency has no idea of what the benefits are or is disinclined to calculate them, it can still promulgate a rule because the least cost standard merely requires it to pick the cheapest rule. There is no need to ask whether there are any benefits from taking the action at all. But a maximizing net benefits approach forces the agency to examine the cost-benefit rationale for its proposed rule.
<p>
	DON'T allow agencies to get away with issuing rules based on mere assertions of benefits. Agencies often cite tremendous uncertainty about the benefits of the regulations they propose. Unfortunately, a least cost standard allows agencies to get away with this. Consequently, agencies just assert that there are difficult-to-qualify benefits and they "justify" the costs of an action. Agencies must be required to use the best data available in performing an analysis of a rule's benefits and costs. 
<p>
 	DON'T let the agency loopholes be bigger than the loop. Lawmakers should not be fooled into believing there are cost-benefit decisional criteria in a statute if the legislation also gives agencies ample exemptions from using them. Agencies already argue that there are uncertainties or benefits that are nonquantifiable. A least cost approach gives them the incentive to continue doing so. Thus, regulators generally are comfortable with a least cost approach because it allows them to escape any requirement rather than attempt to determine seriously what the benefits of their action would be and compare them with the cost.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO</b>
<p>
	Section 624 of the bill unfortunately establishes extremely weak criteria that agencies must use in making regulatory decisions. The provisions are so full of exceptions that an agency could justify almost anything it wanted to. The bill requires an agency merely to show that a rule's benefits "justify" costs. In addition, the rule the agency adopts must be the "least cost" alternative of the reasonable alternatives considered, and even what alternatives are considered appears subject to agency discretion.
<p>
	Even these two troublesome criteria are further weakened because the bill allows agencies to adopt more costly rules when there are "scientific, technical, or economic uncertainties or nonquantifiable benefits to health, safety or the environment...."  This plays completely into the hands of regulators, since agencies and the Clinton Administration routinely claim that benefits are often nonquantifiable. So this provision would allow agencies essentially to be able to justify whatever alternative they want, even if it is very costly and even if there are no benefits.
<p>
	If a statute precludes an agency (or the agency interprets the statute to preclude it) from weighing costs and benefits, then in reality it need only meet the other criteria established. The fact that an agency must "clearly articulate" its evaluation of the relationship of costs to benefits will have little value if a particular law or the agency's interpretation of that law does not require such a relationship even to be established.
<p>
<b>2) COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS</b> (Section 621)
<p>
	DO require agencies to look at "incremental" costs and "incremental" benefits. "Incremental" is another key term in regulation. There may be diminishing returns in taking a regulatory action. Analyzing the "incremental" effect would require agencies to apply cost-benefit analysis to assess the utility of each further increment of control or action. For example, EPA should not be able to develop a new clean air rule and simply state that the rule achieves the desired benefit. There are lots of things that help make the air cleaner. What EPA should be forced to show is that the additional improvements in clean air are directly attributable to the rule with the additional cost. That makes it more difficult for an agency to choose actions that have very high incremental costs but little added benefit.
<p>
	DO require agencies to analyze clearly for the public record what they consider to be the nonquantifiable costs and benefits. The American people have a right to know what value judgments federal bureaucrats have made on their behalf. In particular, agencies must be able to show some reasoning behind their selection of nonquantifiable costs and benefits.
<p>
	DON'T let agencies off the hook from explaining to the public the relationship between benefits and costs, both quantifiable and nonquantifiable. This is particularly important if, as the Clinton Administration has argued, cost-benefit analysis is a necessary mix of scientific and value judgments. In the period for reviewing and commenting on proposed regulations, the American people have a right to know what the relationships are between the quantifiable and <i>non-quantifiable</i> costs and benefits and the importance the agency has given to each of them.
<p>
	DO require agencies to include the analysis of a range of alternatives that can educate Congress and the public about regulation and its consequences. Such a provision in reform legislation becomes even more important if the law unwisely requires a least cost standard, because the consequences of the rule must be fully understood. Agencies should be required to include a discussion of the costs and benefits of a range of regulatory alternatives, even if the underlying statute may preclude the adoption of one or more of the alternatives. Some of the overzealous and expensive regulatory actions taken by agencies are done because Congress has prescribed it in law -- with lawmakers often unaware of the alternatives at the time. Unless Congress takes the position that it always has the best information available when it makes these kinds of decisions, agencies should be required to provide information to Congress and the public about regulatory alternatives that may be preferable to what is prescribed in law. That would allow Congress the option of modifying the law.
<p>
	DO require agencies to assess the cumulative burden of a rule and the burden on small business. Agencies must be required to assess the cumulative burden of their regulatory actions and the burden on small businesses. The Clinton Administration wisely considered these important enough to include this item in the regulatory principles of E.O. 12866.4 Unfortunately, agencies routinely ignore the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which requires agencies to assess specifically the impact of their regulations on small business. As the Clinton Administration puts it, regulatory agencies "still tend to draft one-size-fits-all" regulations.5 Small businesses are extremely vulnerable to heavy regulatory compliance costs. Congress thus must require agencies to be flexible in crafting rules to minimize the burden on smaller firms.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO </b>
<p>
	Unfortunately, rather than require agencies to focus on the incremental costs or benefits, the definitions in the bill appear to allow an agency to attribute almost any benefits to a rule that may not, in reality, be the result of that rule but of some other "agency action."  True, an agency is allowed to do the same for "cost," but regulators have no incentive to do so. What this means is that agencies have wide freedom to find unrelated benefits to justify the costs of a rule.
<p>
	Section 622 of this bill does require agencies to include cost-benefit analysis as part the proposed and final rulemaking processes. It restricts an agency's discussion of reasonable alternatives solely to those the agency has the authority to consider. In addition, the bill appears to limit further the benefits of examining reasonable alternatives by allowing an agency to choose which alternatives it will consider rather than all of them (as specified in the bill). There appears to be no requirement that an agency must include in its cost-benefit analysis either an assessment of the cumulative impact or the impact on small business.
<p>
	Agencies are allowed, under the bill, to issue a major rule for effect without the cost-benefit analysis if the agency "for good cause finds that conducting the cost-benefit analysis is impracticable due to an emergency or health or safety threat that is likely to result in significant harm to the public or natural resources."  This is an extremely broad exemption, which may even be broader than what is currently permissible under the Administrative Procedures Act. How broadly can agencies interpret "health or safety threat"?  Can a regulatory action designed to save one hypothetical life be justified here?  This exemption should be exercised only rarely, or it would become a huge loophole. This weak provision can be strengthened by requiring the agency head to make the "good cause" determination only in emergencies and to justify it directly to Congress.
<p>
<b>3) RISK ASSESSMENT</b>
<p>
	DO require agencies to generate and disclose central tendency estimates of risk. Some agencies focus entirely on "worst-case," "upper-bound," or "high-end" estimates of risk. These estimates are not necessarily wrong or always inappropriate for decisionmaking. However, they are always wrong, inappropriate, and misleading when they are provided as estimates of "the" risk. Further, such estimates cannot be properly used in cost-benefit analysis -- except where an agency seeks to show that, under even the most favorable circumstances, the benefits of a proposed regulation do not justify the costs. Where they are proposing to regulate, agencies should be prohibited from providing estimates only of the "worst-case," the "upper-bound," or the "high-end."
<p>
	DO encourage agencies to generate as much of the full risk distribution as possible. Risks are never uniform across the population, and all risk estimates suffer from considerable uncertainty. Most risk experts agree that it is better to ascertain the entire risk distribution rather than to rely on single-valued point estimates. While it is not possible to do this perfectly, every effort ought to be devoted to doing it as well as possible. Legislation should provide incentives that encourage both regulatory agencies and regulated entities to estimate more the risk distribution than just the central tendency.
<p>
	DO require agencies to disclose fully the assumptions, data, models, and inferences that underlie their risk assessments. The public cannot be expected to comment intelligently upon (or successfully challenge) agency risk assessments that are cryptic or inadequately documented. Risk experts agree that transparency is key to effective review and oversight. Only those who fear being held accountable oppose consistent, firm, and unyielding demands for full disclosure.
<p>
	DON'T allow agencies to get out of performing risk assessments for major rules by asserting vague claims of impending health, safety, or environmental catastrophe. Such claims are implausible on their face without a credible risk assessment, for how would an agency head know that a catastrophe lurks without scientific evidence?  It is important to permit agencies to respond to real emergencies without first performing a sound risk assessment because time is of the essence. However, once this response is in place, there is no legitimate reason for waiving normal analytic requirements. Emergency action promulgated without risk assessment (or cost-benefit analysis) should automatically sunset when agencies fail to fulfill their analytic and procedural requirements in a timely fashion.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO </b>
<p>
	The discussion draft incorporates many important principles for risk assessment and risk characterization, and risk assessments performed in accordance with its spirit will be better than current practice. Unfortunately, the draft falters in too many places where reasonable performance standards could easily be articulated and may provide loopholes that are too numerous and too large.
<p>
	Section 633(f)(1) directs agency heads to express risk estimates in terms of ranges or distributions, but fails to express a preference for the latter. Ranges are not nearly as useful as distributions, and in many instances they will be highly misleading.
<p>
	Section 632(c)(1)(A) allows agencies to evade the risk assessment requirements entirely by asserting vague "health or safety threat[s]... likely to result in significant harm."  Regulations imposing billions of dollars in cost and preventing a mere handful of hypothetical cancer cases have nevertheless been issued on the ground that such risks are "significant."  With this history, it is hard to be optimistic about agencies' willingness to foreswear this huge loophole.
<p>
<b>4) JUDICIAL REVIEW</b> (Sections 553, 706)
<p>
	DO include a strong judicial review provision that makes agencies accountable to the public. The only way agencies will perform the analyses required by a strong standard for cost-benefit and decisional criteria is if the courts can check them. The courts must be allowed to consider whether or not the agency followed the legal procedures for public notice and comment and the extent to which the analyses required by the regulatory reform legislation relate to the agencies' decisional responsibilities as specified in the law.
<p>
	A strong judicial review provision is needed to force agencies to comply more strictly with a reform statute. But such a provision means little if the cost-benefit standard and decisional criteria are weak, for an agency can happily comply with legislation with a weak standard. 
<p>
	 The Administration and Senate Democrats, who generally have supported the aggressive use of regulation, understandably do not want strong judicial review. But they also know that they can weaken the effect of judicial review by watering down the cost-benefit standard and the decisional criteria. In doing so, the courts will have a hard time finding fault with an agency's chosen action.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO </b>
<p>
	The standards for review in Section 625 allow courts to set aside an action which is "arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion (or unsupported by substantial evidence where the standard is otherwise provided by law)."  The problem is that, given the weak nature of other provisions of the bill, there will be very few cases where the courts will be able to set aside an agency rule on these grounds. Indeed, the bill seems to enhance -- rather than control -- an agency's ability to exercise its discretion, and the public will have difficulty challenging it in court.
<p>
<b>5) ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES</b> (Section 553)
<p>
	DON'T let agencies off the hook easily for providing public notice and disclosure and following public procedures. Exemptions from such requirements should be the exception, not the norm. Today, agencies continue to stretch compliance with requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. Agencies must recognize that the public has a right to this information and the fact that it is perhaps inconvenient or takes time to provide it is not an acceptable excuse from doing it. Demonstrating that the public notice and procedures are "contrary to the public interest" appears to be a sufficient standard.  If an agency feels that is compelled to circumvent public notice and comment and/or cost-benefit analysis, this choice must be made at the highest levels of the agency and only for true "good cause."  In addition, if an agency uses the exemption, it should be required to go back later and follow the appropriate public procedures. Even the Paperwork Reduction Act requires agencies that have sought emergency exemptions from OMB review to go back and submit a proper request for approval and make any changes required based on public comment and OMB review. Regulations should be held to at least the same, if not a higher, standard than paperwork.
<p>
	DON'T allow agencies to issue conflicting or duplicative rules. Agencies should be expected before issuing a final rule, to the extent permitted by law, to make sure it is not incompatible with or duplicative of any other rules already in force. Agencies are notoriously bad at coordinating their regulatory actions. OIRA has played a critical role in doing this for them. However, it is not without a tremendous amount of effort. Again, even the Clinton Administration in E.O. 12866 includes among its regulatory principles instructions to agencies "to avoid regulations that are inconsistent, incompatible or duplicative with other regulations or those of other federal agencies."6  At a minimum, an agency should explain in its proposed and final rules what steps it has taken to work with other agencies to resolve conflicting policies or duplicative efforts.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO</b>
<P>
	Section 553 addresses the administrative procedures agencies must use to promulgate rules. It outlines what agencies must include in their proposed and final rules, and the ways in which agencies may go about gathering information about a proposed action. These changes are important because agencies are required to disclose to the public important information, including information regarding any cost-benefit analysis, and alternative methods of compliance. However, there is a "good cause" exemption, and it does not appear to require an agency that has an exemption to go back later, follow public procedures, and make any necessary changes. 
<p>
	 Section 553 also gives interested persons the right to petition for the "issuance, amendment or repeal of a rule."  The petition process for major rules is further addressed in Section 623(j).
<p>
<b>6) PETITIONS</b> (Section 623)
<p>
	DO require a strong public petition process and keep it separate from the agency's "look-back" timetable. The public should be given the right to demand that an agency reexamine any aspect of a "major" rule after it has gone into effect, including the underlying cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment. Today, the public can comment on a rule only before it is promulgated. Affected individuals and industry should have the ability to petition agencies and/or the President to reexamine regulations, to the extent permitted by law. This should include petitions targeted at specific types of regulations, to repeal agency guidance enforced as regulation, to examine alternative methods of compliance or waive compliance with rules, or to reexamine the risk assessment or cost-benefit analyses performed. However finely the petition process is structured, it should include:  1) an advisory committee of experts in the agency's area of responsibilities to help review and advise the agency; 2) clear deadlines for when an agency must respond to petitions; and 3) a prohibition on the consideration of additional similar petitions for a reasonable period once a decision is made.
<p>
	Until an agency makes a decision regarding an existing rule in response to petitions submitted, the agency should not limit the number of petitions submitted. The petition process should be seen as operating for existing rules in a manner similar to the way in which the public comment process works for proposed future rules. An agency may receive hundreds or thousands of public comments on a regulation during the proposed rule stage. Today, an agency cannot limit the number of comments it receives on a proposed rule because there might be too many. That is the whole point of the public comment process; people have a right to participate in regulatory decisions that affect them. Similarly, an agency should not limit the number of petitions submitted for fear of getting too many. The fact that there might be 1,000 identical petitions filed should be a message to the agency that there is a serious problem that deserves its attention and soon. There is a frightening arrogance in taking the position that the government does not have to be responsive to the needs of the people because it will make too much work for government bureaucrats.
<p>
	The right to force a reexamination by petition should not depend on the agency's timetable for reviewing its own rules (the "look-back" process). Linking the petition and look-back process would give agencies ample opportunity to avoid or delay addressing petitions or reviewing rules in a timely manner. 


<p>
<b> WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO</b>
<p>
	While Section 553 gives the public the right to petition for "the issuance, amendment or repeal of a rule," Section 623 appears to undermine seriously the effectiveness of this petition process. Under this Section, one of the reasons a petition to amend or repeal a major rule would be rejected is if the rule has already been included as part of the agency's final review of rules schedule.
<p>
		So if an agency has already decided that a major rule will not be reviewed for, say, another ten years, the petition will not be granted. The only recourse the affected party has is then to petition to change the priority the agency has assigned to the review of the rule. But that agency petition review process alone could take anywhere from 18 to 36 months without anything being done to change the schedule for reviewing the rule, let alone changing the rule itself. The same procedures would apply to petitions to review interpretive rules, general statement of policy, and guidance. These provisions thus appear to allow agency bureaucracy to thwart providing any kind of timely regulatory relief for the most expensive, burdensome rules.
<p>
<b>7) AGENCY REVIEW OF RULES</b> (Section 623)
<p>
	DO require agencies periodically to review existing regulations and do it frequently.  In E.O. 12866, the Clinton Administration included a "look-back" mechanism.7 To date, the success of this effort has been limited. Agencies should be required by statute to work in conjunction with OIRA to establish schedules for the review of major rules. Some proposals have suggested that agencies should wait ten or more years to review rules. This makes no sense. These federal regulatory agencies have tens of thousands of employees who handle these program rules every day:  they, as well as the public, know what rules do not work. The Vice President's "reinventing regulation" reports have begun to ask them. The American people should not have to wait more than ten years to change or eliminate rules that the federal government itself has already decided are unwise. Thus, while regulatory reform legislation should improve standards for future rulemakings, it also should provide a more timely mechanism for reassessing existing regulations. 

<p>
<b> WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO</b>
<p>
	Section 623 gives federal agencies, rather than the affected public, the ability to determine when burdensome regulations will be reviewed and perhaps changed. This provision appears to allow agencies to take as long as 14 years to revise a regulation. Thus, under the bill, agencies possibly could be allowed to take until 2010 even to consider changing rules that the Clinton Administration already may have identified as ineffective or excessive through its "reinventing government" efforts. 
<p>
	 Specifically, agencies are required by the bill to solicit comment on a preliminary schedule of review of rules they have identified within one year (and every subsequent five years) after enactment of this law. Interpretive rules and guidance, which may have the force and effect of rules and can be used to get around rulemaking requirements, also can be added to the list. A final schedule must be published a year later, addressing public comment. This final schedule can be revised if the agency grants a petition requesting a change in the priority of a rule or to amend or repeal a major rule. The deadline for the review of any rule cannot be longer than ten years from the date of the initial publication of the final schedule. However, the agency head can extend the deadline for review of any rule by up to two additional years (i.e., total agency review time alone can be 12 years). Two years before the deadline for review, the agency must notify the public and solicit comments on the rule and address these comments in a published notice within a year before the deadline. The agency still has two years after the deadline for review to promulgate a revised rule if that is the action that the agency chooses to take. If no action is taken within the two years, the rule would expire. 
<p>
	 Opponents of "look-back" provisions argue that it would be a cumbersome, costly process for agencies. Unfortunately, Section 623 adds a provision that requires the President's budget for each agency to "identify as a separate sum" the amount requested to implement the section. If an agency does not want to carry out this provision of the law, it may fail to request money for implementation, which the President and Congress may support. This provision -- at the heart of regulatory relief -- is seriously weakened by allowing it to be undermined through the budget process.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	For regulatory reform legislation to be effective, it must force regulatory agencies to behave differently. It must force them to base their regulatory decisions on costs, benefits, and actual risks faced by Americans and force them to use sound data to make these calculations and state clearly what non-measurable factors shaped the design of the regulation. Once a regulation is promulgated, reform legislation must give the public much greater power to force reviews of existing rules that do not meet these tests. And legislation must hold agencies accountable, under judicial review, for their regulatory actions.
<p>
	Senator Dole was doing regulatory reform the right way before the Senate Democrats and the Clinton Administration got in the way. While the intent of most sponsors of the current Senate draft is a bill that would achieve the objectives of real reform, the language of the bill itself is so flawed that it would not achieve these intentions. Indeed, in many areas the language actually would insulate agencies further from proper accountability. The Dole/Johnston bill as currently drafted could be a setback for regulatory reform.

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
 <P>
In an effort to ease the burden of federal red tape, Representatives Tom 
DeLay (R-TX) and David McIntosh (R-IN) and Senators Don Nickles (R-
OK), Christopher Bond (R-MO), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) have 
introduced legislation (H.R. 450/S. 219) to place a moratorium on executive 
branch regulatory activities. The purpose of the bills is to provide for a "tim
out" period, during which the Congress and the Administration can debate and 
study the large number of regulations currently being written and consider 
pending reforms aimed at improving the way in which rules are written. 
<P>
Congress is right to be concerned about the heavy burden of regulation on the 
economy. The departing Bush Administration estimated in 1993 that 
regulation cost the economy $542 billion in 1991 and that the cost would 
increase to $662 billion by the year 2000. Using different calculations less 
than a year later, the Clinton Administration placed the cost of federal 
regulation to the economy at the still very high figure of "at least $430 billi
annually." Despite these figures, the Administration's November regulatory 
agenda indicates plans to issue 872 final rules in the upcoming months. 
Private sector analysis of just two of eight proposed rulemakings from one 
agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 
estimates these rules would cost business billions of dollars annually to 
implement. 
<P>
Before introducing the legislation, the Republican leadership first asked the 
President in a letter to declare a 100-day moratorium himself. The 
Administration refused, calling the freeze a "blunderbuss that could work in 
unintended ways." A moratorium, however, would not stop rules that would 
ease unnecessary federal red tape or address imminent threats to public safety.
The moratorium legislation is designed instead to provide both the 
Administration and the Congress with two important opportunities: 
<P>
Congressional committees and the Administration will gain a review period to 
examine rules that are in the pipeline and the chance to determine whether the 
Administration's own regulatory review processes are working. 
<P>
Congress will have an opportunity during the moratorium period to debate the 
regulatory process reforms included in such measures as the House 
Republicans' Contract With America, including risk assessment and cost-
benefit reform, paperwork reduction, a regulatory budget proposal, and 
private property rights reform. 
<P>
<B> HOW THE PROPOSED MORATORIUM WOULD WORK</B>
<P>
The Regulatory Transition Act of 1995 would halt agency rulemaking dating 
back to November 9, 1994, and extending until June 30, 1995. Rulemaking 
activities that would be covered by the moratorium thirty days after the bill's
enactment include substantive or interpretative rules, statements of agency 
policy, notices of inquiry, and advance notices and regulatory notices of 
proposed rulemakings. 
<P>
The moratorium also would include regulatory actions covered by statutory 
and court deadlines. Any deadline would be extended for five months or until 
July 1, 1995, whichever is later. So the public would know what rulemakings 
and deadlines would be covered by the moratorium, the President would be 
required within thirty days to publish the list in the Federal Register. 
<P>
The purpose of the legislation, however, is to suspend only burdensome 
regulations. Thus, it exempts from the moratorium those rules that would 
streamline or reduce regulatory or administrative actions and license and 
registration approvals. It is no "blunderbuss." Despite Administration official
claims, it is not intended, for example, to block the Administration's proposal
to streamline federal procurement rules. The legislation also would allow the 
President, through executive order, to waive the moratorium for actions 
necessary because of imminent threats to public health and safety. 
<P>
<B> THE REGULATIONS THAT WOULD BE COVERED</B>
<P>
A principal stimulus for the regulatory moratorium is the large number and 
wide scope of federal regulatory actions now under way. The moratorium 
would allow these regulations to be examined, while lawmakers at the same 
time could streamline and improve the regulatory process itself. The actions 
listed below, which have been estimated to cost close to $50 billion, are only 
a sample of the pending rulemaking actions that would be covered under the 
moratorium: 
<P>
Indoor Air Quality. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) would be prevented from promulgating a rule to require restaurants, 
retailers, office building owners, and others to implement comprehensive 
indoor air and ventilation plans. The rule would require these businesses, as 
well as manufacturers, to ban cigarette smoking unless smoking takes place in 
separately ventilated rooms. OSHA estimates that the rule would cost 
employers $8.1 billion annually. 
<P>
Ergonomics (Also Called Repetitive Motion Disease). OSHA currently is 
working on a rule that would require employers to take a number of actions to 
address repetitive motion injuries. These are injuries due to repeated hand, 
wrist, or other physical motions that cause or aggravate musculoskeletal 
disorders. Employers would be required not only to have written plans to 
prevent these injuries, but also to take actions to redesign work areas, such a
desks and computer set-ups, to slow assembly lines, and potentially to pay for 
medical bills. Private industry estimates that a similar rule proposed by 
California-OSHA would cost $3.1 billion annually in that state alone. Other 
sources estimate the federal rule would cost $21 billion to implement. 
<P>
Race and Gender Disclosure Rules. The Federal Reserve Board would be 
prevented from issuing final rules under the Community Reinvestment Act. 
Specifically, the moratorium would stop work on a requirement that banks 
and thrifts report race and gender data of small businesses and farmers 
seeking loans for $1 million or less. This proposal, incidentally, contradicts 
another Federal Reserve rule that prohibits institutions from collecting such 
data on loan applications. 
<P>
Labeling of Sunglasses. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be 
stopped from any further work on a rule to require labeling of sunglasses. 
According to the Administration's regulatory agenda, the purpose of this 
proposal (which is still in the pre-rule stage) is to make sure consumers are 
aware that overexposure to ultraviolet radiation could hurt their eyes. 
<P>
Paper Industry "Cluster Rules." The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
has proposed what it terms "cluster rules" for the paper industry. Basically, 
these rules combine requirements under the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. 
While the EPA claims the new rules would simplify existing regulations, 
many businesses say they actually complicate them. According to the paper 
industry, the rules would cost $11 billion in capital expenditures. According 
to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the EPA admits "the new rules would force 
33 mills to close; 21,000 people would lose their jobs." 
<P>
Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative. The EPA's Great Lakes Initiative would 
impose uniform standards for water quality on eight different states in the 
Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin). The EPA first proposed the initiative on April 
16, 1993, and is required by court order to issue the rules on March 13, 1995. 
The EPA estimates that the proposal could cost from $80 million to $500 
million annually. But in a study conducted for the Council of Great Lakes 
Governors, DRI-McGraw Hill estimated that it would cost over $2 billion per 
year and up to 33,000 jobs lost. According to the Great Lakes Water Quality 
Coalition, which consists of local governments, businesses, and agricultural 
interests in the region, the initiative will not "significantly improve" water 
quality and "does not address the predominant sources of chemical pollutants 
into the Great Lakes Basin -- air deposition and stormwater runoff." 
<P>
Clean Air Act: California Federal Implementation Plan (FIP). The EPA is 
required by judicial deadline to issue in February its final federal plan to pu
three areas in California (Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Ventura) in 
compliance with the air quality requirements in the 1977 Clean Air Act. The 
1,700- page draft plan would impose draconian limits on emissions, ranging 
from factories to automobiles and trucks and even to lawn mowers. The EPA 
estimates that the FIP could cost Californians between $4 billion and $6 
billion annually. According to the State of California, when the FIP is fully 
implemented in 2010 the "losses will total at least $8.4 billion in direct cost
$17.2 billion in output, and 165,000 jobs." This estimate does not include the 
impact on transportation firms in the rest of the state that are affected by th
rule. 
<P>
<B> RECOMMENDED ACTIONS DURING THE MORATORIUM</B>
<P>
These proposals are only a sampling of the hundreds being worked on by 
federal agencies which together would impose many billions of dollars in 
regulatory burdens on the economy. A regulatory moratorium would allow 
Congress and the Administration to review the justifications for these rules to
see whether they follow the standards set by the Administration and should be 
allowed to move forward. Even more important, Congress also should use the 
interval to work on legislation that would roll back burdensome rules and 
overhaul the regulatory process. 
<P>
Clinton's Regulatory Review. According to President Clinton's executive 
order on regulatory review, the White House Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and the federal agencies are supposed to weigh a 
number of factors when deciding to regulate. Specifically, the executive order 
requires that agencies planning to issue "significant rulemakings" (those 
estimated to cost more than $100 million annually) must analyze their costs, 
benefits, and possible alternatives.Although not a specific requirement, 
agencies are encouraged when setting regulatory priorities to consider the 
risks posed by "various substances or activities within its jurisdiction." 
Agencies also are required under the order to have a process by which they 
can review existing regulations. 
<P>
During the moratorium period, Congress and the Administration should 
review at least the ten or fifteen proposals expected to impose the largest 
burden on the economy to see whether agencies actually are following the 
Administration's own requirements to conduct cost-benefit analyses, consider 
risks, and look for less costly alternatives. The high cost of the regulations 
mentioned above raises questions about how closely the agencies are adhering 
to the executive order. In addition, Congress should review issues brought up 
in the Clinton Administration's own six-month review of the order. For 
example, although OIRA Administrator Sally Katzen stated that they had 
"made a very good start in implementing" it, she admitted that "the start-up 
time for various provisions of the Order has taken longer (and in some cases a 
lot longer)" than anticipated, such as agency review of existing regulations. I
addition, the report listed items for further consideration, such as how 
agencies determine which rules are "significant" and whether the definition 
needs to be clarified; whether executive branch review time limitations are 
sufficient -- especially for significant rules; and post hoc evaluation of rule
determine whether initial estimates were correct and the results expected 
achieved. 
<P>
OSHA's proposed rulemaking on indoor air quality is one example of a rule 
that would benefit from closer scrutiny. According to the Administration's six-
month review, OIRA spent only nine days reviewing an $8 billion-a-year 
regulation. Given OSHA's propensity for past regulatory excesses, this rule 
warrants more study. In addition, the agency's scientific justification for the
rule relies heavily on a controversial EPA second-hand smoke study. 
Congress, last year, almost passed legislation that would have given the EPA 
authority to conduct further studies and to educate the public and inspectors 
regarding "indoor air quality" or "sick building syndrome." Although the 
legislation states that the EPA is supposed to coordinate with OSHA, in 
certain cases the two agencies' responsibilities appear to overlap. 
<P>
The "Contract" Regulatory Reforms. Placing a freeze on most regulatory 
activity also would give Congress an interval within which to consider 
regulatory reforms such as those included in the House Republicans' Contract 
With America, as well as others introduced in the Senate. The unifying 
purpose of these proposals is to establish a more thorough system of scrutiny 
for proposed regulations than exists under current law and the Clinton 
executive order. 
<P>
The Contract With America contains major regulatory reforms which have 
been introduced by Representatives Bill Archer (R-TX), Tom DeLay (R- TX), 
Billy Tauzin (D-LA), Lamar Smith (R-TX), and others as the Job Creation 
and Wage Enhancement Act of 1995 (H.R. 9). The reforms include putting in 
place risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis procedures for regulations, a 
regulatory budget to control the cost of regulations, improvements in the 
Paperwork Reduction and Regulatory Flexibility Acts, and compensation for 
private property owners for government "takings" of their property. Most of 
these provisions were introduced in both Houses last year as separate pieces 
of legislation and came close to passage. 
<P>
Three reforms, in particular, would dramatically improve the current 
regulatory process: risk assessment/cost-benefit analysis, a regulatory budget,
and private property rights reform. Specifically: 
<P>
Congress should require agencies to base rules on sound science and to 
prioritize. 
<P>
Action should be taken to stop government from restricting private property 
to enforce environmental regulations. Out of simple fairness, the government 
should be required to reimburse property owners if a regulation restricts their
right to use their land. 
<P>
Debate over these measures, moreover, would help lay the needed 
groundwork for enactment of a regulatory budget. This reform would place a 
ceiling on the total estimated cost that could be imposed on the economy each 
year by all federal regulations. The agencies must improve their ability to 
estimate the cost of regulations and to prioritize before a regulatory budget 
can work or be enacted by Congress. 
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION 
</B>
<P>
Both the Clinton Administration and the new leadership in Congress have 
called for improving the regulatory process and easing the burden of red tape. 
Neither branch of government, however, has acted either to curb the volume 
of new rules or to lower the cost of regulations now in the pipeline. A 
regulatory moratorium would give both the Administration and Congress time 
to rethink current regulations and enact reforms to ease the impact of future 
rules.

INTRODUCTION
 
<P>    Congress may act soon on legislation to reauthorize the 1980 
Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(CERCLA, pronounced sir-kluh), also known as Superfund. As it is 
enforced, Superfund is perhaps the most complex existing law. But it 
is now synonymous with failure and has become a symbol of wasteful, 
ineffective environmental legislation. 

<P>The Clinton Administration agrees that the Superfund law has not 
worked, and last February unveiled its reform proposals. These 
proposals have been substantially incorporated into two bills before 
Congress: S.1834, introduced by Senator Max Baucus (D-MT), who is 
Chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works; and H.R. 
3800, introduced by Representative Al Swift (D-WA), the Chairman of 
the Transportation and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee of the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce.

<P>Although $20 billion has been spent already on the 
program,Superfund has failed in its mission to clean up hazardous 
waste sites. So far, only a small fraction of the "worst" hazardous 
waste sites have been cleaned up. To clean up the remaining sites will 
cost hundreds of billions more. Unfortunately, the legislation fails 
to address the two fundamental problems that have created this 
situation.<P>
Specifically, the legislation:
<P>
Retains the law's retroactive, strict, joint and several liability 
scheme. 

  <P>   This delays site cleanup as responsible parties attempt to avoid 
liability by shifting it to others. Moreover, it adds to total site 
cleanup costs by creating a climate for increased litigation and other 
transaction costs.
<P>
Maintains overly stringent and inflexible cleanup standards.
   
<P>  Unreasonable cleanup standards are the other major factor behind 
the slow and costly pace of site cleanup. The current system not only 
fails to prioritize those sites posing the most significant risk, it 
also imposes excessive standards of "cleanliness."

 <P>    Instead of fixing these fundamental problems, the bills create 
the Environmental Insurance Resolution Fund (EIRF), funded by an 
unnecessary and inequitable $8.1 billion tax on the insurance and 
reinsurance industry. The purpose of this fund is to settle the 
problem created by current law that virtually forces companies to sue 
the insurance industry because the extent of insurer liability is not 
easily settled. This fund, built on retrospective and prospective
taxes, helps some insurance companies at the expense of others and 
still would leave insurers open to future risk.

<P>     The right solution would be to repeal retroactive, joint and 
several liability and fix the cleanup standards. By doing this, only 
the most needy sites would be cleaned up. Instead of the l itigious 
scramble for the responsible party and the ensuing litigation, the 
polluter would pay. For those sites where no one is legally 
responsible under the new law, the federal government should decide if 
they warrant cleanup, and if so, clean them up.

<P>     In addition, the bills contain other provisions that do nothing 
to fix the Superfund program and will only add to the cost of the bill 
and the cost of cleaning up hazardous sites, such as new Davis-Bacon 
Act expansions in the House bill. These have no place in such 
legislation.

<P>     The many problems with these bills underscore the need to move 
cautiously on Superfund reform rather than to rush through a bill in 
the final days of this Congress. With exploding costs on the horizon 
caused by Superfund's flaws, real reforms are necessary now. These 
bills, however, would virtually guarantee five years more of the 
status quo until the next reauthorization. If Superfund reform cannot 
be done right this year, it should not be done. 

<P>WHAT IS SUPERFUND?

<P>     The Superfund program was created in 1980 after widespread media 
attention to the exposure to high levels of dangerous chemicals of 
residents of Love Canal, near Niagara Falls, New York. The national 
media coverage thus provided the political impetus for legislative 
action. (It is  important to note that the company that buried the 
chemicals in the area, Hooker Electrochemical Company, took great care
to prevent public exposure to the chemicals.  Hooker buried the 
chemicals sealed in a thick protective tube of   impermeable clay with 
the intent of maintaining ownership of the land.  Unfortunately, the 
Niagara Falls Board of Education through threat of eminent domain, 
effectively forced the company to sell the land (for $1), despite the
company's warmings that the land was contaminated and not fit for 
public use.  A public elementary school was built on the site and city 
construction crews bulldozed through the clay seal, thus allowing the 
chemicals into the surrounding soil.  Additionally, some of the land 
was sold off for residential housing.  Thus, the problems at Love 
Canal were the direct result of government interference.) 

<P>     Superfund, known formally as the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), was intended to 
force companies to clean up their hazardous wastes. It also created a 
government fund to pay for cleanup of "orphan sites," which are 
contaminated properties where the polluter, say, has gone out of 
business. (42 U.S.C.  sec.  9601 et.  seq.; PL 96-510, as amended by 
97-216, July 18, 1982; PL 97-272, September 30, 1982; P.L.  98-45, 
July 12, 1983; PL 99-160, November 25, 1985; PL 99-499 (Superfund 
Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA)), October 17, 1986; 
PL 100-202, December 22, 1987; PL 101-144, November 9, 1989; PL 101- 
508, November 5, 1990; PL 101-584, (Superfund Surety Bonding),
November 15, 1990; PL 102-389, October 6, 1992; and PL 102-426, 
October 19, 1992.) The law was hurried through in the final days of 
the Carter Administration and many provisions were ill-considered. 
Consequently, CERCLA has cost approximately $20 billion or more while 
utterly failing in its mission of cleaning up hazardous waste sites. 
As Carol Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection  
agency (EPA), explains, "A lot of time and money is taken up with 
companies suing each other over how much they owe to clean up a 
particular site." (Remarks by EPA Administrator Carol Browner to the 
U.S.  Chamber of Commerce Policy Insiders Breakfast, February 16, 
1994.)
<P>
     To deal with orphan sites, Congress originally authorized a $1.6 
billion trust fund, or "Superfund." This sum was believed adequate by 
policy makers to clean up all orphan sites known or likely to be 
discovered. For many reasons, however, the program proved much more 
expensive. In 1986, the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
(SARA) increased the trust fund by another $8.5 billion, to $10.1 
billion. The total was raised by another $5.1 billion, to $15.2 
billion, during the 1990 budget deal. The increases were financed 
through excise taxes, primarily on crude oil and petrochemicals, as 
well as a corporate environmental tax. Of this amount, $10.8 billion 
had been spent by the end of fiscal year 1994. (The 1994 figure 
includes estimated outlays for Fiscal Year 1994, which funds through 
September 1994.  The cost in real dollars is $12.2 billion.)

<P>     The $10.8 billion spent so far from the Superfund, moreover, 
comprises only a fraction of the total cost of CERCLA. The cost spent 
by companies and individuals in compliance with CERCLA has raised the 
overall price tag of the program by billions of dollars more. 
(Estimates vary greatly -- from $7.8 billion to $18 billion -- and 
typically are not based on solid data; nevertheless, there is uniform
agreement that the costs have been substantial.)

 <P>    Much of this cost has been spent not on cleanup, but on
litigation and other "transaction" costs. In fact, only 237 of the 
1,292 "worst" hazardous waste sites placed on the National Priorities 
List (NPL), or about 18 percent, have been cleaned up. (EPA Superfund 
Hotline run by Booz-Allen & Hamilton, as of September 23, 1994.  Note 
that some of those cleaned up sites, technically known as 
"construction  completed," actually are undergoing long-term 
remediation.  Also note that by the end of 1992, from which time many
of the cost figures for various studies were derived, only 149 of 
1,275 on the NPL had been cleaned up.) Moreover, only 60 sites have 
been deleted from the NPL. To clean up the remaining sites already on 
the NPL, the EPA's costs alone -- excluding costs to businesses and 
insurance companies -- will run an estimated $40 billion. Also, many 
more sites are expected to be listed on the NPL -- for an ultimate 
number between 2,100 to 10,000 -- thus driving up the costs even
higher. (Congressional Budget Office, "The Total Costs of Cleaning Up 
Nonfederal Superfund Sites," January 1994, citing Milton Russell, E.  
William Colglazier, and Mary R.  English, Hazardous Waste Remediation:  
The Task Ahead (Knoxville, Tenn.:  University of Tennessee, Waste 
Management Research and Education Institute, 1991); and the Office of 
Technology Assessment, Coming Clean:  Superfund Problems Can Be 
Solved....   (October 1989).) Over the next thirty years, according to 
the General Accounting Office, total costs are estimated at $300 
billion in 1990 dollars. (General Accounting Office, "Superfund 
Program Management," High Risk Series, December 1992.) The 
Congressional Budget Office, on the other hand, has put the total 
costs of cleaning contaminated sites not owned by the federal
government at between $106 billion and $463 billion in nominal 
dollars, or $42 billion and $120 billion in discounted dollars, over 
the next 78 years. (CBO, "The Total Costs of Cleaning Up Nonfederal 
Superfund Sites," January 1994.  The baseline projection in nominal 
dollars was estimated at $228.3 billion, or $73.9 billion in 
discounted dollars.  To calculate the discounted costs, the study used
a discount rate of 7 percent, which biased the study's  discounted 
costs downward.  While proper if the figure being calculated was 
return on investment (ROI) -- or payback on a present cost--to ensure 
a conservative estimate, it should not be used to estimate future 
costs.) The lion's share of those costs will be incurred within the 
next two decades, with annual costs potentially reaching a peak of 
$14.4 billion by the year 2003. (Ibid.  Note that this figure is the 
high case estimate in undiscounted dollars for cleanup of non-federal 
facilities.  The base case and low case estimates are $9.1 billion and 
$4.4 billion, respectively.  Inclusion of federal facilities in cost 
estimates, of course, would result in significantly higher estimates.)
If the costs of cleaning up federal facilities are added into the 
equation, the total cost could exceed $750 billion or about $7,800 per 
household in America. (Kent Jeffreys, "Science, Economics, and 
Environmental Policy:  A Critical Examination," Alexis de Tocqueville 
Institution, Arlington, Virginia, August 11, 1994, citing Milton 
Russell et al., Hazardous Waste Remediation.  The author calculated 
the potential average household cost by dividing the total by the 
number of households in the United States, or 96.391 million, in 1992, 
according to U.S.  Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 
Current Population Reports, "Money Income of Households, Families, and 
Persons in the United States:  1992.")
<P>
WHY SUPERFUND DOES NOT WORK

<P>     The high cost and slow pace of Superfund cleanups are caused 
principally by two problems: the program's unworkable liability scheme 
and its overly stringent cleanup standards. The law's retroactive, 
strict, joint and several liability scheme results in endless 
litigation as potentially liable parties search for the "deepest 
pockets" to pay for cleanup. In addition, parties can be held liable 
for cleanup whether or not they are at fault, even if they dumped only 
minute amounts of waste and regardless of whether the dumping was
legal at the time. The program's unreasonable cleanup standards 
require hazardous waste sites, no matter what the location, be 
excessively clean and fail to set up a priority system that ensures 
the maximum bang for the cleanup buck.
<P>
The Liability Scheme Is Unworkable

<P>     The most important reason why the Superfund has failed to clean 
up more hazardous waste sites is its highly unusual liability scheme. 
This retroactive, strict, joint and several liability system delays 
cleanups and increases total costs by fueling constant litigation.

<P>     This liability scheme has led to countless examples of absurd and 
grossly unfair results. For instance, Russ Zimmer was named as one of 
the "potentially responsible parties" (PRP) ("Potentially Responsible 
Party," usually referred to by its acronym PRP, is the legal term 
referring to a person or institution that is identified as a liable 
party under CERCLA's liability scheme.  This term also is applicable
before any court determination of liability, as the word "potentially" 
implies.) for a Superfund site located at a battery cracking plant in 
Torrington, Wyoming. His  contribution to the problem? He sold a bag 
of dog food in 1977 and a bag of seed in 1984, and took a third-party 
check as payment for the items. Since the checks originally had been 
issued by the now-bankrupt company that had owned the battery cracking 
plant, Zimmer was sued as a PRP. Zimmer decided upon advice from 
counsel that he should settle or it would cost him even more in legal 
costs. So he agreed to pay $3,500. (Jack Anderson, Michael Binstein, 
"How Superfund Hurt the Innocent," The Washington Post, March 7, 1994,
p.  C11.)

<P>     Joint and several liability is much to blame for causing legal 
woes such as Zimmer's. Under joint and several liability, a person who 
contributed even a very small amount to a problem, such as by tossing 
a car battery into a landfill, can be held responsible for the entire 
cost of, say, a multi-million dollar cleanup. (Special rules apply now 
to very small (de minimis) contributors, but the problem discussed 
nevertheless still exists for many extremely small, as well as 
moderate, contributors.  The bills before Congress offer a partial 
solution to the current system by exempting truly tiny (de micromis) 
contributors, but the bills would not eliminate the problem because 
they would have the burden of proving a negative -- that they did not
pollute more -- to qualify for the exemption.  Moreover, moderate 
polluters would remain subject to enormous liability.) 

<P>     The concept is designed to find somebody -- anybody -- to pay for 
cleanups of hazardous waste. Under the doctrine, the "responsible" 
person presented with the tab often has no part or only a small part 
in creating the waste problem. In practice, this means that a firm 
with "deep pockets" ends up paying for the cleanup of wastes created 
by someone else. Naturally, any person or institution identified as a 
PRP has a strong incentive to prove that others are liable as well, in 
order to dilute the costs among more PRPs. Hence, litigation is 
virtually assured.

<P>     Although EPA Administrator Carol Browner has admitted the need 
for reform, she justifies Superfund's liability scheme because "a lot 
of good has come from the program. The polluter-pays concept that was 
first adopted in the Superfund law has changed the way businesses in 
this country deal with their waste." Unfortunately, Superfund does not
adopt the "polluter-pays" system, but rejects it. By  imposing joint 
and several liability, Superfund guarantees people like Zimmer pay for 
cleaning up the pollution of others. In short, joint and several 
liability works against the idea of making polluters pay the costs 
that their actions impose on others -- no more, no less. (For a clear
elucidation of the principle as properly defined, see John Shanahan, 
"The Conservative As Environmentalist," Heritage Lecture No.  358, 
November, 19, 1991.) 

<P>     Perhaps the most controversial part of this liability scheme is 
the retroactive component. (Retroactivity is not expressly provided 
for in the text of CERCLA, but that it is clear from the usage of the 
past tense that Congress intended for it to be retroactive.  Moreover, 
the courts have correctly interpreted that the intent of the law was
to impose retroactive liability.) Retroactive liability means that 
owners, operators, and other individuals and companies who otherwise 
would be liable under the strict, joint and several standards are held 
responsible for pollution that took place before the Superfund law was
passed in 1980. For instance, if a company made jeep parts during 
World War II, and during production some chemicals seeped into the 
ground, the company would be legally responsible for the cost of 
cleaning up those chemicals now. Thus, because of a law passed more 
than 35 years later, the company may be faced with tens of millions of 
dollars in cleanup costs -- even though the company's actions not only
were completely legal at the time, but were considered patriotic. (For 
many defense contractors, liability has amounted to hundreds of 
millions of dollars.)
<P>
     There are essentially three problems with retroactive liability. 
<P>
     Retroactive liability is of questionable constitutionality. The 
standard is seemingly unconstitutional on its face. In the same part 
of the Constitution that authorizes the existence of Congress, it
clearly and unequivocally states that "No... ex post facto Law shall 
be passed." (U.S.  Constitution, Article I, Section 9, Clause 3.) An 
ex post facto law is defined as "the infliction of punishment upon a 
person for an act done which, when it was committed, was innocent... 
[or] every law which, in relation to the offense or its consequences,
alters the situation of a person to his disadvantage." (Henry Campbell 
Black, M.A., Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition (St.  Paul, Minn.:  
West Publishing Co., 1990).) 

 <P>    Superfund very clearly is an ex post facto law because
individuals and companies are surely punished and their situations 
"altered to disadvantage" when the government requires them to spend 
perhaps tens of millions of dollars to atone for actions that were 
legal when done. The intent of the Founding Fathers is clear, yet that 
intent has not been rigorously upheld by the Supreme Court. Relatively
early in the history of the nation, in fact, the Court held that the 
prohibition against ex post facto laws applied only to either criminal 
or penal measures. (Calder v Bull, 3 U.S.  (3 Dall.) 386, 1 L.Ed.  648 
(1798).) Thus, an important question is whether the imposition on a 
single person of liability for millions of dollars is penal by nature.
When individuals and companies may be bankrupted based on their own 
past behavior -- as opposed to, say, compliance with general 
regulations -- it is difficult to conceive of a law that could be more 
penal without being criminal.

  <P>   Even in cases where a statute was not considered penal, the Court 
traditionally ruled against retroactive laws. (See Railroad Retirement 
Board v.  Alton Railroad Co., 295 U.S.  330, 55 S.Ct.  758, 79 L.Ed.  
1468 (1935).  The Court bias against retroactive laws has not solely 
rested on the ex post facto law prohibition, but also has rested on 
several other constitutional grounds such as the due process.) In the 
last twenty years, however, there has been a shift in the 
interpretation. A relatively modern case that squarely addresses ex 
post facto "non-penal" laws suggests that, if ruled on, Superfund 
could be held constitutional if it is found to be rationally related 
to a legitimate government purpose. (Usery v.  Turner Elkhorn Mining 
Co., 428 U.S.  1, 96 S.Ct.  2882, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976).) This is 
considered a low legal hurdle to overcome. In addition, lower court 
decisions have found that the prohibition against ex post facto laws 
poses no constitutional barrier to Superfund's retroactivity. (See 
U.S.  v.  Northeastern Pharmaceutical & Chemical Co., Inc., 810 F.2d 
726 (8th Cir.  1986), cert.  den., October 5, 1987.  The fact that the 
Supreme Court declined to hear this case lends some weight to the 
belief that the Court supports the 8th Circuit court's decision, but 
does not set Supreme Court precedent.) To date, however, the Supreme 
Court has not squarely addressed the issue of Superfund retroactivity.

 <P>    Retroactive liability is unfair. Fairness is another problem with 
retroactive liability. It is unfair to hold people accountable today 
for actions taken decades ago, perhaps by a previous owner of the land 
with several intervening owners. Yet the law, as enforced, does just
that. Thus, a farmer may find that his grandfather -- or indeed, 
someone whom he has never heard of -- fouled the sub-soil 50 years 
earlier using state-of-the-art equipment, and the farmer must fix the 
entire problem, no matter how much it costs. Even if the farmer caused 
the problem himself back in the 1960s, is it really fair to assume 
that a law-abiding citizen should know that his actions -- reasonable
at the time -- could destroy his children's inheritance of the family 
farm? Not only environmental sensitivity, but environmental knowledge 
has increased exponentially since that time.

<P>     Retroactive liability has triggered an avalanche of litigation. 
The third problem with this liability scheme is a very practical one: 
it leads to constant litigation. Litigation probably is the biggest 
contributor to Superfund's failure to achieve its primary objective of
cleaning up hazardous waste sites. 

  <P>   Perhaps the most important practical problem is that
retroactivity increases the raw number of PRPs for any given site. 
Numerous individuals and companies may have owned the land over the 
decades. Moreover, each of the previous owners typically had dealings 
with others who might be liable. When the fact that large numbers of 
owners and other potentially liable parties often have poor records, 
it is little wonder that those already targeted by the EPA as deep 
pockets turn to the courts to defray the costs.

 <P>    Another problem is that records for actions taken decades ago can 
be difficult to obtain. If an entrepreneur conducted regular business 
in the 1950s through the 1970s with a chemical company that created a 
hazardous waste site, he usually would not have kept records dating 
back that far. He would be ill-suited to defend himself in court 
against canceled checks and other such records from the chemical
company. His own culpability may be small or nonexistent, but without 
records of his own, the evidence may point to his liability. Moreover, 
since the law also is strict, joint and several, the entrepreneur is 
potentially liable for the entire cleanup if he has the deepest 
pockets. Thus,  liability potentially can occur due to a failure to
maintain decades-old records. 

<P>     Another practical problem of retroactivity is that companies 
recognize the government could very well decide to increase standards 
beyond those required today. After all, retroactivity has proved no 
barrier with this law. Thus, companies are vulnerable to uncertain and 
unknowable liability costs in the future. Naturally, this further
motivates companies involved in litigation to reduce their share of 
the liability by suing as many other companies as possible. (This list 
of problems is not exhaustive, but is representative only.)

<P>     In all, transaction cost accounts for approximately 32 percent of 
total private sector CERCLA costs, although the average varies from 17 
percent to 60 percent according to firm size. (Jan Paul Acton, Lloyd 
S.  Dixon, with Deborah Drezner, Laural Hill, and Steven McKenney, 
Superfund and Transaction Costs:  The Experience of Insurers and Very
Large Industrial Firms (Santa Monica, CA:  Rand Institute for Civil 
Justice, 1992).) Litigation comprises 65 percent of this amount, or 21 
percent of the total average site cost. While this figure is 
significantly lower than the widely publicized, yet inaccurate, 
estimate of 80 percent of site cost, it nevertheless represents a 
figure of about $6.7 million per site.
<P>
Cleanup Standards Are Overly Stringent, Inflexible

<P>     The extremely high costs of actually cleaning up Superfund sites 
also contribute to delay of cleanups and litigation. Although EPA 
estimates that hazardous waste sites are a medium to low health risk, 
the average site cleanup is now estimated at $24 million to $46 
million. (Ibid.  The $32 million figure is based on 108 companies at
18 sites with annual revenues less than $20 billion between 1981-
1991.) Yet this figure is unnecessarily high because of overly 
stringent and inflexible cleanup standards. This leads to numerous and 
costly problems. (The problems discussed are not exhaustive.)

<P>     The most egregious problem was highlighted by the Office of 
Technology Assessment when it found that cleanup decisions at the 
majority of Superfund sites are based on hypothetical future risks 
rather than on actual or likely future risks. ("Coming Clean:  
Superfund Problems Can Be Solved...  ," Office of Technology 
Assessment, October 1989.  Others also have identified this problem.) 
This means that remote or inaccessible contaminated sites that pose no
current or likely future danger to people's health are given a 
priority just as high as sites that expose people to a real present 
danger. In fact, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 
announced in 1990 that under 12 percent of all Superfund sites pose an 
actual or current risk to human health or the environment. (Kathryn A.  
Kelly, Dr.  P.H., Nanette C.  Cardon, M.S., M.L.I.S., "The Myth of
10(-6) as a Definition of Acceptable Risk," EPA Watch, Vol.  3, No. 17 
(September 15, 1994), p.  8, citing reference in C.B.  Doty and C.C.  
Travis, "Is EPA's National Priorities List Correct?" Environmental 
Science and Technology Vol.  24, No.  12, pp.  1778- 1782.)

 <P>    To place sites on the National Priorities List, EPA uses a system 
known as the "hazardous ranking system" (HRS) to score sites on a 100 
point scale. If a site ranks 28.5 or above, it qualifies for the NPL. 
Yet this system has been widely criticized. As Peter Guerrero, 
Associate Director of Environmental Protection Issues at the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) stated, the HRS "utilizes an arbitrary 
criterion... not based on the risks posed by the sites." (Richard L.  
Stroup, Sandra L.  Goodman, "Rights vs.  Regulation:  How to Reform 
Superfund" (Political Economy Research Center, Bozeman, MT, September 
1994), endnote #17, p.37, citing Peter F.  Guerrero, testifying before 
the Subcommittee on Oversight of the Committee on Ways and Means, June 
11, 1992.  Serial 102-122, p.37.) 

 <P>    Another problem is CERCLA's preference for permanent cleanup, as 
opposed to on-going treatment or containment. This preference drives 
up the costs of remediation because containment and isolation are 
discouraged. Even if blanketing layers of plastic and clay on the 
soil, surrounding the property with a fence, and posting guards would 
completely eliminate exposure to the public for a small fraction of 
the cost of remediation, this option is not available. Moreover, 
Superfund is structured so that states pay only 10 percent of remedial 
construction costs, while it requires them to pay 100 percent of the 
Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs of Superfund sites in the state.
Although ongoing treatment may cost much less over the long run and 
may reduce public exposure equally well -- and in some situations, 
more -- states have a built-in incentive to demand permanent and 
extremely strict cleanup standards in an effort to avoid future O&M 
costs. Thus, states reduce their costs, but companies, through 
increased taxation, needlessly pay more.

 <P>    Another problem is that EPA uses a range of "risks" -- from one 
in ten thousand to one in a million -- to define when the probability 
of contracting cancer crosses the line from being an acceptable risk 
to an unacceptable risk. Thus, one official may consider a site to be 
"hazardous," and thus subject to CERCLA, if the risk of cancer from 
the materials at the site is one in ten thousand over a lifetime. But
another EPA official may use a risk level of one in a million. There 
is much disagreement over whether using a range of risks is proper or 
whether EPA should set a single specific risk level, or risk-point, 
that is acceptable. The more important controversy, however, centers 
not on the range argument, but on whether using a one in a million
risk of contracting cancer over a lifetime of exposure is appropriate 
at all. (Any specific numerical risk level should be at the lower end 
of the current range, and should act as a threshold floor for 
prioritizing cleanups.)

<P>     Conceptually, it helps to put this risk level in context of 
overall cancer rates. The chance of developing cancer from all causes 
is 1 in 3, or 33 percent. Thus, if a site increases the cancer risk to 
an exposed person by one in a million, it increases the person's 
overall cancer risk by only .0003 percent. This is an extremely small 
increase in the overall chances of someone contracting cancer.
Realistically, moreover, it is unlikely that many people would be 
exposed over an entire lifetime. Thus, the real cancer risk increase 
is smaller yet.

 <P>    Oddly, there is no scientific justification for choosing a one in 
a million risk level. It has "never received widespread debate or even 
thorough regulatory or scientific review. It is an arbitrary level 
proposed 30 years ago for completely different regulations,... the
circumstances of which do not apply to hazardous waste site
regulation." (Kelly and Cardon, "The Myth of 10(-6) as a Definition of 
Acceptable Risk," p.  4.) Moreover, no one seems to know how this risk 
level came to be the standard of a one in a million risk. In fact, 
when representatives of Environmental Technologies International, 
Inc., asked one federal agency where the standard came from, they were
told, "You really shouldn't be asking these questions." (Ibid.)

<P>
PROBLEMS WITH THE REFORM BILLS

<P>     Given that the Superfund program is facing hundreds of billions 
in cleanup costs in the next few years it is critical that the five- 
year reauthorization bill address these two fundamental problems. 
Unfortunately, both the House and Senate bills make only half-hearted 
attempts to address them. Instead of repealing the law's liability
scheme, it sets up instead an unwise and inequitable fund that will 
settle only part of Superfund's litigation problems. With regard to 
cleanup standards, the bills fail to adopt acceptable risk standards 
for cleanup and site prioritization. Finally, they include unnecessary
giveaways for organized labor and environmental activists that will 
only increase the cost of the Superfund program. 
<P>
Failing to Establish Real Reform in CERCLA's Liability
<P>
     Perhaps the most controversial liability reform in the bills is 
the proposed Environmental Insurance Resolution Fund (EIRF). The EIRF 
ostensibly is designed to settle the problem created under current law 
that virtually forces companies to sue the insurance industry because 
the extent of insurer liability is not easily settled. Not only does
this drive up litigation costs, but it hurts the insurance industry's 
ability to make sound business decisions. Insurance is based on 
spreading risk, which in turn is based on actuarial calculations -- in 
short, the insurance industry is built on the predictability of risk. 
Yet Superfund defeats this purpose by inserting huge uncertainties 
into the process.
<P>
     This has hurt both insurance companies offering commercial 
multiperil coverage and those insured. Some insurance companies face 
bankruptcy, and those remaining are unable to gauge their liability 
exposure for policies written decades ago. Hence, CERCLA creates 
uncertainties in premium rate setting today because insurers must 
somehow recoup these losses through cost shifting. (Moreover, the
inevitable cost shifting hurts modern companies with newer policies 
because the insurance industry's liability costs for old policies are 
shifted to them indirectly.) 

<P>  The EIRF has been proposed as a way to enable insurers to "insure 
against" this uncertainty by creating a fund financed by an $8.1 
billion tax over ten years on the entire insurance industry offering 
commercial multiperil coverage. The tax, which would be levied on both 
direct insurers and reinsurers, would fund voluntary settlements by 
PRPs. Essentially, PRPs found liable for cleanup could agree to accept 
reimbursement from the fund in exchange for agreeing to settle any 
claim they had instituted against the insurers prior to this 
reauthorization. (The bills include specific provisions as to 
eligibility, timing, and necessary documentation.  The term "insurers" 
refers to both direct insurers and reinsurers.) This often would be 
advantageous to insured companies since their liability would be 
certain and litigation costs would be reduced. The choice to accept
the settlement would be voluntary for the insured company, so even 
though an insurer pays the tax, it still could be liable for all 
existing claims depending on the PRPs' decision-making. (The 
reimbursement offer made to the PRPs would be based on a fixed 
percentage of the cleanup costs.  These fixed reimbursement rates, 
broken into categories, vary according to the state.  The amounts were 
based roughly on the relative average awards by courts against 
insurers in each state.  Thus, each state is assigned to one of three
percentage categories for reimbursement settlements:  20 percent , 40 
percent , or 60 percent.  Most states are classified in the 40 percent 
reimbursement category, with a few states in each of the 20 percent 
and 40 percent reimbursement categories.  The categories, however, are
unnecessarily limited and broad.  Also, it is claimed that at least 
two states have been miscategorized.) Moreover, since future claims 
would not be covered by the fund, insurance companies would continue 
to be exposed to uncertain risk.

<P>     If fewer than 85 percent of the PRPs potentially eligible for 
awards did not accept the fund's settlement offer within 150 days of 
the bill's enactment, however, the fund would not be created. (Note 
that there would not be a five month accumulation of money in the EIRF 
because, although taxes are being accrued through the first 150 days,
payments are due only after the fund becomes operative, if at all. 
This period could be up to 150 days (known as the contingency period).  
This is a sound approach.) If this occurs, and there really is no way 
to assess adequately the probability of reaching the 85 percent 
threshold, one of the cornerstones of the "reform" would disintegrate. 
(The reauthorization attempts to increase the likelihood of achieving 
at least 85 percent by penalizing companies that decide to take 
advantage of their right to settle the matter in court, and either 
lose or are awarded less than the settlement offer.  In such cases, 
the insurance companies' attorneys' fees must be paid by the company.  
While an effective strategy, it is unfair and only is necessary
because the reform is so timid in its overall approach to real 
reform.)
<P>
     Even if the fund became operative, and thus brought some 
predictability to the situation, the EIRF is ill-conceived. Under H.R. 
3800, 70 percent of the tax raised in the first four years is to be 
financed through retrospective taxes on net premiums charged between 
1968 and 1985. (As this paper goes to press, the taxing structure in 
S.1834 is indeterminate.  This will change, however, during mark-up of
the bill by the Senate Finance Committee scheduled for September 28.  
Most notably, the Administration has proposed that the tax on 
reinsurers be different from that on direct insurers by making the tax 
on reinsurers 100 percent retrospective.  This would address some of 
the problems discussed regarding H.R.  3800, but would not eliminate
the problems from the Senate bill.  Moreover, the financing mechanism 
that would emerge from a conference of both chambers cannot be 
accurately predicted.  Note that the 70 percent figure in the text 
accompanying this footnote applies to years one to four only.  During 
years five to ten, retroactive taxes will account for approximately 25
percent of the annual total.) But retrospective taxes simply are 
unfair. While they may not be penal in nature, they nevertheless exact 
taxes based on financial activity between 26 and 9 years into the 
past. While many insurance companies may not be adversely affected by 
the tax, since they will recoup the loss through reduced future 
liability, others will be net losers. Many of these companies might 
have been more prudent when writing policies, or for other reasons may
have smaller liability risks in relation to their premiums. (There can 
be many reasons for this situation.  Insurance companies could have 
collected higher insurance premiums per policy for their level of 
Superfund liability exposure because their policies subjected them to 
what then was perceived to be greater risks.  Conversely, they could
have insured companies, that on average, pose lower Superfund 
liability risk to the insurance company.) Yet they would be taxed just 
as much.

<P>     A prospective tax is even more unfair, and some 30 percent of the 
proposed tax for the first four years -- and 75 percent for years five 
through ten -- is prospective. The entire purpose of the EIRF is to 
settle liability uncertainties from old policies, yet a prospective 
tax is based on future policies. This means insurance companies
offering multiperil insurance coverage that cut back market share or 
were less cautious in decades past reap a windfall at the expense of 
the cautious or expanding companies. For example, Lloyd's of London 
has cut back its market share considerably, but still faces enormous 
liability for past policies. Under a prospective tax, the firm's total 
exposure is reduced considerably at the expense of American insurers,
who would pay disproportionately. While the Administration proposes to 
amend this structure in the Senate bill to eliminate prospective taxes 
on reinsurers, the problems of the EIRF's inequitable collection of 
taxes cannot be completely cured. 

<P>     Despite the Clinton Administration's assurances that the EIRF is 
a "consensus" position, only a small percentage of insurance companies 
support this tax. The over 2,000 companies opposing the EIRF typically 
are much smaller than the companies supporting the EIRF. But even so, 
those opponents represent approximately two-thirds of total premiums 
written. This hardly represents consensus in favor of the new tax. As 
Jack Ramirez, Executive Vice President for the National Association of 
Independent Insurers, stated, "We are strongly opposed to the 
insurance fund. The product they have come up with is not the 
industry's  position, although it is being represented as such." 
("House Subcommittee Approves Reform Bill; State Role, Voluntary
Cleanup Titles Added," National Environment Daily, Bureau of National 
Affairs, May 13, 1994.) Rather than impose an inequitable $8.1 billion 
tax that has limited support at best, Congress would be better served 
by dealing with one of the fundamental problems of Superfund: a flawed 
liability standard.

<P>     Another important provision also is ill-advised. The bills 
attempt to reduce legal costs by allowing companies to use an 
arbitration process in which the costs would be allocated among the 
liable PRPs. On its surface, this proposal sounds like a step in the 
right direction because it would alleviate much of the litigious 
burden of joint and several liability. However, the proposal has a 
very serious built-in problem. Many companies may be unwilling to use
this system because it is an informal process that denies them the 
protection of the normal rules of evidence and procedure in court. 

<P>     To discourage companies from rejecting a settlement offer based 
on the arbitrator's decision, any company choosing to use the courts
still would face joint and several liability. The Administration has
stated candidly that this is intended as a stick to influence
companies to choose arbitrated settlements. In fact, if a company
rejects what it considers an unfair settlement offer, the bills
expressly make the company subject to liability for the portion of the
cleanup that the arbitrator allocated to the orphan share. For
example, suppose a company sought a court ruling on a $30 million
cleanup because the company was allocated 10 percent of the liability
when it caused only one percent, or $300,000, of the problem. By
rejecting the government's settlement offer to pay 10 percent, the
company potentially would face liability for the entire $30 million.
The proposed structure thus would be severely punish companies for
seeking the legitimate protections of the court.
<P>
Limited Steps in the Right Direction
<P>
     While these provisions, and the lack of reform of the underlying
liability scheme would ensure that costs continue to explode for five
more years, not all provisions in the bills move in the wrong
direction. Although the additional provisions are only limited steps
that largely would be unnecessary if real reforms were enacted, they
nevertheless move in the right direction.
<P>
     One positive provision in the bills is lender liability reform,
which would provide needed stability to the lending industry. This is
significant because an unintended consequence of CERCLA, as now
written, is that it dries up real estate loans. As interpreted by the
courts, lenders who foreclose on properties held as collateral or
exercise financial management, perhaps to rehabilitate a loan, are
subject to Superfund's liability scheme. (For a full discussion of the
legal issues, see In Re Bergsoe Metal Corp., U.S.  Ct.  App., 9th
Cir., 910 F.2d 668 (1990).) Thus, lenders have become hesitant to make
loans based on collateral that might be subject to later litigation
under the Act. Lenders are at risk of not only losing their original
loan investment, but of becoming liable for cleanup costs of perhaps
millions of dollars. Moreover, because banks typically are "deep
pockets," they are likely to end up paying more of the cleanup costs.
So, lenders now typically require that studies be undertaken to assure
the property is free of any contamination. If it is not, an original
or refinance loan on the property is virtually impossible to obtain.
<P>
     The benefit to the government of this situation is that banks
investigate or require potential applicants to investigate properties
around the nation for contamination, thus helping it to identify
contaminated sites more swiftly and cheaply. In effect, CERCLA has
imposed an unfunded mandate on the lending industry.
<P>
     Under the pending legislation, lenders' liability essentially
would be limited to their level of investment in the mortgaged
property. This is an important step in the right direction, it stops
short of taking this concept to its logical conclusion. Lenders should
not be liable for the costs of cleaning land that may have been
polluted without their knowledge or effective control. While the
extent of liability may now be quantified, which provides needed
stability, even limited liability distorts the economic markets and
unfairly shifts the burdens of Superfund onto innocent investors.
<P>
     Another worthwhile provision would reduce the state's
contribution to Operation and Maintenance costs of cleaned sites from
100 percent to a comparably small rate consistent with construction
remediation costs. This change will reduce the incentive on states to
demand unreasonably stringent cleanup standards to "front-load" the
costs so that the federal government will pay the vast majority of the
project cost. (Under current law, although the states must pay 100
percent of future O&M costs, they are only liable for 10 percent of
the front-end cleanup costs.  The bills set a 15 percent uniform share
for state governments.  This aspect of the provision has been
criticized because it will increase the burden to the states for
front-end construction costs.) 
<P>
     Yet another useful provision would create an exemption for so-
called micromis, or truly tiny, contributors. While this is welcome
relief, it would be unnecessary were it not for the current liability
scheme. Moreover, the provision is not without problems. If
Superfund's liability scheme is kept in place, truly tiny contributors
should be relieved of the burden of proving a negative -- that they
did not contribute significantly to the pollution.
<P>
Failing to Establish Reasonable Standards
<P>
     The House and Senate bills, unfortunately, fail to correct many
of the problems created by inflexible and overly stringent cleanup
standards. Moreover, while some issues substantively would be
resolved, other standards and requirements would create new problems.

<P>     One of the most controversial provisions would deal with the goal
of protecting human health through cleanup of Superfund sites. This
new national goal "shall be expressed as a single numerical health
risk level that ensures a reasonable certainty of no harm from
exposure to carcinogens and... noncarcinogens." (S.1834, Title V, Sec. 
501.) The risk level would be decided through negotiated rule-making
which would allow EPA to set, and likely result in, an excessively
strict and expensive risk level of one in a million. This would cause
the cost of Superfund cleanups to skyrocket because it would mandate
the cleanup of extremely small risks.

<P>     Another major problem with a national goal is that it would allow
an inflexible "bright-line" for deciding when cleanup should or should
not occur. A more prudent policy would base the cleanup decision on
the risk reduced per dollar of cleanup cost. (See John Shanahan, "How
to Help the Environment without Destroying Jobs," Heritage Foundation
Memo To:  President-Elect Clinton No.  14, January 19, 1993.) Thus,
for every dollar spent on Superfund cleanup, the most immediate risks
to the public would be addressed first. Essentially, the law should be
structured to get the "biggest bang for every environmental buck." But
as the Washington, D.C.-based non-profit National Research Council
found, none of the agencies with responsibility over waste sites,
including EPA, "have developed [their] over-all priority-setting
process in a manner that is explicit, adequately documented, and
sufficiently open to scientific and public scrutiny." (Bureau of
National Affairs, National Environmental Daily, September 12, 1994,
discussing National Research Council, Commission on Geosciences,
Environment and Resources, "Ranking Hazardous Waste Sites for Remedial
Action," September 8, 1994.) But these prioritization changes, plus
similar changes in other environmental laws, would allow the greatest
risks to the public to be reduced first, regardless of the type of
environmental problem. In this way, the nation could more efficiently
spend fewer dollars while pursuing a chosen "acceptable" risk level. 

<P>     The bills grant exemptions to PRPs from achieving the new
numerical risk standard if the necessary cleanup would be either
technically infeasible or unreasonably costly. In either case, the EPA
Administrator would be allowed to set a lesser cleanup level at a cost
that, while possibly quite large, is not unreasonable. At first
glance, this seems like a reasonable step in the right direction. But
a closer look reveals that the bills further codify the use of
unnecessarily strict cleanup standards. 

 <P>    The exceptions granted in the bill are qualified by the language
that the lesser cleanup standard chosen to avoid a unreasonable cost
cannot "result in a unacceptable risk to human health.... " Thus, any
relief from unreasonable costs must result in an acceptable risk. Two
questions about this exception must be asked: 1) Why should PRPs not
granted an exception pay huge sums if lesser standards would result in
an acceptable risk? 2) What does an "unreasonable" cost mean? Either
the bills are in most cases mandating expensive cleanups to meet
excessive cleanup standards, or the exception is meaningless since
both reasonable and unreasonable costs must be set at the same risk
level -- acceptable. 

<P>     Not all provisions in the bills, however, are so poorly crafted.
To its credit, the Administration effectively exempts industrial sites
and other properties from Superfund's unnecessarily stringent
requirements. Currently, CERCLA is indifferent to the traditional or
expected future use of the contaminated property. CERCLA's standards
effectively require that the dirt be clean enough to eat. (While there
is no official standard that the soil be "clean enough to eat," it
serves as an effective criterion because of the exposure assumptions
built into the standards, such as ingestion of a certain amount of
soil per day.) While this arguably may make sense in a residential
community, it is certainly unnecessary in an industrial park where
there is little likelihood of exposure to the soil. 

<P>     As a result of these high standards, industrial operators
invariably decide to locate their plants on pristine sites in order to
avoid future liability for cleaning up another company's expensive
mess. Often, the companies that contaminated plots have gone out
business in the intervening years, so the properties have become
"orphan sites," effectively increasing the cost to the public. (While
the costs are directly levied on businesses, much of this cost is
passed on to the consumer through increased prices.  Additionally,
there are the losses to the public in the form of reduced dividends to
shareholders and income to workers for costs that companies cannot
pass on to the consumer.) Even if these sites are cleaned up,
companies have little incentive to locate on them for fear of future
litigation. Since many of these older polluted industrial sites are
located in urban areas, Superfund effectively acts as barrier to urban
revitalization. Thus, the poor and minorities, who disproportionately
live in urban areas, are the unintended victims of this policy.
(Unfortunately, the Administration through S.  1834 and H.R.  3800
unwisely attempts to address "environmental justice" through the
creation of a Superfund affirmative action plan.  An in-depth analysis
of the problems created by "environmental justice" provisions,
however, and other provisions effectively targeted to the same groups,
is beyond the scope of this paper.) The bills properly relax the
unnecessary cleanup standards by allowing the EPA Administrator to
take into account the intended and historical uses of property in
setting the standards. Thus, albeit by a circuitous path, the bills do
take into account real expected exposures for some sites. 
<P>
Financing Environmental Pork 

 <P>    The bills also contain plenty of pork barrel spending for
organized labor and environmentalists. The House bill now under
consideration contains a provision applying the Davis-Bacon prevailing
wage law to Superfund cleanup sites. (The Clinton proposal did not
include Davis-Bacon provisions.) By mandating that PRPs pay union
wages, Congress is moving in the diametrically opposite direction of
containing Superfund costs, reducing litigation, and accelerating
cleanup. There can be no justification for mandating that cleanups be
more expensive than necessary. 

<P>     Perhaps the most egregious provision, however, effectively
creates an environmental welfare program diverting Superfund's money
to environmental activists. (This provision is in both bills.) Grants
totaling up to 4 percent of the Superfund pay-out in any given year,
or approximately $63.4 million, would be given to private citizens to
investigate hazardous waste sites, including those not on the National
Priorities List. (S.1834, Title I, sec.  101.  Those sites not listed
on the NPL would be limited to 1/8th of total grant expenditures.  The
dollar figure estimate cited in the text is based on 4 percent of
estimated Superfund outlays for Fiscal Year 1995, or $1,585,979,000. 
Naturally, this dollar figure would climb as Superfund figures
climbed.) The grants may be used to hire "experts" for informational
reasons, to hire a community liaison to PRPs, "to hire experts to file
comments with the federal government and generate other documents,"
and "for training funds for interested affected citizens to enable
them to more effectively participate in the remedy selection process."
None of the rules that govern agencies in selecting experts would
apply since all decisions would be made by private citizens, although
"guidelines" would be published. Thus, the grants would be open to
large-scale abuse.
<P>
     The practical effect, if not the purpose, of this provision would
be to make it easy for environmental activists to get paid with
federal tax dollars for what they now do with voluntary donations.
Environmental activists would be able to increase the scope of their
activities as well as their payrolls. 
<P>
     Another provision in both bills pursues a completely different
environmental objective -- recycling. The bills exempt from liability
recyclers who inadvertently contaminate property with hazardous waste.
(S.1834, sec.  410, adding new section, sec.  130(j).) Essentially,
this provision would reward recyclers for their environmentally benign
intent despite the actual damage done by their physical actions. It is
ironic that polluters pursuing other societal objectives, such as
national defense and health care, which arguably are as important to
the nation as recycling, are denied this favorable status. Indeed,
this provision would shift the recycler's costs onto those other
sectors because, as written, they would have to pay the recycler's
shares. (Moreover, recyclers who have been unsuccessfully sued to pay
for site cleanup would be allowed to recover attorney's fees. 
However, this treatment is not given to other PRPs that have
successfully sued a non-qualifying recycler.  While the "English rule"
of allowing the recovery of attorney's fees is preferable to the
dominant "American rule" of no recovery of fees as a general matter,
there is no justification for this unequal treatment.  The section
also has an arbitrary cut-off date of February 3, 1994; this date
coincides with the bill's introduction.) 
<P>
A WORKABLE SOLUTION

  <P>   The best solution to the current problems with Superfund would be
to repeal retroactive, joint and several liability. With the repeal of
retroactive liability, all sites contaminated before 1980 -- when
Superfund was enacted -- would be "orphaned," meaning that no one is
liable under the law. With the repeal of joint and several liability,
moreover, whenever actual polluters that partially contaminated sites
after Superfund was enacted could not be found, their shares of the
cleanup costs would become orphan shares. Cleaning up these orphan
shares would thus require expenditures from the Superfund created for
just this purpose. If society wishes to clean up orphan sites for
which no responsible party can be found, then society should pay the
tab -- Congress should not use a tax to shift the cost to another set
of innocent "deep pockets."

  <P>   The fund, however, should not be given additional appropriations
to account for this liability scheme change. Rather, substantive
reforms should be enacted to make cleanup standards more flexible and
less stringent. These two changes, together with the lower EPA
oversight costs that would follow, would reduce the average cost of
cleanups considerably. Limiting Superfund finances in this way would
force EPA to prioritize site cleanups according to its assessment of
which sites posed an actual present threat to public safety and would
force the agency to use judgment in reducing each site's cleanup
costs. Congress should give EPA the flexibility to make these
judgments. Adding more money to Superfund, or creating the
Environmental Insurance Resolution Fund, would remove this pressure
for substantive reform.
<P>
CONCLUSION

 <P>    The Superfund reauthorization now being considered by Congress
has been touted as a major reform of the costly Superfund program,
which is widely considered one of -- if not the -- most ineffective
and unfair laws today. Unfortunately, the reforms being considered are
as disappointing as the current law. If the proposed reauthorization
becomes law, it will: create yet another fund -- this one financed
through a new $8.1 billion tax on the insurance industry; create an
"environmental pork" grant program that will benefit environmental
activists, and inequitably shift recyclers' shares of costs of
cleanups to others who often are already paying more than their fair
share. Moreover, those few reforms that make positive strides, such as
limiting lender liability, are only half-measures.
<P>
     The most striking aspect of the reform, however, is what it will
not do. It will not reform the retroactive, strict, joint and several
liability system that is causing much of the litigation now plaguing
Superfund. Nor will it do much more than tinker around the edges of
the fundamental cost drivers of cleanups -- overly strict and
inflexible standards. Hence, the most important accomplishment of this
reform will be to lock in the most unworkable provisions of the
current law for another five years during a time of exploding costs,
thus ensuring even greater waste into the future.

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
     The Administration last spring released additional information on
President Clinton's "voluntary" 44-point plan to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions in the United States to 1990 levels by the year 2000. (When
the plan was unveiled in October 1993, the media and Administration
officials referred to it as containing 50 points or initiatives,
instead of the correct figure of 44. Even the President used the
50-point figure. The confusion stems from statements, made repeatedly
in the official plan and elsewhere, that there are "almost" or "about"
50 initiatives.) This plan is designed to address the potential threat
of global warming, or the enhanced greenhouse effect, which is the
unproved theory that man-made emissions will raise the temperature of
the Earth's atmosphere. The President's plan, as outlined, would be a
mistake for the United States and should be reviewed carefully by
Congress, the media, and the public.
<P>
     The Administration's calculation of costs and benefits is flawed
for at least five reasons:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The plan would impose more than $60 billion of unnecessary costs on
   the economy over six years.<P>
It likely would not achieve its objective.<P>
It would not, in fact, be voluntary as the Administration claims. <P>
Most qualified scientists believe catastrophic global warming
  is improbable.<P>
There are better ways to address any threat which may exist.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     In recent years, numerous research studies have contributed to
the body of knowledge of the effects of greenhouse gases on the
planet's atmosphere. These efforts continue today, with well over $1
billion spent annually on climate research. As knowledge grows more
sophisticated, however, dire predictions are being scaled back. In
fact, many of the theories upon which the belief in global warming was
based have been shown simply to be wrong. For instance, contrary to
popular opinion, satellite data show the average temperature has not
risen in the last 15 years. Instead of rushing to expensive,
ineffective, and perhaps wasteful action, policy makers should ask one
fundamental question: should the priority be to take action based on
ignorance or to lessen this ignorance through continued scientific
research? Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration has embraced the
former option.
<P>

<B> WHAT IS GLOBAL WARMING?</B>
<P>
The theory of global warming holds that man-made gases will warm up
the Earth's atmosphere, thereby endangering life on the planet. While
most Americans have heard of this theory, few understand it, and there
is widespread confusion between global warming and another term, the
"greenhouse effect."  The greenhouse effect refers to the Earth's
release of certain gases, called greenhouse gases, which enable the
atmosphere to retain some of the heat received from the sun instead of
reflecting all of it back out into space. These gases -- which include
carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide, and water vapor -- thus have
the same effect as glass in a greenhouse, keeping the Earth at a
higher average temperature, and a more even temperature, than would be
the case without them. 
<P>
     The greenhouse effect maintains a temperature which allows plant
and animal life to exist. Contrary to popular belief, all scientists
agree that the greenhouse effect is desirable; without it, life as we
know it would cease because global temperatures would plummet to an
average of -18C, or 0F. Explains Patrick Michaels, State
Climatologist for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the statement that all
scientists agree that the greenhouse effect is real "is about as
profound as a statement that all scientists agree that the Earth is
round." (Patrick Michaels, "Apocalypse Not Now: Science, Politics, and
Global Warming (Part 1)," National Chamber Foundation, U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, March 1992.)
<P>
     The theory of global warming (technically known as the "enhanced
greenhouse effect"), on the other hand, rests on the claim that
certain gases released by human activity warm the planet significantly
beyond normal greenhouse levels. These gases include carbon dioxide
and other greenhouse gases that are released naturally into the
atmosphere, (Water vapor, the primary greenhouse gas, is not increased
by human activity. Water vapor and clouds account for 98 percent of
the greenhouse effect.) along with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), man-
made gases, associated chiefly with refrigeration, that do not occur
in nature. The need for the National Action Plan was premised on the
belief that gases produced by human activity over time will increase
the greenhouse effect, leading to undesirable changes in weather
patterns, crop failures, flooding, and other damaging effects that it
would take decades to reverse. Thus, the Administration argues, action
must be taken now.
<P>

<B> THE CLINTON PLAN
</B><P>
The Climate Change Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gases was
announced by President Bill Clinton in October 1993, and an
explanatory supplement was released in late March 1994. (The Climate
Change Action Plan (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
October 1993) and Office of Policy, Planning, and Program Evaluation,
U.S. Department of Energy, The Climate Change Action Plan: Technical
Supplement (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, March
1994).) The plan is to form the cornerstone of the U.S. commitment to
the international Framework Convention on Climate Change. This
international agreement, which requires that a National Action Plan be
developed and submitted, was signed by President George Bush in June
1992 and became effective this year. It requires that countries reduce
greenhouse gas emissions eventually to 1990 levels and that some
progress be made by the year 2000. But President Clinton has pledged
his commitment that the United States will attain the full 1990 levels
by the year 2000.
<P>
     The plan is a potpourri of initiatives designed primarily to
encourage companies and households -- by persuasion, by education, and
in some instances by compulsion -- to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
such as carbon dioxide and methane, produced in the manufacture or use
of a product. This would be accomplished by such means as reducing
energy consumption (which produces greenhouse gases) and limiting
methane releases from garbage dumps or landfills. In all, the plan has
44 different initiatives ranging from mandates that household
appliances and buildings be made more energy-efficient to increased
government funding of the Green Lights Program, an educational program
created during the Bush Administration to show companies how they can
reduce energy consumption while saving money. Other initiatives, such
as the Source Reduction, Pollution Reduction, and Recycling
Initiative, focus on spending federal monies to persuade companies to
reduce their emissions voluntarily without legislative mandates. Yet
another initiative is designed to reduce cow flatulence through
improved techniques of beef production. The Clinton Administration's
plan relies in part on existing legislative authority to implement the
initiatives through regulatory action, but it would also require
significant additional federal spending.

<P>
<B> HOW THE COSTS ARE UNDERESTIMATED</B>
<P>
The Clinton Administration estimates that it will cost $63.4 billion
to implement this plan over the next seven years. Of this amount, the
private sector's share is $61.5 billion, the government's only $1.9
billion. (The Administration calculates a net savings of $793 million
due to increased taxes and continued leasing of dams. This projected
figure is not used here for two reasons: 1) the $1.9 billion
represents projected cost outlays, and 2) the report incorrectly shows
the tax increase that is projected to reduce the government's "net"
outlays without showing the tax as a corresponding increase in private
sector outlays.) Most of the public sector funds, it is claimed, will
be transferred from other funding sources. At the same time, the
Administration projects savings to the economy of $268.1 billion,
primarily in energy savings if the initiatives are implemented. 
<P>
     Unfortunately, the Administration's figures are highly
misleading. Specifically, the Administration underestimates how much
the plan will cost both the government and the private sector, and it
overstates projected energy savings by using flawed accounting
procedures and unduly optimistic forecasts. Experience teaches that
once government programs are born, they almost never die, yet the
Administration assumes that every government program initiated or
augmented by the plan will cease within seven years. It also assumes
that all private sector costs will drop to zero at that time. Thus,
although these programs will continue to exist, and will probably
grow, the Administration ignores all costs that will be incurred after
the year 2000 and implicitly assumes that the costs of maintaining
greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels will be zero -- while
calculating the benefits from energy savings derived from the plan
until the year 2010, or for 17 years, with benefits beyond the year
2000 included in the calculation of costs and benefits. Moreover,
while it is true that some costs borne in the early years will
continue to reap benefits for another decade, this is not true of all
programs. 
<P>
     This disparity in the calculation of costs and benefits is only
one way in which the Administration distorts the plan's true costs and
savings. Another is its highly unusual accounting method. Under the
standard method, future figures would be discounted to their present
value; the Administration, however, has chosen to calculate all cost
and benefit figures in undiscounted 1991 dollars. The result: the
plan's supposed benefits are inflated far more than its costs because
cost or benefit figures occurring further in the future are inflated
proportionately more. Thus, potential but undiscounted savings yielded
17 years from now are greatly inflated, while costs 7 years from now
are only somewhat exaggerated. This deliberate obfuscation of the real
costs and benefits indicates that the Administration knows the real
present value costs of its program exceed the real benefits discounted
for inflation and the time value of money. If the Administration truly
believes the benefits justify the costs, it should present real
figures calculated in the standard way.
<P>
     Even using this flawed accounting methodology, the Administration
significantly underestimates the probable costs and overestimates the
likely benefits of many of the plan's initiatives. Perhaps the best
example is Action #16 -- the source reduction, pollution prevention,
and recycling program -- which encourages and subsidizes increased
recycling of, and reduced use in products and packaging of, certain
natural resources such as paper, plastic, and other materials. The
plan estimates this program will cost the government and private
sector $176 million but save the economy $36.5 billion, or 207 times
as much. If such a generous return on an investment was possible, it
seems odd that entrepreneurs would have not already seized the
opportunity without the need for government encouragement. In reality,
however, recycling is expensive and generally uneconomical, with the
exception of aluminum found in such products as cans. (Aluminum cans
are both economically and ecologically beneficial to recycle because
it takes 95 percent less energy to recycle aluminum than to make it
from bauxite (aluminum ore). Of course, since recycling aluminum cans
is profitable, over 50 percent of cans already are recycled as an
entrepreneurial activity.) Thus, the cost for the private sector will
be much higher than the Administration forecasts, and benefits that
otherwise might offset these costs will be lower.
<P>
     Similarly, redesigning packaging and other products to reduce
their natural resources content is very expensive. Past trends
indicate that manufacturers already try to cut packaging costs because
packaging, which adds weight and volume to a product, is expensive to
buy, store, and transport. (Packaging accounted for 30.3 percent of
waste in 1986, down from the 1970 level of 33.5 percent. See John
Shanahan, "A Plain Man's Guide to Garbage: The Reauthorization of the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act," Heritage Foundation Issue
Bulletin No. 172, March 30, 1992.) Expensive government programs to
encourage less packaging are thus unnecessary. At worst, they can be
counterproductive by encouraging manufacturers to reduce packaging
when it is uneconomical. For instance, reducing paper packaging of
food can be counterproductive because every pound of paper packaging
reduces food waste by an average of 1.41 pounds. Thus, reductions
would waste valuable food while increasing total garbage destined for
landfills. 
<P>
     The Administration also obscures the true cost of reducing
greenhouse gases by not counting funds dedicated to efforts now
underway, or programs already announced, that comprise part of the
plan. In short, $63 billion is not the total amount to be spent on
reducing greenhouse gases; it is only the additional amount to be
dedicated to this effort. One cannot accurately gauge the true costs
either to the government or to the private sector until the White
House is more candid in estimating how much is now being spent to
fight global warming and combining that with accurate, discounted, and
itemized projections as to how much its new initiatives will cost
Americans.
<P>

<B> WHY THE PLAN WILL BE INEFFECTIVE</B>
<P>
The technical supplement explaining many of the plan's underlying
assumptions does not support the Administration's claim that the plan
will be effective. For instance, a major goal of the plan is to reduce
carbon dioxide releases, but the Administration has included in this
comprehensive package many other environmental initiatives that will
increase net carbon dioxide releases. The Administration also proposes
in Action #16 to encourage and subsidize increased recycling of paper
and other materials as a way to reduce carbon emissions, assuming that
trees left to grow instead of being cut for pulpwood will continue to
absorb carbon dioxide. But this turns the facts upside down.
<P>
     If paper recycling increases, net carbon dioxide emissions
actually will rise, not fall. Eighty-five percent of all pulpwood
comes from tree farms where the trees are planted, grown, and
harvested on about a twenty-year cycle. These smaller, fast-growing
trees absorb much more carbon dioxide than slow-growing, older trees.
Thus, by continuing to harvest every twenty years to supply the paper
market, tree farmers are encouraged to replant young carbon-absorbing
saplings. If increased paper recycling caused the virgin pulpwood
market to contract, tree farmers generally would cut down their trees
and replant their land with some other crop -- if they plant at all --
in order to make a living. The number of trees in the U.S. would drop
and net carbon dioxide releases would increase, not decrease. (This
refers to the effect of the recycling initiative alone on carbon
dioxide releases, not to total carbon releases that actually will
occur given increased production, other initiatives, and likely
technological advances. See ibid.)
<P>
     While some of the mandatory provisions no doubt would achieve
limited success at high cost, other provisions are less likely to
prove effective. For instance, Action #3 -- Establish State Revolving
Fund for Public Buildings -- assumes that providing $1 million in seed
money to ten competitively selected states each year, for a total of
$55 million through 1999, will result in energy savings of 29 percent
for one in ten state and local public buildings and two percent of all
commercial buildings. (Presumably, this statistic applies only to
commercial buildings; the technical supplement is not specific. See
Technical Supplement, op. cit.) The Administration claims that loan
repayments funded from energy savings will allow these funds to be
lent several times over; but this assumes that all energy-saving
technologies are cost-effective, and experience shows this is not
always the case. Many of these upgrades will never repay their
investment. Administration officials also make the questionable
assumption that the private sector will be motivated to spend $2.5
billion in upgrades based solely on the $55 million seed money
provided to states and localities, (The Technical Supplement
specifically states that two percent of all buildings and ten percent
of state and local buildings "are assumed to use new technologies as a
result of this action" and will thus incur the $2.5 billion investment
in energy saving technology projected under this program. Ibid.) but
this would mean investing $45 for the benefits of a $1 loan. (Even if
the Administration's assumption is correct and the $55 million could
be re-lent, say, three more times, the ratio still would be
approximately 11 to 1.)
<P>
     Another program that is unlikely to produce any significant
benefits is Action #39 -- Improve Ruminant Productivity and Product
Marketing -- which attempts to reduce cow flatulence by increasing
beef productivity. Cattle flatulence contains methane, a greenhouse
gas. The Administration assumes that a $28 million investment over six
years will increase significantly the productivity of this multi-
billion dollar industry. It proposes to achieve this goal through
improved nutrition and grazing management practices, "production-
enhancing agents to improve feed efficiency," disease control, and
improved genetic characteristics and reproduction. The White House is
correct in arguing that, if this initiative were to be successful,
less methane would be produced per pound of beef at the supermarket,
but it assumes falsely that increased beef productivity per unit will
not mean increased total beef production. In fact, increased
productivity presumably would cause lower prices, spurring greater
demand for beef and more production. While the amount of methane
produced per unit might decrease, the total amount from cow flatulence
actually could increase.
<P>
     Even the environmental lobby is skeptical of the plan's
effectiveness. As Steve Kretzman of Greenpeace said when briefed by
the Administration, "It's a repackaging of some old ideas and a few
scattered new ones. There is no guarantee that any of this will get us
anywhere. The only thing worse than this policy would have been no
policy." (Gary Lee, "Clinton Sets Plan to Cut Emissions," The
Washington Post, October 18, 1993, p. A1.)
<P>
     Echoing this sentiment, Michael Oppenheimer of the Environmental
Defense Fund, a vocal and well known advocate of the global warming
theory, said, "I have doubts as to whether even taken all together
[the 44 initiatives] can achieve reductions to 1990 levels. The
problem is that almost all of the measures are voluntary and there is
very little to encourage industry to participate and punish those who
don't." (Ibid.) But while the criticism that the U.S. will not reduce
its emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 is probably true, it is
certainly not because the plan is voluntary.
<P>

<B> THE PLAN IS FAR FROM VOLUNTARY</B>
<P>
Approximately one-half of the $63 billion plan results from mandatory
proposals. (It is impossible to know with certainty the exact costs of
the mandatory programs because the Administration's plan combines
major mandatory programs with minor voluntary programs in its cost and
saving estimates.) In Action #7, for instance, the plan proposes to
require appliance manufacturers to spend $19.5 billion to improve the
energy efficiency of household appliances. These costs in large
measure will be passed on to consumers in higher prices for
refrigerators, heaters, air conditioners, ovens, televisions, and
other appliances. The plan also calls for mandatory increases in
residential building standards under Action #10, which, according to
the Administration, will cost another $11.7 billion when combined with
two minor programs. (Ironically, this effort to seal buildings more
tightly to reduce energy loss, which will increase airborne illnesses
and hazards, comes at a time when the Administration is attempting to
address the problem of indoor air pollution.) Unfortunately, it is not
possible to know the exact projected cost for this program because the
Administration has combined the cost estimates of all three programs;
but the others appear to be minor in scope, so that costs under the
mandatory increased building standards will likely amount to nearly
all of the $11.7 billion projected for the three programs combined.
Added together, these two mandates will cost approximately $31
billion, or half of the total costs of the plan. This means that
households will spend an average of more than $300 each over the next
seven years on higher-cost houses and appliances, since these costs
largely will be passed on to consumers. Moreover, this $300 per
household is in addition to any costs that flow through companies to
consumers from the other 42 programs.
<P>
     Action #22 also calls for mandatory labeling of automobile tires
to encourage consumers to buy more fuel-efficient tires. According to
the Administration, this program would cost the private sector $2.2
billion but save fuel worth $3.9 billion. But, since the labeling
would be informational and would not itself result in energy
efficiency, it is impossible to estimate its benefits accurately.
Moreover, the Administration arrives at $3.9 billion in fuel savings
by making some rather suspect assumptions. For instance, it claims one
out of thirteen drivers will buy new tires in response to the labels,
supposedly because they will be able to drive almost a full mile
further for every gallon of gas. Thus, they will burn less gas, which
releases carbon. It is far from clear, however, that the government's
figures are accurate. In the body of the Action Plan, the government
assumes implicitly that the average car now only gets 1.7 miles per
gallon; it states that a .068 miles per gallon increase in average
fleet on-road fuel economy is a four percent increase over current
miles per gallon. Obviously, the Administration's claim is false. Yet
in the Appendix of the Action Plan, the Administration uses accurate
and fairly detailed fuel consumption figures.
<P>
     Several other provisions are also mandatory, such as pesticide
use reductions due to an Integrated Pest Management Program required
under Action #18. (The Administration assumes small energy savings
from the reduction in manufacture of pesticides, but its calculations
ignore the increased energy consumption needed to obtain the same crop
yield without pesticides, as well as the sizable increased costs
associated with pesticide reductions.)The plan does not rely solely on
inflexible "command and control" regulation. Most of the 44
initiatives are based on new "voluntary" partnerships between
government and businesses. (While "voluntary" initiatives comprise the
largest number of initiatives, it appears their cost is not more than
half the total cost of the plan.) As Secretary Hazel O'Leary said when
the plan was unveiled, "What 'voluntary' connotes is an agreement,
among parties of equal standing with full knowledge who agree, in
fact, to accomplish something." (Remarks at White House briefing,
October 19, 1993.) But, of course, companies do not have equal
standing with the federal government. This is not an agreement between
sovereign powers. Rather than take control of the method of production
directly, as many other environmental regulations do, the plan
encourages companies to sign onto "voluntary" reductions of greenhouse
gas emissions -- or face the regulatory hammer.
<P>

<B> CATASTROPHIC GLOBAL WARMING IS IMPROBABLE</B>
<P>
The enormous drain on economic resources to achieve questionable
success would cause concern even if the threat of catastrophic global
warming were real, but this assumption, on which the entire plan is
based, is under increasing challenge. According to a 1992 Greenpeace
survey, only 13 percent of climate scientists polled believe that
runaway global warming will occur, while 79 percent are split between
whether it is possible or will "probably not" occur. (Greenpeace press
release, "Climate Scientists Fear Effects of Understanding Global
Warming, Poll Shows," February 9, 1992.) This result is not
surprising. Accumulated scientific data and analyses of past studies
show that the dire predictions are either highly improbable or simply
wrong. Moreover, there is enormous uncertainty associated with the
scientific methodologies used to predict future climate changes. 
<P>
Climate change computer models that predict warming often rely on
  assumptions and oversimplifications that raise serious questions as
  to their reliability. One model, for example, effectively moved the
  Earth's orbit two million miles closer to the sun. (John Shanahan,
  "A Guide to the Global Warming Theory," Heritage Foundation
  Backgrounder No. 896, May 21, 1992.)
<P>
Models do not account accurately for the influence of important
  climate factors, such as the behavior and effect of clouds and
  oceans.
<P>
Temperature records over the last century are inconsistent with the
  predictions of global climate theories.
<P>
There are shortcomings in the data. Temperature records over the last
  century, for example, may show warming incorrectly because many
  weather stations are close to growing cities.
<P>
In contrast to measurements from ground stations, which are prone to
  various inaccuracies, more reliable satellite data collected since
  1979 show that temperatures over the last 15 years have not
  increased. (Telephone conversation with Dr. John R. Christy, Earth
  Systems Science Laboratory, University of Alabama in Huntsville. Dr.
  Christy and his co-author, Richard T. McNider, published their
  results in a January 27, 1994, letter in Nature.)
<P>
Concern about the quality of the models used is heightened further by
  the fact that they fail to predict accurately today's temperatures.
  When climate data from 50 years ago are fed into these models, they
  indicate that temperatures today should be much hotter than they
  actually are. Thus, the models contain a bias toward predicting
  hotter weather.
<P>
     Further, even if scientists were to become convinced that some
level of global warming is occurring and will continue, three
questions need to be answered.
<P>
QUESTION #1: Is the Earth warming because of human-caused greenhouse
   gases, or because of natural phenomena?
<P>
QUESTION #2: If the planet is experiencing a major warming trend, how
   will this warming take place? Will the Earth warm up substantially
   at night, perhaps cooling slightly during the day? Will the warming
   occur only in the tropical regions or only in the high latitudes
   around the poles? Will it occur in the summer or the winter? (These
   questions are important because any single figure suggesting the
   average temperature of all regions of the world for all times of
   day and night during the entire year ignores variations amid the
   warming trend that would have very different -- and not necessarily
   harmful -- effects.)
<P>
QUESTION #3: What will be the effect of any changes in the climate?
   Will the ocean levels rise, resulting in worldwide flooding, or
   fall, expanding Earth's landmass? Will worldwide agricultural
   production increase because of more crops in areas now too cold for
   major cultivation, thereby helping to alleviate world hunger, or
   decrease, prompting famine in some regions?
<P>
These questions must be answered before the consequences of global
warming -- assuming there is such a thing -- can be predicted. In any
event, the evidence suggests strongly that: (See Shanahan, "A Guide to
the Global Warming Theory.")
<P>
<LI> Widespread flooding from the melting of the ice caps will not occur.
<LI> Daytime temperatures will not increase.
<LI>Agricultural production will increase, not fall.
<LI>Increased periods and regions of drought will not result.
<LI> Plants will retain water better and thus will be more drought- 
resistant.
<P>
In light of the unanswered questions, new data, and the uncertainties
and inconsistencies of climate change models which are known to mirror
reality inaccurately, the final and most important question is: What
is the appropriate course of action?
<P>

<B> WHAT IS PRUDENT POLICY?</B>
<P>
Administration officials have decided to follow what some bureaucrats
and environmental lobbyists call a "no-regrets" policy. Basically,
this policy works on the "just in case" principle: government should
take decisive, albeit expensive, action if a potentially serious
problem is possible -- just in case. But while this argument may sound
plausible, it ignores the dangers of overreaction. Hundreds of
thousands of Americans could lose their jobs as the Administration
combats what may well be an entirely mythical problem. 
<P>
     When faced with uncertain science like the theory of global
warming, what should the government do? One of four basic strategies
can be adopted, depending on the particular situation. (S. Fred
Singer, "Environmental Strategies with Uncertain Science," Regulation,
Winter 1990, p. 65.) 
<P>
OPTION #1: Take no action, not even research. This option is, of
   course, costless, but it introduces the danger both of not dealing
   with a potential problem and of not learning the degree of a
   possible threat.
<P>
OPTION #2: Conduct more research, but take no other action. This
   option is relatively inexpensive, yet increases knowledge of the
   scope and likelihood of a potential problem. It risks the possible
   consequences associated with deferring action and having to catch
   up later; but if stepped-up research shows the problem to have been
   overrated, or nonexistent, huge and unnecessary costs will have
   been avoided.
<P>
OPTION #3: Take limited action to control greenhouse emissions, phased
   in over a period. This option is also less expensive than tackling
   the problem -- again, assuming it exists -- completely and
   immediately; but it is extremely expensive when compared with
   research, and the result may be huge expenditures on a problem that
   does not exist.
<P>
OPTION #4: Undertake full control of emissions on an emergency
   timetable. This option addresses the potential harm as quickly and
   thoroughly as possible, but it also means a heavy cost to the
   economy for what may be a nonexistent problem.
  <P>
If real, the threat posed by global warming is large enough to rule
out the first option as sound policy. Likewise, the cost to Americans
of an emergency program to avert an improbable catastrophe is heavy
enough to rule out the fourth option.
<P>
     The decision as to whether the U.S. should "take action" or
increase research should be based on the potential cost of delaying
action while research is conducted compared with the cost of action.
According to a scientific panel of the George C. Marshall Institute, a
Washington, DC.-based public policy institute focusing on scientific
matters, two important studies indicate that the cost of delay is in
fact very small:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The calculations [of both studies] show that a five-year
     delay in limiting carbon emissions will make the world
     warmer in the next century by at most one tenth of a degree,
     compared to how warm it will be if there were no delay.
     (George C. Marshall Institute, "Global Warming Update:
     Recent Scientific Findings," 1992.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Meanwhile, knowledge is increasing rapidly because of stepped-up
research. The vast majority of what scientists know about climate
change has been learned in the last three or four years, and this
knowledge is expected to increase substantially more within a few
years.
<P>
     Despite the need for more data, and although the United States is
under no international obligation to leap without looking, the
Administration is pursuing the third option. Indeed, "this [national
action plan] is a political commitment of the president," according to
Dr. Susan Tierney, Assistant Secretary for Policy, Planning, and
Program Evaluation at the Department of Energy. (Speaking before U.S.
Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources hearing on
Administration's National Action Plan to Reduce Greenhouse Gases,
October 28, 1993.) Yet the total costs are unknown. The $63 billion
cost of the Administration's plan almost certainly is an underestimate
-- and it is only the first installment. If the aim is to limit CO2
emissions during the next century, the United States will have to
continue its efforts beyond the year 2000.
<P>
     Given the enormous but unknown costs and the negligible danger
from delay, the focus of U.S. efforts should be to expand scientific
knowledge about global warming, not to spend billions on a program to
minimize the risk of an improbable theory. Specifically, the U.S.
should:
<P>
Continue federal funding for climate change research. 
<P>
     Currently, the U.S. spends more on climate change research than
the rest of the world combined. Yet some environmentalists, as well as
the Office of Technology Assessment, advocate reducing scientific
research on whether global climate change will occur. (Office of
Technology Assessment, Preparing for an Uncertain Climate -- Volume
II, OTA-568, October 1993.) Instead, they want funds to be devoted to
studying the effects of global warming based on the assumption that
because runaway global warming could come suddenly at any time, it is
better to act now on this extreme improbability than to determine
whether it is even possible.
<P>
Open the National Archives to climate change researchers. 
<P>
     Subject to legitimate national security concerns, such as sources
and methods of intelligence gathering and existing programs,
scientific researchers should have access to the National Archives,
which houses mountains of data that could be used to accelerate
research. Collected by surveillance satellites, aircraft, submarines,
and oceanographic vessels, these data could aid in research on past
contours and thaw rates of polar ice caps, ocean chemistry and
temperatures, and scores of other questions.
<P>
These two steps would ensure that scientists could continue to
increase their knowledge of climate interaction at a rapid rate.
Moreover, America would avoid the mistake of spending enormous sums of
money on what science may show to be a non-problem.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
Faced with an uncertain science and the known consequences of rash
action, sound public policy demands that lawmakers use care in
choosing how the United States addresses global warming. If billions
of dollars are squandered on what turns out to be a "Chicken Little"
threat, lawmakers will have failed in their duty.
<P>
     As envisioned, the Clinton Administration's National Action Plan
will impose large costs on all households even though scientists
remain divided as to whether adverse climate changes will occur. The
wisest course of action would be to increase the corpus of knowledge
of the Earth's atmosphere before spending billions on potentially
unnecessary programs.

INTRODUCTION

<P>Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the Clean
Water Act, passed in 1972 to clean up the nation's rivers, lakes, and
streams. (The forerunner of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act,
as the Clean Water Act also is known, was passed in 1948 as the Water
Pollution Control Act of 1948, Public Law 809-845. The Clean Water
Act's structure is much different, but built upon the 1948
foundation.) One of the key issues being debated is federal wetlands
policy. In practice, the Clean Water Act is being used as a
legislative vehicle to restrict any disturbance of wetlands, even
though wetlands are not mentioned in the legislation.

<P>Wetlands can be defined very loosely as lands that are wet, such
as swamps, and their protection has long been a politically
contentious issue. Although the Administration recently claimed that
its new proposal "broke the gridlock on wetlands policy," ("Highlights
of the Clinton Administration's Environmental Accomplishments,"
released by the White House April 21, 1994.) its claim is far from
accurate; the controversy continues unabated, in large part because of
the confusing and onerous nature of existing wetland policy.
Specifically:

There is great doubt whether the executive branch is authorized to
protect wetlands under the Clean Water Act as currently written.

The official definition of what constitutes a wetland uses a one-size-
fits-all approach, has fluctuated frequently, and has been overly
broad.

Disagreement exists over whether the nation already has achieved its
wetland goal of "no net loss" in light of evidence that in 1994 there
will be a wetlands net gain of nearly 60,000 acres.
<P>
The government consistently has refused to compensate property owners
for the lost value of land when, to preserve wetlands, owners are
denied the right to develop or use their land.

<P>Congress should address these problems in its consideration of
the Clean Water Act and in subsequent legislation. Failure to do so
will mean continued and valid charges of injustice in federal policy,
and the resulting lawsuits will continue to clog the court system.
Equally important, failure will mean that the nation's scarce economic
resources will continue to be misdirected to low-priority
environmental problems. Specifically, Congress should:
<P>
1)   State clearly in the Clean Water Act reauthorization that
     protection is limited to water pollution and that wetlands are
     not protected under the Act.
<P>
2)   Decide whether wetlands should be protected for their own sake.
     If the answer is yes, a separate Wetlands Protection Act should
     be passed that provides clear authority to the executive branch
     to regulate wetlands for their ecological value. This new Act
     should require the executive branch to define different
     categories of wetlands according to their ecological structure
     and value. The categorization should include the economic value
     of land, to ensure that the country obtains the "biggest bang for
     every environmental buck."
<P>
3)   Require a Presidential Report to Congress detailing a county-by-
     county breakdown of the number of acres being converted from
     wetlands to productive use and the number of acres being restored
     to wetland status, highlighting any conflicts in the current
     government wetland data.
<P>
4)   Require the government to pay landowners that are denied the
     right to use their land the fair market value -- plus 15 percent
     -- of the rights taken. This additional premium would compensate
     owners on average for their inconvenience and for the lost
     personal value of their land. Additionally, it would discourage
     highly disruptive government actions that are only marginally
     beneficial. (See footnote 41 for a discussion of why a premium is
     needed.)

 <P>    If these solutions are not enacted, America will continue to
misspend its resources pursuing a misguided policy on wetlands
protection that it is not clearly authorized by law to regulate. And
irate landowners will continue to oppose government wetland policy
because of its fundamentally unfair nature. Wetlands protection should
not be an issue clogging the courts. It needs instead to be addressed
properly and definitively by Congress.
<P>
     
ACTION ON CAPITOL HILL

 <P>    Congress is having difficulty reauthorizing the Clean Water Act
because of the varied and complex issues surrounding the law. In
addition to dealing with the heated wetlands controversy, Congress is
considering how best to control what is known technically as "non-
point source pollution," or pollution that enters waterways from no
specific source, such as from agricultural run-off. These issues have
slowed considerably the progress toward reauthorization. 

<P>     The Senate Clean Water bill reported by the Environment and
Public Works Committee (S. 2093), which is the rewrite of S.1114 and
S. 1304, is co-sponsored by Senators Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman of
the Environment and Public Works Committee, and John Chafee (R-RI),
ranking Republican on the same committee. (S. 2093 is a substitute
bill that combined the substantive provisions of S. 1114 and S. 1304
as well as other minor bills. Thus, it was reported as an original
bill.) Unfortunately, the bill does little of substance to solve the
major problems with current wetland policy. Significantly, it does
confer legislative authority on the executive branch to regulate
wetlands. But this authority would do far more harm than good unless
the other major problems listed above are addressed as well.

<P>     At this time, the status of the bill's consideration is
uncertain. Although Chairman Baucus has indicated he intends to bring
the bill to the floor as soon as possible, significant opposition may
forestall that step. One indication of this is a bipartisan letter to
Baucus in late April from 46 Senators detailing their extensive
substantive problems with S. 1114 (now incorporated in S. 2093),
including its failure to address key wetland reforms. (Specifically,
the letter states that "S.1114 fails to address needed wetland reform.
Prior converted wetlands should be excluded, regardless of the crop
grown. Agricultural lands cropped a majority of the time should be
excluded from jurisdiction. Classification of wetlands should be
established....We also have concerns with the following issues:...
prior converted wetlands, agricultural lands definition, definitions
for pollutant and discharge.... " Letter to The Honorable Max Baucus
from 46 Senators (bipartisan), April 25, 1994.) Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, however, has indicated he will move forward with the
present bill despite these concerns.

<P>     On the House side, Representative Norman Mineta (D-CA), Chairman
of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, is sponsoring that
chamber's version of reauthorization legislation (H.R.3948). The bill,
introduced on March 3, originally ignored the wetland issue but has
been changed in fundamental ways by Chairman Mineta with little input
from Committee members. Although it now includes a wetland provision
providing legislative authority for regulation, like the Baucus bill
it still lacks the fundamental reforms needed.

 <P>    The House bill has been as controversial as the Senate version
because there were no hearings before mark-up originally was scheduled
for May 3. Chairman Mineta, however, did not have the votes to send
the bill out of committee. Also, Members in May circulated a
"Discussion Draft Bi-partisan Alternative" to H.R. 3948 that would
address many of the problems now existing in Clean Water Act and
wetland policy. Under pressure from his committee members, and because
of the possibility an alternative bill might succeed, Chairman Mineta
consented to hearings just days before the intended May 3 mark-up,
which was postponed until after hearings are concluded.

<P>     An important bill that is substantially incorporated in the
alternative proposal is H.R.1330, sponsored by Representative James
Hayes (D-LA). The Hayes bill would require the Army Corps of Engineers
to classify wetlands according to their ecological value. During
hearings, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner
stated that several of the alternative bill's provisions "would be
detrimental to wetlands protection." (Speaking before the Committee on
Public Works and Transportation's Water Resources and Environment
Subcommittee on May 24, 1994. Technically, the Administrator did not
address herself to the alternative bill, but the specific issues that
she addressed are the core wetlands provisions in the alternative
bill.) Specifically, she opposed plans to categorize and rank
wetlands, change wetlands delineation criteria, and pay owners for
government purchase of high-value wetlands.

<P>     Another important House bill concerning wetlands (H.R.3875) is
sponsored by W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (D-LA), who calls his bill the
"private property owners' Bill of Rights" because it mandates
compensation to landowners when government action to protect wetlands
or endangered species results in a fifty percent reduction in property
value. While this bill is not tied to the Clean Water Act
reauthorization, it has gained widespread support in the policy
community. Opposition to the Tauzin bill also has mounted, making
action doubtful at this time.

<P>
FUNDAMENTALS OF WETLAND POLICY

 <P>    Wetlands, traditionally known as swamps or bogs, have been
disappearing at a rapid rate during this century. The fundamental
reason for their disappearance earlier in the century is also the
reason for efforts to protect them now: wetlands or swamps are unique
ecosystems. Wetlands are valued by many Americans for the very
practical reason that they can act as a buffer against flooding and
can purify streams and rivers, in addition to providing a home for
diverse species of wildlife. Others despise wetlands as "mosquito-
infested swamps," and indeed they typically are breeding grounds for
disease-carrying mosquitoes. Historically, the vast majority of
Americans have fallen into the latter group and have supported efforts
to eradicate wetlands, but increased public recognition of the
positive qualities of some wetlands in recent decades has led to
demands for preservation.

<P>     Ironically, the organization in the United States most
responsible for destroying these swamps is now the primary
organization charged with their protection -- the Army Corps of
Engineers. In 1780, before the Corps' systematic campaign to fill in
wetlands, there were 221 million acres of wetlands in the lower
continental United States. Today only an estimated 104 million acres
are left. ("Wetlands Losses in the United States 1780's to 1980's,"
U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1990.)
The Corps has taken on the mission of wetland protection as one of its
primary activities and, in conjunction with the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), zealously punishes violators of its
complicated regulations. For example, Bill Ellen, an environmental
engineer and consultant, inadvertently violated federal wetlands
regulations in 1988 by making duck ponds on his employer's privately
owned wildlife preserve. He paid for this error by being jailed as a
felon four years later. His case is not unique.

 <P>    Under federal regulations as now written, a landowner intending
to build on, clear, or otherwise disturb wetlands must obtain
permission from the EPA and the Corps through a permit application
process. (Sections 301 and 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act, as amended.) If the permit is denied or carries conditions, the
landowner cannot use his property as he intended. Thus, for example,
if an application for a permit to alter a wetland in order to
construct a duck pond or building were denied, the landowner would be
an owner in name only. (The owner would have title to the land, and
would pay taxes on land, but would not in practice be able to use the
land. The landowner, however, still would retain the right to exclude
others from his property. While this retained right can have value if
the land is close to a home or for a similar reason, in the absence of
the right to beneficial use, this right to exclude is frequently
worthless. Counties increasingly are taking this decreased value into
account in terms of property taxes. In Anchorage, Alaska, for example,
the value of an acre of non-usable wetlands is deemed to be $100. This
has the effect of reducing local taxes significantly. Yet, while it
relieves the burden of the owner from paying high taxes on worthless
property, the productive value of the property is lost. Thus, the
local economy loses both economic value and tax revenues.)

<P>     Since the inception of wetland protection, many fundamental
problems and issues have arisen which have caused a growing backlash
against the EPA and the Corps, as well as against environmentalists.
(The backlash against environmentalists has occurred because they are
perceived correctly as driving the government's increasingly strict
wetlands policy. Moreover, they have lobbied actively against payments
to landowners when their land is taken on the premise that it would
cost too much. But there is a cost either way to taking the land; the
only question is who pays the cost.) Traditionally, environmental laws
regulate bigger firms by mandating that they use certain
"environmentally friendly" technologies or meet specific standards
when conducting large-scale operations. The Clean Water Act, for the
most part, uses this same regulatory structure designed for big
business, but under recent wetland policy, the Act's structure also
applies to smaller landowners.

<P>The Clean Water Act has been enlarged through statutory
interpretation to authorize the federal government to regulate anyone
who wishes to use his land if that land is found to meet the
government's definition of a wetland. Thus, homeowners, small
entrepreneurs and developers, and retirees hoping to build their dream
homes all have come under the direct authority of EPA and the Corps.
Essentially, ordinary Americans have been forced to deal with legal
requirements designed for businesses with lawyers on staff or
retainer. But what is an irritation for a large firm can be a costly
legal nightmare for a small landowner, and many of those complying
with requirements lose valuable rights when the federal government
denies them permission to alter their own land. Faced with heavy
mortgage notes on now nearly worthless land, many of those affected
have joined in a growing grass-roots movement to combat what they view
as heavy-handed and legally unauthorized federal actions. (In many of
these cases, the owners cannot simply abandon the mortgage note
because the land affected is generally only a portion of the whole
property. Thus, the regulated owner may own a home on the same site
that also acts as security on the note. Even when the note could be
abandoned, this merely transfers the economic loss to another
individual or firm.) 

<P>In any serious discussion of wetland policy, four issues are of
paramount importance.
<P>
ISSUE #1:  The "Law" That Is Not A Law

<P>The first issue is the apparent lack of legislative authority
under existing law for current executive branch policy on wetlands
protection. The Clean Water Act does not protect explicitly any
wetland; in fact, neither the word "wetland" nor any synonym is
mentioned or implied in the language of the Clean Water Act. Thus, on
its face, the Act authorizes no federal protection of wetlands.
Section 404, the center of the controversy, prohibits the "discharge
of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters" of the United
States unless a permit for such activity is issued. (33 U.S.C.A. sec.
1344; Permits for dredged or fill material, FWPCA sec. 404.) According
to the wording of this clause, Congress clearly intended to limit the
ability of individuals to choke waterways that were navigable by
limiting the practice of dumping dirt into them. By requiring
governmental permission, Congress ensured that navigation remained
clear for boat traffic.

<P>The clause, however, has been broadly interpreted by the Army
Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other
agencies to prohibit virtually any activity in connection with land
that has a certain minimum water content -- whether or not it is
navigable. The ostensible justification for this position is that any
form of pollutant, including clean fill dirt, that comes into contact
with wet soil will make its way via ground water flows into navigable
waterways. While minute quantities can make their way into navigable
waterways, this rationale has been stretched so far that the
government now considers any mechanical disturbance, such as
bulldozing of soil already naturally in the wetland, to be a violation
of the Clean Water Act. But Congress never intended to prevent such
minor movements of soil. Indeed, the legislative history of the
original Act shows that not a single Congressman voiced support for
the strained interpretation the executive branch now reads into it.
Not a single lawmaker even uttered the word "wetland."

<P>Nevertheless, it is arguable that certain kinds of wetland are
protected under the Clean Water Act. (For an in depth and thorough
treatise on the question of wetland protection authority, see William
G. Laffer III, "The Meaning and Scope of the Clean Water Act, and
Especially Section 404, As Applied To Wetlands," February 14, 1992
(revising original dated January 21, 1991. Comments filed with EPA
pursuant to 56 Fed. Reg. 40446.)) The legislative history may provide
some rationale for supporters of current protection in its discussion
of "navigable waters," a term used to specify the type of waterways
the overall Clean Water Act was meant to regulate. ( Courts often rely
on formal comments by Congressmen during the legislative process to
assist them in their determination of the meaning of specific
provisions of laws. The effort is based on the presumption that the
legislative record provides evidence of what meanings were intended by
Congress as a whole when it passed the law. A major problem with
reliance on legislative history, however, is that comments in the
record virtually never reflect the views of all those who vote on the
issue. Hence, the record may inaccurately reflect and even contradict
congressional understanding. The legislative record is useful,
however, to demonstrate that the common understanding of clear and
plain language was not contradicted during debate. See William N.
Eskridge, Jr. and Philip P. Frickey, Legislation: Statutes and the
Creation of Public Policy, American Casebook Series (St. Paul,
Minn.:West Publishing Co., 1988).) In presenting the Conference
version of the Clean Water bill to the House, Representative John
Dingell (D-MI), who was a member of the Conference Committee,
explained that:
<UL>
     the conference bill defines the term "navigable waters"
     broadly for water quality purposes.... Thus, this new
     definition clearly encompasses all water bodies, including
     main streams and their tributaries, for water quality
     purposes.... No longer are the old, narrow definitions...
     going to govern. (1 Legislative History 250 (House
     Consideration of S. Conf. Rep. No. 1236, 92d Cong., 2d
     Sess.) (Oct. 4, 1972) (emphasis added).)</UL>

<P>While this statement and others in the record indicate that
navigability should be construed broadly, this extension of the term
still was meant to apply only to waters that drain or flow into
navigable waters. The legislative history shows the focus of the
definition was to widen the requirement that directly affected waters
be those navigable by vessels. More precisely, the term was broadened
specifically to prevent the migration of pollutants to navigable
waterways from tributaries. ("Water moves[,]... and it is [therefore]
essential that discharge of pollutants be controlled at the source.
Therefore, reference to the control requirements [of the Act] must be
made to the navigable waters, portions thereof, and their tributaries.
S. Rep. No. 414, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 77 (1971), reprinted in 2
Legislative History 1945.)

<P>Although it is possible to stretch that meaning to encompass some
wetlands, not all wetlands can contribute pollutants to navigable
waters. Most crucially, isolated wetlands which do not interact with
waters flowing into navigable waterways (technically known as "non-
adjacent wetlands") cannot by any stretch of interpretation fall under
the Act because there is no possibility a pollutant can enter a
waterway. (The factors that would have to be present for a wetland to
be legitimately covered under the Clean Water Act are, at a minimum:
1) a discharged material; 2) through drainage or flow via either
ground water or surface water; 3) could migrate to an interstate
water. Even this interpretation of the extent of authority is likely
overreaching and broad since section 404 refers specifically to dredge
and fill material.) Indeed, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in
May 1994 held that pollutants are not covered under the Act even if
they can migrate to navigable waters via ground water. The court
indicated that pollutants were covered only if they could migrate via
surface waters to navigable waterways. (Oconomowoc Lake v. Dayton
Hudson Corp., Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 93-3380, May 18,
1994.)

<P>In short, the Act was intended to reduce pollution at its source,
not to protect wetlands per se. (See Laffer, "Meaning and Scope," op.
cit. A final important argument is that Congress does not have the
authority to regulate intrastate wetlands that have no intercourse
with interstate waters because these rights are reserved to the
states. The Supreme Court, however, routinely grants such authority
under the Commerce clause. U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8,
clause 3. While the judicial reasoning behind the Court's
interpretation of the Commerce clause is fatally flawed, it
nevertheless remains the law of the land. See Wickard v. Filburn, 317
U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942).) If an activity would not
produce pollution downstream in a truly navigable water by fostering
migration of pollutants through surface water tributaries, it should
not fall under the authority of the law as written.

<P>Despite their highly questionable authority to regulate wetlands,
the Corps and the EPA have issued regulations restricting any wetland
interference without permission, which averages over a year to obtain
and often is not granted. Despite numerous court challenges,
enforcement of these regulations largely has been supported by the
courts. But this support has not been uniform. (See Oconomowoc, op.
cit.) Moreover, since the Supreme Court has yet to address the issue
squarely, the issue remains unsettled, which merely fuels further
litigation. (The Supreme Court did decide, in a case dealing with
adjacent wetlands, that the term navigable did not require the water
actually be navigable, but rather only that, from water, a pollutant
could flow into navigable waters. United States v. Riverside Bayview
Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121 (1985). This is consistent with the
discussion preceding the accompanying text.)
Recommendation: Given the executive branch's murky authority to
protect wetlands under the Clean Water Act, Congress should decide
legislatively whether wetlands as such should be protected.
In either case, Congress should add a provision during reauthorization
specifically limiting Section 404 to its original purpose of
regulating dredge and fill material, and not protecting wetlands for
their own sake. If Congress also wants to protect wetlands for their
own sake, it should enact separate legislation that consolidates all
wetlands policy and legislation. Thus all enforcement, mitigation, and
restoration programs intended to promote wetlands should be made part
of a "Wetlands Policy Act." Such a new law also should contain relief
measures for landowners once the Bush-Clinton goal of no-net-loss is
achieved (see below).
<P>
ISSUE #2: The Problem Of Definition

<P>The second issue is simply one of definition: what exactly is a
"wetland"? Although this would appear to be a relatively simple
matter, it has proven much more difficult for experts to define than
most people would imagine. Hence the ridicule when former Vice
President Dan Quayle questioned "how wet" land had to be under the
Act. Quayle understood this complicated environmental issue while his
detractors did not. The problem of defining what is a wetland was
characterized succinctly by Robert Pierce of the Army Corps of
Engineers in the National Wetlands Newsletter:
<UL>
     Ecologically speaking, the term "wetland" has no meaning:
     natural systems exist on a hydrolic gradient from ocean to
     desert. Somewhere in the middle are what society calls
     wetlands. For regulatory purposes, a wetland is whatever we
     decide it is. The type of natural systems that have been
     defined as wetlands has changed virtually every year for the
     last decade. (CEI Update (Competitive Enterprise
     Institute),Vol. 7, No. 4, citing Robert J. Pierce,
     "Redefining Our Regulatory Goals," National Wetlands
     Newsletter, November/December 1991, p. 12.)</UL>

<P>Not only has the definition of what is or is not a wetland
changed over time, but the definitions often have been overly broad.
As Senator David Pryor (D-AR) stated last year, "one definition would
designate the entire eastern half of Arkansas to be a wetland and any
activity -- be it for commercial, agricultural, or other purposes --
could be considered breaking the law." ("Wetlands Caucus Created in
Senate," EPA WATCH, August 31, 1993, p. 3.)

<P>Such disagreements as to what constitutes wetlands and how
broadly they should be defined have caused the government to change
its official definition twice since former President Bush made his "no
net loss of wetlands" pledge during the 1988 presidential campaign.
(Bill Peterson, "Bush Vows to Fight Pollution, Install 'Conservation
Ethic'; Speech Distances Candidate From Reagan," The Washington Post,
September 1, 1988, p. A1.) At that time, the 1987 Wetlands Delineation
Manual specified the official definition of a wetland. (Federal Manual
for Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands (1987).)

<P>Fundamental changes in this standard were made in 1989, however,
when President Bush's new appointees decided to broaden the definition
of a wetland. This new definition was severely criticized as
overreaching any reasonable definition of land that is wet. By some
estimates, 40 percent of drought-stricken California (even before the
winter rains of 1992-1993) would have qualified as wetlands under the
1989 standard. (Rick Henderson, "The Swamp Thing," Reason, April 1991.
pp. 32-33.) The 1989 Delineation Manual stayed in effect until 1992,
when an appropriations amendment sponsored by Senator Bennett Johnston
(D-LA) limited funding to enforcement of the 1987 standard. In effect,
the 1989 standard was put on the shelf. Although the definition issue
was re-evaluated yet again by the Clinton Administration, the White
House decided to let the 1987 definition stand temporarily.

<P>     Basically, three factors are considered when determining whether
an area is a wetland under the 1987, 1989, and other definitions:
<P>
1)   The number of days land is inundated or saturated with water;
<P>
2)   Whether the area has hydric soil, or "earth that is chemically
     changed by water, usually with a peat, muck, or mineral base;"
     (Richard Miniter, "Muddy Waters: The Quagmire of Wetlands
     Regulation," Policy Review, Spring 1991, p. 72.) and 
<P>
3)   Whether the area has one of approximately 7,000 "indicator"
     species of plants growing on it.

<P>     Most of the problems in defining a wetland have arisen not from
disagreements over the appropriate factors, but over how many factors
must exist and to what degree. For instance, should two or all three
factors exist for a given site to be classified as a wetland? How many
days should it be saturated with water and to what depth? 

<P>Much of the problem with both the 1987 and 1989 Delineation
Manuals has centered on the "one-size-fits-all" approach to wetlands
designation. Ecological systems by nature are typically varied in
their structure, sensitivity, and ecological and economic value. These
considerations, currently neglected in forming decisions, (There is
some limited flexibility in the 1987 Wetlands Delineation Manual, but
this flexibility cuts both ways; an EPA regional office has the
flexibility to ignore mitigating factors in its decision making
process.) should be given utmost attention whenever a determination is
made as to whether a particular site should be declared a wetland and
preserved or declared a "dry" land with no restrictions against
development (or even declared a wetland that should be developed
anyway because the economic value in a specific situation far
outweighs its limited ecological value).
<P>
Recommendation: If Congress wants to extend protection to wetlands
   legislatively, the Wetlands Protection Act should require the Army
   Corps of Engineers to classify lands according to their ecological
   value.

<P>Wetlands would be divided into classes, such as "A," "B," "C,"
etc. Government would be authorized to acquire only those with the
highest ecological value (class "A"), which would merit the highest
degree of protection. Lower categories or classes could be given
lesser degrees of protection. (Congressman James Hayes' bill,
H.R.1330, would put just such a system into place by dividing wetlands
into three categories and requiring payment to affected landowners in
Class "A" wetlands.) This would avoid the inherent waste of spending
scarce economic resources on relatively unimportant low-value wetlands
and enable the country to target its efforts toward protection of more
valuable ecosystems. Moreover, since the government would be obligated
to purchase only the highest-valued wetland property, its intrusion
into the personal affairs of middle-class Americans would be kept to a
minimum.
<P>
ISSUE #3: Wetland Gains and Losses

<P>The third issue centers on whether wetland protection legislation
is necessary at all. (For a more detailed, but concise treatment of
this topic, see Jonathan Tolman, "Gaining Ground: Analysis of Wetland
Trends in the United States," Washington, D.C.,Competitive Enterprise
Institute, May 1994.) Despite the statement last year by EPA
Administrator Carol Browner that nearly 300,000 acres of wetland are
lost annually, 300,000 acres are not being lost. (Ibid., citing USA
Today, August 25, 1993.) Her estimates are based on figures over a
decade old. (This figure reflects the annual loss rate of 290,000
estimated for the 1974-1983 period, see T.E. Dahl and C.E. Johnson,
Status and Trends of Wetlands in the Coterminous United States,
Mid-1970's to Mid-1980's, U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and
Wildlife Service, Washington, D.C., 1991.) More recent data suggest a
much different picture. Based on government figures, a recent study by
Jonathan Tolman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that
America will have 59,000 more acres of wetlands at the end of 1994
than it did at the beginning. (Tolman, op. cit.)

<P>Tolman's estimate does not imply that wetlands no longer are
converted to productive use such as agriculture or development
(although the loss rate has slowed), but rather that wetland
restoration has increased significantly. The most recent data
available on wetland conversion rates were compiled by the Department
of Agriculture's Soil Conservation Service as part of its National
Resources Inventory, which is updated every five years. (U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, 1991 Update of
National Resources Inventory, Wetlands Data For Non-Federal Rural
Lands, Iowa State University Statistical Laboratory.) Unfortunately,
the Administration and groups calling for preservation of wetlands
have not made a point of publicizing the results, perhaps because the
results do not support their cause: the data show that wetland
conversion is slowing. From 1982-1987, the annual loss rate was
131,000 acres, significantly less than estimated by the Department of
Interior for the previous decade. Moreover, the loss rate slowed even
more from 1987-1991, when only 108,000 acres were lost annually.

<P>The rate of increase in wetland restoration, on the other hand,
has been dramatic in recent years, not because of the Clean Water
Act's prohibitions, but because of incentives to private landowners
under three other programs: the Partners for Wildlife program, the
Conservation Reserve Program, and the Wetlands Reserve Program. These
three programs, which are designed to encourage landowners to create
new wetlands, are responsible for the restoration of over 560,000
acres over the last seven years, and the annual rate has been
increasing. Based on annual trends and restoration authorizations,
Tolman estimates that in 1994 a total of 167,000 acres will be
restored -- compared with only 108,000 acres lost -- for a net gain of
59,000 acres of wetland. (Tolman, op. cit. The study contains good
charts illustrating this trend line, as well as more information on
the particulars of the wetlands restoration programs. Note that the
108,000 acres converted figure is probably conservative since the
trend, at least for agricultural conversions, has been downward. Thus,
the net gain figure is likely understated.)
Recommendation: Congress should require a presidential report
outlining all known information on wetland conversion and restoration.
This report should present a breakdown of conversions and restorations
on a county-by-county, state-by-state basis. Contradictory government
data should be highlighted and relevant considerations discussed.
Whenever discrepancies in the data exist, the report should show the
range of conversion and restoration estimates based on all data. The
report should be updated yearly. Moreover, if a "Wetlands Protection
Act" is considered necessary, Congress should incorporate a provision
giving relief to landowners from denial of permits to use their land
if in any consecutive two years there is a net gain of wetland acres.
Landowners, after all, should not be denied the fruits of their labor
if their actions will not result in a reduction of the "wetland
stock."
<P>
ISSUE #4: Whose Property Is It, Anyway?

<P>The fourth issue concerns the de facto taking of property through
regulation, known popularly as "regulatory takings," that now occurs
under regulation of wetlands and other property. (For in depth
research and clear analysis of constitutional issues surrounding
regulatory takings, see the book by Mark Pollot, Grand Theft and Petit
Larceny: Property Rights in America (San Francisco: Pacific Research
Institute, 1993). Pollot also authored Executive Order 12630, signed
during the Reagan Administration, that requires agencies to do a
Takings Impact Analysis (TIA); essentially, the agencies are required
to consider the potential that their actions will result in a taking
of property requiring just compensation and, where alternatives to
achieve the statutory goal exist, to adopt the alternative least
intrusive to the landowner.) One of the most unfair and burdensome
hardships inflicted by regulatory takings is that wetland owners are
not reimbursed for their loss. For instance, if an elderly couple
spends a large portion of their retirement savings to buy property to
build their dream home and that property is subsequently designated a
wetland, the value of their property -- and their savings -- is gone.
Unfortunately, tales of financial hardship caused by government
designation of lands as wetlands have become commonplace.

<P>The Administration is on record as opposing payments to
landowners whose property is designated a wetland. Office of
Management and Budget Director Leon Panetta says it would be "an
unnecessary and unwise use of taxpayer dollars" and a drain on the
federal budget. (Speaking at a hearing before the Committee on Public
Works and Transportation's Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment, U.S. House of Representatives, May 26, 1994.) Landowners
counter that regulatory takings are a drain on the family budget.
(Often ignored in the debate is that many families have mortgages on
the regulated land. While the regulated portions of their land may
become almost worthless, these families must continue to make large
mortgage payments or lose their homes situated on unregulated land
financed by the same mortgage.) Wetlands regulation has evolved into a
question of whether constitutionally guaranteed property rights are
being infringed; and since the courts have been of limited help,
landowners are in need of legislative protection.

<P>To understand why legislative protection for landowners is
appropriate, it is necessary to understand the broader issue of
governmental taking of property. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution implicitly recognizes that the federal government may
take private property for public use. This power, known as eminent
domain, was recognized by the Supreme Court as early as 1795 in
Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance when the court found that "the despotic
power, as it has been aptly called by some writers, of taking private
property, when state necessity requires it, exists in every
government... government could not subsist without it." (2 U.S. (2
Dall.) 304, 311 (1795).)

<P>The Fifth Amendment explicitly mandates, however, that government
must pay the property owner for the land confiscated. This concept,
embodied in the clause "nor shall private property be taken for public
use, without just compensation," ensures that property taken for
public use is paid for by those who benefit -- the public -- and not
by the citizen unfortunate enough to own land the government wants.
(Constitution of the United States, Amendment V, clause 3) In its most
basic sense, this is a fairness issue: Why should one American bear
the entire burden of the government's pursuit of a national good?

<P>The Founders well understood the positive economic consequences
of protecting owners' investments in their property. If property is to
be put to its best and most highly valued use, ownership must reside
in the hands of those who value it for as much or more than the fair
market value. (By definition, owners personally value their property
more highly than the government even when just compensation is paid
for an involuntary taking of land, or else the owner would have sold
it voluntarily. This "idiosyncratic" or subjective value by the owner
is real, but is a premium above the amount that could be obtained in a
fair market transaction. Due to this generally small discrepancy, even
when the government pays fair market value, it is purchasing the
property in a sense at a bargain price because the payment is less
than the value of the property to the seller. Nevertheless, since the
subjective value cannot be measured accurately, the objective standard
of fair market value properly should be paid as just compensation by
the government, with perhaps a fixed percentage of additional
compensation to offset the damage to the owner forcibly separated from
control of his land. A fair percentage would be perhaps 15 percent. Of
course, under this additional compensation arrangement, there would be
"winners" and "losers" in the sense that the 15 percent premium would
be more or less than the owner's subjective value compared with the
market price. But on average landowners would be more fairly
compensated and the government would be discouraged from taking
disruptive actions that are only marginally beneficial to the public.)
If government had a free hand to take property without payment, its
incentive to confiscate property that conferred only a small benefit
on the public would be large; after all, even small benefits outweigh
a zero cost. The problem is that costs are nonexistent only to the
government. The actual costs, borne by someone else, often are
substantial.

<P>Another positive result of requiring just compensation is
increased security. The Founders well understood that protection of
property restrained usurpation of other rights recognized by the
Constitution. It is this relationship to which Supreme Court Justice
Potter Stewart referred in Lynch v. Household Finance Co. Inc. when he
stated that there is a "fundamental interdependence... between the
personal right to liberty and the personal right to property." (405
U.S. 538, 552 (1972).)

<P>Practically speaking, governments can control a wide spectrum of
individual activities if they can control whether individuals remain
financially secure or must surrender their property. The majority
truly can tyrannize a disfavored minority if property rights are
uncertain. As James Madison characterized the problem of individual
rights in Federalist Paper No. 10, "it is that [pure] democracies have
ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been
incompatible with personal security or the rights of property." It was
to restrict just such tyranny over individuals that the Framers put
severe limits, such as the requirement of just compensation, on the
unchecked will of the majority. 

<P>The Supreme Court has been clear in requiring federal, state, and
local governments to pay just compensation whenever governmental
bodies physically take or occupy land or real estate. (The requirement
of just compensation by the federal government under the 5th Amendment
is extended to the states under the 14th Amendment. It also applies,
by further extension, to localities since their authority is derived
from the state.) Essentially, the Court has held that, even if only a
small amount of real property is involved, a taking has occurred and
just compensation is required. (Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV
Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982).) Unfortunately, however, the Court's
decisions regarding regulatory takings have been less clear and
consistent. One landmark case essentially found that if any
compensation was provided, whether at a just level or not, a taking
had not occurred. (Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City,
438 U.S. 104 (1978). This was one of many holdings in the case.) This
reasoning was faulty because the question of whether a property right
has been taken is independent of the issue of compensation, which by
definition can take place only if property has been taken or lost. If
a small payment negates the finding of a taking, it also would negate
the requirement of "just" compensation. (This is clearly absurd on its
face. Such a construction completely negates the effect of the just
compensation clause and, instead, substitutes the requirement of a
token payment.)

<P>The Supreme Court in recent years has begun slowly to move back
toward protection of property owners. (See First English Evangelical
Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, California, 482
U.S. 304, 96 L.Ed. 2d 250 (1987) (finding a temporary restriction on
property to be a taking) and Nollan v. California Coastal Commission,
107 S.Ct. 3141, 488 U.S. 825, 97 L. Ed. 2d 677 (finding that the
government could not engage in "extortion" by requiring a homeowner to
provide public access to the beach in order to get a permit to build a
second story on his bungalow. The Court found that there was an
insufficient nexus between the Coastal Commission's mission of
protecting the coastal view and providing public access to the
beach).) In its most recent regulatory taking case, Lucas v. South
Carolina Coastal Council, (Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council,
505 U.S. ____, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798, 112 S.Ct. 2886 (1992).) the Court in
1992 found that a regulation prohibiting property use which also
destroyed 100 percent of the property's value was a taking requiring
just compensation. The Court, however, specifically declined to
address the issue of whether anything less than a complete devaluation
was a taking. (Essentially, the Court makes the same mistake here as
it did in Penn Central in defining a property right as being its
value. Simply put, property rights are fixed legal rights of an
individual to use and enjoy property. Since property can be used in
many different ways, there are consequently many different rights the
individual owns. For instance, an owner of land can sell an easement
to a neighbor allowing the neighbor to walk across the land, yet
retain all other rights to that land himself. By focusing on the value
of the rights infringed rather than on the substance of the rights
denied to an owner, the court confuses fixed legal rights with the
ever fluctuating fair market value of those rights. The value of the
rights taken certainly is important in determining the level of
compensation that is just, but it is irrelevant in determining whether
a legal right has been taken in the first place. The Supreme Court
heard its most recent property rights case, Dolan v. Tigard, on March
23, 1994. The case centered on whether the City of Tigard could
condition the issuance of a permit for store expansion on Dolan's
relinquishing of title to land; for a greenway and a bicycle path to
be constructed at Dolan's expense. The decision is expected this
summer.) Thus, it is uncertain whether the government must compensate
owners when the property retains, say, 20 percent of its previous fair
market value.
<P>
Recommendation: In light of the ambiguous and limited protection
   against uncompensated regulatory takings, a Private Property
   Protection Act is necessary to ensure private property rights are
   fully protected.

<P>If the government infringes any property right by denying an
owner use of his own land, the affected landowner should be given the
full fair market value of any reduction in the value of his property.
While any devaluation should be compensated, the Act should specify
that a 25 percent devaluation of real property after an infringing
governmental action is a presumptive taking requiring full
compensation for the value of the land taken. (The Act should include
a section that a taking has not occurred if the governmental action is
to abate a nuisance as defined by background principles of common law
within the state the property is situated.) The owner also should be
allowed to elect payment for the entire value of the regulated land --
rather than just the reduction in value -- if he forfeits title to the
government. (It is important to note that this provision should apply
only to land directly affected by the governmental action, including
permit denial, and would not allow the property owner to demand
payment for the value of acreage not affected by the regulatory
action. If the owner does not elect to forfeit his title, the
government should pay only the differential between the fair market
value prior to and after the regulatory taking since no additional
rights have been condemned and compensated.)  These provisions will
constrain judicial latitude and thus minimize the possibility of
misguided judicial interpretation limiting protection to property
owners.

<P>Moreover, a 15 percent premium over fair market value should be
paid. This premium roughly would compensate owners for their
inconvenience and for the lost personal value of their land. (See note
41 for a discussion of why a premium is needed.) It also would reduce
highly disruptive actions that are only marginally beneficial to the
government.


CONCLUSION

Unfortunately, the wetland policy that has emerged in recent years is
fraught with problems that have contributed to a growing backlash from
property owners. While the issues are many and varied, four basic
problems have fueled the controversy. First, clear legislative
authority to protect wetlands as wetlands is lacking in law. Second, a
one-size-fits-all definition of what constitutes a wetland is used but
is crude and inappropriate. Third, new evidence has shown that America
has met its no-net-loss of wetlands goal and more wetland acres are
being restored than lost. Fourth, landowners whose valuable property
rights are infringed to pursue this public benefit are not compensated
for their loss.

<P>Each of these problems can be solved. For example, the lack of
legislative authority to protect "wetlands as wetlands" can be dealt
with by clarifying that Section 404 of the Clean Water Act is not
intended to protect wetlands. If protection of "wetlands as wetlands"
is desired, a Wetlands Protection Act should be passed to encompass
all federal efforts to maintain the current number of wetlands,
including restoration of wetlands as well as efforts to slow wetland
losses. This Act also should require the Army Corps of Engineers to
classify wetlands according to their ecological value so that the
nation's economic resources are not squandered on land that is of
little ecological significance. Moreover, it may be unnecessary to
limit the private development of wetlands at all in light of new
evidence that the nation likely will gain almost 60,000 net acres of
wetlands due to increased restoration. Congress can answer the charges
of unfairness by landowners who have seen their life savings destroyed
by onerous wetlands regulations simply by requiring the government to
pay for the value of the land it takes.

<P>Although the Clean Water Act never was designed as a vehicle to
protect wetlands, it has evolved into a regulatory nightmare for
ordinary Americans who simply want to use their land as they intended
when they took out a mortgage on their property. If Americans still
believe in the basic concepts upon which this nation was built --
liberty, opportunity, and the right to reap the rewards of hard effort
-- they must reverse the current wetland policy of essentially
confiscating land from the nation's most productive and valuable
citizens.

INTRODUCTION<P>
      George Bush signed the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) last December 17.  If approved by Congress, this trade pact
will link the United States, Mexico, and Canada into the world's
largest free trade zone.  Bill Clinton has expressed support for the
agreement, but he faces considerable opposition in the Congress,
primarily from his own Democratic Party.  NAFTA will face an up-or-
down vote in the Congress, probably this fall, but certainly no later
than the end of this year.
<P>
      Passage of the NAFTA will be a significant foreign policy test
of the Clinton Administration.  Senator Bill Bradley, the Democrat
from New Jersey, noted last February that the pact will be "the most
important foreign policy decision that Clinton will make in his first
six months in office."  There is more at stake, however, than simply
enhanced trade with Mexico.  The NAFTA will be an important factor in
ensuring that U.S.  businesses remain internationally competitive and
that free trade continues to advance around the world. 
<P>
      Despite the agreement's acknowledged benefits to the U.S. 
economy, many groups oppose free trade in general, and freer trade
with Mexico in particular.  Among these are several labor unions,
environmental organizations, and some industries which favor
protectionism.  Believing that their interests will be harmed by freer
trade with Mexico, these groups try to portray the NAFTA as harmful to
the U.S.  economy as a whole.  They allege that the NAFTA will
increase pollution of the environment, reduce worker safety and wages
in both the U.S.  and Mexico, and cause the loss of U.S.  jobs.
<P>
      In response to these and other criticisms, Clinton has made U.S. 
approval of the NAFTA conditional on the negotiation of additional
"parallel accords" concerning labor and the environment.  Far from
being low-cost remedies to these concerns, however, these agreements
have the potential to undo much of the good created by NAFTA. 
Opponents of free trade have seized upon these parallel agreements as
vehicles by which to reintroduce the trade restrictions NAFTA is
intended to eliminate.
<P>
      The strategy of anti-NAFTA groups is to make increased trade
with Mexico appear to the American public as threatening.  Because
Americans are unlikely to be swayed by appeals for protecting such
special interests as labor unions, environmental groups, and
uncompetitive industries, opponents of NAFTA's free trade provisions
have targeted labor and environmental issues in a campaign to broaden
the appeal of their cause.
<P>
      In their attempts to discredit the NAFTA, trade protectionists
exaggerate the potential harm of the accord while rejecting many of
its benefits.  The disintegration and distortions advanced by these
groups have clouded the NAFTA debate in Congress.  As Congress begins
its consideration of the agreement in the coming months, it will
require clear and concise information on the results of approving the
NAFTA.  Only then can it put aside the pleas for protection by special
interest groups and ideological opponents of free trade and decide
whether NAFTA benefits the country as a whole.
<P>

A PRIMER ON NAFTA:  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
<P>
      Opposition to the NAFTA focuses on its alleged negative effects
on jobs and the environment.  Labor unions worry that freer trade with
Mexico will cause the loss of jobs among their members, and lead to
relaxed worker safety laws.  Environmentalists maintain that
commercial integration between the two countries will lower U.S. 
environmental standards, prompt polluting U.S.  companies to move to
Mexico to avoid strict standards, and lead to massive pollution in
Mexico.  In addition, opponents charge that the agreement was
negotiated in secret, without input from labor, business, and
environmental groups.

THE NAFTA, JOBS, AND THE ECONOMY
<P>
      Among the most commonly expressed questions raised about the
NAFTA and its impact on North America are: 
<P>
Q:    With Mexico so much poorer than the U.S., will expanded trade
      with that country reduce the standard of living of Americans?
<P>
      The reduction of trade barriers around the world since the end
of World War II has brought about enormous increases in trade and
economic activity among the participating countries.  In constructing
this international trading system at the 1948 Bretton Woods
Conference, Democrats and Republicans understood that free trade would
benefit most working Americans.
<P>
      Despite the clear connection between free trade and general
economic prosperity, there will always be groups who believe their
individual interests to be threatened by competition from abroad.  The
traditional free trade opponents were those industries such as
shipping and textiles that profited from government subsidies and
tariffs that protected them against foreign competition.  In addition
to these protected, uncompetitive industries, the opponents of free
trade now include labor unions and organizations whose self-interest
makes them hostile to free trade and market economics in general and
whose message is that, contrary to all evidence, free trade will lead
to a reduction in living standards.
<P>
      These critics are wrong.  The NAFTA will benefit the whole U.S. 
economy.  It will lower costs for consumers on such basic products as
food, clothing, electronics, appliances, and automobiles.  Since these
products require a high labor content in their production, lowering
labor costs will lower the retail price of these goods.  Reducing the
costs of consumer goods not only dampens inflation but also improves
the standard of living of all Americans and makes businesses more
competitive.
<P>
      The NAFTA also will expand U.S.  exports to Mexico, which will
greatly benefit the American economy.  Mexico already is America's
third largest trading partner, after Japan and Canada, and is growing
rapidly.  U.S.  exports to Mexico are heavily weighted toward the
high-value, high-technology products that are the foundation of future
U.S.  growth.  Growth in exports has been one of the major factors in
U.S.  economic growth over the past decade and a source of much of the
past and future job creation.  The U.S.  Department of Commerce
estimates 19,100 U.S.  jobs are created for every $1.0 billion
increase in U.S.  merchandise exports.  The NAFTA will lower Mexico's
trade barriers even further, ensuring that U.S.  exports to that
country will continue to increase.
<P>
Q:    Since the Mexican economy is so small, how can it become a
      sizeable market for U.S.  products?
<P>
      Although the Mexican economy is small compared to that of the
U.S., total U.S.-Mexico trade in 1992 was $73 billion (compared to
U.S.-German trade with $50 billion and U.S.-China trade with $33
billion), with $40.6 billion in U.S.  exports producing a surplus of
$6.8 billion.y (Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Jeffrey J.  Schott, NAFTA:  An
Assessment (Washington, D.C.:  Institute for International Economics,
1993), p.  14.)  By comparison, the U.S.  had a trade deficit with
China of $17.1 billion.
<P>
      U.S.  merchandise exports to Mexico support 611,000 American
jobs.  The Institute for International Economics, a non-partisan
research group that studies the effects of trade on the U.S.  economy,
projects that by 1995, over 1 million U.S.  jobs will be dependent on
U.S.  exports to Mexico.  The NAFTA is expected to spur growth in the
Mexican economy from between 3.5 percent and 6 percent annually during
the next ten years.
<P>
      Because Mexico will continue to buy most of its imports from the
U.S., opportunities for U.S.  business will grow as Mexico's economy
grows.  Currently, 73 percent of Mexico's imports come from the United
States.  In contrast, Hong Kong buys only 8.1 percent of its imports
from the U.S., Japan 22.9 percent, and Germany only 7.5 percent.  Each
Mexican purchases $300 worth of products every year from the U.S.,
compared to $30 of European imports.  The NAFTA will only add to the
advantages enjoyed by U.S.  businesses in Mexico.  Because the NAFTA
will reduce tariffs and restrictions on U.S.  and Canadian imports
into Mexico, while retaining them on imports from countries outside
the free trade zone, U.S.  businesses will see their competitive
advantage enhanced by the agreement.
<P>
Q:    How can an economy as underdeveloped as Mexico's help U.S. 
      businesses become more globally competitive, especially against
      East Asia?  Will a free trade pact with Mexico slow down the
      U.S.  economy?
<P>
      Far from being a threat to U.S.  prosperity, the disparity in
wage rates with Mexico (Mexican unskilled and semi-skilled wages are
seven times lower than in the U.S.) affords an important opportunity
for U.S.  businesses to become more competitive internationally by
emulating some of the successful practices of their East Asian
competitors.  Given the relatively high U.S.  wages, U.S.  industries
cannot adequately compete with foreign companies which use cheap
unskilled labor.  Unlike the U.S., such advanced industrial countries
in Asia as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have adjusted to competition
from labor-intensive, unskilled manufacturers in developing countries
like Mexico and Malaysia through a scheme known as "co-production."
<P>
      The manufacturing process is split between highly skilled
workers in the advanced countries and low-skilled workers in
developing countries, such as the People's Republic of China, the
Philippines, and Singapore.  This arrangement has allowed the advanced
East Asian countries to dominate global markets and rapidly expand
their own economies by lowering labor costs in the production of
goods.  Much of these countries' often-alleged "unfair advantage"
comes from their intelligent use of these resources to adapt to the
highly competitive environment of the international market.
<P>
      The U.S.  has been less successful than Japan and Taiwan at co-
production, mainly because there have been few developing countries
close to home whose economies complemented that of the U.S.  and which
were sufficiently open to allow easy operations.  The NAFTA will help
U.S.  companies co-produce more efficiently by combining operations in
the U.S.  and Mexico.  This will occur because of the more stable
business environment the NAFTA will create for U.S.  business
operating in Mexico.
<P>
      Those who oppose expanding such operations in Mexico, saying
they "export jobs," ignore a simple fact:  U.S.  operations will move
somewhere else if Mexico is closed to them, principally to East Asia,
with far less positive results for the U.S.  economy. 
<P>
      When American companies transfer part of their operations to
Mexico, most of their work force stays in the U.S., particularly in
administration, sales, warehousing, and components manufacturing.  For
instance, Ford Motor Company operates an assembly plant in Hermosillo,
Mexico, which produces small cars and engines for the U.S.  and
Mexican markets.  Over 75 percent of the components used at that plant
are produced in the U.S.y (Paul A.  London and Jonathan Whittle,
"Investment, Trade, and U.S.  Gains in the NAFTA" (Washington, D.C.: 
U.S.  Council of the Mexico-U.S.  Business Committee, 1992), p.  24.) 
Without this plant, Ford would be forced to produce these cars in Asia
or Europe, with practically no materials or services used in their
production coming from the U.S. 
<P>
      Investment by U.S.  companies in Mexico also increases U.S. 
exports.  For example, U.S.-Mexican joint ventures on average buy 51
percent of their materials and services from the U.S.  By contrast,
when U.S.  industries locate their operations in Pacific Rim countries
or in Europe, U.S.  firms supply only an average of 13 percent of the
materials and services to those companies.
<P>
      By making Mexico a more attractive investment opportunity than
East Asia, the NAFTA will encourage U.S.  companies that have already
moved assembly plants to faraway countries like Malaysia to relocate
to Mexico.  Once in Mexico, most of these assembly plants will benefit
the U.S.  economy by buying their components from U.S.  companies
instead of from East Asian suppliers, thereby providing more jobs for
U.S.  parts manufacturers, research and development, transportation
and shipping firms, and marketing companies.
<P>
Q:    Should not the U.S.  government be protecting workers from
      losing their jobs as a result of the NAFTA?  
<P>
      Like other industrialized nations, the U.S.  is confronted with
ever-increasing global economic competition.  Since World War II, the
wages of U.S.  workers have increased dramatically compared to those
of workers in the developing world.  Given this wage disparity for
unskilled labor, the U.S.  is faced with two choices:  It can
encourage American companies to focus on higher technology production
where the U.S.  has a comparative advantage, or it can provide
government protection in the form of higher tariffs and import quotas
for industries that employ large numbers of unskilled workers.  If the
U.S.  government chooses the second alternative, it will: 
<P>
1)    raise costs to U.S.  consumers; 
<P>
2)    encourage retaliation by other countries against U.S.  exports; 
<P>
3)    increase costs for U.S.  companies that use imports in their
      manufacturingprocesses and render them less globally
      competitive; and 
<P>
4)    ensure that the protected industries become ever more
      uncompetitive. 
<P>
      The temptation to use the government to protect inefficient
industries from competition should be resisted because for every
uncompetitive sector that is protected, the economy as a whole
suffers.  Government protection of threatened industries may help
small groups of people temporarily, but the costs, ultimately born by
the American consumer and the unprotected workers, are quite large.
<P>
      During the 1980s, for example, the steel industry received
government protection from foreign competition in the form of tariffs
and import quotas, ostensibly to protect an estimated 18,000 jobs
threatened by less expensive imported steel.  This protectionism
raised the cost of domestic and imported steel.  Many U.S. 
manufacturers that used steel in their production could not buy cheap
raw steel from abroad, raising the final cost of their products. 
These U.S.  manufacturers lost sales, costing 52,400 jobs in U.S. 
steel-related industries during the 1980s.y (Arthur T.  Denzau, "Can
Trade Protectionism Save Jobs," Center for the Study of American
Business, April 1987, p.  5.)  The U.S.  International Trade
Commission estimates quotas and tariffs on textiles and steel cost
consumers an additional $168,700 in 1988 dollars for every U.S.  job
saved by the protectionist measures.y (International Trade Commission,
"Economic Effects on U.S.  Imports Restraints:  Phase 1: 
Manufacturing," Pub.  2222, October 1989, p.  8.)  According to the
U.S.  General Accounting Office, the system of "voluntary" quotas the
U.S.  imposes on the Japanese automobiles costs American consumers
over $190,000 for every U.S.  job saved.  Clearly, the costs of
protectionism to the economy as a whole far outweigh any benefits to
individuals. 
<P>
      In contrast, the NAFTA, by facilitating co-production, will help
U.S.  companies to remain competitive in what they do best:  producing
high-technology goods and services for export and domestic use.  With
a more stable business environment in Mexico, U.S.  companies can have
many of their products assembled in Mexico for export abroad.  Those
who would erect artificial barriers in an attempt to protect
uncompetitive industries in the U.S.  would succeed only in reducing
the prospects for economic growth for everyone.
<P>
Q:    Will there be a massive loss of jobs as U.S.  companies move
      south in search of cheaper labor?
<P>
      During the presidential campaign, Ross Perot referred to a
"great sucking sound" being made as companies were pulled into Mexico,
attracted by cheaper labor.y (The Wall Street Journal, January 15,
1993, p.  A16.)  Nevertheless, in spite of dire warnings by Perot and
other opponents of the NAFTA, virtually all economists agree the NAFTA
will produce a net increase of U.S.  jobs over the next decade.y (For
the most recent study on job growth under the NAFTA, see Hufbauer and
Schott, op.  cit.)  By increasing opportunities for exports to Mexico,
the NAFTA will generate jobs throughout the entire economy.  And, as
more U.S.  companies engage in co-production, more U.S.  jobs will be
created as the American companies become more competitive in the
international market. 
<P>
      To be sure, some U.S.  companies will move a portion of labor-
intensive operations like the assembly of components to Mexico to take
advantage of the unskilled and semi-skilled labor.  The labor needed
to manufacture textiles, shoes, some glassware, and other labor-
intensive industries is too expensive in the U.S.  for them to remain
competitive.  But for most U.S.  industries, especially those upon
which the future growth and competitiveness of the U.S.  economy rest,
and which require highly skilled and trained workers, Mexican labor
will hold few attractions.
<P>
Q:    Will Mexico's lower labor costs depress wages in the United
      States?  
<P>
      If the NAFTA is approved, Mexico's economic modernization will
accelerate.  Since approximately 80 percent of all the capital
equipment Mexico buys is made in the U.S., U.S.  export industries are
likely to expand production and hire more U.S.  workers.  These
companies will not be tempted to relocate to Mexico because that
country's work force and infrastructure are not capable of supporting
high-technology production.  As Mexico grows, the demand for skilled
manufacturing in the U.S.  will grow, placing upward pressure on U.S. 
wages.
<P>
      Mexico is one of the fastest growing markets for U.S.  goods. 
The NAFTA will increase that market by forcing Mexico to lower trade
barriers that are on average 2.5 times higher than those in the U.S. 
The reduction in barriers by Mexico over the last several years has
resulted in a $6.8 billion trade surplus for the U.S.  in 1992.  That
surplus is projected to continue for the next fifteen to twenty years
as Mexico requires capital equipment to modernize, which will create
U.S.  jobs in export industries.
<P>
      President Clinton promised repeatedly in his campaign to expand
high-wage jobs for U.S.  workers.  Without a NAFTA, those high-wage
jobs will be more difficult to create because U.S.  businesses will
not be able to export to Mexico as easily as before.  Neither will
they be able to increase their efficiency through co-production
schemes in Mexico.  Japan's business sector not only has maintained
its generous wage levels but actually increased them through its high-
technology exports and its relocation of low-technology, low-paying
manufacturing jobs to developing countries like Malaysia and
Singapore.  This strategy has allowed Japanese companies to stay
competitive and reinvest in research and development and high-
technology production at home.
<P>
      Trade between the U.S.  and Mexico, up 200 percent since 1987,
will increase even more under the NAFTA, providing more U.S.  jobs in
such businesses as shipping, trucking, warehousing, and retailing that
will service the growing commercial base.  Increased sales to Mexico,
in turn, will cause U.S.  wages to rise. 
<P>
      For instance, the advanced countries of the European Economic
Community did not experience lower wages when the far less developed
economies of Greece, Portugal, and Spain joined the Community.y
(Michael Porter, The Competitive Advantage of Nations (New York:  The
Free Press, 1990), p.  50.)  Japan's co-production with Malaysia and
Singapore has not slowed the rapidly increasing prosperity of Japanese
workers.
<P>
      Opponents of free trade view international commerce as a fixed
economic pie:  job growth in manufacturing industries in country A
must mean job losses in manufacturing industries in country B. 
Opponents also believe that less expensive labor in one country will
depress wages in a country with more expensive labor, if they are
allowed to trade freely. 
<P>
      These views are mistaken.  Market economies are far more
sophisticated and dynamic than free trade opponents seem to realize. 
Jobs are created when economic activity increases and are lost when it
shrinks; wages respond to the demand for labor.  No modern economy is
static; only by adapting to changing conditions and making use of
opportunities can economies avoid stagnation.  Therefore, the NAFTA
will not only stimulate business activity across the U.S.  economy,
but also offer new business opportunities that will create jobs. 
Economic growth in Mexico will create jobs in export industries in the
U.S.
<P>
Q:    Will the abundant, unskilled labor in Mexico hurt unskilled,
      poorer workers in the U.S.?  
<P>
      In some cases, industries such as apparel and shoe manufacturing
that use high-cost, unskilled or semi-skilled labor will relocate
their assembly operations to Mexico.  However, most unskilled U.S. 
workers are located in the services sector; it employs 80 million
Americans, compared to 19 million in manufacturing.  The poorest
American workers are concentrated in service industries like
restaurants and retail stores.  These industries will not be
threatened by lower Mexican wages.  In fact, since low-wage Mexican
workers will tend to produce cheaper agricultural and consumer goods,
the services industries in the U.S.  that sell these goods will
benefit.
<P>
      In addition, the NAFTA will help reduce competition for
unskilled jobs by illegal immigrants.  Economic growth in Mexico will
remove much of the economic incentive for Mexicans to migrate to the
U.S.  in search of employment.  An estimated 2.5 million to 4 million
illegal immigrants from Mexico now work in the U.S.,y (Telephone
interview with Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 9, 1993.) almost
exclusively in the service sector in areas such as construction, food
services, and agriculture.
<P>
Q:    Why do labor unions oppose the NAFTA so adamantly?
<P>
      United Auto Workers Union President Owen Beiber expressed the
general sentiment of other labor unions about the NAFTA when he said
it was time to "stop tinkering with the damn thing and just say no." 
The Executive Council of the AFL-CIO issued a statement on February 17
calling for rejection of the NAFTA, saying it "would be a disaster for
millions of working people in the United States."y (Statement by the
AFL-CIO Executive Council on The North American Free Trade Agreement,
Bal Harbour, Florida, February 17, 1993.) 
<P>
      Although most labor unions resoundingly oppose the NAFTA, most
union workers stand to benefit from the agreement.  For example, while
the International Trade Commission estimates a 5 percent decrease in
automobile manufacturing in the next ten to fifteen years under the
NAFTA, the same study estimates a growth of 6 percent to 15 percent in
automotive parts exports during that period.y (International Trade
Commission, "Potential Impact on the U.S.  Economy and Selected
Industries of the North American Free Trade Agreement," Report to the
Committee on Ways and Means of the United States House of
Representative and the Committee on Finance of the United States
Senate, U.S.I.T.C Publication 2596, January 1993, p.  2-8.)
<P>
      Certain apparel industries may move south, but the textile
industry is projected to increase exports by 13 percent under NAFTA. 
Unions in the service sector, such as the Teamsters, will benefit from
the agreement because of increases in cross-border trucking and
warehousing.  Even in the areas that will experience job loss, the
loss is minor, such as 6 percent to 15 percent loss in flat glass and
major household appliance manufacturing, and less than 5 percent over
the long term in the U.S.  automotive industry.y (Ibid.)   
<P>
      Most surprising is labor union opposition to an agreement that
will spur growth in export industries where most high-wage jobs are
located.  The International Trade Commission estimates that workers in
export manufacturing industries earn wages 17 percent higher than
workers in non-export related manufacturing.  Estimates are the U.S. 
will have a $7 billion to $9 billion trade surplus with Mexico by
1995.  That means an estimated 200,000 to 350,000 additional jobs in
U.S.  export industries.y ("Guide to the North American Free Trade
Agreement:  What It Means for U.S.  Business," U.S.  Chamber of
Commerce, International Division, 1992, p.  25.)
<P>
      Of larger concern to the unions should be U.S.  economic
competitiveness.  Union jobs in uncompetitive industries cannot long
survive without government assistance, which eventually dooms an
industry to hopeless inefficiency.  Job security, as well as standards
of living, rest directly upon finding ways of enhancing the
competitiveness of U.S.  business.  Without a NAFTA, however, U.S. 
industries will have difficulty co-producing like the Japanese and
Europeans.  This could lead to much larger losses of jobs in the
medium to long term, as foreign businesses gain a larger share of the
U.S.  market at the expense of inefficient U.S.  producers. 
Industries will also have a harder time exporting to countries like
Mexico if those countries maintain high trade barriers.
<P>
Q:    Will NAFTA expand maquiladora industries, causing greater loss
      of U.S.  jobs?
<P>
      U.S.  companies have been operating assembly co-production or
maquiladora -- plants along the U.S.-Mexico border since 1965.  Under
the maquiladora program, components made in the U.S.  are sent to
Mexico for assembly, utilizing Mexico's less expensive labor.  The
finished products are then sent back to the U.S.  or exported abroad. 
Despite frequent charges that the maquiladora program has hurt the
U.S.  economy, it has not caused a net loss of U.S.  jobs.  To the
contrary, by reducing labor costs, this program has allowed
manufacturers to remain globally competitive and keep their U.S. 
plants operating.
<P>
      During the early 1970s, U.S.  corporations faced stiff
competition from foreign companies exporting cheaper goods to the U.S. 
With the U.S.  paying relatively high wages for unskilled labor, U.S. 
companies that used high percentages of unskilled labor in their
production processes found it hard to compete against these foreign
providers.  To stay in business U.S.  companies were forced to move
the labor-intensive part of their production to countries where labor
was less expensive.  Most of this co-production in Mexico takes place
in the maquiladora program.
<P>
      Co-production with Mexico has helped many U.S.  companies face
international competition and increase exports.  For instance, the
Mexico-based Trasgo Group is working with U.S.-based Tyson Foods
Company in the growing and packaging of poultry products, 50 percent
of which is being sold in Japan.  General Motors' Packard Electric
Division assembles sophisticated components that are produced in its
Ohio and Mississippi plants and assembled in plants throughout Mexico. 
The Company has remained internationally competitive only by lowering
labor costs on the unskilled portion of its manufacturing.  AT&T has
several facilities in Mexico for manufacturing and phone equipment
repair.  AT&T plans to shift its Asian supply base to Mexico,
providing components manufacturing jobs in the U.S.  Moving facilities
to Mexico will help AT&T produce for the U.S./Mexico market and
beyond.y (London and Whittle, op.  cit., p.  24.)
<P>
      The NAFTA will eliminate maquiladora rules that prevent U.S. 
companies from selling in Mexico the products they assemble there. 
Formerly, maquiladoras could sell only 20 percent of their products in
Mexico.y (U.S.  Department of Labor, "Economic Discussion Paper #29,"
August 1988, p.  17.)  Under the NAFTA, U.S.  companies with
maquiladoras can sell 100 percent of their products in the Mexican
market. 
<P>
Q:    Will NAFTA make it easier for Mexico to flood the U.S.  with
      goods? 
<P>
      NAFTA opponents paint a grim picture of truckloads of cheap
Mexican products heading north, flooding U.S.  markets and putting
U.S.  producers of similar goods out of work.  Freer trade with Mexico
in the past four years, however, has demonstrated the reverse to be
true.  As barriers to trade have been removed, the U.S.  has exported
more to Mexico than it imported.  Under the NAFTA, these barriers will
fall even farther and U.S.  exports will continue to grow.  Because
Mexican tariffs to U.S.  goods are 2.5 times greater than U.S. 
tariffs on Mexican goods, U.S.  exporters will benefit from trade more
than their Mexican counterparts.  The majority of U.S.  exports to
Mexico are in automotive parts, telecommunications equipment,
electronic components, processed foods, and basic grains, which
currently are subjected to Mexican import quotas and tariffs that
raise the costs of these goods from 10 percent to 20 percent.
<P>
      Currently, only 17.9 percent of U.S.  goods enter Mexico without
tariffs.  Once NAFTA becomes law, half of U.S.  exports will enter
Mexico duty-free.  After five years, under the NAFTA, 67 percent of
U.S.  exports will be duty-free.  That percentage rises to 80 after
ten years.y (International Trade Commission, "Potential Impact," p. 
104.)  The apocalyptic scenarios by opponents seem especially
exaggerated because the U.S.  has had trade surpluses with Mexico for
the past three years.  Those surpluses are widely projected to
continue as Mexico imports U.S.  capital equipment needed to modernize
its economy.  Although Mexico has in the past attempted to restrict
such imports, it will be forbidden to do so under the NAFTA. 
<P>
      The NAFTA also removes non-tariff barriers to U.S.  exports. 
For instance, today U.S.  auto makers need import licenses to sell
U.S.-produced cars in Mexico.  U.S.  auto makers with auto assembly
plants in Mexico have also been under restrictions, known as export
quotas, that require U.S.  automobile companies with plants in Mexico
to export $2 of automotive products for every $1 of U.S.  automotive
products imported into Mexico.y (Hufbauer and Schott, op.  cit., p. 
39.)  These restrictions are also eliminated under the NAFTA, giving
U.S.  auto makers greater flexibility to export to Mexico from U.S. 
plants.
<P>
Q:    Will freer trade with Mexico benefit only the Southeastern
      states while hurting the industrial states of the Northeast and
      Midwest?
<P>
      Almost all fifty states have substantially increased their
exports to Mexico in the last five years as Mexican barriers to trade
have dropped.  In Arkansas, exports to Mexico grew 154 percent from
1987 to 1991.  In Michigan 31,000 jobs depend on exports to Mexico;
from 1987 to 1991 exports to Mexico rose 51 percent.y (U.S.  Exports
to Mexico:  A State-by-State Overview 1987-1991 (U.S.  Department of
Commerce, International Trade Administration, July 1992), p.  32.) 
Surprisingly, many Members of Congress who oppose the NAFTA, such as
Congressman Donald Pease of Ohio, and Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell of Maine, come from states which have experienced net gains
in employment because of growing U.S.  exports to Mexico.  For
example, Ohio Senator Howard Metzenbaum is opposed to the NAFTA; but
between 1987 and 1991 his state's exports to Mexico increased 137
percent to $582 million.  Over the same period, New York's exports to
Mexico increased 73 percent, providing new jobs for thousands of
workers.  Mexico represents the third largest export market for
Illinois, Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania, and the second largest
market for Maine, New Hampshire, and Ohio.  Mexico is the largest
export market for California and Texas.  Pennsylvania Senator Harris
Wofford's election platform included an anti-NAFTA stance; yet
Pennsylvania's exports to Mexico have climbed 283 percent since 1987
to $694 million in 1991, creating approximately 9,000 additional jobs
for Pennsylvania workers.y (For a more comprehensive state-by-state
analysis on exports to Mexico, see ibid.)
<P>
PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT UNDER THE NAFTA
<P>
Q:    Will American companies move to Mexico to avoid strict
      environmental laws in the U.S.?
<P>
      Almost all environmental and labor groups argue that lax
environmental enforcement and lower standards in Mexico give an unfair
advantage to companies based there.  Lower standards, they say, will
encourage U.S.  companies to reduce environmental compliance costs by
moving their factories to Mexico.
<P>
      Such criticism, however, overlooks a number of facts. 
<P>
1)    Mexico's environmental laws and regulations are roughly equal to
      those in the U.S.  In fact, the Mexican environmental agency,
      Secretaria del Desarrollo Urbano y Ecologia (SEDUE), is adopting
      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards wholesale; 
<P>
2)    Most multinational companies already follow U.S.  environmental
      standards when operating in Mexico; and 
<P>
3)    For most industries, the difference in environmental compliance
      costs between Mexico and the U.S.  is not substantial.
<P>
      For example, Mexican laws regulating the transportation of
cross-border toxic waste are equivalent to those in the U.S.  Mexican
regulations require any U.S.  company locating within 62 miles (100
kilometers) of the U.S.-Mexico border to comply with all EPA standards
on the disposal of toxic wastes.  Under new Mexican environmental
laws, any U.S.  company using toxic materials in Mexican plants must
dispose of these materials and their waste by-products by shipping
them back to the U.S.
<P>
      SEDUE's civil penalties for violations include plant closure, up
to $80,000 in fines for first-time violators, and administrative
arrest of company officials for up to 36 hours; criminal penalties
include up to six years in prison.  Mexican environmental regulators
also have policing powers that their U.S.  counterparts regulators do
not.  Although enforcement of Mexico's environmental laws has not been
perfect, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has shown a strong
commitment to environmental protection since taking office. 
Government expenditures for environmental enforcement have increased
1,800 percent to $1.8 billion in 1991. 
<P>
      In some specific cases, U.S.  companies have relocated to Mexico
for environmental reasons.  However, this has usually been in response
to draconian environmental regulations on air emissions in U.S. 
cities rather than lax standards in Mexico.  For instance, several
furniture makers based in the Los Angeles area basin moved their
facilities to Tijuana, Mexico, when new rules by the state and local
governments placed extremely low limits on the use of solvent-based
paint and stain emissions.  Although many of those companies moved to
Tijuana, some relocated to neighboring states like Arizona and Nevada. 
According to a study by the U.S.  Trade Representative's Inter-Agency
Task Force, this relocation was not part of a general flight of U.S. 
industry to Mexico to avoid general environmental standards.y ("Review
of U.S.-Mexico Environmental Issues," Prepared by an Inter-Agency Task
Force Coordinated by the Office of the United States Trade
Representative, Draft, October 1991, p.  194.  (The Trade Policy Staff
of the Inter-Agency Task Force, during six public hearings held from
August 20 to September 11, 1991, gathered data on the alleged movement
of U.S.  companies to Mexico for environmental reasons.  They found
these allegations to be untrue, except in the specific case of
furniture refinishing companies relocating from Los Angeles to Mexico
and other U.S.  states.))
<P>
      Most U.S.  companies have little incentive to move south to
avoid strict U.S.  environmental standards because Mexico operates by
those same standards.  According to this Task Force study, "U.S. 
firms, particularly the larger multinational firms most likely to
undertake large process industry investments [in Mexico], often hold
subsidiaries to a worldwide standard, usually at least as high as
standards with which they must comply in the U.S."y (Ibid., p.  195.) 
An example is Ford Motor Company, which has a policy of applying U.S. 
environmental practices in its automotive manufacturing plants in
Mexico.
<P>
Q:    Will economic growth in Mexico lead to more environmental
      degradation in that country, and North America generally?
<P>
      Some environmental groups oppose the NAFTA because it will
promote economic growth in Mexico.  These critics are against economic
development because of the increase of pollution that development
brings.  Thus, they believe the best way of improving the environment
is to prevent economic growth from taking place. 
<P>
      Environmental critics of the NAFTA misunderstand the
relationship between economic development and a clean environment. 
Without economic growth, Mexico can never adequately address its
environmental problems.  As countries become wealthier, the priorities
of their people change from subsistence living to such quality of life
concerns as environmental protection.  That is why every
industrialized country spends a far greater percentage of its GDP on
environmental protection than any underdeveloped country.  When the
choice is between jobs and stricter environmental standards, poorer
countries choose jobs.
<P>
      When Mexican companies were heavily debt-ridden and on the verge
of bankruptcy during the 1980s, it was difficult for the government to
force compliance with environmental regulations.  The reason:  the
government feared throwing people out of work by closing polluting
factories.  Only with economic growth does sustained environmental
improvement become possible.
<P>
      Of 42 countries analyzed in a recent Princeton University study,
pollution levels began to decrease in those with per capita GDP rising
above $4,000 to $5,000.  Mexico, with a current per capita GDP of
$3,700, already is beginning to devote larger resources toward
environmental purposes.  Example:  a 200 percent increase in
environmental inspectors since 1989.  This process will continue as
the economy grows.  Unfortunately, Mexico's growth would be stalled
without the NAFTA, postponing future environmental protection.
<P>
Q:    Is extensive government regulation necessary to protect the
      North American environment?  
<P>
      Economic growth is not inherently harmful to the environment;
pervasive government intervention in industry and commerce is. 
Surprisingly, some U.S.  labor and environmental groups are promoting
traditional protectionism as the best way to avert further
environmental degradation in Mexico.  For instance, labor groups are
advocating placing tariffs on goods produced in Mexican factories that
have lower environmental standards than those in the U.S.
<P>
      Mexico, like many socialist countries in Eastern Europe, has
learned that planned economies and authoritarian governments have
created far more seriously degraded environments than their free
market, democratic counterparts.  For most of the period since the
1930s, Mexico has been ruled by an authoritarian, quasi-socialist
government.  The economy was subjected to central planning and
control, and the Mexican government protected domestic industries
through high import tariffs, quotas, and licensing.  The government
also created an enormously burdensome system of rules and regulations
to shield workers from exploitation, control production, and direct
resources to government priorities.
<P>
      The result of this legacy was not only economic ruin but
environmental degradation.  Protectionism and overregulation made
domestic industries inefficient and wasteful, impoverished the country
as a whole, and discouraged private investment.  Without new capital,
antiquated polluting factories could not be replaced with more modern,
cleaner ones.  Nationalized or heavily regulated industries also had
little reason to obey existing environmental laws, since the
government was loath to punish its own companies or companies it so
closely directed.
<P>
      Inefficient production eventually led to excessive pollution in
Mexico.  For example, 76 percent of the air pollution in Mexico City
comes from automobiles using low-grade leaded gasoline refined by the
inefficiently run, government-owned oil monopoly PEMEX.  Most of the
remaining 24 percent of the air pollution in Mexico City comes from
factories, two-thirds of which were controlled or owned by the
government before privatization began five years ago.
<P>
      Now environmentalists and labor unions wish to create a complex
set of regulations as part of the NAFTA.  They argue that only the
government has the detached interest and expertise needed to set
priorities, direct private funds, and mandate industry practices and
procedures in order to protect the environment.  There is no evidence,
however, that new central planning of North America's production and
commerce will protect the environment.  In fact, the U.S.  government
has a lackluster record of protecting the environment through complex
regulations.  For example, the environmental Superfund, designed to
assist in toxic waste cleanups has produced steady employment for
lawyers, accountants, and consultants, while failing to adequately
address environmental cleanup.  Additional government intervention is
most likely to lead to further wasteful spending without a
commensurate improvement in the environment. 
<P>
Q:    Will the maquiladora industry simply expand under the NAFTA,
      causing more pollution along the U.S.-Mexico border?
<P>
      Some environmentalists charge that the maquiladora industry has
ruined the environment along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexican border.  They
argue that NAFTA would spread this problem throughout Mexico by
encouraging maquiladora-type operations throughout the entire country.
<P>
      There are two main environmental problems plaguing the border
region:  a lack of sewage systems and other infrastructure to service
the population, and facilities and resources to dispose of and clean
up contaminants dumped into the environment by industry.  Both of
these problems result from the tax codes under which the maquiladora
program operates, not the development resulting from the maquiladora
program.
<P>
      For example, under existing laws, local authorities have little
power to tax industry involved in maquiladora operations.  American
companies can locate in a Mexican state along the border, but are
required to pay taxes only in the U.S.  state where the company is
incorporated.  This has effectively impoverished the Mexican side of
the border region, denying it essential tax revenues from its major
industry with which to build infrastructure, monitor compliance of
environmental regulations, and dispose of industrial waste.
<P>
      Under the NAFTA, however, the preferences that maquiladora
industries in the border region now enjoy relative to other areas in
Mexico will be eliminated.  The Mexican federal system and the states
in the U.S.  will be able to set their own taxes.  This will provide
municipalities and regional governments with the funds to build the
sewage systems, waste dumps, and water purification systems they need.

<P>
RULE OF LAW, SOVEREIGNTY, AND PARTICIPATION UNDER THE AGREEMENT
<P>

Q:    Will cross-border commercial disputes under the NAFTA be decided
      in a way that infringes on U.S.  sovereignty?  
<P>
      Liberal and conservative critics of the NAFTA charge that the
agreement infringes on national sovereignty and limits local power to
control laws, enforce environmental standards, and uphold health and
safety regulations.  For instance, Ralph Nader's Public Citizen group
alleges that the NAFTA will prevent local governments from setting
limits on pesticide use or regulations on how milk is processed.
<P>
      However, NAFTA dispute mechanisms will give U.S.  citizens and
businesses more direct participation in resolving commercial,
environmental, and investment disputes between the three countries, by
allowing them their day in court.
<P>
      The NAFTA rules for settling commercial disputes arising under
the agreement are similar to those of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement (FTA) of 1988.  Under the FTA, regular cross-border
commercial disputes are settled by either country's domestic courts. 
The free trade agreement with Canada does not limit domestic control
over these types of commercial disputes.  The same is true of the
NAFTA.  Under the NAFTA, traditional commercial disputes will be
handled by the courts that would naturally have jurisdiction in such
cases -- depending on the type of commercial activity and the
jurisdiction the parties had agreed to in advance.
<P>
      The U.S.-Canada agreement mandates the creation of expert panels
to determine whether a government's laws, regulations, and policies
violate its rules.  These panels are made up of experts appointed by
each country.  The NAFTA also requires the creation of similar panels
to decide NAFTA-related disputes.  However, as with the FTA, the NAFTA
panels do not have the power to force a country to abide by its
decisions.  For instance, in the case of countervailing duty and anti-
dumping disputes, a party can challenge a panel decision by requesting
a special review panel.  If the party's government objects to the
finding of the review panel, it can suspend the binational panel
system entirely.  Despite this lack of enforcement power, these panels
have worked smoothly and effectively to resolve trade disputes.
<P>
      State, local, and national governments are free to set higher
environmental, health, and safety standards of their own under the
NAFTA.  Such standards can only be challenged through NAFTA panels if
they are based on political rather than scientific considerations or
discriminate against imports.  Thus, the power to enforce U.S.  laws,
regulations, and standards through domestic courts ultimately remains
in the hands of domestic national, state, and local governments. 
<P>
      The dispute panels, in turn, will help U.S.  companies seek
redress for violations of the law in Mexico and Canada that
traditionally have been difficult to obtain.  For instance, conflicts
arising over lax enforcement in protecting such intellectual property
as patents will be decided by panels created under the NAFTA.  This
will help U.S.  companies recoup the approximately $900 million they
lose annually because of non-existent or lax enforcement of
intellectual property rights in Canada and Mexico.y (Exact figures on
past losses are unavailable.  However, the International Trade
Commission estimates that in 1986 U.S.  companies lost $533 million to
Mexico and $367 million in Canada due to non-enforcement of
intellectual property rights.)
<P>
Q:    Will citizens be prohibited from participating in the judicial
      process in disputes that arise under the NAFTA?
<P>
      Ideological opponents of the NAFTA, such as the Alliance for
Responsible Trade and the Citizen Trade Campaign, have called the
dispute resolution mechanisms in the NAFTA undemocratic and secretive
because these allegedly do not provide the "broadest possible
participation by workers, consumers, environmentalists, and human
rights organizations."y (Letter to Members of Congress from the
Alliance For Responsible Trade/Citizen Trade Campaign, December 15,
1992.)
<P>
      However, NAFTA commissions and panels review only disputes
arising out of interpretations of the agreement itself.  NAFTA
commissions will not review regular commercial disputes between
companies.  The vast majority of commercial disputes will be decided
by the domestic courts of the country which have jurisdiction over the
dispute.  The NAFTA will not change the long-standing tradition of
commercial law.  Both legal systems (America's common law and Mexico's
civil or code-based law) allow only those parties whose involvement
gave rise to the dispute to be directly involved in the judicial
process.  If numerous parties, each with separate grievances, were
allowed to participate in the same judicial proceeding, the government
could not narrow the issues being adjudicated or ever come to a final
decision based in law.  Since the NAFTA dispute panels will have the
right to assess penalties against a company, the issues in a dispute
need to be narrowly defined by law.  So, too, should the parties that
can participate in the dispute.     
<P>
      Balancing the grievances of numerous groups is a challenge more
appropriately addressed by legislatures, not courts.  To allow an
open-ended participation "for cases involving challenges to social
legislation"y (Ibid.) would turn the judicial process into a purely
political one.  Although parties not directly involved in a judicial
proceeding may be harmed by a court's decision, using the judicial
process to address their grievances would weaken the rule of law in
commercial disputes, and make a mockery of stable commercial
transactions.  This, in turn, would reduce commercial activity between
the two countries. 
<P>
Q:    Was the NAFTA negotiated hastily, in secret, with little or
      noparticipation by citizens groups, unions, or Congress?
<P>
      The NAFTA was negotiated by the Bush Administration under "fast
track" authority given it by Congress.  In giving the President fast
track authority, Congress agrees in advance to either approve or
reject the negotiated agreement as a whole, without amendments.  Fast
track negotiating procedures, authorized in the 1974 Trade Act, have
given several Presidents the power to conclude trade agreements that
would not later be unravelled by the Congress.
<P>
      Some special interest groups, however, oppose fast track
authority because it limits their ability to influence Congress. 
Thus, apparel and shoe manufacturers, and many unions which seek
protection from foreign competition, argue that the NAFTA was
negotiated in secret with little participation by groups affected by
the accord.
<P>
      In fact, fast track procedures required the Administration to
work closely with Congress, labor, business, and environmental groups
during the course of the negotiations.  Months before formal
negotiations began between the U.S.  and Mexico in July 1991, Congress
held a series of hearings on the NAFTA where all issues were presented
by groups opposing and supporting the agreement.  Congressional
opponents of the agreement like Congressman Richard Gephardt, the
Democrat from Missouri, made their preferences known to the
Administration at that time. 
<P>
      Fast track procedures do not produce secret negotiations. 
Because they are rules that Congress has imposed on itself, fast track
procedures do not limit congressional power to control trade issues,
and can be overridden at any time.  These procedures simply limit the
ability of special interest groups with well-financed lobbying efforts
to undermine an agreement that would be acceptable to Congress as a
whole.
<P>
Q:    Should the agreement be renegotiated since a new President will
      have to implement the agreement?
<P>
      Now that the White House is occupied by a new President, NAFTA
opponents are portraying the agreement as a Republican accord that
must be renegotiated to accommodate the new policies of Bill Clinton. 
However, free trade in general and the NAFTA in particular are not
partisan issues.  The NAFTA was not planned, debated, or negotiated
along partisan lines.  Some of the strongest NAFTA supporters, such as
former Texas Senator and now Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and New
Mexico Congressman Bill Richardson, are Democrats.  In addition,
President Clinton himself has long supported the agreement.  The U.S. 
needs to demonstrate continuity and reliability in its dealings with
foreign countries on trade issues if its interests are to be
effectively advanced.
<P>
Q:    Should NAFTA incorporate a "social charter" similar to the model
      the European Community has adopted?
<P>
      Some groups opposing free trade are demanding that the Clinton
Administration adopt a European-style social charter through the
parallel negotiations on labor and environmental issues.  A NAFTA that
heavily regulates labor and environmental issues would be an albatross
for U.S.  competitiveness and significantly reduce the level of
potential exports to Mexico from small and medium-sized U.S. 
businesses.  A regulated commercial accord, modeled after Europe's
Social Charter, would also set a bad precedent for future regional
accords and multilateral trade agreements like the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), leading to an overall reduction in global
trade. 
<P>
      Including non-commercial issues into a trade accord provides
protectionists and others who oppose free trade in principle with
endless excuses to raise trade barriers.  Labor relations,
environmental protection, and political reform are far more
complicated for governments to manage than traditional commercial
activities.  The result is usually a trade arrangement that increases
government intervention, regulation, and bureaucracy and decreases the
amount of trade the agreement was intended to encourage.
<P>
      The example of the European Community is instructive.  Although
the European Community set out to create a single market by removing
barriers to trade, the economic benefits of this opening have been
more than offset by the imposition of a heavy regulatory burden in a
wide-ranging social charter that mandates costly standards for labor,
wages, and the environment.  A vast and unelected bureaucracy has
arisen to administer these regulations, armed with extensive
regulatory and enforcement powers.
<P>
      Groups calling for a social charter speak of the virtues of
global environmentalism and worker safety.  Creating enforcement
commissions, citizen's courts, and sanctions for divergent
environmental and labor standards -- the wish list of groups seeking a
social charter -- may appear to be cost-free.  Unfortunately, an
environmental and social charter imposed on North American commerce
will take on a regulatory life of its own, forcing U.S.  business to
waste time and money dealing with expanding regulatory bureaucracies
-- money which would be better spent on investment.  Companies with
little political clout and few Washington lobbyists, especially small
and medium-sized businesses, would be the principal victims.
<P>
      Recent federal overregulation of U.S.  small and medium-sized
businesses provides an illustrative example.  Between 1989 and 1992,
increased environmental, labor, and health regulations imposed by
Congress cost U.S.  business an additional $130 billion.  Small
businesses were hit with a 34 percent increase in government
regulations that significantly slowed job growth in the small business
sector after 1990.  The Congressional Joint Economic Committee called
this federal regulatory intrusiveness "economic crib death." 
Increasing these burdens on U.S.  exporters by imposition of an
ambitious social charter would only further damage U.S. 
competitiveness.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
      The U.S.  and Mexico have had a long and often difficult history
as neighbors.  For the last 150 years, cooperation between the two
countries has been more the exception than the rule.  Today, however,
America and Mexico are entering a new era, one characterized by
increasing cooperation.  By removing the barriers to trade and
investment that limit the growth of both countries, NAFTA will
contribute not only to a cementing of good bilateral relations, but
also to expanding economic opportunity throughout North America.
<P>
      Fortunately, Mexico's modernization coincides with America's
need to remain internationally competitive as it enters the 21st
century.  The world's largest exporter, the U.S.  will rely
increasingly upon international trade for its prosperity, which will
require reducing barriers to trade world-wide.  By creating a free
trade area in North America, the NAFTA will help American industry
grow at home and remain competitive abroad, while also giving a major
boost to global free trade.
<P>
      Despite the fact that all objective studies of the effects of
the NAFTA clearly indicate that it will benefit all three countries,
there is significant political opposition to the agreement in the U.S. 
Although many of the concerns raised are real, much of the opposition
is based upon a desire to protect the special interests of politically
powerful constituencies who are opposed to free trade.
<P>
      There are indeed many problems in both Mexico and the U.S.  that
the agreement does not solve, such as environmental pollution.  But
the best method of addressing these is not through the creation of yet
another regulatory bureaucracy that will inevitably limit economic
growth, but through the increased prosperity that free trade will
bring.
<P>
      While not perfect, the NAFTA is a major step forward from the
existing relationship between Mexico and the U.S.  A rejection of the
NAFTA, or a renegotiation of it to produce more governmental control
of trade, would do little to protect U.S.  jobs or promote
environmental protection.  In fact, a managed North American free
trade zone could be worse than the existing trading system with
Mexico.  It would raise the costs for small and medium-size U.S. 
businesses and limit private resources available for environmental
protection.  Under a managed trade system, power would flow to the
numerous government bureaucrats and industry lawyers that would result
from increases in regulations in order to "manage" trade.
<P>
      The NAFTA is a culmination of two years of close cooperation
between the U.S., Mexican and Canadian governments.  The NAFTA
represents decades of increased trade among the three countries.  Its
creation will put the U.S.  firmly on a more competitive footing with
other industrialized nations into the 21st century.  This will be good
for U.S.  businesses and U.S.  workers alike.

INTRODUCTION 
<P> In the first week of June, an international "Earth summit" will
convene in Rio deJaneiro, Brazil, to discuss environmental issues and
their relationship to economic development. (For an analysis of the
circumstances leading up to the conference see Christopher M. Gacek
and James Malone, "Guidelines for the U.N. Environmental Conference,"
Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 874, January 28, 1992.) The
leaders of the majority of the world's countries are expected to
attend. Last week, President Bush announced that he will attend. 
<P> This summit, formally called the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development, or UNCED, will discuss issues ranging
from the distribution of wealth among nations and women's rights to
deforestation. But the topic that will attract the most attention and
controversy is the claim that the Earth is subject to steady and
potentially damaging rise in temperature -- a phenomenon known as
"global warming" -- and that this condition is in large part a
byproduct of Western industrial growth. 
<P> While recent preparatory negotiations did not include binding
agreements on targets and timetables for reducing emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO2) and other so-called "greenhouse gases," the U.S. will
come under enormous pressure at the conference, from other countries
and many environmental groups, to sign a treaty curbing greenhouse gas
emissions. These greenhouse gases occur in nature but also are caused
by human activity, such as by burning fossil fuels. They are
responsible for making the earth sufficiently warm to permit the
existence of life, and are thus essential. The concern is that the
build-up of these gases in the atmosphere could warm the planet more
than would otherwise be the case, and that this global warming could
lead to adverse changes in the world's ecology. At the extreme, some
environmentalists say, parts of the Earth could become subject to
flooding and tidal waves because of rising sea levels caused by
melting polar ice caps, and drought-induced crop failures could
trigger global famine. 
<P> In spite of these fears, the accumulated scientific data do not
support such dire predictions, showing the cataclysmic results to be
either highly improbable or simply wrong. Moreover, there is enormous
uncertainty associated with the scientific methodology used to predict
future climate changes. Among the difficulties: 
<UL>
      Climate change computer models that predict warming often rely
      on assumptions and simplifications that raise questions about
      their reliability. Example: one model effectively moved the
      Earth's orbit 2 million miles closer to the sun.

<P> Models do not accurately account for the influence of important
      climate factors, such as the behavior and effect of clouds and
      oceans.

<P>      There are shortcomings in the data. Example: temperature records
      over the last century may incorrectly suggest warming because
      many weather stations are close to growing cities.

  <P>    Temperature observations over the last century are inconsistent
      with the predictions of global warming theories.
      
  <P>    A competing theory, based on the hypothesis that solar activity
      may be the major factor in climate change, is more consistent
      with temperature observations in the northern hemisphere during
      the last century.

  <P>    Furthermore, even if most scientists and policy makers were
      convinced that some level of warming is occurring and will
      continue, three questions have to be answered.
 </UL>     
<P>Question #1: Is the Earth warming as a result of human-caused
      greenhouse gases or because of natural phenomena?

<P>Question #2: If the planet is experiencing a major warming trend, 
      in what way will this warming take place? Will the Earth warm 
      up substantially at night with days cooling slightly? Will the
      warming occur in the tropical regions, or only in the high
      latitudes around the poles? Will the warming occur in the summer
      or the winter? These questions are important because a single
      figure suggesting the average temperature of all regions of the
      world for all times of day and night during the entire year is a
      meaningless statistic. It ignores variations amid the warming
      trend that would have very different -- and not necessarily
      harmful -- effects in different regions.

<P>Question #3: What will be the effect of any changes in the climate?
      Will the ocean levels rise, resulting in worldwide flooding? Or
      will they fall, expanding earth's landmass? Will worldwide
      agricultural production increase thanks to more crops in areas
      now too cold for major cultivation -- helping to alleviate world
      hunger -- or will it decrease, prompting famine in some regions?
       
<P> The existing scientific evidence does not give clear answers to
these questions. But the decisions made by policy makers at the United
Nations conference and elsewhere could have enormous implications for
the Earth's inhabitants. Moves to slow down economic growth in the
western industrialized countries, for instance, could have the
unintended effect of slowing economic growth also in the poorest
countries. Indeed, poor countries would be disproportionately
affected.

<P> The economic costs to Americans from enacting policies to
address the perceived problem of global warming would be less
dramatic, yet significant. Consider one proposal -- imposing a "carbon
tax" of $100 per ton, designed to reduce industry's carbon emissions
to the 1990 level by the year 2000. The Congressional Budget Office
estimates this tax would reduce the Gross National Product (GNP) of
America by two percent. This would result in a loss to the economy of
approximately $100 billion per year, or about $1,200 per household.
Further, the increase in unemployment by the year 1997 would be an
estimated 700,000 jobs.

<P> To be sure, if the economic, environmental, and health costs
associated with global warming are as large as some fear, then the
side-effects of reducing CO2 might be smaller compared with the
dangers of inaction. This leads to the question asked by many
environmentalists and policy makers: "Isn't it worth buying an
insurance policy against global warming regardless of cost, since the
consequences could be so severe?" 

<P> This is a reasonable question, but the answer is not necessarily
"Yes." The decision to buy an insurance policy depends not only on the
possible consequences of not doing so, but on the probability of those
consequences. With a high level of uncertainty, such as that
associated with global warming, other measures might be more prudent. 

<P> To determine if the world should buy an expensive insurance
policy against global warming, the probability of harm occurring must
be multiplied by the likely magnitude of the harm. If the resulting
expected harm is higher than the economic and social cost, then buying
an insurance policy makes sense. If the expected harm is lower than
the cost, it does not make sense to do so. Although it is difficult,
if not impossible, precisely to quantify the expected harm from global
warming, lawmakers must attempt this calculation if they are to
develop sensible, cost-effective policies.
<P>

WHAT IS GLOBAL WARMING?

<P> One of the main subjects to be addressed at UNCED is global
warming. While most Americans have heard of the phenomenon, few
understand it, and there is widespread confusion between global
warming and another term -- the "greenhouse effect." 

<P> The greenhouse effect, on the one hand, refers to the fact that
the earth releases gases, called greenhouse gases, which enable the
atmosphere to retain some of the heat received from the sun rather
than reflecting all of it back out into space. These gases thus have
the same effect as glass in a greenhouse, which is to keep the Earth
at a higher average temperature, and a more even temperature, than
would be the case without the gases. These gases include carbon
dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide, and water vapor. The greenhouse
effect maintains the Earth at a temperature which allows plant and
animal life to exist. Contrary to popular belief, all scientists agree
that the greenhouse effect is desirable. Indeed, without it, life as
we know it on Earth would cease because global temperatures would
average -18C, or 0F. Explains Patrick Michaels, State Climatologist
for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the statement that all scientists
agree that the greenhouse effect is real "is about as profound as a
statement that all scientists agree that the Earth is round." (Patrick
Michaels, "Apocalypse Not Now: Science, Politics, and Global Warming
(Part 1)," National Chamber Foundation, U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
March, 1992.)

<P> Global warming, technically known as the "enhanced greenhouse
effect," on the other hand, is a term used to describe temperature
increases allegedly caused by humans over some period of time. This
theory rests on the claim that certain gases released by human
activity warm the planet significantly. These gases include carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are released naturally into
the atmosphere. (Water vapor, which is the primary greenhouse gas, is
not increased by human activity. Water vapor and clouds account for
about 98 percent of the greenhouse effect.) Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
are an exception. These are man-made gases, chiefly associated with
refrigeration, which do not occur in nature.

<P>
THE DEBATE AT UNCED

<P> Many of the delegates at UNCED will demand action to reduce the
levels of human-generated greenhouse gases on the grounds that a large
rise in the Earth's temperature would be harmful. Among the studies
generating these demands is a report to the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC). ("The Scientific Assessment of Climate Change," The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, August 1990.) This summary
concluded that global warming had already occurred, would continue to
occur, and was causing a rise in the ocean levels. (The executive
summary, however, was not representative of the body of the report,
according to 40 percent of the scientists who worked on the document,
and was termed "misleading" by half of those scientists. "Survey of
U.S. Participants in the IPCC Report," The Science and Environmental
Policy Project, August 1991.) 

<P> If an agreement to set targets and timetables for reducing man-
made greenhouse emissions is reached at the conference, the most
popular method to reduce emissions is likely to be a carbon tax. A
carbon tax is a tax placed on every ton of carbon dioxide emitted by
industry. This would encourage factory owners to reduce CO2 emissions
-- which is considered the leading human-caused greenhouse gas. 

<P> The U.S. position throughout the discussions leading up to the
conference has been that all greenhouse gases should be considered,
not just CO2. Only half of the potential warming due to human activity
would be caused by CO2, the rest would be due to the other greenhouse
gases. The U.S. position has been that the other human-generated
greenhouse gases also should be reduced if CO2 is reduced. Putting the
burden purely on CO2 disproportionately affects the emerging poor
countries and the U.S. economically. 

<P> Further, the U.S. has insisted throughout the preparatory
negotiations that specific targets and timetable not be included in
any treaty. On May 9, 1992, the U.S. position was formally adopted by
the International Negotiating Committee (INC). Nevertheless, the
negotiated language does state the general proposition that greenhouse
gases should be cut.

<P> One of the official concerns has been that the conference will
turn into an effort aimed at redistributing the wealth from richer
countries, such as the U.S., to poorer nations. Further, the U.S. and
other industrialized countries may be pressed to change the
foundations of their economic systems and lifestyles to help the less
developed countries. Indeed, Maurice Stong, General Secretary of
UNCED, claims that industrialized countries have developed and
benefitted from unsustainable patterns of production and consumption
which have produced the present dilemma, and thus, industrialized
countries primarily have the means and responsibility to change these
patterns. (Ironically, many environmental ills have not been brought
on by industrialized countries. For instance, rainforest destruction
is cited as one reason for this conference, but the policies of
Brazil, the host country, and World Bank programs are largely
responsible for the destruction. Brazil requires homesteaders to
clear-cut the land in order to gain title. Likewise, the World Bank
provided funds to build roads through the jungle to encourage
agriculture. Thus, simple policy changes have the potential to curb
much of the destruction.)

<P>
THE ORIGINS OF GLOBAL WARMING CONCERNS

<P> The theory of global warming was first put forward by Swedish
chemist Svante Arrhenius in the late 19th century. Arrhenius theorized
that the rise in CO2 emissions caused by increased coal burning during
industrialization would warm the Earth considerably. Arrhenius
predicted that a doubling of CO2 would increase the temperature by 5C.
(Svante Arrhenius, "Philosophical Transactions," 1896. Arrehenius
further states that "[t]he influence is in general greater in the
winter than in the summer, except in the case of the parts that lie
between the maximum and the pole. The influence...is in general
somewhat greater for land than ocean. On account of the nebulosity of
the southern hemisphere, the effect will be less there than in the
northern hemisphere. An increase in [CO2] will of course diminish the
difference in temperature between day and night. A very
important...secondary effect will probably remove the maximum effect
from lower parallels to the neighborhood of the poles.") The enhanced
greenhouse effect theory, or global warming, was given new life in the
1950s because the summers were hotter than usual, and was championed
by Roger Revelle, then director of Scripps Institution of
Oceanography. (Jonathan Laing, "Climate of Fear: The Greenhouse Effect
May Be Mostly Hot Air," Barron's, February 27, 1989.) 

<P>
The Ice Age Theory

<P> The 1960s and 1970s, however, were substantially cooler than
previous decades in the northern hemisphere. The global warming theory
lost favor and a new theory emerged to supplant it. Many scientists
and environmentalists then believed that in fact global warming never
had been a real threat and that the concern should be about global
cooling. Just as many supporters of the global warming theory argue
today, the culprit was said to be human economic activity -- chiefly
dust. And just as global warming predictions today are usually stated
as fact, so the coming "Ice Age" was presented to the public as fact
in the 1960s and 1970s. The only question, according to numerous
nationally recognized proponents, was not whether an Ice Age would
occur if man continued his destructive activities, but how soon it
would come and how devastating the cold would be. (For examples of
colorful and forceful quotes by nationally recognized proponents of
global cooling, see Anna Bray, "The Ice Age Cometh," Policy Review,
No. 58, Fall 1991.)

<P>
The Shift Back to Global Warming Theory

<P> The international fear about an apocalyptic Ice Age waned as
quickly as it had arisen as soon as the trend of temperatures turned
upwards again in the late 1970s. The first computer-simulated climate
model to gain attention by suggesting a warming trend, known
technically as the General Circulation Model (GCM), was first
published in 1975, and revised in 1980. This model predicted that the
Earth would warm 4C with a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

<P> The global warming theory gained enormous support after James
Hansen, a physicist and the chief of NASA's Goddard Institute for
Space Studies, testified before the U.S. Senate in June 1988 that the
full force of human-induced global warming had arrived. (Testimony
before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, June 23,
1988.) Hansen stated that "global warming is now sufficiently large
that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and
effect relationship to the greenhouse effect." (Ibid.) In support of
his conclusions, Hansen declared that 1988 would be the warmest year
on record, barring any "remarkable and improbable" cooling. This
statement was readily accepted by the press and the general population
because the previous winter had been unusually warm and the spring and
early summer were much hotter than normal. The remarkable and
improbable cooling nevertheless occurred (even as Hansen was
testifying) in the tropical Pacific Ocean. A cold front the size of
the U.S. Great Plains also settled over Siberia later in the year,
bringing average northern hemisphere temperatures downward. In fact,
despite the unusual temperatures in the summer of 1988, one out of
every six summers since 1895 has been hotter in the U.S., the most
recent being 1963. (Jonathan Laing, "For 1989, a Drought Encore?"
Barron's, February 27, 1989.) 

<P> Since his 1988 testimony, Hansen's vision of global warming has
come under increasing attack. (Hansen also testified that the observed
warming in the past century was 0.6C to 0.7C. This is 20 to 40 percent
higher than any objective trend analysis using the global records
considered most reliable. See Michaels, op. cit.) Reid Bryson, a
respected expert in climate research and Emeritus Professor of
Geography, Meteorology, and Environmental Studies at the University of
Wisconsin at Madison, dismissed the Hansen testimony as a "phenomenal
snow job" and the global warming theory as "a triumph of sociology
over science." (Laing, "Climate of Fear," op. cit.) In fact, the
theory that substantial global warming will occur is bitterly disputed
by many highly respected scientists. Global warming is not a fact. It
is a theory that is widely challenged. In a recent survey of
atmospheric physicists and meteorologists, for instance, almost all of
the scientists agreed that catastrophic global warming predictions are
unsupported by scientific evidence and that climate models showing
warming cannot be relied upon. ("Survey of U.S. Participants in the
IPCC Report," op. cit.) There are several reason why so many
scientists are uncertain about the theory.
<P>
Reason #1: The science involved in the global warming theory is 
      very complex. 

<P> Scientists generally agree on many of the fundamental concepts
behind the greenhouse theory, which is crucial to the catastrophic
global warming theory. Where they part company is in making the jump
between one theory and the other. 

<P> The reason why there can be deep disputes among scientists
investigating climate change is that climatology is perhaps one of the
most complex and uncertain of all scientific fields. It is not
possible to run controlled experiments for the whole planet in a
laboratory test tube. Climate conditions cannot be created and changed
at will, and then studied. Thus scientists are forced to use models to
predict the consequences of various influences, and to try to
disentangle the effect of one factor from a myriad of others.
Necessarily, such models attempt to include all significant variables
and exclude the insignificant ones. The problem is to decide which is
which, and if all the variables have in fact been considered.

<P> Given the inherent difficulties in the science of climatology,
it is crucial that models are continually tested against data being
collected and that scientists accept that conflicts throw their models
and theories into question. Unfortunately this does not always happen.
For example, Christopher Folland of the United Kingdom Meteorological
Office, who was one of the senior authors of the 1990
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report to the U.N. that
predicted global warming of 2.5C, recently was asked if the data
collected to date (which showed substantially different results from
those predicted by models) would alter recommendations for CO2
emission reductions. Folland responded that "the data don't matter,"
adding that "[w]e're not basing our recommendations on the data; we're
basing them upon the GCM [General Circulation Model] climate models."
(Presentation by Patrick Michaels at the National Chamber Foundation,
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, April 10, 1992.)

<P> Clinging to a model in the face of conflicting data is bad
science, and generally leads to bad policy. But the data gathering and
modeling problem is made even more difficult because of systematic
warming biases of the data on which the models are based.

<P> "Heat Island" Effect. For instance, past observations indicate a
global temperature increase of 0.5C over the last 100 years. (It
should be noted that almost all of the warming occurred more than 50
years ago, prior to the emission of more than 67 percent of
human-generated greenhouse gases. Since 1941, the temperature dropped
and then rose about 0.1C.) But questions have arisen over the
reliability of even such a basic trend, because recording stations
have been placed in areas, such as near cities, that have experienced
growing populations over the decades. The buildings and roads which
accompany an increasing urban population retain warmth from the sun.
This may have exaggerated the long-term temperature rise -- or even
suggested one where none exists. This is known as the "heat island"
effect. 

<P> Extremely accurate and more reliable temperature records do
exist -- but only since 1979. Satellite temperature readings,
according to Roy Spencer of NASA, and John Christy of the University
of Alabama, are accurate within 0.01C, because the satellites use a
different method to calculate temperature. Just as important, the
satellites are not affected by the heat island effect and the readings
cover the entire globe uniformly, unlike ground-based stations which
are clustered and sporadic. Significantly, these satellite
temperatures show that the ground-based stations records may not be
very accurate. The ground-based records show a warming in the southern
hemisphere of 0.3C over the past decade, but the highly reliable
satellite data contradict this warming trend. In fact, the satellites
show that the southern hemisphere temperatures actually dropped 0.02C.
This calls into question the wisdom of relying on questionable data
accumulated earlier this century as the basis for costly policy
changes.

<P> But even if the ground-station records were correct, the results
would squarely contradict the global warming theory, which predicts
that the northern hemisphere will warm much faster than the southern
hemisphere. Northern hemisphere temperatures have not changed
significantly. This means that global warming advocates are faced with
the prospect of pursuing their theories although the data are suspect
and do not support their assertions, or re-examining their theories in
light of new satellite data, which show no warming trend where models
predicted it should have occurred. Unfortunately they have chosen the
first course. 

<P> Reason #2: Many models use questionable or incorrect parameters.

<P> Some of the models predicting global warming have been
discovered to have included incorrect parameters. Parameters are
variables or arbitrary constants in mathematical expressions that
generally try to reflect real world conditions which restrict or
determine the outcome of the mathematical expression. Sometimes
adjusting these parameters can have bizarre results. A prime example
is the first influential GCM model, developed in 1975. This model,
devised by Sukryo Manabe and Richard Wetherald of the Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), indicated that the Earth would warm by 4C with
a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere. Unfortunately for the model, it
also predicted background temperatures (that is, the temperatures that
would occur if there had been no CO2 increase) that would have to be
5C lower than today. It is interesting to note that since the last Ice
Age was between 4C and 6C colder than today, an ice age would have
occurred if the background model was correct. To correct for this
problem, the researchers revised the level of the sun's radiation
reaching the Earth's atmosphere upward by 6 percent. But this is
equivalent to moving the earth's orbit 2 million miles closer to the
sun. (The researchers also used incorrect parameters in another
instance in the study. The original study predicted that the polar ice
caps would melt at approximately today's temperatures. In the
subsequent report, they corrected this error, but left the accelerated
warming which is the direct result of ice cap melting in the model.) 

<P> A study of Hansen's GCM computer model, which predicts
catastrophic warming by the year 2100, found that a one percent
difference in the initial conditions or parameters was enough to
create totally different predictions of global temperatures over the
last half of the period 1991-2100. (A. Tsonis, "Sensitivity of the
Global Climate System to Initial Conditions," Eos, No. 30 (July 23,
1991), p. 313.)

     <P>Other examples of questionable or incorrect parameters include:

<P> Oceans. The theory that oceans retard the warming caused by
greenhouse gases is generally accepted, and incorporated into most
newer models. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the ocean effect is
poorly understood and roughly estimated. This could introduce
significant errors into models. For instance, many researchers claim
that it takes 50 years or more for carbon emissions to affect
temperatures. Other researchers, however, concluded recently that 75
percent of the full effect of carbon dioxide emissions on sea
temperatures is experienced within ten years. (S. Manabe, K. Bryan,
and M.J. Spelman, "Transient Response of Global Ocean Atmosphere Model
to a Doubling of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide," Journal of Physical
Oceanography, Volume 20 (1990), pp. 722-749.)

<P> Clouds. The problem of determining the effect of clouds is even
more complicated, and consequently climate models often contradict
each other in the characteristics that they assign to clouds. One
theory is that as the temperature increases, because of a rise in
greenhouse gases, the relative humidity drops and fewer clouds form.
Thus, sunlight reaching the earth increases, causing more warming, or
"positive feedback." But another scientific school of thought
maintains that clouds have a cooling effect, or "negative feedback."
The cloud feedback problem is crucial to a full discussion of the
global warming issue, since the models show a range of warming from
less than 1C to as much as 5C, depending on the extent and sign
(positive or negative) of cloud feedback alone. (George C. Marshall
Institute, "Two Environmental Issues" (Washington, D.C. December
1991).)

<P> Recent studies seem to support the view of scientists who
theorize a negative feedback from clouds. James Angell, a research
meteorologist at the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory, found that between
1950 and 1988, the number of cloudy days increased by 3.5 percent.
(J.K. Angell, "Variations and Trends in Tropospheric and Stratospheric
Global Temeratures, 1958-1987," Journal of Climate, Vol. 1, No. 12
(December 1988), pp. 1296-1313. The number of cloudy days increased 2
percentage points from approximately 56 percent to 58 percent of total
days. This is a 3.5 percent increase in the number of cloudy days.) In
addition, other research finds that human-generated sulfates,
contributing to atmospheric pollution, also have the effect of
enhancing the brightness of clouds. This increases the amount of sun
radiation reflected back into space, thus cooling the earth. ("When
fossil fuel is burned, both carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide are
added to the atmosphere. The former should cause warming of the lower
atmosphere by enhancing the greenhouse effect, whereas the latter, by
producing sulphate aerosols, may cause a cooling effect. The
possibility that these two processes could offset each other was
suggestd many years ago...but during most of the intervening period,
attention has focused on the greenhouse effect...Over the next 10-30
years, it is conceivavble that the increased radiative forcing due to
SO2 concentration changes could more than offset the reductions in
radiative forcing due reduced CO2 emissions." Virginia Climate
Advisory, Volume 15, Number 1, Spring 1991, (quoting T.M.L. Wigley,
"Could Reducing Fossil-Fuel Emissions CauseGlobal Warming?" Nature,
Vol. 349 (1991), pp. 503-505.) 

<P> Many scientists have theorized that sulphate aerosols are
primarily responsible for the increase in cloud cover, but this theory
is challenged by new evidence. In the southern hemisphere, where there
are virtually no sulphate aerosols, new evidence shows that cloudiness
has increased. (Telephone interview with Patrick Michaels, State
Climatologist for the Commonwealth of Virginia, May 13, 1992.)
Contends Patrick Michaels, State Climatologist for the Commonwealth of
Virginia, this lends credence to another theory "that increased
cloudiness is one of the natural responses to a greenhouse
enhancement, and therefore, a disproportionate amount of warming
occurs at night." (Ibid.)

<P> Cooling Effect. Clouds are probably more important than
greenhouse gases in their influence on global climate change by a
factor of 4. A study by V. Ramanathan, a professor of geophysical
sciences at the University of Chicago, has shown conclusively that
clouds have a cooling net effect on the planet. (V. Ramanathan, R.D.
Cess, E.F. Harrison, P. Minnis, B.R. Barkstrom, E. Ahmad, D. Hartmann,
"Cloud-Radiative Forcing and Climate: Results from the Earth Radiation
Budget Experiment," Science, Vol. 243, January 6, 1989.) While clouds
do create some warming effect as well as a cooling effect, the cooling
effect is larger by 13.2 watts per square meter of planet surface.
(Ibid. The heating effect of clouds, caused by longwave cloud forcing
resulting from the greenhouse effect, is 31.3 watts per square meter.
The cooling effect, caused by shortwave cloud forcing resulting from
enhanced planetary albedo, is -44.5 watts per square meter.) This
cooling effect is approximately four times the expected warming from
enhanced greenhouse gases (almost 4 watts per square meter) predicted
by catastophic global warming models, according to the study.
Moreover, "[t]his cooling effect is large over the mid- and high-
latitude oceans, with values reaching -100 watts/square meter."
(Ibid.) Thus, a small increase in cloudiness could offset potential
warming from enhanced greenhouse gases.

<P> Perhaps even more important than the change in the effect of
clouds on the overall change of temperature is the effect they may
have on day-time and night-time temperatures. This is important
because the dangers often cited by alarmists are generally predicated
on the fears of rising day temperatures, which they claim will cause
drought-induced crop failures, global flooding from the melting polar
ice caps, and other catastrophes. If only night temperatures increase,
then these dangers are extremely unlikely because rising night
temperatures would not cause these problems. Alarmists rely on the
1990 IPCC report that states "there is no compelling evidence for
general reduction in the amplitude of the diurnal cycle" from
greenhouse gases. Yet this important assumption has been recently
contradicted by government scientists. A 1991 study of the U.S., the
former Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China by Thomas Karl
and other scientists of the National Climatic Data Center at NOAA have
found that night temperatures over the time periods available in each
country have increased, but day temperatures have not. This phenomenon
is found to be directly related to increased cloud cover. (T. Karl, G.
Kukla, V. Razuvayev, M. Changery, R. Quayle, R. Heim, Jr., D.
Easterling, Cong Bin Fu, "Global Warming: Evidence for Asymetric
Diurnal Temperature Change," Geophysical Research Letters, Volume 18,
No. 12 (December 1991), pp. 2252-2256.)

<P> This study concludes that either models have overpredicted day
temperature (underpredicted night temperatures) or that the slight
warming over the last century is due to "factors unrelated to an
enhanced anthropogenically-induced greenhouse effect." (Ibid.) 

<P> Solar Activity. Cycle variations in solar activity may be a much
bigger determinant of Earth temperature variations than previously had
been assumed. While not without problems, this research is extremely
promising as an alternative explanation of global temperature changes,
and -- if correct -- means that variations in man-made greenhouse gas
emissions may have little or no impact. A study by Danish scientists
E. Friis-Christensen and K. Lassen of the Danish Meteorological
Institute has gained enormous attention recently. This study, released
in November 1991, found that variations in the sunspot cycle are
correlated extremely closely with northern hemisphere temperature
fluctuations. (E. Friis-Christensen and K. Lassen, "Length of Solar
Cycle: An Indicator of Solar Activity Closely Associated with
Climate," Science (Vol. 254), November 1, 1991. Sunspots are
relatively dark spots that appear in groups on the surface of the sun.
They have approximately eleven-year cycles and are associated with
strong magnetic fields. The variations in the eleven-year cycle
correlate to increasing and decreasing temperatures over the last 130
years, according to the Danish study.)

<P> Some experts have even theorized that solar magnetic activity
may account almost completely for the changes in the Earth's
temperature in the last 130 years. (See Marshall Institute, "Global
Warming Update: Recent Scientific Findings" (Washington, D.C. 1992).)
Indeed, the remarkably close relationship seems to suggest that other
possible influences, such as greenhouse gases, could not influence
temperatures beyond a few tenths of a degree over the period. There is
further evidence that solar activity may be the dominant factor in
climate change. (For a thorough explanation, see George C. Marshall
Institute, op. cit.) For example, carbon analysis of trees, which is a
reliable indicator of levels of solar magnetic activity, indicates
that solar activity has risen and fallen significantly every 200-300
years for the last 6,000 years. Geologic evidence of the size of past
glaciers reveals that when solar activity increased in the past, as
indicated by carbon analysis, the Earth's temperatures also increased.
When solar activity decreased, temperatures decreased.

<P> Needless to say, the solar theory, like the global warming
theory, is still a theory and must be subjected to vigorous testing.
Moreover, the theory also leaves several questions unanswered.
Although the theory explains the northern hemisphere temperature
changes extremely well, for example, it fails completely to explain
temperature changes in the Southern Hemisphere. It also does not yet
adequately explain how solar radiation warms night temperatures but
not day temperatures. Nevertheless, the Danish study lends
considerable weight to the argument that much more research on climate
change is needed before fundamental changes in energy and economic
policies should be enacted. If solar activity turns out to be the
principal cause of climate change, the world would be needlessly
throwing away its wealth and enduring hardship if it sought to control
other minor factors.

<P>
WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBAL WARMING?

<P> Even if it appears likely that a significant increase in global
temperatures will occur, and even if human activity is the principal
cause, there is still the question of whether any changes in global
temperature would be beneficial or detrimental. Again, the ability of
science to predict with confidence the results of a climate change is
very limited. Still, there are some indications of what might happen.
<P>
The Impact on Crops

<P> Nights may become warmer without any major change in daytime
temperatures. Historical data show that the temperature increases in
the past 100 years have all been at night, and that day temperatures
basically have remained constant. (The large increase in warming that
is often cited as having occurred in the last 100 years actually
occurred between 50 to 100 years ago, before the large increases in
CO2 emissions. Obscuring this fact often leads to the false conclusion
that the Earth has been steadily warming. In fact, it has oscillated.
The last fifty years showed very little overall warming.) This pattern
has important implications. The crop-growing season is affected most
by the timing of the last spring frost and the first fall frost. If
night temperatures increased, these frosts would occur earlier in the
spring and later in the fall, thereby extending the growing season and
boosting food production in many regions.

<P> It is widely believed that global warming would lead to droughts
while increasing the water requirements of plants. But this theory
does not stand up to scrutiny. First, droughts are not likely to
increase with global warming if the primary effect is to raise only
night-time temperatures. (Part of the confusion stems from the
improper use of a crude drought index, known as the Palmer Drought
Index, to gauge not only the level of drought that has occurred, but
to further predict the amount of drought that would occur in the
future from increases in the mean temperature. Proponents of future
drought base their predictions on the presumption that precipitation
will decrease while mean temperatures will increase. The problems with
this methodology are two-fold. There is no indication that
precipitation will decrease (past records show no change). Further,
using increased mean temperatures to estimate drought will
systematically overstate the problem or find problems where they do
not exist if the increase occurred at night. Simply stated, if
precipitation and day temperatures remained constant while night
temperatures increased, thereby raising the mean temperature, the
evaporation rate would not change very much because evaporation is
caused primarily by high day temperatures.) Second, since water
evaporation from plants mainly occurs during the day, plants would not
experience greater heat stress simply from warmer nights.

<P> The increased CO2 associated with the global warming theory may
also actually improve agricultural production. Studies conducted by
the Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
show that doubling the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere would
improve cotton yields by 80 percent, wheat and rice by 36 percent,
soybeans by 32 percent, and corn by 16 percent. (Laing, "Climate of
Fear," op. cit.) Increased CO2 in the atmosphere also would
significantly reduce the amount of water necessary for plants because
plants could breathe easier, thus losing less moisture through their
pores during the breathing process. 

<P> Another probable effect of global warming would be to expand the
world's agricultural belt. More of Canada and the former Soviet Union,
as well as the northern latitudes of Europe and the northern states of
America, could become more abundant producers. But lower latitudes
would not necessarily experience an equivalent fall in production. The
enhanced greenhouse, or global warming, theory predicts that future
warming will occur primarily in higher latitudes. Moreover, if warmer
nights were the main effect of global warming, this would mean higher
yields in lower latitudes that now experience frosts by extending the
growing season.

<P> Flooding. Some proponents of the global warming theory predict
worldwide flooding. The theory is that as the earth warms, the polar
ice caps will begin to melt and sea levels could rise to dangerous
levels. Some projections in the early 1980s theorized huge tidal waves
and a sea level rise of as much as 25 feet above the current sea
level. Even the more conservative models suggested a rise of two to
three feet. Projections have been revised down considerably in the
last decade, however. (The 1990 IPCC report found that the "best
estimate" predicted a sea level rise of 66cm, or just over 2 feet.)

<P> Evidence released this year suggests that even these recent
predictions may be wrong and that sea levels could even fall. A team
of Canadian and American scientists studied the geological record of
the ice caps over the last 130,000 years. (G. Miller, and A. deVernal,
"Will Greenhouse Warming Lead to Northern Hemisphere Ice Sheet
Growth," Nature, Volume 355 (1992), p. 245.) The team discovered that
as global temperatures rose, the size of the ice caps became larger.
The explanation? The Arctic and Antarctic air normally is too cold to
hold much moisture. (Marshall Institute, "Global Warming Update," op.
cit.) Consequently, the poles experience very little snowfall. But as
the temperature rises, the air becomes warm enough to hold moisture
and snow falls -- increasing the size of the polar caps and leading to
a drop in the sea level. 

<P>
THE COST OF DOING SOMETHING

<P> Many less developed countries are just beginning their slow
ascent out of poverty, thanks to their adoption of free market
economic policies favoring strong growth. These policies will bring
material prosperity and improvements in the quality of life of their
inhabitants. But rapid growth requires large amounts of inexpensive
energy, and for underdeveloped countries, this generally means burning
fossil fuels, such as oil and coal. If restrictions on the use of such
fuels are enacted, these countries will have to forego some of the
benefits of increased wealth and the associated improvements in
health.

<P> Some proponents of slower economic growth maintain that slower
growth means better environmental protection. But a Princeton study of
42 countries, released late last year, shows that air pollution is
inversely related to wealth above the $4,000 to $5,000 Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capita level. In other words, as a country grows
wealthier, its residents tend to be more prepared and can afford to
devote financial resources to reducing air pollution. (G.M. Grossman
and A.B. Krueger, "Environmental Impacts of a North American Free
Trade Agreement," Discussion Paper No. 158, Discussion Paper on
Economics, Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, November 1991.
It must be noted that between $0 to $4,000 GDP per capita, the amount
of air pollution increases as GDP per capita rises. Since Lesser
Developed Countries fall into this range, this provides an additional
reason to allow these countries to break past the wealth barrier as
quickly as possible, rather than slowly increasing in wealth or
remaining economically flat.) Action to improve the environment is a
characteristic of rich countries, not poor ones.

<P> Huge Costs. Although the economic impact of curbing man-made
greenhouse gas emissions would be greatest in less-developed
countries, American families also would be hard hit. One proposal is
to reduce CO2 by 20 percent by the year 2000 by imposing a carbon tax.
According to a 1991 Department of Energy report, this would cost
approximately $95 billion annually, or $1,200 for every American
household. ("Limiting Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the United
States," U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Environmental Analysis,
Deputy Under Secretary for Policy, Planning and Analysis, September
1991.) America currently spends approximately $125 billion annually,
or about $1,500 per family, on environmental protection. The carbon
tax proposal would almost double that cost, and might lead to demands
from business and households to reduce other spending to protect the
environment. In preparatory conference negotiations concluded this May
9, the U.S. and 142 other countries adopted non-binding vague language
that urged greenhouse emissions to be returned to their 1990 levels by
some unspecified date and to attempt unspecified reductions by the
year 2000.

<P> However, according to a 1990 study by the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO), even if emissions were kept at 1990 levels, America
would "risk several years of economic stagnation and high
unemployment," depending on how a carbon tax was implemented.
(Congressional Budget Office, "Carbon Charges as a Response to Global
Warming: The Effects of Taxing Fossil Fuels," August 1990.) Even if
the tax were phased in gradually, an estimated 700,000 jobs would be
lost as a direct result of the carbon tax by 1997, according to the
CBO. 

<P> Another report, a Department of State memorandum issued last
month, suggests the cost of reducing carbon emissions would be very
small, but this report contains doubtful assumptions. ("U.S. Views on
Global Climate Change," United States Department of State, Bureau of
Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, April
23, 1992.) For instance, the State Department memorandum assumes that
over one-quarter of all households and up to almost two-thirds of all
U.S. businesses will replace their lighting fixtures with more energy
efficient fixtures by the year 2000. This unlikely assumption accounts
for as much as 46 percent of the total voluntary carbon reductions the
State Department predicts will occur.

<P>
A PRUDENT POLICY AMID UNCERTAIN SCIENCE

<P> When faced with uncertain science, as is the case with the
theory of global warming, one of four basic strategies can be adopted.
(S. Fred Singer, "Environmental Strategies with Uncertain Science,"
Regulation, Winter 1990, p. 65.) These are: 
<UL>
<P>Option #1: Take no action, not even research. This option has the
      advantage of being costless, since it requires nothing but
      waiting until the threat, if any, is clearer. But it introduces
      the danger of not dealing with a potential problem and not
      increasing knowledge concerning the threat and the consequences
      of inaction.

<P>Option #2: Conduct more research, but take no other action. This
      option has the advantage of being relatively inexpensive
      compared with other possible actions, while increasing the
      knowledge of the scope and likelihood of a potential problem. It
      risks, of course, the consequences associated with having
      delayed action if the threat turns out to be real.
      

<P>Option #3: Take limited action to control greenhouse gas emissions,
      phased in over a period of time. This option has the advantage
      of being less expensive than tackling the problem -- if it
      exists -- completely and immediately. But it suffers from being
      much more expensive than research, and the result may be huge
      expenditures on a problem that does not exist.


<P>Option #4: Undertake full control of emissions on an emergency
      timetable. This option has the advantage of addressing potential
      harm as quickly and thoroughly as possible. But it is very
      expensive, and may address a mythical problem.
</UL>

<P> The threat posed by global warming, if it is real, is large
enough to rule out the first option as the prudent policy. Policy
makers then must consider the risk in delaying action while acquiring
more scientific understanding on which to base a policy. Two studies
completed last year strongly contradict the "must act now" view that
maintains there is no time to delay, according to a scientific panel
of the George C. Marshall Institute, which is a Washington, D.C.-based
public policy institute focusing on scientific matters. According to
the panel's findings:
<UL>
 The calculations [of both studies] show that a five-year delay
      in limiting carbon emissions will make the world warmer in the
      next century by at most one tenth of a degree, compared to how
      warm it would be if there were no delay. (Marshall Institute,
      "Global Warming Update," op. cit.)
</UL>
<P> At the same time, the research data made possible by stepped-up
global climate research means knowledge is increasing rapidly, so
delay may significantly increase the chances of taking the right
course of action without incurring serious damage to the Earth's
environment if the global warming theory is found to be substantially
correct.

<P> Thus rather than agreeing to targets and timetables for
controlling greenhouse gas emissions, which may not be needed and
which would impose enormous costs on developed and less-developed
countries, the U.S. would be wise to pursue an intensive program of
research and urge other countries to do likewise.

<P> The U.S. has set the pace in research on global change, and this
has produced huge amounts of new data -- much of it raising serious
questions about the global warming theory. The U.S. has spent $2.7
billion since the global change research project was initiated three
years ago, and the Administration has proposed increasing the annual
global change research budget next year by 24 percent to almost $1.4
billion. The rest of the world combined spends about the same amount
as the U.S. currently. The U.S. should commit to increases in the
research budget of $300 million, or 25 percent, annually for the next
five years. To pay for this research, the federal government should
sell the Naval Petroleum Reserve, which is no longer needed for the
Navy's security.

<P> The Search for an Answer. New climate change research could be
supplemented by allowing scientists greater access to non-sensitive
intelligence information accumulated in the past. This would be useful
because surveillance satellites and aircraft, submarines, and
oceanographic vessels have collected mountains of data that can be
used to accelerate research on questions such as past contours and
thaw rates of polar ice caps, ocean chemistry and temperatures, and
scores of other issues. Subject to legitimate national security
concerns, such as sources and methods of intelligence gathering and
existing programs, President Bush should announce that he will
authorize U.S. intelligence agencies to begin opening their relevant
archived files. (The authorization for opening the archives should be
limited to global research only.) Not only could this prove very
beneficial to the search for an answer to the questions implicit in
the global warming theory, but such an action would demonstrate that
the President takes the potential threat of global warming seriously
-- without prematurely engaging in a potentially harmful and costly
policy. (As Alton Frye, Vice President and Washington director of the
Council on Foreign Relations, states: "Given the pressures on the
President to join the commitments projected for the Rio conference, a
program of cooperation between environmental and national security
communities could be a political windfall for the Administration. The
President should tell the world at the Earth Summit that he has sent a
clear order to the national security community: ' subject only to
safeguarding current programs, open the archives.' Few steps would do
more to demonstrate commitment to vigorous action on the global
warming issue.... " Alton Frye, "How to 'Spy' on the Environment," The
Washington Post, May 4, 1992, p. C4.) 
<P>
CONCLUSION

<P> Climate change is an extremely complicated field of scientific
research. Although understanding of the probable effects of greenhouse
gas emissions is rapidly improving, the level of uncertainty remains
high and the predictive power of climate models is poor. The models
now used vary in their predictions enormously. 

<P> Moreover, recent studies and analyses of past studies indicate
that many of the underlying assumptions in the computer models showing
warming are wrong and lead to erroneous predictions. Models of climate
change also fail to explain the discrepancy between predicted climate
change in the last 100 years and actual change. 

<P> In addition, even if the elements of the global warming theory
are accepted, the forecasted effects are overblown and may in some
cases be completely wrong. In particular, the evidence suggests
strongly that widespread flooding from the melting of the ice caps
will not occur. Further, agricultural production is likely to
increase, not fall. 

<P> And while there is a plausible ring to the argument that it
would be wise for countries to take action, "just in case," the costs
of government-mandated reductions in CO2 would be enormous. Such
reductions would impose heavy costs on American families and raise
unemployment. Less developed countries would be especially hard hit.

<P> Thus, given the shaky science, the uncertain effects, and the
enormous cost of taking precipitous action, the U.S. should not agree
to binding targets and timetables on emissions at the Rio conference
next month. Any agreement should be limited to a commitment to treat
the threat seriously, with reductions in greenhouse gases voluntary
for each country. 

<P> What the U.S. should do is emphasize the importance of research
on global climate change. The U.S. should pledge to increase its
climate research budget, which accounts for half the total spent by
all countries, and challenge the other nations at the conference to
step up their research. The U.S. also should open up the relevant
archives of U.S. intelligence agencies, subject to legitimate national
security concerns, to accelerate global climate research.

<P> Global warming may pose a huge danger to the Earth. Or it may
turn out to be just as much a false alarm as the "Ice Age" panic
twenty years ago. If the science of climate change was more precise
than it is, and all the evidence consistent with the dire predictions
of some proponents of the global warming theory, then it could make
sense for the U.S. and other countries to take urgent, expensive
action in an effort to deal with the potential threat. But the science
is uncertain. Rather than rush to "do something," the wiser course
would be to find out what is actually happening to the Earth's
climate.

Issue Bulletin #173<BR>

<P>INTRODUCTION

<P>      It is time for federal regulators to obey the Bill of Rights.
This is the message of the Private Property Rights Act (S. 50),
introduced in the Senate by Steve Symms, the Idaho Republican. Symms's
bill would give teeth to the Fifth Amendment's requirement that no
"private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."
Targeted by the bill is the mounting practice of government
regulations to deprive individuals and businesses of the use of their
property without compensating the owners for the loss of their
property.
<P>      The Symms bill would codify and make permanent Executive Order
12630, signed by Ronald Reagan in 1988, which requires federal
agencies to consider whether their actions might infringe on property
rights and, if they do, to seek alternative ways to achieve their
goals. The Symms bill also would give the President a legislative
weapon to use in his fight to make all federal agencies fully and
consistently put the right of property ahead of the power of
bureaucrats.

 <P>     Just Compensation. The Fifth Amendment's requirement that when
the government takes private property the government must compensate
the owner is referred to interchangeably as the "Just Compensation
Clause," the "Eminent Domain Clause," or the "Takings Clause." Thus,
if the government needs land on which to build a road, it must pay the
owner for the land. The Fifth Amendment also applies to other
infringements of property rights that fall short of total
confiscation; on these, however, the courts have upheld the right to
compensation only inconsistently. 

 <P>     In recent years property owners have found the use and enjoyment
of their property more and more restricted by regulators, often in the
name of environmental protection. Thus, for example, individuals have
bought land for houses only to be told that they are no longer allowed
to build. Farmers have bought land for farming only to be told that
they are not allowed to farm because their land must be left in its
natural state. Businesses have been told to shut down mining
operations not, as it turns out, to prevent them from polluting, but
because their mining property has been designated as a "wetland" that
must be preserved. Typically in such cases, the government has not
voluntarily compensated the owners for their losses.

 <P>     Shift in Court. Since 1987, however, the Supreme Court has
started to recognize that regulation is often used as a substitute for
the power of eminent domain: Instead of buying land outright, the
government often tries to avoid the requirement of paying compensation
by simply commanding property owners to use their land in whatever
manner the government wishes. In the face of this practice, however,
the Supreme Court has begun to hold that regulation, as much as
outright confiscation, can be subject to the constitutional
requirement of just compensation. In response to this shift in the
Supreme Court's treatment of regulatory takings, Ronald Reagan in 1988
issued Executive Order 12630, which requires federal agencies to
determine in advance if their actions may prompt a claim for
compensation. The purpose of the Order is twofold: to protect private
property owners from the inadvertent, de facto confiscation of their
property through regulation, and to control and limit the amount that
taxpayers have to pay in just compensation awards to people whose
property has been taken by federal regulation. Such awards will soon
become a major budget item. The total amount of all such outstanding
claims is over one billion dollars and growing rapidly.

 <P>     The Executive Order has been applied diligently by some
government agencies but has been resisted by others. A future
President, moreover, could rescind the order. Symms's bill would make
permanent the protection offered by the Executive Order and require
that the Attorney General certify that each agency is in compliance
with the Order's principles.

  <P>    The Symms legislation could be improved if it required that
compensation be paid out of the budget of the agency at fault in
taking private property without compensation. This would give agencies
a strong incentive to avoid unnecessary takings of the property rights
of the citizens.


<P>THE FIFTH AMENDMENT
<P>
      The federal government and the states have the power to condemn
and take over land for such public uses as roads, parks, post offices,
or military bases. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
stipulates that in such cases, which are called "takings," the owner
must be compensated for the loss of the property. As the Supreme Court
has explained, "The Fifth Amendment's guarantee that private property
shall not be taken for a public use without just compensation was
designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear
public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by
the public as a whole." (Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49
(1960).) Since the general public thus benefits, the Court has
declared, "the public at large, rather than a single owner, must bear
the burden of an exercise of state power in the public interest."
(Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 260-61 (1980).) 

  <P>    Although the Just Compensation Clause in the Fifth Amendment is
mainly concerned with land, it applies to any kind of property.
Example: If in a military emergency the government were to confiscate
airplanes or ships from private owners, or simply require that they be
turned over to the government for the duration of the emergency, the
government would have to compensate the owners.

 <P>     Government can take an interest in property short of complete
ownership, moreover, and still be required to pay compensation for
what it has taken. Thus, for example, where flights of government
aircraft over private property are so low and frequent as to
constitute a direct and immediate interference with the use and
enjoyment of the land, the government has taken a flight easement for
which it must pay damages to the landowner. (United States v. Causby,
328 U.S. 256, 267 (1946).) 
<P>
REGULATORY TAKINGS

<P>      The government also takes property rights by imposing
restrictions on the use of property. Suppose, for example, the
government wants to preserve a forest or a wetland in its natural
condition, either for recreational use or for a wildlife refuge. If
the government were to condemn the land outright, there would be no
question about its obligation to compensate the landowner. 

 <P>     Yet, suppose further that the government decides to leave legal
title to the land with its private owner and passes a regulation
prohibiting the owner from developing the land, or from farming it, or
from doing anything else that changes the land's natural state. In
this case the government would be compelling the private landowner to
devote the land to whatever use the government desires. In effect, the
government here takes away from the owner the right to use the land.
The private owner of the land would be owner in name only; the
effective owner would be the government, although in almost all
instances the private owner would still be liable for the payment of
property taxes on the land. This would be an attempt to circumvent the
Fifth Amendment and to achieve the same ends as would outright
condemnation, but without paying compensation. 

  <P>    Common Law Rights. Not all regulations, of course, infringe on
private property rights. Under the common law of property and tort, a
landowner's property rights are defined and limited by the property
rights of his neighbors. If a regulation merely prevents someone from
engaging in activities that would violate the rights of others under
the common law of nuisance or trespass, (The common law kept clear the
important distinction between inflicting a harm and withdrawing or
denying a benefit. In general, only physical invasions counted as
injuries and could give rise to a cause of action. See Richard A.
Epstein, Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain
(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985), pp. 107-125.) such
as polluting a river that runs through a neighbors's land, then the
landowner has no right to compensation, even though the value of the
landowner's land may be diminished as a result of the prohibition.
This is because the landowner has no right to engage in such
activities to begin with. (See, e.g., Office of Legal Policy, U.S.
Department of Justice, Economic Liberties Protected by the
Constitution, March 16, 1988, pp. 7-11, 32.) Regulations in such cases
actually would protect private property rights.

  <P>    The Easement Option. By contrast, if a particular activity would
not violate the property rights of others as defined under the common
law of trespass or nuisance and would not give others any legal ground
to sue, then a landowner has the right to engage in the activity on
his or her own land. If a neighbor wants to prevent the landowner from
engaging in some activity that does not violate the neighbor's
property rights, the neighbor must pay the landowner to abstain from
the activity; and if the neighbor wants to stop the activity
permanently, he or she must purchase an easement from the landowner.
(An easement is a right over the property of another. An affirmative
easement is a right of use, such as a right of way allowing one to
pass over the land of another to access a road or a beach, or a right
to discharge water onto neighboring land. A negative easement is a
restriction on the use of land by its owner, prohibiting him from
doing something which would otherwise be lawful. A negative easement
may also be called a "restrictive covenant" or a "negative servitude."
Black's Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition (St. Paul, Minn.: West
Publishing Company, 1979), pp. 457-58, 1182, 1229.) 

  <P>    This means that any regulation that prevents people from
engaging in activities on their land that do not violate the property
rights of others abridges the property rights of the landowners whose
activities are restricted. Specifically, such a regulation takes away
some of the landowners' rights in the use and enjoyment of their land,
in effect taking an easement that should have been theirs to sell.
Even if many other desirable uses are still permitted to the
landowners, the regulation is a partial taking. As such, the
landowners deserve to be compensated for whatever property rights they
have lost. 

  <P>    Computing Compensation. Whenever a regulation takes away private
property rights, the proper measure of compensation is the difference
between the value of the property with and without the regulation;
this difference is the value of the easement the government has taken.
Of course, if the property is worth just as much with the regulation
as it is without it, then no loss in value has been caused, and no
compensation is owed. Similarly, some government actions may reduce
the value of land without taking away property rights, and hence do
not give rise to an obligation to compensate. Example: A decision to
close an exit along a particular highway, or to build a new highway
someplace else, may diminish the value of hotels and restaurants along
the original highway. If the landowners' property rights in the use of
their land have been left fully intact, however, then they are not
entitled to compensation out of taxpayer funds. 

 <P>     The mere fact that a regulation amounts to a taking does not
mean that the government cannot go forward with the planned
regulation. It simply means that the government must pay compensation
in order to do so. The only issue properly involved in regulatory
takings cases under the Fifth Amendment is the right to compensation,
not the validity of the regulations.
<P>

PROBLEMS IN THE CASE LAW

 <P>     Although the Supreme Court has recognized for at least 70 years
that regulations can constitute a taking of private property for
public use, (Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922). The
Court considered but rejected a regulatory taking claim some 35 years
earlier in Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887).) it has awarded
compensation only rarely. Often the Court found procedural or
technical reasons to avoid ruling on regulatory taking claims. In many
cases, the Court has denied compensation on the ground that the
regulation is an exercise of the "police power" of the federal
government or of the state governments, even though the Fifth
Amendment contains no "police power" exception. ( For examples of
regulations that have been upheld on "police power" grounds, see
Office of Legal Policy, op. cit., p. 35; Epstein, op. cit., pp.
112-15, 121-25, 130-34, 140-41.) 

 <P>     Police power originally referred only to government action that
sought to guard against genuine threats to health, safety, or
property. Examples of this might include zoning laws that ban toxic
waste dumps or nuclear reactors from residential areas. Over the
years, however, the term "police power" has been expanded to cover
virtually any government action. As a result, any action that is for a
public use or purpose usually constitutes an exercise of the police
power in the eyes of the court. 

 <P>     In cases in which the plaintiff seeks to invalidate a
regulation, the "police power" doctrine can be appropriate. (For
example, in Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365
(1926), the first case to uphold zoning against a constitutional
challenge, the plaintiff did not even seek just compensation under the
Fifth Amendment in his appeal before the Supreme Court (although he
had sought just compensation in the courts below), but instead merely
sought an injunction against enforcement of the zoning ordinance on
the ground that it took his property without due process of law, in
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.) But it is not appropriate in
cases where the plaintiff is merely seeking compensation. The fact
that a regulation that takes private property rights may fall within
the police power, as that power has come to be defined by the courts,
only suffices to show that the regulation is consistent with the Fifth
Amendment's requirement that takings be for public use; it cannot
eliminate the requirement that just compensation be paid. Before it
clarified matters in 1987, (See Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass'n v.
DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 491 n. 20 (1987).) the Supreme Court often
acted as though the issue before it was whether a regulation was
valid, when in fact the proper constitutional issue was whether a
constitutionally valid regulation nonetheless required payment of just
compensation. 

  <P>    Confusing the Issue. The Supreme Court also has held sometimes
that a regulation is not a taking of property unless the regulation
leaves the property owner with no remaining "economically viable use"
of his property. (E.g., Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 260
(1980); United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121,
127 (1985). Other cases have explicitly or implicitly rejected this
view. E.g., Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922);
Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982). The
Court has never specified just how remunerative a remaining use must
be in order to count as "economically viable.") This has meant that a
regulation must render the affected property essentially worthless
before the Supreme Court will recognize a taking and award
compensation. In these cases, the Court seems to have confused the
issue of whether a taking has occurred with the issue of how much
should be paid as compensation. 

  <P>    Obviously, if a regulation leaves a property owner with some
remaining "economically viable use" of his property, then the owner is
not entitled to receive the full pre-regulation value of his property
as compensation. The owner is entitled, however, to compensation for
the drop in value resulting from the regulation, regardless of whether
the property's remaining value is great or small, so long as it is
less than the pre-regulation value. There is a middle ground between
paying the full value of the affected property as compensation and
paying nothing. This middle ground consists of paying the value not of
the property in its entirety, but of the easement that de facto has
been taken.
<P>

REVERSING THE TREND

 <P>     In 1987 the Supreme Court's treatment of the Fifth Amendment's
Just Compensation Clause began to change significantly. First, the
Court made clear that the "police power" doctrine, which it often had
used to uphold the validity of statutes, does not apply to takings
claims brought under the Fifth Amendment, and hence does not
constitute an exception to the Just Compensation Clause. (See Keystone
Bituminous Coal Ass'n v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 491 n. 20
(1987).) The Court also explicitly rejected the notion that the only
remedy for a regulatory taking is invalidation of the regulation,
making clear that compensation is an appropriate remedy (When the
government formally seeks to condemn a piece of land, compelling the
owner to sell, it institutes an eminent domain proceeding. When a
landowner whose land has been invaded or restricted by government, but
who has retained legal title in his land due to the government's
failure to invoke the power of eminent domain, wishes to obtain
compensation by compelling the government to buy the land (or at least
an easement therein), he institutes an inverse condemnation
proceeding.) even for a partial or temporary taking. (First English
Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482
U.S. 304 (1987). First English dealt with a temporary taking, but the
underlying principle is equally applicable to permanent takings of
partial interests in property.) The Court further explicitly
recognized that easements are a form of partial taking of property
that can arise in the context of regulation or a permit-application
process. (Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825 (1987). In
Nollan, the Court found a taking where the California Coastal
Commission refused to grant a building permit to owners of beachfront
property unless they agreed to convey to the government an easement
for public access to the beach over their land.) Finally, the Court
explicitly rejected the notion that "economically viable use" of a
landowner's remaining property rights will always necessarily bar an
award of just compensation for an easement that was taken. (Nollan,
483 U.S. at 830, 834-37. See also Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan
CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982). Both of these cases involved
regulatory actions requiring landowners to submit to physical
invasions of their land or buildings by others. However, the principle
of providing partial compensation for a partial taking should apply
regardless of the nature of the easement taken.) 

 <P>     These rulings all made it easier for landowners whose property
rights are taken by regulation to obtain just compensation, prompting
an attorney with the Congressional Research Service to proclaim the
emergence of "a court trend supporting increased protection of private
property against government controls." (137 Cong. Rec. S684 (daily
edition, January 14, 1991) (statement of Senator Symms) (the
identities of the CRS attorney and the publication quoted are not
provided).) 

 <P>     This trend appears likely to continue. The Supreme Court late
last year agreed to hear two cases that will give it an opportunity to
strengthen Fifth Amendment protections of private property. (The Court
heard oral arguments in both cases earlier this year.) The more widely
publicized of the two involves a South Carolina law that prohibits new
building on oceanfront property. (Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal
Council, 112 S. Ct. 436 (cert. granted Nov. 18, 1991) (No. 91-453).)
In this case, a man had bought two beachfront lots in 1986 for a total
of $975,000, planning to build a house for his family on one lot and
to build a house to sell on the other lot. Two years later, South
Carolina passed a law prohibiting new building near the beach. This
law has prevented the man from building a house on his land -- even
though such a house would pose no threat to his neighbors and would be
no closer to the beach than many other nearby lots in the same
development, including those on either side of his, that were built
before the 1988 law was passed. As a result of the law, the two lots
have been rendered virtually worthless.

 <P>     The fact that the Supreme Court has accepted the two cases leads
many observers to predict that the Court will reinvigorate the
constitutional right to just compensation. (The other Fifth Amendment
just compensation case that the Court has agreed to hear involves a
challenge by the owner of a mobile-home park in Escondido, California
to a local rent control ordinance. Yee v. City of Escondido, 112 S.
Ct. 294 (cert. granted October 15, 1991) (No. 90-1947).)

  <P>    Substantial Awards. The trend toward granting compensation for
regulatory takings also has been reflected in the United States Claims
Court, the special federal court in Washington, D.C., that hears all
just compensation claims against the federal government. In 1990, for
example, for the first time ever, the Claims Court held that two
landowners who had been denied permits under the federal Clean Water
Act to use their land in various ways because the government had
classified the land as a "wetland" were entitled to just compensation
because the government failed to prove that the substances that would
have been discharged into the wetlands would have lowered water
quality. (In the vast majority of cases under the Clean Water Act, the
decision to deny a landowner a permit to fill in a wetland has nothing
to do with any polluting properties of the substance that would be
used to fill the wetland; often this substance consists simply of dirt
taken from one part of the wetland and deposited onto another. See
William G. Laffer III, "Protecting Ecologically Valuable Wetlands
without Destroying Property Rights," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder
No. 840, July 15, 1991.) The Claims Court awarded the respective
landowners over $1 million dollars in one case (Florida Rock
Industries v. United States, 21 Cl. Ct. 161 (1990) (involving the
mining of limestone). This case is now on appeal before the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.) and over $2.6 million in another,
(Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 21 Cl. Ct. 153 (1990)
(involving the building of houses). This case is now on appeal before
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.) specifically
basing its decisions on the distinction between tortious and
nontortious uses of land. (See Florida Rock Industries, 21 Cl. Ct. at
166-68. The only damage that is done when a wetland is filled with
chemically harmless material is to the landowner's own property, the
wetland; there is no physical invasion of anyone else's land or water
such as would give rise to a common-law nuisance action. See Epstein,
op. cit., p. 123.) In each case, it was clear that the decision by the
Army Corps of Engineers to deny a permit under the Clean Water Act had
nothing to do with the prevention of water pollution, but instead was
motivated purely by a desire to preserve the wetlands in question as
wetlands. Therefore, the Corps of Engineers was really confiscating an
easement on the landowners' land, taking away some or all of their
development rights.

<P>      While these two cases are on appeal, there is evidence that
higher courts will side with property owners. In a bellwether case,
(Whitney Benefits, Inc. v. United States, 18 Cl. Ct. 394 (1989),
modified, 20 Cl. Ct. 324 (1990), aff'd, 926 F.2d 1169 (Fed. Cir.),
cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 406 (1991).) the Claims Court in 1989 awarded
over $150 million to a company that had been prohibited by the
Department of the Interior from mining coal on its own land. The Court
of Appeals last year affirmed the decision, and the Supreme Court
declined to take the government's appeal, thereby allowing the lower
court decisions to stand. The Supreme Court's decision not to review
the lower courts' rulings in this case is widely viewed as solid
evidence that it will decide the cases currently before it in favor of
justly compensating the landowners. (See, e.g., Moore, "Showdown on
Property Rights," National Journal, November 30, 1991, p. 2940;
"Environment Laws Face a Stiff Test from Landowners," The New York
Times, January 20, 1992, p. A1.)

<P>
PAYING FOR REGULATORY TAKINGS

 <P>     The increased ability of property owners to secure just
compensation when their property rights are taken by regulations means
that the government, and hence the taxpayers, can expect to pay more
in coming years for actions that restrict property rights. As a
consequence of the court rulings of the past five years, and of the
explosive growth in regulation over the past twenty years, the number
of takings claims filed against the government, the frequency with
which property owners seeking just compensation win, and the average
dollar amount awarded to successful claimants all have increased.
<P><UL><UL>
      Consider the following:
<P>
      52 cases alleging the taking of property and seeking
      compensation were filed with the Claims Court last year, the
      most in at least a decade, and possibly the most ever. ( Ibid.)
<P>
      Nearly 200 takings cases are pending in the Claims Court. (Ibid.
      ) The total compensation that the U.S. would have to pay if
      those seeking redress were to win and receive the full amount
      that they are seeking is well over $1 billion.</UL></UL>
<P>
      Although the United States surely will win and thereby avoid
paying compensation in many of these cases, the frequency with which
property owners seeking just compensation win has risen sharply in
recent years. Property owners won more than half of all regulatory
taking cases decided by the federal courts in 1990, the most recent
year for which figures are available. In contrast, the federal
government wins nine out of ten times in other areas of the law.

 <P>     The growth in federal regulation in the past three years, and
the trend in the courts toward protecting private property owners,
means that the government can expect to pay more in the future to
compensate for regulatory takings.

<P>
EXECUTIVE ORDER 12630

 <P>     On March 15, 1988, in response to the Supreme Court's 1987
takings decisions and the perceived increase in the likelihood of the
federal government having to pay increased just compensation awards,
Ronald Reagan issued an Executive Order dealing with "Government
Actions and Interference With Constitutionally Protected Property
Rights." (Exec. Order No. 12630, 53 Fed. Reg. 8859 (March 18, 1988).)
This detailed Executive Order basically requires each department or
agency in the Executive Branch:
<P><UL><UL>
      to consider in advance whether any contemplated action might,
      under the Supreme Court's case law as it stands at the time of
      the agency's or department's determination, be a taking of
      private property, and hence lead to an eventual judgment against
      the U.S. that must be paid by the Treasury;
<P>
      to estimate the potential cost to the federal government of any
      contemplated action regulating the use of private property, in
      the event that a court later determines that the action
      constituted a taking;
<P>
      to look for alternatives that would achieve the same ends but
      would not involve takings or would impose less on private
      property;
<P>
      to decide in advance whether a particular action that may result
      in a taking is worth what it is likely to cost; and 
<P>
      to set regulatory priorities.</UL></UL>
<P>
      The Executive Order also gives the departments and agencies
detailed and specific instructions on how to minimize the burdens
imposed on private property and the resulting liabilities imposed on
the Treasury. These instructions include: 
<P><UL><UL>
      avoiding undue delays in granting or denying permits, and in
      making other decisions affecting private property;
<P>
      ensuring that permits are granted or denied based on the same
      standard; (This requirement has been violated often in the past.
      The Army Corps of Engineers, for example, routinely abuses its
      enforcement authority under the Clean Water Act, which is purely
      an anti-pollution statute, by granting permits for discharges of
      materials that pose no threat to water quality only on the
      condition that the landowner set aside land for wildlife
      protection at his own expense.)
<P>
      ensuring that restrictions imposed on the use of private
      property are not disproportionate to the contribution of the
      restricted uses to the overall problem that the restrictions are
      imposed to redress.</UL></UL>
<P>
      The purpose of all these measures is to avoid taking private
property inadvertently, and thereby to avoid incurring unanticipated
costs to the taxpayers.

 <P>     Executive Order 12630 does not add to or alter the Fifth
Amendment's requirement that just compensation be paid, the
probability that those landowners whose property is taken will be
paid, or the amount that they will recover if they are paid. It simply
requires Executive Branch agencies and departments to anticipate the
potential fiscal consequences of their actions. 

 <P>     Given the recent changes in the Supreme Court's standards for
awarding just compensation, if federal officials fail to conduct such
an inquiry before acting, they run a significant risk that the federal
government will get stuck with an unexpected bill several years later.
This also would mean that the government could end up being compelled
to pay for properties that it would not have chosen to buy if it had
thought about its priorities in advance. Thus, the Executive Order is
really just a "look before you leap" provision designed primarily to
protect the taxpayers. It mainly is a budgetary tool -- a device for
controlling spending.
<P>
      Paying Costs of Regulation. Yet, the Executive Order also
protects property owners. Since regulators will be forced to refrain
from taking actions that they cannot afford to pay for, many
regulatory takings of private property will be deterred. Regulators no
longer will be able to treat private property as a free good, usable
without limit and without cost. Instead they will have to decide how
much regulation they can afford. 

 <P>     Thus, even though the Executive Order does not affect the
ability of those whose property is taken to obtain compensation, it
will still protect landowners. After all, landowners who have their
property taken without their consent and who receive court-determined
compensation almost always would prefer to forego the compensation and
keep their land. (Presumably even then they would still be entitled to
receive compensation for any temporary taking that had occurred.)
There are two reasons why this is so. First, if the compensation
provided were worth as much in the eyes of the landowner as the
property taken, the landowner would sell voluntarily, and the
government would gain nothing by taking rather than buying. Second,
compensation is risky and uncertain, and difficult and expensive to
seek and obtain. (However, under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and
Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. 4654(c),
those who succeed in obtaining an award of compensation for the taking
of property by a federal agency also receive, as part of their award,
reimbursement for any "reasonable costs, disbursements, and expenses,
including reasonable attorney, appraisal, and engineering fees," that
they are forced to incur in order to obtain their compensation from
the government.) Therefore, although court-determined compensation is
better than nothing, landowners generally would be better off if their
land had not been taken in the first place.
<P>
BEYOND THE EXECUTIVE ORDER: THE NEED FOR A STATUTE
<P>
      Although the Executive Order is a major step toward protecting
private property rights, it lacks the force of law. Officers and
employees of the Executive Branch have no statutory obligation to
comply with the order. Any President, moreover, may rescind the order
at any time. Explains Senator Malcolm Wallop, the Wyoming Republican:
<P><UL><UL>
      But the order is not without shortcomings. It has no teeth.
      Without the possibility of judicial review or the
      requirement of disclosure, the executive branch can ignore
      the order with impunity. Moreover, as with all executive
      orders, it can be withdrawn on a whim. (136 Cong. Rec.
      S10917 (daily edition, July 27, 1990) (statement of Senator
      Wallop).)</UL></UL>

  <P>    To date, some parts of the Executive Branch have been more
diligent and enthusiastic in complying with the Executive Order than
others. Regulators in the EPA, for example, have resisted the
Executive Order because they view it as a threat to their ability to
regulate. (Specifically, the EPA opposed adoption of the Executive
Order, attempted to soften its requirements as much as possible,
attempted to soften the guidelines for implementing the Executive
Order, and actively lobbied against legislation aimed at reinforcing
the Executive Order until the Administration had officially endorsed
the legislation.) In practice, the easiest way to circumvent the
Executive Order is routinely to find "no takings implications" when
performing the "Takings Implication Assessment" required by the
Attorney General's guidelines for implementing the Executive Order.
Existing Supreme Court and lower court precedents are sufficiently
open-ended to allow such a conclusion to be reached in many instances
without an obvious breach of good faith. The Executive Order,
meanwhile, does not limit the government's ability to regulate. The
Takings Clause and the Executive Order allow regulation, but merely
require that it be budgeted before the fact, in the case of the
Executive Order, and paid for after the fact, in the case of Takings
Clause. 

 <P>     To strengthen the Executive Order and give it the force of law,
Senator Symms introduced his Private Property Rights Act, S. 50. The
Bush Administration strongly supports S. 50, and the Senate approved
the bill last year. The House of Representatives, however, has not yet
even considered the measure. The proposed legislation states that:
<P> <UL><UL>
      No regulation promulgated after the date of enactment of
      this Act by any agency shall become effective until the
      issuing agency is certified by the Attorney General to be
      in compliance with Executive Order 12630 or similar
      procedures to assess the potential for the taking of
      private property in the course of Federal regulatory
      activity, with the goal of minimizing such taking where
      possible. (S. 50, 102nd Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1991).)</UL></UL>
<P> 
This language would prevent any new regulation from taking
effect unless the agency issuing the regulation:
<P> <UL><UL>
1)    has adopted procedures for assessing the potential impact of its
      regulatory activity on private property, as required by the
      Executive Order; and 

2)    has had its compliance with the applicable procedures certified
      by the Attorney General.</UL></UL>

 <P>      Not only would the Symms bill force the bureaucracies to take
the Executive Order more seriously by putting conditions on their
ability to regulate, but it would make permanent the protection
afforded to private property by the Executive Order. Executive
departments and agencies would not be able to regulate until the
Attorney General had certified their compliance with the applicable
procedures for assessing the impact of regulatory activity on private
property. And the Attorney General cannot certify such compliance if
such procedures do not exist. Therefore, no subsequent President could
rescind the Executive Order without replacing it with something
equivalent. 

<P>       By making the bureaucrats' ability to regulate conditional upon
their compliance with the Executive Order, or with any similar
procedures that might be adopted in the future, the legislation
proposed by Senator Symms would give regulators an incentive to
respect private property rights.

 <P>      Holding Agencies Accountable. The Symms bill, however, goes only
part way in defending the Fifth Amendment. To prompt regulators to
take the greatest care when regulating property, for example, a bill
could require all just compensation awards to come out of the budget
of the agency or department that had imposed the regulations.
Currently all such judgments come out of a "Judgment Fund"
appropriated separately from any individual agency's or department's
budget. The Executive Order requires the Office of Management and
Budget to "take action to ensure that all takings awards levied
against agencies are properly accounted for in agency budget
submissions." But this requirement is not binding on Congress and may
be repealed by the President at any time. Last year the Bush
Administration proposed legislation that would require agencies and
departments to reimburse the Judgment Fund out of their individual
budgets, but not Representative or Senator has yet introduced the
Administration's bill.
<P> 
CONCLUSION

 <P>      A fundamental goal of government is to protect the property of
its citizens. Each American correctly considers it her or his
birthright to be free to acquire land on which to build a home or to
use however she or he sees fit, so long as this use does not interfere
physically with the rights of neighbors. Businesses acquire land for
productive use, providing goods, services and jobs for Americans.

 <P>      Reducing the Regulatory Burden. When the government takes or
restricts the use of property for some public good, it must compensate
the owner. This is stated plainly in the Fifth Amendment. Without this
compensation, the government ceases being the protector of property
and instead becomes its violator. In America, based as it is on
individual rights and private enterprise, the government should go out
of its way to assure that property rights are strictly protected. The
Symms bill will make certain that property owners are compensated for
government restrictions or takings of their property. And it will help
stem the growth of regulations that not only affect individuals but
impose a heavy burden on a currently staggering economy as well.

<center><h3>WHAT THE GAS TAX COSTS STATE ECONOMIES</h3>

F.Y.I. No. 100<br>

<P>
<a href="fyi100.gif">Table 1</a>: Estimated Revenue Raised by 4.3 Cent per Gallon Federal Gas Tax, 1996
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress is now considering repealing the 4.3 cent federal tax imposed under the 1993 budget plan championed by the Clinton Administration.  Gasoline prices at service stations across the country have risen sharply over the last few months, raising concerns over the impact of these rising prices on already strained family budgets.  Nationally, since the beginning of the year, gas prices have risen approximately 16 cents.  In California, where prices have risen even more dramatically, gasoline now costs more than $2 a gallon in some areas.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While recent gas price hikes are an unwelcome added cost to family budgets, they actually are far exceeded by the total gas taxes paid by Americans.  Combined federal and state gas taxes per gallon of gasoline now average 37.7 cents, more than twice the recent short-term spike caused by market conditions.  These taxes raise the cost of driving a car an average of $310 per year.  In response to the growing public concern over prices and the economic impact of the tax burden, Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX) introduced a <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.1727:">bill</a> on May 2 which would repeal the 1993 federal fuel tax of 4.3 cents applying to gasoline and diesel.  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) also is expected soon to offer a bill that will repeal the gas and diesel tax and possibly may roll back the 4.3 cent tax on jet fuel as well.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Eliminating the 1993 gas tax is a good start.  While gasoline would still be subject to a 14 cent federal tax, as well as substantial state taxes, repealing the 4.3 cent tax would benefit the economy by reducing transportation costs.  It also would help family budgets.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unlike the rest of the federal gasoline tax, the 4.3 cent levy is not earmarked for transportation costs.  It flows instead into general revenues.  As Senator Dole has said, at least the previous gasoline taxes "helped build highways and bridges, but this tax was just for deficit reduction.  It doesn't do a thing for highways or bridges.... If we repeal this tax, it'll be 4 cents cheaper at the pump.  If we can find an offset, then we should repeal this tax."  Melvin Sherbert, Chairman of the Legislative Committee of the National Service Station Dealers and owner of two service stations himself, confirmed that tax savings would be passed on directly to consumers.  Sherbert testified on May 3 before theSenate Finance Committee that "We would pass the savings on because we are just waiting to lower prices [because] that helps us sell more gas while still making the same profit [per gallon]."<sup>1</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The poor and lower middle class would be the biggest beneficiaries of this repeal.  Susan Perry, Senior Vice President of the American Bus Association, testified on May 3 before the Senate Finance Committee that as the result of higher fuel costs since the imposition of the fuel tax, "there are fewer bus stops [and] the very poor, very elderly and very rural are mostly affected" because they disproportionately ride buses and fuel costs are passed on to passengers.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, since the fuel tax is a flat 4.3 cents per gallon, it is regressive.  Because three-quarters of those Americans earning less than $10,000 per year commute to work in privately owned autos, a flat tax rate falls disproportionately on these poor as a percent of their income.<sup>3</sup>  Indeed, 1987 Bureau of Labor statistics data show that the poorest 20 percent of Americans devote 8.8 percent of their expenditures to gasoline and motor oil while the wealthiest 20 percent devote only 3.1 percent of their expenditures to gasoline and motor oil.<sup>4</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The benefit to the economy of repealing the fuel tax would be significant.  Carol Hallett, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Air Transport Association of America, testified that the airline "industry estimates that passing on this [4.3 cents per gallon tax] cost results in five million fewer passengers a year [due to higher ticket prices.  This] correlates to a loss of 1 passenger per flight.  This statistic alone is enough to drop many flights into the loss column, and will surely result in airlines cutting back."<sup>5</sup>  And according to the trucking industry, the 4.3 cent tax adds about $600 per truck annually to the cost of operations.<sup>6</sup>  These costs in turn are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher priced products.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The burden of this tax for 1996 is $5.3 billion for gasoline alone and $7.4 billion total, based on Department of Energy daily use estimates.<sup>7</sup>  Too often ignored, however, is the regional and state disparity in the impact of this tax.  To assess the state-by-state impact of the 4.3 cent tax on motor, distillate, and jet fuel, we calculated the tax for each state based on Department of Energy state summaries of usage patterns for 1993, the most recent year for which complete data are available.<sup>8</sup>  While the pattern among states may have changed slightly between 1993 and today, the estimates of the tax burden in general would be higher than our state-by-state figures because of increases in consumption.<sup>9</sup>  According to this calculation, the drain on California alone is $772 million based on 1993 usage, while New York and Pennsylvania combined, with about the same number of people, have a cost of $586 million.

<title>How To Salvage Agriculture Reforms In Budget Reconciliation -- Heritage</title>

<h3><i>HOW TO SALVAGE AGRICULTURE REFORMS IN BUDGET RECONCILIATION</i></h3>

By John E. Frydenlund<br>
Director, Agricultural Policy Project<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Issue Bulletin No. 219<br>
November 9, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
As conferees work to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of budget reconciliation, they will determine whether any real agriculture reform will occur this year. Only the House has included fundamental reforms of some of the existing farm programs -- changes in the wheat, feed grain, cotton, rice, and dairy programs embodied in House Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts's Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195).<sup>1</sup>  Unfortunately, neither the House nor the Senate has offered any significant reform of the sugar or peanut programs or the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). If Congress is serious about accomplishing anything close to real reform this year, it should adopt the House proposals. In addition, when Congress considers the farm bill either later this year or in 1996, those programs that were overlooked in reconciliation must be addressed.<sup>2</sup>
<p>

<b>COMPARING THE HOUSE AND SENATE AGRICULTURE PROVISIONS</b>
<p>
The only meaningful reforms of agriculture programs still being considered as a part of budget reconciliation are the Freedom to Farm Act provisions included by the House (Table 1 presents a comparison of the key agriculture provisions in the House and Senate reconciliation bills). These reforms would replace traditional payments for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice with transitional payments that decline over a period of seven years. The House eliminates the deficiency payments based upon target prices, ending the federal government's role in telling farmers what and how much to produce. The House also eliminates the marketing loan payments and the three-entity rule, which would end the preferential treatment for cotton and rice and close the payment limitation loophole that allows these farmers to receive as much as $250,000 annually. In addition, the House bill provides similar reform of the dairy program, eliminating price supports and marketing orders and replacing them with transition payments. 
<p>
The Senate failed to include any reform of these programs, other than elimination of annual acreage reduction programs and the farmer-owned reserve, reforms also embodied in the House reconciliation package. The conferees should accept the reforms provided in the House version. Otherwise, there would be no meaningful reform of the current agriculture programs, and America's farmers will be denied the chance to capitalize upon the opportunities a free market provides.
<p>
In fact, the Senate would move away from real, free-market reform of the dairy program by establishing a "Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact" that provides a competitive advantage to dairy producers in six states.<sup>3</sup>  Under the Compact, a governing commission would set a minimum price for all milk produced in the Northeast region above the price set by milk marketing orders. Producers and processors from outside this region will be precluded from competing in these six states because no milk from outside the compact states will be allowed to come in at a lower price. This not only will increase prices to consumers in the Northeast, but also will create potentially costly surpluses that must be purchased by the American taxpayer. 
<p>
Even worse, the Senate bill establishes a two-tiered pricing system by requiring compensatory payments for nonfat dry milk used in higher value products. Allowing a lower price for nonfat dry milk being exported while setting a higher price for U.S. dairy and food manufacturers using nonfat dry milk in their products amounts to imposing a "powder tax" on domestic manufacturers who use nonfat dried milk as an ingredient. The Senate bill also establishes a mechanism for national pooling of milk prices by requiring milk producers in most areas of the country to pay into a "pool" to subsidize lower prices received for surplus milk products from other areas. The Senate provisions, rather than provide reform as in the House version, takes an already archaic system of milk pricing under the Federal Milk Marketing Orders and imposes more unnecessary federal regulation on the dairy industry.
<p>
The only positive provision in the Senate version, which is absent from the House version, provides that farm program authorities expire at the end of seven years. The House bill would establish the Commission on 21st Century Production Agriculture, ostensibly for the purpose of identifying the appropriate future relationship between the federal government and production agriculture after 2002. This proposal simply represents a delaying tactic. There is ample evidence pointing to the advantages of getting the federal government out of the business of centrally managing U.S. agriculture.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
Finally, both the House and Senate failed to include any meaningful reform of the sugar or peanut programs because reform advocates were virtually frozen out of any opportunity to offer amendments that would have reformed these archaic programs. They also failed to effect significant reform of the Conservation Reserve Program, which removes millions of sustainable acres from productive use. These programs should be addressed in the farm bill. 
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
House and Senate agriculture conferees for budget reconciliation should adopt many of the reforms embodied in the House reconciliation bill. These proposals would begin to free America's farmers to produce for the world marketplace rather than for the dictates of the federal bureaucracy. These include provisions which provide significant reform of the wheat, feed grain, cotton, rice, and dairy programs. The benefits are increased farm income and greater economic growth. Conferees must reject most of the Senate provisions, which, at best, preserve the status quo and, for dairy in particular, actually make the programs more restrictive and uncompetitive. Finally, in other program areas, such as peanuts, sugar, and the Conservation Reserve Program, little or no reform is accomplished in either the House or Senate versions of reconciliation. Therefore, Congress must address the reform of these programs in the farm bill.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The 104th Congress has a rare opportunity to reform American agricultural policy and provide a huge boost to the U.S. economy. The current system of centrally planned commodity support programs, export subsidies, supply controls, acreage allotments, production quotas, and restrictions on trade imports holds back American farmers. This makes it impossible for them to benefit from the growing world market and denies farming-related industries the economic boost of higher farm production.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Freeing the U.S. farm economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market would mean huge economic benefits for Americans. An analysis by Heritage Senior Fellow David Winston and Research Analysts Rea Hederman and Christine L. Olson indicates that such reform would generate as much as $135 billion in new economic activity over ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In <I>Freeing America's Farmers:  The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity</I>, The Heritage Foundation has proposed that Congress immediately end all supply control programs.<sup>1</sup> The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which is more a supply control than conservation program, harms the rural economy more than all other supply control programs combined because it keeps about 36 million acres out of production. The Heritage plan would reform the CRP immediately by neither renewing expiring contracts nor entering into any new ones. Farmers with existing contracts would be given the option to withdraw from the program before their contract expiration date. In return, they would receive 33 percent of the payment to which they otherwise would have been entitled for the duration of their contract.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two legislative proposals before Congress:  the Farm Freedom Act (H.R. 2010), sponsored by Representatives Richard Zimmer (R-NJ) and Charles Schumer (D-NY), and the Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195), sponsored by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), would end the use of annual supply controls for the wheat, feed grain, cotton, and rice programs. However, neither addresses the fundamental CRP problem. Only proposals that remove the federal government from the business of managing supply and demand can increase farm income from the marketplace while stimulating overall economic growth.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If farmers were free of the controls that now restrict output, they would enjoy a surge in new income even when modest declines in prices are taken into account. The comprehensive model of the agriculture economy developed by The Heritage Foundation indicates that additional net farm income from the marketplace in 1996 would exceed $2 billion. By the year 2001, it would be nearly $4 billion, and between 1996 and 2001, it would exceed $18 billion. The state-by-state impact on farm income of the Heritage Foundation's agriculture reform proposal can be found in <I>Freeing America's Farmers</I>.
<p><b>

HOW INCREASED FARM INCOME WILL PRODUCE AN ECONOMIC BOOM FOR STATES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Although some states would not immediately make dramatic farm income gains or would take longer to become net farm income winners, farmers in most states would gain significantly under the Heritage plan.<sup>2</sup> But an increase in farm production also has an economic impact on farm-related business. Freeing U.S. farmers would bring millions of previously idle acres back into productive use. This would require increased use of agricultural inputs, such as seed, fertilizer, and equipment, in addition to expansion of the food processing industry and greater demand for packaging, transportation, and shipping.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The appendix presents state-level data for 1996-2005 to show the value of the additional economic activity that would be generated by changes in farm income under the Heritage agriculture reform proposal. In this ten-year period, the overall economy would expand by $134.9 billion, with every state sharing in the economic expansion. Even some states that are not major agricultural producers would enjoy a boost because they supply farmers elsewhere or handle farm products. In fact, the national economy would grow by $10.9 billion in just the first year. And states benefit because they have business activity related to the farm economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Example:  Kansas and Texas each would enjoy a $1 billion boost to the economy in the first year, and Iowa would benefit by almost $800 million. States with significant agricultural production, such as Kansas (a large wheat producer), Iowa (a leading corn producer), or Texas (a large state producing many crops), reap the greatest economic benefits because most of the increased economic activity would remain in the state in which the additional farm income is generated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Example:  Even non-agriculture states reap sizable economic benefits. Because the Heritage analysis assumes that as much as 75 percent of the new production would go to the export market, a number of states with significant export facilities but minimal agricultural production would receive large economic benefits. For instance, although a state like Rhode Island does not produce a great quantity of agricultural product, its economy would benefit from increased shipping and transportation activities, especially those related to exports. In fact, any state with significant export activities or port facilities, such as Louisiana and a number of other coastal and Great Lakes states, would derive more in benefits than they have contributed through increased agricultural production.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Also, a major share of the increased agricultural production would mean new business for firms engaged in processing, converting raw agricultural commodities into value-added products for both export and domestic use, and livestock production. Therefore, any state with a significant livestock industry or food processing facilities also would gain more than it generates simply through increased agricultural production. 

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the next few weeks, Congress will consider the 1995 farm bill, probably as a part of budget reconciliation. Congress must take advantage of this compelling opportunity to effect fundamental reforms in U.S. agricultural policy. If the 1995 farm bill eliminates supply controls such as acreage reduction programs, ends the government's role in manipulating supply and demand through subsidies, and phases out the CRP, not only will farm income increase significantly, but the national economy will expand by over $135 billion over the next ten years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 Some Members of Congress have advocated proposals that would do nothing more than protect the status quo and thus would fail to capture any of these potential gains. On the other hand, two proposals, H.R. 2010 and H.R. 2195, do eliminate some of the supply control programs, which would benefit farmers and related businesses. However, unless Congress enacts complete reform, including termination of the CRP, the U.S. economy will be denied the growth that can be achieved only with an end to central planning in agriculture. 

<p>
<b>APPENDIX:  THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION MODEL</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation Farm Income Projection Model, described in detail in <I>Freeing America's Farmers</I>, projects what would happen to future farm income (1996-2005) should just over three-quarters of all idled land come back into production, based on a historical analysis of the farm sector from 1990-1993. In our model we assumed that overall, about 80 percent of government-idled land would come back into production. These additional acres would yield only 95 percent as much as land currently being farmed, and costs of production would be 5 percent higher. For all cropland in our analysis, yields would increase 0.5 percent each through 2005 due to productivity gains. Finally, we assumed that because of growing overseas demand, the increase in supply would have a minimal impact on prices. The greatest effect would be in 1996, when prices would drop 4 percent. By 2005 this loss would be more than recouped.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In keeping with estimates of the gain in farm income contained in <I>Freeing America's Farmers</I>, the Heritage Foundation's more comprehensive estimates of increased economic activity are conservative in their assumptions. In the model to estimate farm income gains, we assumed that future productivity gains would be only one half of one percent annually and estimated relatively higher costs of production for new acreage relative to existing acreage. Thus, the model significantly understated potential income gains, and our conclusions about changes in farm income presented the worst case scenario, suggesting that some states would take much longer to become net farm income winners.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some states would take longer because the model assumed that farmers would continue to grow whatever crop they previously produced or currently were producing and that production on new acreage would simply reflect their historical growing patterns, even when this would cause a loss of income. However, if allowed to produce for the marketplace rather than for the government, farmers would not use their available acreage to produce any crop that resulted in a negative income. If there is no alternative crop available to generate a net profit from production on the new acreage, the farmer's rational decision would be to leave that land idle rather than produce a crop at a loss. Therefore, our model showed income losses for farmers when, at worst, there would have been no gain.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By comparison, a study by Abel, Daft and Early estimated an expansion of $28.9 billion dollars for one year, based on ending supply controls.<sup>3</sup> However, their estimate also assumed that there was no reduction in deficiency payments, which then were credited with contributing to the overall economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In estimating the additional economic activity generated by increases in farm income, we assumed that most, though not all, of the new product will be sold overseas to meet the growing demand for food in Africa and the Pacific Rim. While it is true that increased production could trigger faster development of new consumer products and new uses for the domestic market as well as for the international market, we estimate only the increase in economic activity that would be derived from increases in exports.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Heritage analysis is based on the gross business multiplier of all agricultural exports developed by Gerald Schluter and William Edmondson of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. Their multiplier factor is based on a recognition that "in a highly interrelated economy like that of the United States, many more people benefit from agricultural exports than just farmers and exporters and their employees."  Schluter and Edmondson specifically point to firms that provide materials and services used by farmers and others to provide the export goods as beneficiaries of increased economic activity that leads to business growth, in addition to businesses which sell consumer goods and find that their customers spend more income when trade expands.<sup>4</sup>

<h3><i>WHY BUDGET DEBATE MUST NOT SIDELINE AGRICULTURAL REFORM</h3></i>
<p>
By John E. Frydenlund<br>
Director, Agricultural Policy Project<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 417<br>
June 16, 1995<br>

<p>

    Conferees are working now to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of
the FY 1996 budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 67). One area they need to address more boldly is
agriculture. Decisions made during the budget process about funding for U.S. agriculture programs
will have an impact far beyond budget deficit considerations. It may be politically expedient to make
only minor modifications in farm programs, but this would be harmful to farmers in the long run.
Congress must not allow the budget process to thwart the bold reforms needed to enhance U.S.
competitiveness, increase farm income, and revitalize the rural economy. More specifically, Congress
should not make agricultural policy decisions in budget reconciliation that preclude pursuing real
reform in the 1995 farm bill.
<p>
     While the need for serious deficit reduction should spur agricultural reform, Congress resists
change. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-NM) initially sought farm program
reductions of $35 billion-$50 billion over the next five years. However, after intense lobbying by
opponents of reform, the final Senate budget resolution reduced the planned savings to only $28
billion. In addition, a non-binding resolution limits savings from commodity programs to no more
than 20 percent of the total, so Congress must find $22.5 billion in savings from nutrition programs.
In the House budget resolution, nutrition programs must absorb more than two-thirds of the
reductions -- $21 billion -- and commodity programs less than one-third. Senate Agriculture
Committee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN) has suggested that $15 billion in savings could be found
in the  commodity and export programs, which would be an even split with nutrition programs. 
<p>
    Being required to find significant savings in commodity programs might force Congress to
adopt real reform. However, if the budget conferees settle on a lower level of savings, perhaps only
$9 billion or less, they are likely to wind up merely tinkering with existing ineffective programs, and
the opportunity for real reform will be lost. Opponents could thwart real reform, particularly in the
House, by incorporating the farm bill into budget reconciliation and bringing it to the floor with rules
that prevent either amendments or votes on specific programs. This would prevent the rest of
Congress, particularly advocates of fundamental reform, from voting for elimination of the sugar,
peanut, and supply control programs, for example, or a much-needed phaseout of the commodity
subsidies upon which supply controls are built.
<p>
    Opponents of fundamental reform claim they are protecting the interests of America's farmers.
But central planning has worked no better in agriculture than it has anywhere else it has ever been
tried. It holds back   farmers and makes them work to satisfy bureaucrats, not consumers. Nor do
farm programs protect small family farmers:  payments go overwhelmingly to the wealthiest farmers. 
<p>
    The most absurd argument put forward by opponents is that structural reform actually would
result in budgetary costs to the government. This contention rests on two fallacies:
<p>

<b>Budget Fallacy #1:</b>  Eliminating acreage reduction programs would cost the government money.
<p>
    Eliminating acreage reduction programs would cost the government money only if the
additional acres planted were eligible to receive the current level of deficiency payments and there
were only modest reductions in the subsidy level per acre. 
<p>
    Proposals such as those advanced by The Heritage Foundation, however, would eliminate
acreage reduction programs and phase out deficiency payments. Rather than receive payments for
crops planted on this additional acreage, farmers would be free to plant whatever it made sense to
produce for the market. This proposal would save the taxpayer billions of dollars, allow farmers to
produce what they want on these additional acres, increase farm income, and stimulate the rural
economy. Under any credible analysis, eliminating acreage reduction programs increases farm
income. The new export opportunities made possible under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, among other factors, allow output to increase substantially with only a short-term weakening
of prices. The result:  revenue per farm increases.
<p>
    The static economic analyses preferred by defenders of the status quo erroneously assume that
relatively  modest increases in production result in extreme reductions in the market price, inevitably
concluding that eliminating acreage reduction increases government costs. But this ignores recent
bumper crops that did not result in lower prices, as well as evidence that there will be a rapid growth
in the future global demand for food.
<p>

<b>Budget Fallacy #2:</b>  Some programs, such as sugar, are important revenue producers. 
<p>
    By imposing duties on strictly limited imports of sugar, the federal government did indeed
raise about $3   million in the last fiscal year. Proponents of the sugar program also point to
government receipts for assessments on domestic sugar production. These amounted to only $24
million in FY 1994, while the extra costs to consumers was $1.4 billion. This is a heavy economic
price to pay for a program that gives a small cartel of sugar processors and landlords the power to
parcel out the right to grow sugar.
<p>
    For Congress to buy these fallacious arguments would be to allow the special interests to stop
reforms that would help America's farmers and rural communities. Congress has a rare opportunity
this year to demonstrate to American farmers, consumers, and taxpayers that it truly is working in
their best interests. Current commodity programs not only are expensive for taxpayers, but also hold
down farm income. Moving toward a free market would permit farmers to produce for the consumer
rather than for the government.
<p>
    A free market reform of agricultural policy would:
<p>
<ul> <li>Eliminate all authority for acreage reduction and set-aside programs;<br>

<li>Eliminate the sugar and peanut programs;<br>

<li>Phase out deficiency payments for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice and phase out the dairy
program; and<br>

<li>Phase out the Conservation Reserve Program.</ul> 
<p>
     The 1995 farm bill is an historic opportunity to develop market-oriented reforms of
agricultural policy. The budget reconciliation process should not be used to block such reform. If
Congress allows this to happen, the U.S. share of world agriculture markets will continue to shrink,
eroding farm income and hurting rural communities. But if the 1995 farm bill eliminates government
subsidies and controls, America's farmers will be able to   outproduce and outsell the rest of the
world, with their expanded output generating a tremendous growth in farm income. This freedom to
produce will also mean a large boost to the rural economy as supply and distribution industries retool
and reinvest to meet the new demands of a larger farm economy. In fact, according to  Heritage
estimates, rural America would get a $35 billion shot in the arm, which would include an increase in
farm income of more than $14 billion over the next five years. Many communities that are dying
under today's command-and-control programs would spring back to life.1

<h3>U.S. Agricultural Policy: An Australian Perspective</h3>
<p>
Delivered June 7, 1995  by The Honorable Bob Collins,<br>
Minister for Primary Industries and Senator for the Northern Territories, Australia.
<p>
Australians who watch policy debates in the United States have been impressed by the contribution The Heritage Foundation has been making, especially since last November's congressional election and the emergence of a Republican-controlled Congress.
<p>
The recent Heritage Foundation study on U.S. agriculture policy and its recommendations for reforms in agriculture policy in the 1995 farm bill is one we applaud -- although, before starting on my main points, I might say that I don't oppose all forms of government support for agriculture. Personally, I support government contributions to agriculture research and development, and in Australia we have developed what I consider is a very effective form of R & D partnership between government and industry. Also, we have developed what I believe is an effective form of adjustment assistance to farmers, which we call our rural adjustment scheme. 
<p>
Our policy, in essence, is not to provide those forms of assistance which directly intervene in the pricing or production processes. 
<p>
Australia is a major agriculture producer and exporter which has a fundamental interest in seeing liberalization in world agriculture. We export around 80 percent of our agriculture produce, and for many commodities the figure is higher. We are the world's largest exporter of wool, meat, and sugar and a leading exporter of wheat, coarse grains, dairy products, rice, fruit and vegetables, and cotton.
<p>
You may not be aware of the large trading surplus the U.S. currently enjoys with Australia. Last year the surplus was over $7 billion -- the largest trading surplus the U.S. had with any country. The trade balance is currently running at 3:1 in your favor. 
<p>
From Australia's perspective, our trade deficit with the U.S. as a proportion of GDP or on a per capita basis is larger than the U.S. deficit with Japan, and we are all aware of the bitterness that imbalance has caused.
<p>
It is little wonder that Australian governments and farmers react with some hostility to U.S. agriculture policies which subsidize U.S. exports into markets which are of significance to Australia or erect barriers to Australian agriculture exports to the U.S. Our agriculture is  almost totally unsubsidized, and, along with New Zealand, we are the only OECD nations which can claim such status. With a vital interest in bringing about uncorrupted world markets in agriculture, Australia for many years has been a strong advocate for global agriculture policy reform. No sector of world commerce or trade suffers more government intervention or trade-distorting measures than agriculture.
<p>
At the beginning of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, Australia convened a group of 14 fair trading nations in agriculture which became known as the Cairns Group. Australia continues to chair the Cairns Group, which has become the third force in world agriculture after the U.S. and Europe. Australia and the Cairns Group welcomed the outcome in agriculture in the Uruguay Round, although we were disappointed that the final outcome was less than initial expectations. 
<p>
The Uruguay Round outcome is regarded only as a first step. Cairns Group ministers recently met in Manila and reaffirmed that the group would be active in seeking further reform in world agriculture trade. In particular, the Group will be vigilant in ensuring that there is no circumvention, either in the spirit or letter, of Uruguay Round commitments. The Group intends to monitor very closely developments in agriculture policy in major countries, including the U.S., the E.U., Japan, and Korea.
<p>
Australia and the Cairns Group believe that the 1995 farm bill is an important test of the agriculture reform process and an opportunity to develop more market-oriented agriculture reforms. We acknowledge that the U.S. farm bill is largely a domestic policy process, but countries such as Australia have a legitimate role in the debate as U.S. agriculture policies have a significant impact on world agriculture markets. 
<p>
We have been seeking to play an active and constructive role in the debate. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has published a number of studies highlighting the impact of U.S. policies on world agriculture markets and the positive   benefits that would accrue from market-oriented reforms. In fact, ABARE have just released a research monograph on U.S. agricultural policies. We intend to make the report widely available here in Washington to assist those involved in developing proposals for the farm bill.
<p>
In short, we would like to see the 1995 farm bill move in the direction of fundamental market reform and many of the more market-distorting individual commodity programs eliminated. Certainly, the 1995 farm bill should be consistent with the letter and spirit of U.S. commitments in the Uruguay Round, but I also believe that some of the lessons we have learned at home could well be applied in the 1995 farm bill. When we came to office, we were faced with the need to cut our budget deficit; this year we brought our budget back into surplus. We believe strongly that, in our own interests, we should move the whole economy towards a greater market orientation. We therefore decided to pursue a farm policy which would require our farmers to confront the realities of the world market.
<p>
Not surprisingly, many of our farmers were very fearful of this approach, especially those industries which received subsidies, such as our dairy industry, which I'll use as an illustration of the practical effects of our policies. Ten years ago, our dairy industry was on the verge of collapse, and it was widely believed that Australia would have to rely on New Zealand for supply of dairy products. Since we began the reform process, the industry as a whole has blossomed, increasing its production and profitability and doubling its exports over the last ten years. 
<p>
Our farmers are rising to the challenge of a competitive world market. They, like you in America, view the booming Asian markets as a very strong source of growth. Adjustment has taken place, and the number of dairy farmers has fallen by 30 percent. However, over the past ten years, the production of milk in Australia has increased by one third, and the volume of exports has more than doubled. Industry profits and land prices have improved considerably, and the 70 percent of farmers remaining are now contemplating a sustainable future -- provided a fair trading environment exists.
<p>
The dairy support system in the United States is a good example of why Australia has a  legitimate interest in the farm bill debate. It is a complex web of artificial mechanisms designed to support domestic prices for dairy products and is administered by thousands of bureaucrats who balance the effect of those programs. On the export side, the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) is used as a tool to draw surplus product away from the U.S.    domestic market to maintain consumer transfers to dairy farmers, estimated by ABARE at $9 billion each year (resulting in almost all dairy exports being effectively subsidized).     Expansion of the DEIP into Asia will depress prices for everyone and would have the effect of Australian dairy farmers paying for those subsidies as well.
<P>
I could give other examples from our rural sector. Since reforms were introduced, the     rural sector's volume of output has grown significantly despite a reduction in farm numbers consistent with international trends. Land values, while fluctuating, have not declined in real terms. There is no comprehensive safety net for Australian farmers. The application of sound policy principles to agriculture has benefited not only the economy generally, but   agriculture itself. 
<P>
Our efforts to create an internationally competitive agriculture sector are hampered,    however, by the continued presence of export subsidization by the U.S. and the European Union. 
<P>
While in Washington this week, I met personally with E.U. Commissioner Fischler and expressed our continuing strong concerns with E.U. subsidies. I am conscious of the concerns in the U.S. about Canadian grain subsidies, but I believe your problems with Canada should be resolved through NAFTA rather than in third markets. While we acknowledge U.S. assurances that their programs are not aimed at Australia, we are concerned by the emerging trend towards the use of subsidies as a market development tool. In particular, forthcoming announcements under the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) for 1995/96 are a matter for serious concern.
<P>
I have been leaving a strong message in Washington that EEP and DEIP not be further extended in Asia/Pacific markets. We have sensitive markets for wheat, wheat flour, barley, rice, and barley malt and dairy products in the Asia/Pacific region. The U.S. is correct in identifying these markets as key targets for growth, but the large future volumes in these markets will obviate the need for subsidized sales.
<P>
The other aspect of the bilateral relationship that still causes us concern is access for our products. Beef access has improved under the Uruguay Round with the disappearance of the meat import law. Access for Australian sugar and dairy products remains restricted, mainly because of the domestic programs for these commodities, which I have mentioned.
<P>
There are many common characteristics between U.S. and Australian farmers. Our     farming, like yours, is built on the family farm; 95 percent of Australian farms are still family-owned. We both have a lot of land under farming. Some 60 percent of Australian land is used for farming; most is range land extensively grazed by sheep and cattle. The U.S. has a smaller percentage of land under farming, but compared to much of our land, your land is highly productive, enjoying higher crop yields and better pasture.
<P>
Your farmers have an enormous domestic market and an internal transport and distribution system second to none. We have no doubt that, given the underlying strengths, U.S. agriculture would continue to expand without subsidies. Your agriculture would probably be stronger and, as a result, provide stiffer competition for us in world markets. We believe that all farmers would be better off with less government intervention. Foreign consumers, not farm exporters, are the real beneficiaries from export subsidies.
<P>
The fundamental difference I have noted between our two countries is that, in Australia, we have created an environment where our farmers farm for the market and respond to  market signals. American farmers seem to spend a lot of their time farming for government programs, so much so that much of U.S. agriculture loses sight of the product it is supposed to be selling. As a result, the U.S. entrepreneurial spirit is lost.
<P>
The EEP and DEIP were originally designed to counter E.U. subsidies in the particular markets to which they were applied. In Asia, however, the E.U. do not have a significant presence, with only an average 15 percent of the Asian dairy market, for example. Extension of the EEP and DEIP into Asia would be impossible for the U.S. to defend and would put a substantial strain on the excellent relationship which has existed between our two countries.
<P>
For this reason, the major purpose of my visit has been to attempt to ensure that the important decisions that the U.S. is to make on agriculture policy in the coming months do not undermine the good relationship between our two countries. I will be leaving here shortly to put that case to the Secretary, Dan Glickman. I hope, for both our sakes, our message is heeded.

<p>
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT></B>rop subsidies for the 400-acre farm that we rent here in northwest Missouri 
average $10,000 a year, and I've gotten in the habit of spending it all. But Pat Roberts, 
congressman from Dodge City, Kansas, and the new chairman of the House Agriculture 
Committee, assures me that I won't have to wear bib overalls with a scarlet "S" for 
"subsidy" on the front. Well, that's a relief.</P>
<P>	Roberts's sense of humor is as dry as the West Kansas wind. And this year he'll 
need it, because 1995 will see the reauthorization of the Farm Bill, the huge piece of 
legislation that will govern federal agricultural programs for the next five years. As a 
defender of the existing subsidies, Roberts may find himself as lonely as a Dodge City 
vegetarian.</P>
<P>	Several rounds of budget-cutting have pared farm programs by half, or $14 billion 
annually, since 1989. Roberts intends to protect what is left, and that may take more than 
a good sense of humor. He will have few allies. The Clinton administration has no 
interest in agriculture, except for a desire to turn the Midwest into a gigantic wetland, and 
to do whatever the poultry industry wants. Bob Dole, normally a roadblock in the way of 
farm reform, will be busy running the Senate and his presidential campaign. The new 
leadership of the House of Representatives includes Dick Armey, who looks at farm 
subsidies the way a dog looks at a bone. Richard Lugar, the chairman of the Senate 
Agriculture Committee, has opened the debate with a list of 53 questions about farm 
policy. His first one: "Should we have a farm program at all?" (Roberts likens Lugar to 
Lizzie Borden, taking 53 whacks at farmers.) Farm programs have been on the defensive 
for years, but Lugar is the first leading farm-state legislator to question their very 
existence. Roberts is circling the wagons to do what agriculture-committee chairmen have 
always done--protect the subsidies--but this time he may lose.</P>
<P>	Although I have long been a critic of farm subsidies in principle, Lugar's 
questions and the programs' unpopularity have suddenly turned a philosophical question 
into a frighteningly personal one. In addition to his 53 questions, the 54th and most 
important one is: How would I replace the $10,000 in subsidies that I receive each year?</P>
<P>	Well, for one thing, I'd grow more beans. My corn crop is directly subsidized, but 
my soybean crop isn't. So guess which crop I grow more of. Without corn subsidies, 
growing soybeans would be more profitable for us here in Westboro, and in many years 
beans are more profitable even after we receive our green government checks. But we 
consistently plant more than half our acres in corn to protect our corn base. Base is the 
number of acres planted to a subsidized crop, and is used to determine the size of 
government payments.</P>
<P>	If we plant more soybeans to take advantage of their greater profitability, we lose 
some eligibility for future corn subsidies. Fathers pass many important lessons along to 
their sons. Here in the Corn Belt, a 60-year-old lesson is: Protect your base!</P>
<P>	We could offset some of these lost subsidies by reducing our costs of production. 
Soybeans are cheaper to plant, and their yield is less dependent on timely rains. We could 
save on the expensive insecticides we have to apply to the 20 percent of our land that is in 
continuous corn.</P>
<P>	We could also save on commercial fertilizer. Soybeans "fix," or capture, nitrogen 
from the air and leave it in the soil. Some of that nitrogen is available as nutrient for the 
following year's crop. By increasing our soybean acreage, we could do with less 
fertilizer. (The two crops compete for the same acres in this region; if soybean prices 
dropped because lots of other farmers made the same decision, then corn would become 
more profitable.)</P>
<P>	Another thing we'd do without farm subsidies is grow more. In order to qualify 
for government payments, we must leave part of our farm idle. This spring, for instance, 
we will plant on only 380 of our 400 acres. We could plant those other 20 acres without 
any additional investment in tractors, or combines, or rent. Without the acreage 
limitations imposed by farm programs, we would spread our fixed costs over more acres.</P>
<P>	And perhaps most important of all, there is gumbo. Gumbo is the soil that makes 
up much of our river-bottom ground. The spring after we plant corn on gumbo, the soil 
has the consistency of well-cured concrete. There are only two solutions to this problem: 
fall plowing, which is terribly expensive, or rotation to soybeans.</P>
<P>	Without the program, we could increase our average yields through better crop 
rotation. Corn after soybeans consistently yields 10 to 20 percent more than second-year 
corn. So part of the lost subsidies would be replaced by higher yields.</P>
<P>	The largest single expense for any farmer is the cost of his land. And this is where 
the farm program has its biggest impact. The first thing farmers want to know when a 
neighbor's farm comes up for sale is the size of its crop base. Farms with a large corn 
base are eligible for higher subsidies, and so are worth more than those with a smaller 
one--another reason to protect the base. When farm subsidies diminish, the price of land 
falls. Farmers compete with one another for land.  Farm policy has the effect of 
subsidizing established farmers who own much of their land, and making it more difficult 
for younger farmers to buy or rent land to establish themselves. Farm programs are often 
touted as an attempt to save the family farm. But when the capitalized value of subsidies 
raises the costs to families who want to farm, the programs serve as a barrier to entry. Not 
surprisingly, the average age of farmers is well over 50. Cuts in farm subsidies would 
allow easier entry into farming, and less expensive transfer of farms between generations.</P>
<P>	Without subsidies, we would be freed of a number of bureaucratic burdens. This 
spring, we will have to trek to the local Consolidated Farm Services Administration office 
to receive approval for our crop plan. After all of our crops are planted, we must return to 
certify that we did what we said we would. Government planes fly over our farm to take 
photographs and make sure that our corn plantings are within the limits. (Since we 
farmers don't have antiaircraft batteries, the USDA needn't resort to spy satellites.) We 
also have to file conservation plans and plan our crop rotations years in advance.</P>
<P>	How much of the $10,000 that I've become so attached to would be replaced if I 
could farm without all these constraints? I don't know. If full-scale production led to 
huge surpluses, and crop prices fell to extremely low levels and stayed there, then I would 
suffer a great deal. But without the guarantee of protection from Uncle Sam, surpluses 
might not be as much of a problem as in the past. Loan rates (the floor under the market 
price) were set above the cost of production in the 1980 farm bill, and huge surpluses 
were the result.</P> 
<P>	But sometimes we learn from our mistakes: Since 1990, loan rates have been 
below market-clearing levels. Record harvests in 1992 and 1994 have not produced a 
huge carry-over of grain. In fact, prices are slightly higher now than after the 1992 
harvest, even though corn production in 1994 was considerably higher. And in years of 
short supply, my profits might well rise without farm programs, because the government 
sells its grain stocks to set a ceiling on prices.</P>
<P>	Senator Lugar wants to know why some crops are subsidized and others are not. 
He also wants to know whether unsubsidized crops are consistently less profitable than 
subsidized ones. As I've pointed out, we can make as much profit on soybeans, which are 
not directly subsidized, as on corn. The greenhouses where we grow unsubsidized 
geraniums are the most profitable enterprise on my farm, and I don't have to wait for a 
government check. Cattle and hogs have no subsidy programs, yet hogs are consistently 
among the most profitable of agricultural commodities. Florida oranges receive no 
government support, while California oranges are grown under government rules that 
constrain supply and raise prices. Are Florida growers selling out and heading for 
California? I hardly think so.</P>
<P>	Any government subsidy increases costs in the subsidized industry, and any 
government-provided profits tend to be bid into the factors of production. There is little 
evidence that subsidies boost profits in the long run, and the fact that some crops are 
subsidized and others are not is an accident of history and politics.</P>
<P>	In the last two years, farmers witnessed two events that will make more difference 
in the long run than any farm bill could: the passage of GATT and of NAFTA. These 
trade agreements will raise agricultural exports and prices by large amounts. GATT will 
require the European Union to cut subsidies by 36 percent. Export subsidies for more 
than 8 million tonnes of European exports will have to be cut. American farmers are the 
low-cost producers of most of the commodities that Europe subsidizes, and we stand to 
gain most of that business.</P>
<P>	GATT is expected to raise incomes worldwide by as much as $5 trillion in the 
next 10 years. Many of those dollars will be spent to improve diets, as consumers 
worldwide boost their consumption of meat. Since the passage of NAFTA, agricultural 
exports to Mexico have risen by 22 percent, or $670 million, in the first 10 months of 
1994.</P>

<H3>New Farmers' Market</H3>
<P>	That giant sucking sound you hear emanates mainly from Midwestern grain bins, 
busily shipping corn and soybeans south of the border. When Mexico recovers from its 
peso crisis, NAFTA is expected to boost U.S. agricultural exports annually by $2.6 
billion.</P>
<P>	As trade barriers around the world fall, the number of people who can afford to 
buy what I produce is increasing. China has a middle class 100 million strong. With 22 
percent of the world's population, and an economy growing at 10 percent per year, 
China's potential as a market for food is mindboggling. As NAFTA expands to include 
Central and South America, more new markets will open. When the decline in trade 
barriers is combined with growth in worldwide incomes, U.S. farmers may well be 
entering a golden age for agriculture. And here on my farm in Westboro, I may find that 
being part of a freer world market pays better than farming for Uncle Sam.</P>
<P>	I've thought a lot about Senator Lugar's questions. I've tried to figure out how it 
would affect me financially if the answers to those questions persuade Congress to end or 
drastically reduce farm programs. And I think the answer is clear. I can survive without 
subsidies. In some years, I might even be better off. And there is one more question that 
Lugar asked that goes to the crux of the matter: "What is the rationale for transferring 
public funds from taxpayers, most of whom have moderate incomes, to all farmers, 
including those whose incomes--are substantially above--average?" Well, I don't 
know how you justify that.</P>
<P>	Recently, my brother took his 15-year-old son along with him to the local USDA 
office. One of the employees behind the counter pointed out that my nephew was the 
fourth generation of our family that she had worked with. I'm a little uncomfortable with 
being on the dole for that length of time, and I'm particularly uncomfortable knowing that 
my income and assets would qualify me as solidly middle class. The lady behind the 
counter retired shortly afterwards. I don't imagine it was the thought of another 
generation of Hursts that drove her into retirement, but I do believe that maybe four 
generations of middle-class welfare is enough.</P>
<P>	As Congress scrutinizes farm programs, it needs to keep one thing in mind. Pat 
Roberts tells the story of one of his constituents, who said, "I don't care what you do to 
me, as long as you let me know."</P>
<P>	Farmers have planned their businesses with the expectation of continued farm 
payments. Any reform of agricultural policy must keep those expectations in mind. We 
have been adjusting to lower subsidies for five years, and have made those adjustments 
fairly easily. Perhaps we should allow another five years to wind down this 60-year-old 
experiment in central planning, retire our overalls with the red "S," and let farmers do 
what we do best: produce the cheapest and most plentiful food supply the world has ever 
known.</P>

<p>
	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT></B>hen Bell Atlantic Chairman Ray Smith offered to help Congress find alternative 
sources of money to replace federal funding of public-television broadcasting, PBS 
supporters protested en masse. And when Jones Intercable--which already distributes 
adult-education courses through its Mind Extension University--offered to take over 
programming for PBS, the cries of outrage grew louder. Public broadcasting, which has 
always presented itself as an impoverished charity case throughout years of on-air beg-a-
thons, was suddenly described by PBS president Ervin Duggan as a valuable business 
enterprise that should not be "sold off for scrap."</P>
<P>	A similar contradiction surfaced when House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) first 
announced on National Empowerment Television (which receives no tax money) that 
he'd like to "zero out" federal subsidies for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
Lobbyists attacked him for wanting to "kill" public broadcasting. This same lobby 
counters criticism of its reliance on tax money by pointing out that the federal share of its 
revenue was only 14 percent of the total.</P>
<P>	The conflicting arguments of public-television advocates against the privatization 
of the industry illuminate the broad contours of the debate: Congress is now debating 
proposed cuts in appropriations for public broadcasting of 15 percent for 1996 and 30 
percent for 1997. But the issue is about more than just $285.6 million in tax money; it is 
also about the role and reach of the federal government and an elitist culture determined 
to manipulate it for its own purposes:</P>

<H3>Plenty of Money</H3>
<P>	Public broadcasters maintain that the federal share of their income is sacrosanct, 
the "seed money," and quite unlike the remaining 86 percent that comes from other 
sources. But, in fact, the federal matching formulas work precisely in the opposite 
manner. It is the non-federal money which is the "seed money" for public broadcasting, 
as anyone who has ever watched a pledge-week special will recognize. The federal 
government offers to match the amount of private funds each station succeeds in raising. 
This is the reason large urban stations with wealthy viewerships perversely receive more 
money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting than do small, rural stations. It all 
prompts the question: Why are CPB advocates so certain the rest of their income could 
not be generated outside of federal coffers?</P>
<P>	It was a curious thing to watch this hostility to businessmen displayed by 
representatives of an institution that usually, at least in public, sings honeyed praises of 
"public-private partnership." These same elites point to the many <I>Fortune 500</I> 
corporations that enjoy enhanced prestige through their association with PBS: General 
Motors, Mobil, Exxon, GTE, New York Life, and Ford Motor Co.</P>
<P>	Indeed, private-sector benefactors who offered to raise money for the educational 
broadcasting system were described by Frank Rich, a columnist for the <I>New York Times</I>, 
not as generous philanthropists, but rather as "circling vultures." The privatization that 
had once been described as impossible is now denounced as being all too likely.</P>
<P>	The availability of private funding sources reveals that the fundamental issues are 
ideological and not financial. Proponents of federal support for public broadcasting want 
the government to be involved because they dislike private enterprise. They claim to fear 
the "trash" that a market-based broadcasting system could produce. They say they want 
to make television "safe for kids."</P>
<P>	What they dislike, however, is not poor-quality programming, but the very idea of 
the market. If it were the former, then how can PBS justify <I>Tales of the City</I>, a campy 
soap opera; <I>Tongues Untied</I>, which was both crude and lewd; Frontline's <I>Death of a 
Playboy Centerfold</I> and <I>Death of a Porn Queen</I>, subjects more suitable to tabloid 
television; and <I>Yanni: Live at the Acropolis</I>, which some might consider of doubtful 
value? Clearly such programming is not intrinsically superior to <I>A Current Affair</I> or 
<I>Inside Edition</I>. In fact, trash is not in the least offensive to the fans of public 
broadcasting--commercial trash is.</P>
<P>	In the PBS world view, exposure on public television can even elevate 
commercial television into art. Take the case of <I>I'll Fly Away</I>. A CBS drama starring Sam 
Waterston and Alfre Woodard, it did well critically, but poorly in the ratings, and was 
canceled after one season. PBS picked it up, producing one new episode and then airing a 
full season of repeats. The series depicted the effect on one family of the civil rights 
movement in the South, and flattered the sensibility of the liberal professionals who make 
up the core PBS audience. No doubt they could identify with this well-educated Southern 
family, which was manifestly superior to the backwards rednecks who made up the rest 
of the white folks in the series.</P>
<P>	The program was among the highest-rated shows ever broadcast by the network. 
If anything, the success of <I>I'll Fly Away</I> has indicated that a show by commercial 
producers was just what public broadcasting needed. But that was not what happened. 
Despite the series's appeal, no further commercial drama has appeared on the network. 
Indeed, PBS even canceled a development deal with producer Brandon Tartikoff, who 
had been president of NBC when it was at the top of the ratings.</P>
<P>	Commercial-drama producers were not welcome at PBS even after the success of 
<I>I'll Fly Away</I>, just as Bell Atlantic is not welcome as a replacement for Uncle Sam. The 
reason is simple: Public broadcasters see themselves as an aristocracy and, like aristocrats 
everywhere, they find commerce beneath them. No matter that the U.S. Constitution 
prohibits titles of nobility; public broadcasters see themselves like the Dons of 18th-
century Spain, with neither dust on their boots nor soil of commerce on their hands.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic pose of public broadcasting, and protestations of independence 
from mainstream American tastes, is curiously dependent precisely on the patronage of 
the federal government. Otherwise, the status of the enterprise is no different from that of 
any other broadcasting entity. Indeed, the aristocratic pretension even informs the refusal 
of the public-broadcasting lobby on Capitol Hill to submit CPB to the Freedom of 
Information Act. To disclose information to the American public--to mere commoners--
would be to lose stature. The mystery of the enterprise would be disturbed, and without 
the mystery, there would be little majesty.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic conceit also undergirds broadcasters' refusal to ensure, as the law 
requires, that programming is objective and balanced. The Public Broadcasting Act of 
1967 specifically calls for such balance in all matters of public controversy. This was 
necessary for the same reason Congress passed the ban on domestic dissemination of the 
Voice of America--that it would be dangerous to allow the federal government's power 
over the press to be exploited by a victorious political faction.</P> 
<P>	In 1992, after complaints of imbalance and the intercession of Senator Dole (R-
KS), Congress strengthened the statute to provide for a procedural review of 
programming and commissioning of remedial fare whenever public broadcasters violated 
standards of objectivity. Yet, after almost three years, the CPB has never admitted a 
single mistake, nor commissioned a single hour of remedial programming.</P>
<P>	A desire to wear a cloak of status and prestige is the only explanation for this 
otherwise inexplicable phenomenon. For to admit error would be to place public 
broadcasting on the same plane as the commercial press. <I>The New York Times</I> prints 
corrections every single day. The <I>Washington Post</I> has an ombudsman. When NBC was 
caught rigging a crash test on Dateline NBC, the company fired the president of NBC 
News. But when PBS aired the fraudulent <I>Liberators</I>, which falsely gave credit for the 
liberation of Buchenwald to African-American troops instead of the 6th Armored 
Division, WNET in New York retracted it after substantial public pressure from Jewish 
groups and World War II veterans. Yet not a single head rolled, and no corrective 
programming was aired.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic conception of status also thrives in the relation of CPB to 
Congress. Although dependent on the federal government for its annual appropriation, 
the CPB regards its role as a "heat shield" against Congressional critics rather than a 
regulator. That is, public broadcasting must be permitted to receive federal funds and 
commission programming with no questions asked. The government-weary electorate 
demands accountability for tax money spent on every other government program. Yet 
public broadcasters stand with the National Endowment for the Arts as one of the few 
recipients who claim a special exemption.</P>

<H3>Kids as Shields</H3>
<P>	PBS's attitude is bad enough when it is programming for the "new class" of 
professionals and educators. But it is even worse when it hides behind supposed concern 
for the sensibilities of children. Commercials, one of the engines of revenue, are deemed 
hazardous by a cadre of "experts" in education and media, who need to certify shows as 
"educational."</P>
<P>	But here's the rub: When advertising aimed at children became increasingly 
restricted on the networks, PBS became the venue for licensing bonanzas connected to its 
shows. For example, over 5,000 products connected to Sesame Street are grossing almost 
$1 billion in annual sales. Yet the show is nevertheless considered "non-commercial" 
because it is certified as such by "experts" in educational psychology, such as Gerald 
Lesser, a founder of Children's Television Workshop (which created <I>Sesame Street</I>) and 
a professor at Harvard University's School of Education.</P> 	
<P>	PBS executives try to have it both ways. On the one hand, they shun commercial 
television because of its commercializing influence on children. On the other hand, those 
with the franchises for PBS shows enjoy exclusive advantages no other toy vendors can 
claim--for they carry the noble title, "educational," and the PBS seal.</P>

<H3>Big-Bucks Programming</H3>
<P>	In public broadcasting, the democratic institution of Congress, which is 
responsible to the taxpayer, relinquishes the power to approve programs to an unelected 
bureaucracy. In deciding who gets grants, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has 
depended on judgments from expert panels of industry insiders, rather than the board of 
directors appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Again, the principle is 
clear: CPB should be accountable neither to the marketplace nor to the taxpayers and 
their representatives.</P>
<P>	In fiscal year 1993, CPB distributed some $289.4 million to 200 affiliated 
television stations and 490 affiliated radio stations. That was about 14 percent of the 
total--about $2 billion--spent on public radio and television. By way of comparison, in 
fiscal year 1993, CBS was the number-one rated television network in the country, with a 
prime-time Nielsen rating of 14.0, and earned broadcasting revenues of about $2.3 
billion. At that time, public television stations spent about $1.2 billion for an average 
prime time rating of under 2.5. In other words, CBS was paying $164 million for every 
ratings point in 1993, while PBS was paying about $480 million per ratings point.</P> 
<P>	Were PBS viewers three times as valuable as network audiences, or was the 
federally-subsidized network simply paying three times as much to reach the same 
people? Rather than reaching the most people for the least amount of money--a 
democratic mission--public broadcasting strives to reach a select group of people, no 
matter the cost. Such targeting of consumers happens all the time in the commercial 
marketplace. But it's hard to justify for a democratically funded organization.</P> 
<P>	This phenomenon of elitist and parochial disdain, then, begins to explain the 
unwillingness of the public broadcasting lobby to engage in the debate over the specifics 
of public broadcasting. The problem is not lack of money. It is simple snobbery on the 
part of public broadcasters. Federal tax dollars are considered "clean." Private donations, 
sponsorship, or underwriting is considered "dirty."</P>
<P>	Could the public broadcasting system become self-sufficient? Of course. The 
money is already there, within the same system that has been growing for more than 27 
years. As President Clinton himself told Brian Lamb in a C-Span interview during the 
1992 campaign, the public broadcasting system is pretty healthy, and he "didn't know 
that we needed to spend any more money on it." The president's own budget line item for 
CPB has been essentially frozen since he took office, and his administration actually 
proposed a 6 percent cut for public broadcasting in its 1996 budget.</P>

<H3>Drawing from the Well</H3>
<P>	Where could taxpayer funding find a substitute? Any number of combinations and 
permutations of replacement funders spring to mind.</P>
<UL><LI>  More than 5.2 million members contribute some $391 million annually to public-
broadcasting stations. That's about $75 each. Since public-broadcasting membership 
represents the top stratum of the socioeconomic ladder, were each subscriber simply to 
pledge $56 additional each year, it would yield public broadcasting $290 million--the 
entire federal share. Not too difficult a challenge, considering that the average net worth 
of the membership of WETA, a PBS station in Washington, D.C., is $627,000, according 
to <I>USA Today</I>.<BR> 
<LI>  The private foundations that support public broadcasting are among the richest entities 
in America today. They include the multi-billion-dollar Ford, MacArthur, Warhol, and 
Rockefeller foundations. Certainly these vast accumulators of wealth could increase their 
contributions to public broadcasting as well. The Ford Foundation alone has a $6 billion 
endowment. If public broadcasting were a genuine priority for them, private foundations 
could make up the $290 million annual appropriation from their own bank accounts.<BR>
<LI>  The commercial radio and television networks that benefit from the fact that PBS and 
National Public Radio serve to crowd out potential competitors could fund public 
broadcasting in the same way that cable companies pay for C-Span, as a cost of doing 
business and a way of increasing corporate goodwill. Split between NBC, ABC, CBS, 
and Fox, the sum required would be about $75 million each, and no doubt the networks 
could barter programs onto the schedule as part of the contribution. This system was 
actually used by Margaret Thatcher's government in Great Britain to establish Channel 
Four--originally proposed as taxpayer-supported. A private corporation owned by the 
other commercial television companies and known collectively as Independent Television 
(ITV), Channel Four was so successful at nurturing alternative and diverse television 
programming that it has actually begun to support itself, even attracting commercial 
sponsors. It frequently draws better than the BBC's arts and cultural channel, BBC-2.<BR>
<LI>  Hollywood stars are quite vocal in their support of public broadcasting, lining up to 
testify at congressional hearings. But they haven't yet confessed that they are in a better 
position than most to make up for the federal share. Entertainer Barbara Streisand, who 
makes $10 million to $15 million per picture while warning about the deleterious effects 
of cutting public television funding, admitted in a recent speech at Harvard that 
Americans spend about $340 billion annually on the entertainment industry. A donation 
from the Hollywood moguls totaling only one-half of 1 percent of those receipts would 
amount to more than five times the federal share to all of public broadcasting.</UL>
<P>	What's going on here? Are CPB and its offspring, NPR and PBS, hapless paupers 
dependent on the federal dole? Or are they sophisticated business ventures whose profit 
potential remains untapped? Which is it? Although Streisand denounces conservatives for 
emphasizing the private sector, she has chosen to work with commercial Hollywood 
studios and record companies. Stars like Streisand, along with other "arts advocates" 
from groups like the Creative Coalition such as Blair Brown, Christopher Reeve, Ron 
Silver, and William and Alec Baldwin, could agree to donate their time to do one 
television special a year for public broadcasting. They could get their Hollywood friends 
to join them, and the programming could be used as pledge specials. If such stars 
appeared for free on PBS, their shows could be used for fundraising, much like <I>The Three 
Tenors</I> is used now.</P>
<P>	How much money could Hollywood raise for public broadcasting? You do the 
math: Streisand brought in a cool $1 million for then-candidate Bill Clinton at a 1992 
fundraiser. In 1986, she raised $1.5 million for a group of six Democratic congressional 
candidates. Forbes magazine estimates Streisand earned $52 million in 1994.</P> 
<P>	Other big-money show-business stars (according to Forbes) include Oprah 
Winfrey, who made $53 million last year, Bill Cosby ($34 million), Harrison Ford ($27 
million), Bruce Willis ($19 million), Tom Hanks ($16 million), Kevin Costner ($15 
million), Tom Cruise ($14 million), Eddie Murphy ($13 million), and Roseanne ($13 
million). The richest of them all is Steven Spielberg. Forbes magazine estimates 
Spielberg makes $165 million to $170 million annually.</P>
<P>	We know where at least some of their money goes. Spielberg donated $161,000 to 
Democrats running for Congress. Five studio political-action committees gave $866,798 
to Democrats (compared to $187,050 to Republicans). MCA chairman Lew Wasserman 
gave more than $230,000 to Democrats in 1992, compared to $6,000 to Republicans. In 
1992 Disney's Jeffrey Katzenberg (now partnered with Spielberg and music mogul David 
Geffen in a new company) gave over $100,000 to Democrats and $2,000 to Republicans. 
Disney's Michael Eisner gave $19,000 to Democrats and $3,000 to Republicans. Eisner, 
it should be remembered, sold almost $200 million worth of Disney stock after the 
election of Bill Clinton because he feared higher taxes. That one transaction was worth 
almost the entire amount the Corporation for Public Broadcasting spent on PBS in 1992.</P>
<P>   With the biggest names from the silver screen appearing on PBS, there is no question 
but audiences would rise to the occasion. In fact, PBS President Duggan, in a speech to 
affiliates last year, said he would love to have a Barbra Streisand special on PBS for 
pledge week. No doubt CD sales alone would make a startling contribution to the PBS 
budget. Yet so far, Barbra is still operating in the commercial sphere. Why?</P>
<P>	Underwriters would surely love to be associated with top stars, and so private 
support would no doubt more than make up the federal shortfall. Indeed, producers like 
Norman Lear (founder of People for the American Way) might even agree to produce 
series for PBS and donate their fees as contributions, with residual rights reverting to 
PBS.</P>
<UL><LI>  As Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) showed, the telephone companies seem to be willing 
to provide free over-the-air educational and cultural programming in exchange for the 
right to enter the broadcasting business. Certainly regulators and corporations could 
arrange to make duplicate television stations available for other purposes while 
maintaining the core mission of public broadcasting as a cost of doing business.<BR>
<LI>  Cable companies like Jones Intercable also appear ready to step into the breach, 
providing public-service broadcasting in order to expand their activities. Such offers 
should be seriously considered. Another cablecaster expressing interest is the Discovery 
Network, which also runs The Learning Channel.<BR> 
<LI>  Finally, PBS could strike better deals with the producers of <I>Barney, Sesame Street, The 
Civil War, The Frugal Gourmet</I>, and the dozens of other extremely lucrative programs 
with merchandising tie-ins carried on the taxpayer-subsidized airwaves. Valuable air time 
is now given away for free to these producers, who know what to do with it. Producers of 
<I>Sesame Street</I>, for example, use the subsidized exposure to sell $800 million worth of 
some 5,000 licensed products annually. The show's producer, Children's Television 
Workshop, has about $70 million in stocks and bonds and pays its top executives more 
than $300,000 a year. Barney was estimated to sell about $500 million worth of products 
in 1993, and <I>Shining Time Station</I> garnered $250 million. Intelligent licensing deals alone 
could probably make up the lost federal subsidy from products connected to PBS's 
children's programming.</P></UL>
<P>	The recent announcement that CPB would get a share of <I>Barney's</I> net profits is 
unfortunately mere window dressing. In show business, only gross points are real dollars, 
and CPB does not share in the gross under any known contract. One reason that 
producers connected to public broadcasting have enjoyed such sweet arrangements is that 
the system is federally subsidized, There is no incentive to strike the most profitable deal. 
As media critic Brent Bozell noted in recent congressional testimony, it is very hard for 
public-broadcasting executives to go up to Capitol Hill and ask for increasing amounts of 
taxpayer money if they are making millions from selling T-shirts.</P>
<P>	And they are. The <I>Wireless</I> and <I>Signals</I> catalogs produced by Boston's WGBH 
and Minnesota Public Radio, for example, yield about $150 million in total. On the East 
Coast, PBS stations are partners in the Learningsmith chain of stores, pioneered by 
WGBH and WETA. On the West Coast, KCET owns a chain, The Store of Knowledge. 
Both are private firms that benefit from the cross-promotion, advertising, and corporate 
goodwill of their association with PBS. But their books are sealed to the public, exempted 
from the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
<P>	Public broadcasting can survive, indeed thrive, without a penny of scarce taxpayer 
dollars. There are many alternative sources of revenue, from station members, to 
corporate underwriters, to alternative programmers. Better deals can be struck with those 
who are exploiting the present system. The opposition to self-sufficiency is based not on 
practical considerations, but rather on an ideological commitment to the role of the 
federal government as the guarantor of culture and education--much as in Britain, where 
there are jams and jellies carrying the emblem, "by appointment to Her Majesty."</P> 
<P>	That is why the current debate over public broadcasting is so fierce. It is a 
struggle between those with an "unconstrained vision," in the words of economist 
Thomas Sowell, of an all-powerful central government run by an educated elite that does 
everything, including decide what is cultural and educational television. On the other side 
are those who feel a commitment to limited government. As Representative John Kasich 
(R-OH) recently put it, "the vast majority of people we hear from say, as we go into the 
21st century, government doesn't need to run a television station."</P>

<title>Setting the Record Straight on the Albanian Elections -- Heritage</title>

<h3> SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON THE ALBANIAN ELECTIONS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br> 
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 453<br>
June 14, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;



Albania's May 26 parliamentary elections, which produced a landslide political victory for President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party, have come under fire. Opposition parties, led by the former communists of the Socialist Party, charge that the pro-Western Berisha government rigged the elections. While some international election observers have supported the opposition's charges of systematic voter fraud and intimidation, many of these observers -- particularly some of those in the election monitoring delegation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe-Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE-ODIHR) -- held a pronounced political bias in favor of the Socialists. Other monitors, such as those from the Washington-based International Republican Institute, have concluded that election violations were not widespread. This interpretation seems borne out by the fact that the election results were roughly similar to exit polls conducted by independent pollsters. The U.S. should avoid being stampeded into a rush to judgment against a friendly government based simply on unsubstantiated charges by anti-American Albanian leftists and their supporters in Western Europe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

That Albania's parliamentary elections were a rough and tumble affair is hardly surprising, considering that they were only the third free elections since the fall of the Albanian dictatorship. The elections pitted President Berisha's Democratic Party, which has been the driving force behind Albania's political and economic reforms, against the Socialist Party, the renamed successor to the communist party whose iron rule had lasted from 1944 to 1992. The contest was especially bitter because President Berisha had led the opposition forces that toppled the communists from power, and the Socialists were bent on political vengeance. When it became clear to them on election day that their efforts had fallen short, the Socialists withdrew from the elections in the late afternoon, charging that the elections had been a charade. Ironically, this cynical critique of Albania's nascent democracy was vigorously promoted by some of the same communists who had formed the backbone of the Stalinist regime of Enver Hoxa, who had plunged Albania into brutal repression and isolation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

President Berisha, a physician, is far from a dictator. He is a charismatic conservative leader who courageously spoke out against the communists, decisively defeated them in the 1992 elections, and pushed through a popular reform program that has brought great economic benefits to Europe's poorest country. Berisha's privatization reforms have spawned a flourishing private sector that has spearheaded Albania's economic growth, which has averaged about 10 percent annually in recent years. Given his popularity and the success of his political and economic programs, he had little need to rig the elections. Moreover, he had respected the workings of the democratic process in the past, such as the defeat of his proposal for a new constitution in a 1994 national referendum.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The first round of parliamentary elections on May 26 brought an impressive turnout of 89 percent of the Albanian electorate. Berisha's Democratic Party garnered approximately 68 percent of the vote, compared with 65 percent in the 1992 elections. Because the remaining votes splintered among six opposition parties, the Democratic Party won 95 of the 115 directly elected seats in the 140-seat parliament. The Socialist Party claimed that the election results were the product of systematic ballot box stuffing, electoral fraud, and intimidation, but by pulling out of the election monitoring commission on election day, it made it all but impossible to determine the scale of these alleged voting abuses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The election monitors of the OSCE-ODIHR, who have been the most inclined to support the opposition's claims of vote fraud, may be the least credible of the more than 100 international observers that monitored the elections. Mark Almond, a member of the British Helsinki Human Rights Group election monitoring team, turned up evidence that one team accredited by the OSCE-ODIHR monitoring mission was compromised by direct cooperation with the Socialists, who he suspects organized angry crowds of demonstrators at polling stations visited by the OSCE-ODIHR group. The team in question comprised nine members of a left-wing Norwegian group, Workers' International Solidarity, which enjoyed close relations with the Socialists and even requested translators and transportation from them. The OSCE-ODIHR mission also accredited other Socialist supporters, including a Dane who had organized tours of Albania for sympathetic foreigners during the communist era and a German, accused of a pro-Socialist bias in the German press, whose briefings of other election monitors were tendentious and highly emotional.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Significantly, several other monitoring groups contradicted the bleak picture of the elections presented by the OSCE-ODIHR group. The British Helsinki Human Rights Group found the elections to be free and fair. Jonathan Sunley, a member of the group who also had witnessed the 1991 Albanian elections, was struck by the vast improvement in political conditions, particularly "the orderliness and apparent impartiality surrounding the conduct of the election."  Sunley also noted that "compared with the elections held over the last 12 months in Armenia, Georgia, Belarus, and Russia, all of which were issued a clean bill of health, the infringements and irregularities in Albania were minor."  Election observers from the European Democratic Union also found the Albanian elections to be fair.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The International Republican Institute (IRI), which also deployed an election monitoring team, released a report asserting that "IRI observers did find that in most voting centers they visited the voting procedures were orderly, voter identification was being checked and stamped, and voters had the opportunity to cast a secret ballot in a calm atmosphere."  However, IRI observers did find some irregularities in a few voting centers, which led it to conclude that the results of certain parliamentary races -- but not the elections as a whole -- may have been compromised: "While not widespread, observed voting irregularities raise serious questions about the conduct and integrity of a number of Albania's 1996 Parliamentary contests."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

IRI commissioned an independent American-Albanian polling firm to conduct a survey of voters on election day that found that 62 percent of voters expressed approval of President Berisha and 71 percent were satisfied with the development of democracy. IRI's exit poll predicted that the Democratic Party would win 56 percent of the vote, the Socialists would win 22 percent, and the remainder would be split among a number of smaller parties. This exit poll, with a margin of error of 3.5 percent, is not out of line with the 68 percent of the votes claimed by the Democratic Party, especially considering that many Socialist voters may have foregone voting after the Socialists decided to boycott the elections late on election day. Clearly, if there was cheating, it did not decisively affect the outcome of the elections.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Nevertheless, the Albanian government has taken steps to remove doubts about the integrity of the elections. In an apparent concession to the opposition, President Berisha has ordered new elections to be held on June 16 in 17 parliamentary constituencies where there had been reports of significant irregularities. Berisha also ordered prosecutors to investigate charges of police brutality at a Socialist demonstration held in Tirana on May 29. Seven police officials subsequently were fired for failing to rein in police at the banned demonstration.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This undoubtedly will not satisfy the Socialists, who seek to enlist foreign support to have the elections annulled, undermine President Berisha, and drive a wedge between Washington and Tirana. The Clinton Administration should not allow itself to be drawn into the Socialists' plans for what amounts to a coup d'etat against the pro-Western government. Washington should not be more supportive of the former communists than the Albanian people themselves have been. Seeking to appease the opposition by forcing more concessions from the Berisha government will only play into the hands of the Socialists, further polarize Albania, and jeopardize the long-term stability of a friendly country that has been one of the few beacons of hope in the volatile Balkan region.

<h3> What Are America's Vital Interests?</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner</a>, Ph.D.
<P>
Delivered February 6, 1996
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Tonight I would like to outline a conservative internationalist foreign policy anchored in the foundation of vital American interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I define those vital interests as developments that could concretely affect the security or economic future of America and our citizens. Before giving you my list of American vital interests, let me first touch upon the growing drift in U.S. foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. In other words, let's review current policy.
<p>

<table border=0 align=left>
<tr>
<td><img src="drf.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><caption>Heritage President Dr. Edwin J. Feulner Jr.</caption></tr>
</table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clinton's foreign policy has been formulated by a group of retreads from the Carter Administration who were uncomfortable, unconvinced, and therefore unsuccessful in waging the Cold War against the Soviet Union. They returned to office with Clinton and believed that they could successfully reorient American foreign policy to harness the American military for what they deemed to be virtuous crusades in far-flung regions of the world. But they neglected the fact that the American people supported distant interventions during the Cold War only on behalf of important American national interests, and specifically to oppose the spread of an expansionist, ideological, totalitarian system that was publicly committed to burying us.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
American foreign policy has drifted dangerously astray, especially since 1993. A large part of the problem is that the Clinton Administration appears to be incapable of distinguishing between America's vital interests and some liberal do-gooders' marginal interests. The Administration too often has resorted to questionable military interventions to promote its peculiar vision of American values in such countries as Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia, where there were no vital American interests at stake.
<p>
<b>The New World Order </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Remember the New World Order that some American foreign policy gurus were hoping to achieve?  The rest of us ordinary folks soon learned that it was long on new and short on order. Some of us have called this the age of chaos.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I can almost point to the very moment when American foreign policy began losing its purpose. It was that defining day in Moscow -- the day when the line at McDonald's became longer than the line at Lenin's tomb. That really happened, and when it did the communism versus capitalism argument was over. The tenor of the discussion in Russia went from "We will bury you" to "Do you want fries with that?"  But with it, too, went America's organizing purpose abroad. Our prior purpose had been containment of the Soviet Union and eventually, for us conservatives, liberation of the captive nations.
<P>
<b>Isolationist Right and Interventionist Left</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the United States has been searching for an intellectual framework for its foreign policy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A band of conservative isolationists on the fringe wants America to withdraw from the world altogether, while a suddenly macho band of liberal interventionists seeks to remake Haiti, Rwanda, Somalia, and the rest of the world in its own preening self-image.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The isolationist right thinks that we have few vital interests and so we shouldn't join alliances, which only entangle us. The interventionist left distrusts America's power and our vital interests and seeks to deny them by putting our troops and interests under the authority of the United Nations. Both approaches reflect a defeatist attitude of an America in decline -- a pessimistic attitude that America cannot hold its own in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fringe isolationist right hides behind protectionism, having no confidence that the U.S. can compete in the international world economy. The interventionist left hides behind multilateralism, having no confidence that the U.S. can compete in values and in the integrity of its interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The real problem, it seems to me, is that neither group has any conception of America's true vital interests in the real world today.
<p>
<b>Clinton's Foreign Policy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's foreign policy reminds me of the man who said he wanted to take assertiveness training but that his wife wouldn't let him. It variously and alternately seeks to promote human rights, alleviate human suffering, recreate history by undoing coups, build Western-style nations in places that have no Western values, stop nuclear proliferation with vague unverifiable agreements, and advance democracy and international law while raising the planet's environmental conscience.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When not engaged in these activities, the U.S. State Department, under mandates from earlier liberal Congresses issues reports on America's own human rights abuses and bemoans what it calls the historical and continuing oppression of African Americans, Native Americans, and Women Americans. Meanwhile, the U.S. foreign aid bill mandates that U.S. government agencies promote "harmony among diverse racial, religious, and ethnic groups" in foreign countries -- something we can't accomplish or even define at home. Elsewhere in our foreign aid program, it's mandated that we must "include the economic empowerment of women as a factor in the evaluation of projects and programs."  We're even supposed to stop discrimination by foreign governments against people with disabilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Currently, the ultimate foreign policy test is not the vital interests of the American people, but mushy compassion. I commend to you a scathing article in the current issue of the journal <I>Foreign Affairs</I> entitled "Foreign Policy as Social Work," which rakes the Clinton Administration over the coals for its feel-good foreign policy. Written by Michael Mandelbaum, a foreign policy scholar who is no conservative and initially supported the Clinton Administration, the article lambastes the Administration for a misconceived foreign policy that is aimed at relieving suffering in conflict-ridden regions of the world rather than promoting American national interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton presided over three failed military interventions in his first year in office which then set the tone and much of the agenda for this Administration's foreign policy. 
These were:
<P><ul>
<li> The announced intention and subsequent failure to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia and bomb the Bosnian Serbs in May 1993;
<p>
<li> The deaths of 18 U.S. Army Rangers in a failed Special Forces operation in Somalia in early October 1993; and
<p>
<li> The dispatch of a U.S. Navy ship carrying military trainers and its subsequent recall due to anti-American demonstrations in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in mid-October 1993.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Clinton, American foreign policy has been transformed into an international social welfare program. Clinton has expended billions of dollars and scores of American lives in these naive military interventions in Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti -- three countries where the U.S. has no vital interests at stake.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Somalia, the Clinton Administration inherited a humanitarian intervention designed to feed starving Somalians. But while President Bush sent American troops to Somalia to feed people, President Clinton clumsily escalated the mission into a doomed scenario called "nation-building."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Bosnia, Clinton has zigged and zagged so many times, nobody is sure what U.S. policy actually is. But the same mission creep that led to disaster in Somalia is built into the ambiguous U.S. intervention in Bosnia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Haiti, Clinton has chosen to commit the U.S. to bring stability and democracy by working with an unstable leader, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in a country that has never had a stable democracy. Slowly, it is dawning even on the President that the only way to sustain Aristide in office is to extend the stay of U.S. troops in Haiti. Our troops have become Aristide's palace guard. The intervention has already cost an estimated $1.9 billion. This is the equivalent of almost $300 for each of Haiti's 6.5 million people.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration is a hawk on Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia -- in other words, causes that require only small-scale military actions, enjoy the cover of U.N. approval, and serve no clear-cut strategic interest of the United States. And yet it is a dove when it comes to standing up to North Korea, Iran, or some other hostile power that genuinely does threaten U.S. vital interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;That is not all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's feel-good foreign policy focuses on peripheral international issues, often to curry favor with special-interest domestic political constituencies. For example, the Administration actively has intervened in Haiti to court African-Americans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These politically motivated actions are not only an unnecessary waste. They also come at the expense of important American foreign policy interests and defense needs. Humanitarian interventions and nation-building experiments have diverted attention from key items on the American foreign policy agenda.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These key items include:
<p><ul>
<li> Bilateral relations with Russia, whose recent elections have underscored a growing anti-Western backlash;
<p>
<li> China, which is becoming increasingly aggressive and belligerent in East Asia;
<p>
<li> Iran, whose clandestine nuclear efforts and continued export of terrorism have led Congress to seize the initiative and force the Administration to impose trade sanctions;
<p>
<li> NATO, whose future now has become entangled with the future of Bosnia, a military quagmire of uncertain resolution;
<p>
<li> Missile defense, a critical element of national defense that the Administration has woefully neglected; and
<P>
<li> The promotion of free trade, which the Administration allowed to fall by the wayside when it failed to gain fast-track negotiating authority for expanding NAFTA to include Chile.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, the expanding commitment of U.S. military forces to far-flung humanitarian and peacekeeping operations has stretched thin our military forces around the globe. These commitments have also undermined our ability to respond to dangerous threats to our vital interests elsewhere. A recent article in the <I>Washington Times</I> reported that Pentagon officials are concerned that the commitment of 30,000 American troops to Bosnia and the surrounding region will seriously undermine our ability to repel aggression in the Persian Gulf or on the Korean peninsula -- you see, in military and foreign policy, everything is connected to everything else. Thus, the diversion of U.S. combat troops to peacekeeping operations depletes our strategic reserves. It erodes military readiness by interfering with training to sharpen warfighting skills.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the concerns of the Pentagon, the Administration is now considering an additional peacekeeping operation -- the deployment of U.S. troops to the Golan Heights if a peace treaty is signed by Israel and Syria. Such a deployment is dangerous. It will be either too small to defend itself if another Middle East war erupts or too big, further straining our ability to meet other military contingencies around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition, it will be an inviting target for a group of terrorists -- or an official party to the treaty (I refer to Syria and not, of course, to Israel). I say inviting target because the U.S. troops would be an especially attractive "trip wire" to bring the U.S. into the conflict or to drive the U.S. home, out of our more appropriate role in the Middle East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In summary, ladies and gentlemen, America now has a foreign policy as chaotic as the world itself. I do not believe such a policy can possibly offer the leadership that is needed to protect American interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have a policy of good intentions, as defined by a bunch of mushy-minded liberals. But in foreign policy, good intentions are not enough. We all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. As Mandelbaum noted in his article, "While Mother Teresa is an admirable person and social work a noble profession, conducting American foreign policy by her example is an expensive proposition."  And, I might add, an ineffective and inefficient one at that.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So what is to be done?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
My friends, first of all, the left-liberals in America need to get over this notion that it's somehow embarrassing or even immoral to have vital global interests. The isolationists need to get over the idea that, with Soviet communism gone, we no longer have global interests. The fact is, the United States is a global power. Responsibility as a global power requires us to behave like a global power. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We can protect neither our interests nor our values unless we remain a global power. As we approach the 21st century, we must apply the lessons we learned in the 20th century: It is too dangerous for us to hide and to put our heads in the sand.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe the world longs for America's leadership, the kind of leadership that led Ronald Reagan to stand there in Berlin in 1987 and demand, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"  Each day we find out more and more from Soviet archives how it was U.S. strength that freed the people of the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe the world is a freer, safer, more stable place when the U.S. is actively pursuing its own vital national interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Leadership that we have because we are the world's only remaining superpower -- 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Militarily:</b> America's blue water Navy helps safeguard access to free trade and natural resources not just for the U.S., but for all nations. The guarantee of U.S. military support for the NATO alliance is critical to Europe remaining a free and prosperous community of nations. But that does not mean the U.S. should get involved in a local conflicts like the one in Bosnia. Resolving that thorny crisis is a European interest, not an American interest
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Economically:</b> Not only is the U.S. economy the world's largest, but Americans lead the world economy as both importers and exporters.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Educationally:</b> I don't need to tell you how many students from around the world come to America to study. When these students return home, they take with them experiences that bolster free ideas and free markets in their countries -- and that benefits us all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Technologically:</b> America leads the world in inventions and innovations of all kinds, and the whole world benefits. Look at the personal computer, soon to be as common and affordable as the television set. This tool empowers people everywhere to tap into the enormous wealth of information on the Internet and to share ideas unimpeded by national boundaries.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Entrepreneurially:</b> America's corporations know better than anyone how important it is to remain flexible in a global economy. Hence they are constantly innovating, finding ways to do more, to do it better, and to do it with fewer resources. When the world's largest economy does these things, it is felt around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Culturally:</b> You can travel anywhere in the world and see vivid signs of American culture like popular music and movie stars. Less vivid but more enduring, however, are the ideas of democracy and free markets that the United States has been sharing with the other nations of the world for over two centuries, helping to make the world safer and more prosperous for everyone.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe that when America's vital interests are served, so are the values of political and economic freedom worldwide, because to the extent that America is a strong leader protecting its values, those same democratic values are safer and more vital elsewhere in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Here, briefly, are what I believe America's interests to be.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #1: Safeguard U.S. national security.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This means, above all, to protect America's territory, borders, and airspace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our borders are not threatened by the likes of Haitian boat people -- a situation created by our own economic embargo of that poor, desperate country. No, the biggest threat to the United States remains long-range missiles armed with nuclear weapons. Our response to this threat should include an anti-missile defense and a broad nonproliferation policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration vetoed Congress's defense bill recently, largely because it contained an aggressive program for building missile defenses for America by the year 2003. Yet Secretary of Defense William Perry just last month finalized plans for building a missile defense system for Israel in five years, using existing technology. To quote Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, "it will be a great contribution to the security" of the Middle East. But I believe it is inconsistent -- no, it is mad for the United States to help allies to defend themselves against missile attacks while denying our own citizens that same capability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A broad nonproliferation policy also should be a vital component of American foreign policy. If diplomacy fails to discourage hostile powers from acquiring nuclear weapons, our vital interest could warrant the use of force -- unilaterally if necessary -- to stop renegade nations from becoming nuclear powers. I believe the civilized world would sigh with relief if we decided to eliminate those facilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This also means maintenance of the necessary conventional forces to protect our homeland.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #2: Prevent a major power threat to Europe, East Asia, or the Persian Gulf.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Here threats include expansionist activities by Russia against her neighbors, an expansionist Iraq or Iran, or a nuclear-armed North Korea. And we should not focus simply on immediate threats. Today radical nationalism, Islamic fundamentalism, and -- although not as threatening as its original version -- neocommunism exist in places where the U.S. has vital interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Regarding Europe, it is a false economy to withdraw any more of our 100,000 troops just because Russia is not an immediate danger. To those who say, "Well, we'll just come back if or when Russia is a threat again," I say, "You mean like we did in 1944 on the beaches of Normandy?"  And to those who ask, "Why should America pay anything to defend Europe or East Asia?"  I say, "We're not paying for Europe's defense or Japan's defense. We're paying for <I>our</I> defense."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Far better to keep 100,000 troops in Europe to maintain the peace than to send a million later to fight a war started in our absence. Far better to enter into strategic alliances -- like NATO and our mutual defense treaties with Japan and South Korea -- than to try to go it alone.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A word about China: The rulers in Beijing must learn that it is in the national interest of the U.S. to stay a permanent Pacific power. This means that we will not tolerate any forcible activity from mainland China against Taiwan. Taiwan is much more than our 7th-largest trading partner. She has also become the model for a vigorous, democratic, free-market society in Asia. We will not tolerate an invasion, blockade, or aggressive activity by mainland China against Taiwan.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #3: Maintain access to foreign trade.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The greatest danger here comes not from outside U.S. borders but from inside, from those who fear America cannot compete. The protectionists who opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and GATT are pessimists about America's future. They favor the low-paying textile jobs of the past over the higher paying technology jobs of tomorrow. They are blind to the regenerative power of the free market, which they believe in devoutly for the domestic economy but not for the world economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
GATT was central to the Reagan and Bush agendas because those administrations recognized that the U.S. is the world's largest exporter, not just the world's largest economy. Yet some Republicans seem to forget this, and some of them even have edged toward playing politics with free trade. I hope those Republicans return to the party's long tradition of seeking open markets for the benefit of both U.S. consumers and U.S. exporters.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation supported the Clinton Administration on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and we supported it on GATT. We will continue to support further efforts toward expanded free trade, such as expanding NAFTA to include Chile as the next step.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I have confidence that our great nation, with our great people, can compete economically with any country. I am distressed by those who don't have this confidence in America, that we can compete and win.
<P>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #4: Protect Americans against threats to their lives and well-being.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. has an obligation whenever possible to protect American citizens from terrorist activity and other international criminal activity. Yet, if a recent incident is any indication, I don't think the U.S. State Department quite understands this elementary concept.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Terry Anderson, who was held hostage for seven years by Lebanese terrorists, wrote a book on his captivity entitled <I>Den of Lions</I>. While he was writing it, the U.S. State Department refused to turn over any documents it had on his captors for two years because -- get this -- it felt compelled to protect their privacy!  The State Department said it could not give Anderson the documents unless he received written permission from the terrorists for the information's release.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Is it any wonder the State Department seems to have a problem sorting out America's vital interests?  As the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, wrote to Secretary of State Christopher on the day after our seismic November 1994 elections, "It's about time there was an American Desk at the Department of State."
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #5: Maintain access to resources.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American economy depends on foreign oil, which now accounts for more than 50 percent of America's oil consumption and is expected to provide an increasing share of future oil consumption. A threat to our oil supply is a threat to our national interest. Tour the oil fields of Kuwait, as I did three months ago, and you will see first-hand why we must maintain our access to vital natural resources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Reduced to their basics, then these are America's five vital interests.
<P>

<b>Assertive Multilateralism: A Liberal Oxymoron</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Liberals, of course, often believe that where the U.S. has real interests is exactly where we should tread the lightest because these interests are somehow unseemly. As a result, America's foreign policy recently has pursued what is called "assertive multilateralism" -- a contradiction in terms if I've ever heard one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me add that using force multinationally is no more moral than wielding it unilaterally. The U.N. is filled with governments and dictatorships that do not represent the wills of their people. Why is the U.N. more moral than the U.S. Congress?  Yet President Clinton sought and received U.N. approval for invading Haiti but skipped the U.S. Congress. I believe multilateralism is the abandonment of America's leadership role in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, beyond these vital interests I've just mentioned, America has a number of other important interests, as well as many marginal ones, constantly tugging at us. The U.S. has an important interest in promoting democracy and free markets abroad, especially in regions where old totalitarian or authoritarian empires have collapsed. The more democratic the world becomes, the more peaceful it becomes, and therefore the more congenial for U.S. values and interests. Public diplomacy -- that is, reaching out above governments to tell America's story to the world -- is an important tool for promoting American interests and values.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The problem, however, is that the marginal interests -- not the vital ones -- have been driving our foreign policy. This has undermined U.S. credibility abroad and casts doubt on the steadfastness of American foreign policy in many places. This situation will not endure. I'm reminded of what Winston Churchill said during World War II: "You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing, but only after they exhaust all other opportunities."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So, in closing, I believe the United States eventually will do the right thing and recognize our own vital interests. We need not deny these interests. The world need not fear them. They are a stabilizing force for peace and prosperity. That we believe in democracy, freedom, and the power of open markets is something of which we should be proud, not ashamed. We should reassert this in a positive and forthright way. Maintaining the strength and the coherent international principles to protect those values is not a luxury. Rather, it is an obligation of the federal government written into our Constitution. It is the most basic obligation of all: "to provide for the common defense... and secure the blessings of liberty."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The poet Carl Sandburg wrote of American destiny that "Always there arose enough reserves of strength, balances of sanity, portions of wisdom to carry the nation through to a fresh start with ever renewing vitality."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe America's vitality and leadership abroad will return, but I think it will take a change of administration to accomplish this. It is a challenge and an opportunity that we, as a great nation, cannot afford to let pass.

<center><h2>LIFT THE ARMS EMBARGO ON BOSNIA</h2><p>
by <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
<b>Executive Memorandum 421</b><br>

July 18, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%><p>
</center>
<p>

	The July 11 seizure of the Bosnian Muslim enclave of Srebrenica by Bosnian Serb forces
has underscored the failure of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia. 
UNPROFOR peacekeeping troops once again have been taken hostage, unable to defend
themselves, let alone Bosnian civilians, against aggression by the Bosnian Serbs.  The fall of
Srebrenica, the first "safe area" to be declared by the U.N. in Bosnia, and the ongoing Serb
assault against the Zepa safe area highlight the vulnerability of the four remaining safe areas in
eastern Bosnia.  As the fighting in Bosnia continues to escalate, it is time for the Clinton
Administration to abandon its doomed policy on Bosnia, accept the inevitable withdrawal of the
ineffectual U.N. peacekeeping mission there, and lift the ill-considered arms embargo on the
Bosnian government.  <p>

<p>

	Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole has proposed that the U.S. do just that.  The Senate
this week will vote on his bill, S. 21, co-sponsored with Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), that
will terminate the arms embargo after UNPROFOR withdraws or 12 weeks after it is requested
to do so by the Bosnian government.  The Clinton Administration has criticized Dole's proposal
as risking expansion of the fighting, overlooking the fact that the fighting already has raged out
of control despite the limp efforts of U.N. peacekeepers to contain it.  The Administration
stubbornly clings to the illusion that there is a peace to keep in Bosnia, when it is clear that both
sides are spoiling for a fight.<p>

<p>

	The sad truth is that President Clinton's policy zigzags have made a tragic situation in
Bosnia worse.  By repeatedly promising resolute action, such as U.S. air strikes or the
commitment of U.S. ground troops, and then retreating, Clinton has eroded U.S. credibility and
undermined NATO cohesion without appreciably slowing the steady slide of U.N. peacekeeping
forces into near-irrelevance.  The increasingly truculent Bosnian Serbs have steadily undermined
the U.N.'s three goals in Bosnia: to provide humanitarian aid to Bosnian civilians, to moderate
the ferocity of the fighting, and to encourage a diplomatic settlement. Peace efforts have failed
primarily because the Bosnian Serbs have concluded, based on their military superiority to date,
that they have more to gain by fighting than by negotiating.<p>

<p>

	The Serbs have been aided by the arms embargo on Yugoslavia imposed by the U.N. in
1991.  The arms embargo allowed the 80,000 man-Bosnian Serb militia, armed and supported by
neighboring Serbia, to retain control of the territory that it has conquered, roughly 70 percent of
Bosnia, in large part due to a near monopoly of heavy weapons.  The Bosnian government can
mobilize up to 200,000 men but has been unable to arm them because of  the embargo.  Less
than one in three of its potential fighters has weapons, and it is outgunned by the smaller Serb
force.  Nevertheless, the increasingly effective Bosnian army has scored some military successes
in recent months over Serb forces stretched thin along the 1,600-kilometer front.  This has
prompted the Serbs to step up their efforts to eliminate the isolated pro-government enclaves in
eastern Bosnia so that they can consolidate their forces.<p>

<p>

	As the situation in Bosnia continues to deteriorate, the Clinton Administration should:<p>

<p>

	<b>* End the failed U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia</b>.  The 24,700-man UNPROFOR
contingent clearly has lost its credibility with all Bosnian factions. Withdrawal would be better
sooner than later.  If a pull-out is to be completed before winter snows clog the rugged Bosnian
road network, a decision to withdraw must be made by the end of August.<p>

<p>

	<b>*  Rule out the commitment of U.S. ground troops, except to extract UNPROFOR.</b> 
French President Jacques Chirac has asked President Clinton to deploy U.S. troops to reinforce
the remaining U.N. safe areas.  Clinton rejected this, but the Administration reportedly still is
considering providing logistical support for U.N. troops in the safe areas that would involve the
dispatch of heavy-lift and combat helicopters over Serb-held territory.  This would be a
dangerous mistake.  It would raise the stakes of U.S. involvement without significantly changing
the situation on the ground.  If France and other nations involved in the failed peacekeeping
effort unwisely choose to escalate their involvement, they should do so without counting on
American backing.  The U.S. has no vital interest at stake in Bosnia.  U.S. troops therefore
should be committed only in an emergency to save U.N. peacekeeping troops that are being
withdrawn, not risked to help them prolong their ill-fated mission.<p>

<p>

	If called upon to fulfill President Clinton's promise to provide up to 25,000 U.S. troops
as part of a 60,000-strong NATO force to extricate UNPROFOR, the U.S. should do so only if
its troops are under exclusive NATO command, free from U.N. interference and equivocation. 
Moreover, U.S. troops should operate under rules of engagement which allow for massive
retaliation, instead of  half-hearted pinprick reprisals, if U.S. forces are attacked.  Although the
Bosnian Serbs probably will not seek to block the withdrawal of U.N. forces, they will seek to
capture U.N. military equipment.  No U.S. troops should be risked to retrieve equipment. 
Instead, the countries that contributed peacekeepers should warn the Serbs that they will provide
the Bosnian government with three times the amount of military equipment that the Serbs seize
during the withdrawal.  Sadly, many of the problems related to a withdrawal are likely to come
from Bosnian Muslims embittered by the U.N.'s failure to live up to their high expectations.  The
U.S. should warn the Bosnian government that any prospects for future cooperation will rest on
its full cooperation during the withdrawal of U.N. forces.  President Clinton should appear on
national television to state clearly the limited and temporary nature of the U.S. military
commitment and warn the warring Balkan factions against interfering with the extraction
operation.<p>

<p>

	<b>*  Lift the arms embargo on Bosnia</b>.  After U.N. forces have been withdrawn, there
should be no excuse for preventing the Bosnian government from arming itself in self-defense.  
The U.S. should terminate the embargo because it contravenes Bosnia's right of self-defense, a
violation of  Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. The U.S. and NATO then should consider arming
the Bosnian government, but should rule out air strikes or logistical support that could entangle
NATO in the war.  Washington must be careful not to feed Bosnian hopes of increased U.S.
backing, for that will encourage the Bosnian government to form unrealistic expectations that
will make it less amenable to the hard compromises that will be required of both sides if there is
to be a negotiated settlement.<p>

<p>

	<b>*  Maintain economic sanctions against Serbia until it helps push through an
acceptable settlement in Bosnia.</b>  Economic sanctions and the arms embargo should not be
lifted until Serbia has forced its proxies in Bosnia to accept a settlement that will return most of
Bosnia to government control.<p>

<p>

<b>CONCLUSION<p>

</b><p>

	The withdrawal of  U.N. forces and lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia will lead
to greater bloodshed in the short run. But the risks of this course of action are outweighed by the
risks of continuing the current policy of bluster and retreat, which has led the U.N.
"peacekeepers" to become impotent bystanders as war rages around them.  By lifting the arms
embargo, the U.S. can help the Bosnians to defend themselves without becoming inextricably
bogged down in the Balkan quagmire.  Moreover, by allowing the Bosnians to build their
military strength and increase their ability to recover lost territory, the U.S. can help lay the
groundwork for a viable political settlement in the long run. <p>

<h3>THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE BEGINS IN RUSSIA</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm"> Ariel Cohen, Ph.D.</a><br>

Executive Memorandum No. 457<br>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Lieutenant General (Ret.) Alexander Lebed, Russia's new National Security Council Secretary and President Boris Yeltsin's defense aide, already is locked in a succession struggle with Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin. The outcome of this battle is particularly important in view of reports of President Yeltsin's poor health. The nomination of Lebed protege Colonel-General Igor Rodionov as Russia's Defense Minister on July 17 has strengthened Lebed's hand. The nomination of reformist Anatoly Chubais as Yeltsin's Chief of Staff strengthens the democratic faction and the Chernomyrdin camp. A situation of such uncertainty requires that U.S. policymakers maintain dialogue with all factions in Moscow, including General Lebed's.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Lebed joined the Yeltsin administration after the first round of presidential elections, and the next act of the Russian political drama began immediately, leaving little time for the thorough discussion of policy direction that Russia so badly needs. In exchange for supporting Yeltsin, Lebed demanded that Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, his former commander and boss, be fired. He also asked for and received a broad mandate to lead and reform both the military and the security forces.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

No sooner had he joined Yeltsin's administration than Lebed offended his new boss by saying that he, Lebed, might become president before the year 2000, when Yeltsin's term expires. Lebed is lobbying aggressively to be appointed to the currently nonexistent position of vice president, which would give him supreme power if Yeltsin was incapacitated. This was met with a sharp rebuke from Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, who said that Russia is still recovering from its experience with the previous Vice President, the flamboyant Alexander Rutskoy, who politically self-destructed in 1993. Lebed also may have annoyed Yeltsin by lobbying publicly to expand his authority as the de facto head of the Russian National Security Council.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The ambitious general has embarked on a power-grabbing expedition. No one knows where Lebed's anti-corruption drive may end, and who may become its next victim. In Russia's current legal limbo, almost anyone can be charged with corruption.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Western Russia-watchers initially looked upon Lebed as a born-again liberal. However, conversations by the author with his staff in Moscow indicate that the general, as they call him, is no follower of Jefferson. He hired, then dropped, a Moscow economist by the name of Vitaly Naishul, who is an admirer of Chilean General Augusto Pinochet's economic policies. Naishul is credited with writing a large part of "Truth and Order," Lebed's no-nonsense, market oriented election platform. But he also believes that Lebed, if he becomes president, needs to "nominate a professional parliament which will consist of experts" -- a chilling thought for those in Russia who believe in universal suffrage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Lebed's sophisticated image-makers are deeply disenchanted with Russia's experiment with democracy and far too ready to drop it for imperial grandeur and "real power."  Moreover, the key roles in Lebed's inner circle increasingly are being played by hard-line military veterans who would like to re-orient Russia away from the West and toward cooperation with Iran and Iraq. One such insider -- Heydar Jemal, Chairman of the Islamic Committee of Russia, which claims to represent Russia's 20-million-strong Muslim community -- allegedly has  close links to the Islamic regime in Tehran, according to the newspaper Izvestiya.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There are no guarantees that Lebed will remain a democrat. He sees his Security Council position as a stepping-stone to the presidency. Moreover, certain sectors of Russian society like the military-industrial complex, the security forces, and the armed forces remain inherently hard-line and can be counted on to seek senior political figures to represent them at the pinnacle of power. General Lebed seems almost tailor-made for the job.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

However, it is not clear whether Lebed will survive the infighting within the Kremlin. Yeltsin is a master of balance-of-power intrigue, and Lebed's utility dropped greatly after the second round of elections. In the words of one senior Russian diplomat, speaking recently off the record at The Heritage Foundation, "the Kremlin ice is so slippery -- you either learn how to skate, or you fall and break your bones."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is aware of Lebed's ambitious plans and already is taking steps to preempt the general in the forthcoming battle for succession. A veteran of Soviet and Russian power struggles, Chernomyrdin projects the image of a no-nonsense manager. He will retain the reins of the economy and close ties within the energy sector (he was Minister of the Gas Industry during the Gorbachev administration). Chernomyrdin enjoys the trust of the Soviet-era industrial managers: He is "one of them."  But he also will be supported by the new Russian business elite. If Chubais works in tandem with Chernomyrdin against Lebed, the backing of wealthy Russian bankers will be guaranteed as well.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Western multilateral financial organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have invested heavily in a relationship with the Russian Prime Minister, and so has Clinton's White House through the high-powered Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which supervises everything from space cooperation to defense conversion. The West would prefer to see the stolid and predictable Chernomyrdin at Russia's helm rather than the mercurial nationalist Lebed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

America and the West need to understand that the Lebed-Chernomyrdin power struggle has begun. In this struggle, the powerful Russian oil and gas industry will deploy its financial might against the muscle of the armed forces and security services. Lebed may rally to his side the nationalists and the inherently hard-line national security establishment. But Kremlin insiders view Lebed (whose name means "swan" in Russian) not as a regal bird, but as a raging bull on the Kremlin's slippery ice. The prognosis for his long-term success, while guarded, has improved with the nomination of Rodionov as head of the "Moscow Pentagon."  The outcome of this struggle will depend also on President Yeltsin's health, vigor, and longevity in office.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.S. and the West should establish an intensive dialog with Lebed and his staff. The general has shown that he is a quick study and that he possesses a good measure of common sense. But he is inexperienced about the West and its ways and values; he comes from the Soviet armed forces and therefore has received his share of indoctrination in anti-Western xenophobia and Russian nationalism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Lebed should be invited both to Washington and to NATO headquarters in Brussels. He has yet to make up his mind about solutions to many of the burning issues facing Russia, such as economic and military reform and the fight against crime and corruption, and may be receptive to Western views, policy inputs, and assistance. While National Security Advisor Anthony Lake is Lebed's official counterpart, Secretary of Defense William Perry, who coordinates military and security aspects of the Administration's Russia policy, would be the best candidate to invite Lebed to Washington. Perry has the knowledge and interest in Russian affairs to educate Lebed about the U.S. and the West. In any event, a long-term dialogue between Lebed and American security officials should begin now.

<h3> THE RUSSIAN ELECTIONS: A GLIMMER OF HOPE FOR REFORM</h3>

Executive Memorandum No. 454<br>
June 24, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first round of the Russian presidential elections, held on Sunday June 16, 1996, confirms a trend that began with the parliamentary elections in December 1995: Russia is now holding regular national elections that are relatively free and fair. This is no small achievement for a country that has known such leaders as Ivan the Terrible and Josef Stalin. These elections strengthen Russian democracy, and credit should go to the Russian people. But credit should go also to Boris Yeltsin and even presidential candidate Mikhail Gorbachev, who received only 0.5 percent of the vote. They shepherded their country toward a participatory political system after decades of totalitarian communism.
<p>


<b>Communist and nationalist messages rejected.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Communist Gennady Zyuganov and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky seem to be failing to obtain a democratic majority. Zyuganov received 31.96 percent of the vote, while Zhirinovsky got only 5.78 percent, down from the 11 percent his party received in the last election. Most Russians are unhappy with the Yeltsin administration, but they prefer the continuation of market reforms and individual freedoms, even under Yeltsin's faltering leadership, to a return to the communist past. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Boris Yeltsin shrewdly turned the elections into a referendum on communism, polarizing the electorate and saturating the airwaves and print media with anti-communist messages. The Russian President masterfully played on the fear that a communist victory would lead to a new civil war. The communists played into his hands by refusing to adapt their ideology to the new times and new generation. Unlike their Central European colleagues, who by and large have transformed themselves into Western-style social democrats, Russian communists have preserved the spirit, the name, and the trappings of Lenin's party and teachings, adding to them a particularly virulent brand of Russian chauvinism. This not only makes Russian communists appear to be throwbacks to the past. It also limits their voter appeal, especially among the young and the business class.
<p>


<b>The Messengers and the Messages.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; There was also a tremendous difference in style between Yeltsin and Zyuganov. Yeltsin ran a modern, Western-style campaign, complete with "Rock the Vote" concerts, "Choose or You Lose" slogans, widespread television advertising, and media advisers imported from the U.S. By contrast, the communists relied on door-to-door canvassing and tedious party meetings. Yeltsin's new style of campaigning paid off. His popularity surged from single digits in January to an impressive 35 percent, while the communists failed to expand their electoral base, which hovers around 30 percent. Yeltsin made great strides in spite of the dire economic crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During his campaign, Yeltsin took advantage of his incumbency, promising everything from pension increases to wage and stipend hikes and even tax breaks for entire regions. He leaned on the media to ensure favorable coverage for himself. The liberal media were only too glad to deliver the anti-communist message. They did not want to see their freedoms dashed by a return to communist repression.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The impressive vote for retired Lieutenant General Alexander Lebed, who received 14.8 percent of the vote, demonstrated public nostalgia for great power prestige and a thirst for law and order. But the General Lebed of today is not the unabashed hard-liner he was two years ago. He is a professed convert to the gospel of the free market, small state, and democratic principles and procedures. He also seems to recognize the limits of Russian imperialism. The general knows that over 80 percent of the Russian public does not support using military power in the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, not even to assist ethnic Russians residing there. The majority of Russians favor an immediate end to the war in Chechnya, and a plurality even favor Chechen independence as the price for bringing troops home. Lebed has been a bitter critic of Yeltsin's war in Chechnya. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Market economist Grigory Yavlinsky, a Western-style liberal who garnered only 7.42 percent of the vote, finished fourth. He failed to establish himself as the viable alternative to Boris Yeltsin and ran a mediocre campaign that was low on cash and weak on organization. Yavlinsky reportedly does not enjoy stump speeches and campaign travel-- a handicap in a country of eleven time zones. He now has four years to build his Yabloko party into the sort of political machine he must have to win the presidency in the year 2000. He has a long road before him. His intellectual style and politics seem to be out of favor with many Russian voters. 
<p>


<b>The New Russian Electorate.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The first round of the presidential elections demonstrated that the majority of the Russian people eschew the message of the cradle-to-grave welfare state, restoration of the Soviet Union, and militant Russian chauvinism. Moreover, the voters seem to be afraid that the communists would take away the freedoms they are learning to enjoy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The electorate was divided in more ways than one. How these divisions develop in the future will have a huge impact on whether democracy takes root in Russia. The agricultural South and the economically depressed areas of European Russia went for Zyuganov, while most of the resource-rich Far East, Siberia and the North, and the relatively more prosperous large cities voted for Yeltsin and Yavlinsky. The electorate under 35 years of age, large city dwellers, and voters with higher education rejected the communist message. By contrast, rural dwellers, voters over 55 years old, and people with only a secondary education cast their votes for Zyuganov. As older voters pass away, the younger generation that tends to be more democratic will gain more influence in Russian politics. Pro-reform regions in the Far East and Siberia also may continue to grow in political influence, which is good news not only for reform, but for the national unity of Russia's far-flung regions. 
<p>


<b>Second Round Crucial.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; All of this is good news, but it should not be exaggerated. The degree of popular discontent in Russia should not be underestimated. A Yeltsin victory in the upcoming runoff elections, now scheduled for July 3, is not guaranteed. Zyuganov will do his best to play on voter frustrations to win. However, Boris Yeltsin is a master politician. The nomination of Alexander Lebed to serve as Russia's Head of the Security Council and Yeltsin's national security aide, and the firing of Lebed's unpopular rival, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, make the Yeltsin ticket particularly strong. An even greater boost to Yeltsin's popularity is his firing of the unpopular chief of the Kremlin Guards, General Alexander Korzhakov, as well as Internal Security chief Mikhail Barsukov and Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. Moreover, if Yeltsin brings Grigory Yavlinsky into the government as the economic policy czar, or otherwise secures his endorsement, he will improve his chances for re-election significantly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Voter turnout will be an extremely important factor in the runoff. The communist electorate is disciplined, and Yeltsin will need to pay close attention to getting out the vote in order to achieve victory. Otherwise, many voters may decide that Yeltsin's victory is a foregone conclusion and stay away from the voting booths, attending their garden plots and summer homes.
<p>

<b>Conclusion.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; From under the rubble of the former communist economy, a new Russia is emerging, complete with a consumer society and concerns about businesses and jobs. This is a new Russia whose face is much more familiar to Westerners than its previous communist one. The many problems between Russia and the West will not disappear -- problems such as differences over NATO expansion, suppling nuclear reactors to Iran, and Moscow's assertiveness outside its borders in the countries of the former Soviet Union. But at least there is hope that these problems can be worked out with Boris Yeltsin. The new Russia is making its choice for freedom, and it savors the occasion. While comprehensive economic and political reforms are painful and may take at least a generation, the current elections bring a glimmer of hope.

<title>Who Are You, Comrade Zyuganov? -- Heritage</title>

<h3>WHO ARE YOU, COMRADE ZYUGANOV?</h3>

F.Y.I. No. 108<br>
June 6, 1996<br>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to recent polls in Russia, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov ranks first among the Russian presidential candidates. President Boris Yeltsin, ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, social democrat Grigory Yavlinski, retired general Alexander Lebed, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and six other candidates are also competing for Russia's top job. On June 16, Zyuganov has a good chance of receiving a plurality of the vote -- roughly 30 percent. This percentage could allow him to participate in a runoff election four weeks later against the other highest vote-getter (most likely President Yeltsin).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's constituency consists largely of those who have lost out during Russia's progress toward a free-market economy and democracy. These people -- primarily the elderly, the unemployed, and unskilled workers who lack higher education -- are motivated not so much by communist ideology as by the hardships of day-to-day living and disappointment in the reform process. It is difficult to convince them that the communist pledges of a welfare state cannot be implemented, and that the social safety net promised by Zyuganov will require funds that are not available. The only way to raise these funds would be through a major increase in the money supply, which also would lead to hyper-inflation and even more economic hardship.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov claims to be the leader of a broad "national-patriotic" coalition and is supported by non-communist nationalist figures, such as influential Duma deputies Sergei Baburin and Alexei Podberezkin. One of the chief ideologists of Russian imperialism and militarism, Alexander Prokhanov, is among his staunchest allies.<sup>1</sup>  His political platform is a bizarre mixture of populist, communist, and Russian nationalist rhetoric that clearly implies a "communist revenge" -- turning the clock back to government ownership of Russia's industrial assets, aggressive regulation of the economy by the central government, fixed prices and wages, rationing and shortages of consumer goods, the stifling of basic freedoms, and strict control over the mass media, in addition to a new military buildup and renewed confrontation with the West. It is highly doubtful that such objectives can be achieved peacefully.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Zyuganov wins the presidential election, the potential for violence, both internally (as the communists move to crush the opposition) and externally (as Russia takes a more aggressive stance toward its neighbors and the West), will increase. The resulting destabilization could have dramatic ramifications both for Russian and U.S. vital interests. As president of Russia, Zyuganov not only would lead his country down the road of more confrontation with the U.S. and the West, but might even exaggerate his differences with the West to mobilize popular support and resentment at home.

<p>
<b>WHO ARE YOU, DR. ZYUGANOV?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On June 26, 1996, Zyuganov will be 52 years old. He was born in the village of Mymrino in the Central Russian region of Oryol, about 200 miles southwest of Moscow. The son of rural school teachers, he enjoyed higher social status, better living standards, and a richer intellectual environment than the other village children; but the post-collectivization and post-World War II hardships also affected his childhood. He graduated with honors from high school at age 17 and immediately began teaching. Zyuganov wed one of his pupils and now has two married children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1962, Zyuganov became a student at the physics and mathematics department of the local teachers college in Oryol. Less than a year later, while still a freshman, he was drafted into the army. Zyuganov served two years in a special nuclear and chemical reconnaissance unit of the Soviet troops stationed in East Germany and was sent to perform decontamination work in the South Urals after a major nuclear catastrophe in the late 1950s (a disaster hushed up by the Soviet authorities for decades). He apparently was exposed to nuclear radiation while serving in this unit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov proceeded along the typical Soviet <I>nomenklatura</I> career path. At the age of 21, while still serving in the army, he joined the Communist Party (CPSU). The fact that he was drafted into the party at such a young age indicates that he was very disciplined, politically astute and loyal, on good terms with his superiors, and sufficiently pragmatic to anticipate the benefits of early Communist Party affiliation. After resuming his studies at the college, he became a Young Communist League (Komsomol) activist and quickly went on to become a full-time functionary heading the Oryol city and regional committee. In 1974, he became a regional Communist Party deputy chief, responsible for day-to-day running of the region and for ideological questions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1978, he began postgraduate work at the prestigious Academy of Social Sciences under the Communist Party Central Committee, then the center of political training for top Communist Party <I>apparatchiks</I>. Recommendations from powerful superiors were needed to enter. He earned a Candidate (Ph.D.) at the Academy and 14 years later became a Doctor of Science in Philosophy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Completing the postgraduate course at the Academy of Social Sciences boosted his party career and allowed him to network with powerful Central Committee staff members. Soon Zyuganov was transferred to Moscow to become a bureaucrat in the CPSU Central Committee's omnipotent Propaganda Department (later renamed the Ideological Department). The Propaganda Department monitored and shaped the nation's communist indoctrination and exercised strict ideological control over all aspects of life in the USSR. In 1990, toward the end of his party career, Zyuganov was promoted to the position of deputy head of the Propaganda Department, but the fall of the Soviet Union prevented him from becoming one of the top decision makers. Moreover, the department lost influence during the perestroika years under Mikhail Gorbachev. These were not easy times for Gennady Zyuganov. He had to maneuver between his direct superior, Secretary for Ideology of the Central Committee Alexander N. Yakovlev -- the liberal "architect of perestroika" -- and hard-line Politburo Secretary Yegor K. Ligachev, who opposed Gorbachev's policies of glasnost.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov made his final choice in favor of the hard-line communists in 1990 when he joined the newly established Communist Party of the Russian Federation, which brought together all of Gorbachev's militant opponents. Zyuganov was immediately elected to the new party governing bodies and became one of the chief ideologists of the anti-democratic and anti-reform forces in Russia, working to consolidate them under his own leadership within the "national patriotic movement," a motley coalition of anti-Western, anti-reform, and anti-Semitic organizations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov co-authored the infamous "Word to the People" appeal, a declaration which called for reversing reforms, preserving the Soviet Union, and putting down the independence movements in the republics. Published in July of 1991 in the hard-line media  -- for example, in such newspapers as <I>Pravda, Segodnya</I>, and <I>Sovetskaya Rossiya</I> -- this declaration became an ideological basis for the August 1991 abortive coup, which was an attempt to restore totalitarianism in Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What Zyuganov wrote in words, he did not implement in practice, being personally either cautious or cowardly. His behavior during and after the 1991 coup significantly tainted his political image among the communists. Despite his authorship of the "Word to the People," he neither actively supported the attempt nor opposed the subsequent banning of communist parties. In fact, the ban scared Zyuganov so much that he chose to lie low for a time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The unemployed Zyuganov found asylum with the "Russian-American University" (RAU-Corporation),<sup>2</sup>  a center which became a rallying point for "national-patriotic" forces favoring a return to Russia's lost superpower status and "special way of development."  The U.S. Department of State denounced the RAU, calling it a CPSU and KGB front organization, and recommended that American government and private agencies refrain from contacts with it.<sup>3</sup>  Zyuganov plunged into the study of nationalist rhetoric. Alexander Barkashov, leader of the neo-fascist "Russian National Unity" party, once admitted that he had guided Zyuganov in mastering such concepts as the "Russian Idea" and "the Revival of the National Identity."<sup>4</sup>  These are shorthand for Russia's special national mission, geopolitical domination, and supposed racial superiority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The fact that no anti-communist purge took place after the 1991 coup attempt encouraged Zyuganov to resume his political activities. In 1992, he chaired such left-wing and ultranationalist organizations as the Council of Popular Patriotic Forces, the Duma of the Russian National Council, and the National Salvation Council, which vehemently opposed President Yeltsin's reform policies and called for his impeachment. He and his associates also filed a complaint in the Constitutional Court questioning the legitimacy of the presidential decree which had banned the Communist Party. Zyuganov and his comrades won, and the Russian Communist Party's legal status was restored in 1993. Now successful, he was elected Chairman of the Party's Central Executive Committee in February 1993.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1993, Zyuganov helped exacerbate the confrontation between Yeltsin and the "red-brown" opposition which had concentrated in the Russian Supreme Soviet, the old Russian parliament held over from the days of the Soviet Union. The conflict reached a tragic climax in October 1993 with fierce clashes between pro-government forces and opposing rebel fighters in Moscow's streets as the seat of the Russian parliament (the White House) was shelled and stormed by the army. However, Zyuganov avoided direct participation in this mutiny as well, and even condemned the appeal made by its leaders for a general strike. By standing aloof, Zyuganov managed to avoid trouble and run for the State Duma (new parliament) in the December 12, 1993, elections. Other militant opposition leaders had been banned from these elections. Curiously, Zyuganov ran while decrying the illegitimacy of the new Duma, condemning what he called the "presidential coup" which had dissolved the Supreme Soviet.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Architect of the Communist Comeback.</b> The December 1993 election to the first State Duma of Russia put Zyuganov in the leadership position within the Duma's third-largest faction, after reformist Yegor Gaidar's "Russia's Choice" and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist Liberal Democrats. For the next three years, as he continued his unequivocal and belligerent criticism of the government, his popularity continued to rise. On December 17, 1995, in the second Duma elections, Zyuganov's Communist Party received 22 percent of the votes in the Duma. He was now the leader of its largest faction.
<P>
<b>THE WORLD ACCORDING TO COMRADE ZYUGANOV</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's newly emerged philosophy has little to do with traditional Marxist-Leninist communism. Rather, it is a concoction of statist, nationalist, messianic, populist, and even religious Russian Orthodox slogans based on a profound mistrust of the West. Believing that the Western way of development can lead only to a historical dead end, Zyuganov proposes "a breakthrough to a new socio-economic system built on the great Russian cultural and historical heritage."<sup>5</sup>  However, he never specifies exactly what the elements of such a system would be and seems to ignore the fact that all attempts to achieve such a "breakthrough" under the Bolsheviks failed, generating disasters that exhausted Russia and resulted in the worse crisis the country had experienced since 1917.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov has no firsthand knowledge of the West and speaks no foreign languages, but his background, upbringing, and adult experiences have prejudiced him against what he calls "Western capitalism."  He is susceptible to anti-Western conspiracy theories that circulate regularly among Russian communists and nationalists. These speculations lay the blame for all Russia's current hardships at the feet of "American imperialism" and its mysterious "agents of influence" in Russia, as well as Jews and Freemasons. Zyuganov claimed in 1995, for example, that the Soviet Union was dismembered as the result of a U.S. National Security Council directive adopted by John F. Kennedy after the Cuban Missile Crisis. He also believes that the purportedly secret "memoranda #1, 2, 3" drafted for George Bush were part of this strategy to undo the Soviet Union. He says that he obtained this information from a classified CPSU Central Committee "Special File" (<I>Osobaya Papka</I>) containing top secret documents allegedly obtained through intelligence channels.<sup>6</sup>  However, Zyuganov's relatively low position in the CPSU Ideological Department would not have given him access to top secret documents intended only for Politburo members.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past few years, Zyuganov's aides and speechwriters have tried to blunt his anti-Western image. He often has tried to incorporate Western examples or ideas to buttress his essentially anti-Western points of view. For example, Zyuganov argued in 1994 that "Some pro-American people in this country demand that we should move towards private ownership and a limited government. But the U.S. itself rejects such an approach. Back in 1933 Franklin D. Roosevelt summoned 200 leading American industrialists and told them: ' You should share 50 percent of your income with the government or we will have an October Revolution on our hands in no time.'"<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's political campaign is based on inflaming political passions created by difficulties with the reform process. He is an alarmist who repeatedly predicts "disaster," "collapse," the "disintegration" of Russia, the extinction of the population, the humiliation of the nation, and total impoverishment.8  In his anti-Yeltsin rhetoric, he persistently condemns the government as "anti-people," carefully avoiding the fact that most of Russia's present difficulties emerged long before the reforms were started, under the communist regime of Mikhail Gorbachev. His favorite theme is that Russia is dying out, losing one million souls annually. He shuns statistics testifying to the contrary -- for example, that the mortality rate in 1995 dropped dramatically, while the birth rate grew for the first time since the 1970s.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>No Repentance.</b> Russian Communists like Zyuganov have never acknowledged or repented of the massive crimes committed against the nation by their predecessors. On the contrary, Zyuganov praises Vladimir Lenin, who personally ordered the shooting of thousands of innocent citizens, as "the most outstanding leader who unerringly felt Russia's deepest sorrows and needs."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov does not praise Stalin outright, but he also allows no official communist criticism of him.11  He claims that there was no Soviet repression in the post-World War II period<sup>12</sup> and that there are more victims of repression in prisons today than under Stalin.<sup>13</sup>  Zyuganov once told the German magazine <I>Der Spiegel</I> that only two persons were arrested in his native village in the post-World War II period, and that both were hardened criminals. In fact, however, many in this village perished during Stalin's purges.<sup>14</sup>  Zyuganov even denies that former Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov ever sent political dissidents to the Gulag and special psychiatric prisons.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Zyuganov's Electoral Platform.</b> Zyuganov's electorate is stable and will vote for him under any circumstances. Thus, his main objective is to draw in those who are still undecided. Thus far, he has failed to produce a comprehensive program that encompasses all the views of the "broad national patriotic coalition," but his electoral platform, published in March 1996, undoubtedly is not as clear-cut as the secret Program Maximum (set of ultimate political goals) designed for internal communist consumption. While publicly Zyuganov makes no mention of nationalizing privatized property, the party program calls for "nationalization or confiscation of the property acquired against the law, national interests and the rights of working people."<sup>15</sup>  Presumably, the Communist Party will assume the prerogative of determining exactly what those interests and rights are. The newly published communist economic plan, unveiled in Moscow on May 28, calls for reversal of privatization which was executed "through violation of law" and allows meager private ownership limited to apartments, small garden plots, and small service businesses. The program, if implemented, would reverse the achievements of four years of economic reform and severely injure both Russian and Western private-sector interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, Zyuganov does not offer Russia any sort of positive future. What he does pledge is a return to the communist past: economic regulation by the government, state monopoly of foreign trade, state ownership of land with no right to sell or buy property, government subsidies for bankrupt and uncompetitive industries, and restoration of the former Soviet Union.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov accuses the present government of destroying people's savings by devaluing the currency. To remedy this problem, he has promised to reimburse people for their losses. However, he overlooks the fact that most of the devaluation and confiscation of the currency occurred under the communist governments of former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov in 1990-1991, before the reforms were launched. Nor do Zyuganov and the authors of his economic plan explain where they will get the money to restore the people's savings.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's platform lacks clear and specific legislative proposals and policy guidelines. Instead, it contains numerous clichs: for example, "power should be returned to the people"; "children should get everything they are deprived of"; "women will rear children with confidence in their future"; and "talented people should be backed by the government."<sup>16</sup>  The communist election platform conceals rather than elucidates the policies Zyuganov would pursue if elected. Many in Moscow believe that Zyuganov himself does not know.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some of his comrades believe they know. A group of communist Duma members in the spring of 1996 drafted a law "On Emergency Measures to Extricate Russia from the Crisis and to Ensure Its Socio-Economic Development."  This is blatant anti-reform manifesto envisages:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Restoration</b> of the government central planning system under a reestablished committee (GosPlan);<p>

<li><b>  Review</b> all legislation on privatization (with a view to stopping or reversing all privatization);<p>

<li><b>  Restoration</b> of government ministries to manage industries;
<p>
<li><b>  Regulation</b> of wholesale and retail prices;<p>
<li><b>  High protectionist</b> tariffs on imports;<P>
<li><b>  Increased</b> taxation;
<p>
<li><b>  Modernization</b> of Russia's defense industries and increased manufacture of armaments;<P>
<li><b>  Massive government subsidies</b> for the agricultural sector; and
<p>
<li><b>  Censorship</b> of the mass media.<sup>17</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The new communist economic plan issued for public consumption before the elections is a watered-down version of this legislation. Deeply rooted in anti-Western and anti-market ideology, the plan promises retreat from market reforms, the imposition of protectionism, and greatly increased government spending for industrial and agricultural subsidies and a social safety net.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another communist idea is the restoration of the USSR, which under present circumstances would mean an attempt to rebuild a Russian empire hostile to its neighbors, both near and far. On March 15, 1996, communists in the Duma denounced the 1991 Belovezh agreement on the dismantling of the USSR. This move has caused great concern on the part of Russia's neighbors and other Western countries.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Appearing to Conciliate the West.</b> Zyuganov realizes that if he becomes president, he will still be dependent on Western loans and investments to keep the Russian economy afloat. Thus, particularly when addressing a Western audience, he does his utmost to mask his real intentions. He and his deputies currently are campaigning to convince Western politicians and the Western public that communists are harmless and that their ascension to power would strengthen democracy in Russia and improve the climate for foreign investment. This was the central theme of Zyuganov's message at the February 1996 Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland,<sup>18</sup> at which he claimed that communists accept all forms of ownership of property and are simply trying to find the appropriate combination of private and state property for Russia. However, when U.S. Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) asked what he proposed to do to protect private property, Zyuganov avoided a direct answer.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Zyuganov's messages to the West contrast sharply with his statements designed for domestic consumption. His party's internal program clearly stands for ultimate control of all property by the government. However, he does not make this point when talking to foreigners. During a recent meeting with International Monetary Fund leaders, Zyuganov neglected to mention his interview last year in the Russian nationalist paper Zavtra (Tomorrow), in which he likened the IMF emissaries to Nazi regional leaders (Gauleiters) in Russia during World War II.<sup>20</sup>  Anatoly Chubais, Russia's former First Deputy Premier and architect of Yeltsin's privatization program, while speaking at the Davos forum in February warned that if the West flirted with Zyuganov, it would be responsible for the bloodshed that could well occur if the communists moved to renationalize private property. The only way communists can implement their true plans is through violence, said Chubais; they will never confine themselves solely to declarations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Any comparison of Zyuganov to Central and East European leftist leaders is misleading. The former communists in Hungary and Poland show clear signs of having adjusted to the noncommunist political and economic system. The Russian communists do not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Intraparty Challenges.</b> Unlike Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the authoritarian leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal-Democratic Party, Gennady Zyuganov is being challenged for the leadership both of his own party and of its Duma faction. His main rival is Communist Party Chief of Staff Valentin Kuptsov, who was a contender for the chairmanship in 1993. Kuptsov, who is sophisticated and exercises strict control over the party staff, reportedly is supported by two-thirds of the party's members and by more than half of its Duma faction. Kuptsov is even more hard-line than Zyuganov and could be an even tougher adversary for Russian reformers and for the West if he ever seized power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Gennady Seleznyov, former chief editor of <I>Pravda</I> and Communist speaker of the State Duma, also has increased his influence significantly within the party. Even if Zyuganov should win the presidency, a possible shift of power to the parliament could leave him scrambling for support among Duma and party members controlled by Kuptsov and Seleznyov.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many of Zyuganov's allies in the Duma are more ideologically moderate and better integrated into the present Russian establishment than the rest of the party. In fact, many of Zyuganov's supporters are not dyed-in-the-wool communists, but bureaucrats who feel deprived of the opportunities for quick enrichment which privatization and corruption have brought so many other bureaucrats in Yeltsin's administration.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the long run, Russian policy under Zyuganov could be expected to recreate a major threat to America's interests and those of its European allies. Zyuganov's promise (made in December 1995 after the Duma elections) to invade Estonia if NATO is expanded to the Baltics, his declarations that only a reconstituted Soviet Union is capable of confronting the United States, and his deeply rooted hostility to the West all would tend to make his government assume an almost viscerally confrontational posture toward the Euro-Atlantic community should he become president of Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There are policymakers around Zyuganov who advocate Russia's aggressive involvement in the Middle East, including supporting arms sales to existing and future radical and fundamentalist regimes in the region. The fate of the world's largest oil reserves would be at stake if Moscow again attempted to destabilize the Middle East.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If they put their campaign rhetoric into practice, Zyuganov and his team would move to reverse the outcome of the Cold War by attempting to build an anti-American coalition with Iran and China. Such a development undoubtedly would trigger a massive military buildup, both in the East and in the West, as arms control agreements with Russia unraveled.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Paradoxically, if Zyuganov came to power, the effect probably would be to accelerate NATO expansion to the East, as the West would interpret his election as an increased threat from Russia. The likely communist response to NATO expansion is predictable: confrontation with the West, intimidation of neighboring countries, and threats of a nuclear and conventional military buildup.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On June 16, Russian voters across 11 time zones will vote for their next president. This will be a hard choice. The decision Russians will make is not only about the personalities of the candidates. It also is about what direction Russia will take in domestic and international policy. At stake is nothing less than whether there will be continued cooperation or renewed conflict between Russia and the West.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Boris Yeltsin, the incumbent, presided over the collapse of communism and the Soviet Union but now faces a resurgent Communist Party calling for the restoration of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin's opponent is Gennady Zyuganov, head of the Communist Party. Yeltsin was trailing Zyuganov in the polls until mid-May, but now they are running neck-and-neck, with each candidate receiving a 28-30 percent approval rating.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are other contenders in the presidential election as well: for example, liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky, the most pro-reform and pro-Western of all the candidates, including Yeltsin; nationalist General Alexander Lebed; neo-fascist Vladimir Zhirinovsky; and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The free-market, democratic alternative personified by Yavlinsky remains weak. He is expected to receive only 8-10 percent of the vote. While surprises are always possible, the race appears to have come down to a choice between Boris Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov. Yeltsin's record has been marred by the unsuccessful war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and the skyrocketing levels of crime and corruption, while communist turned nationalist Gennady Zyuganov has been compared to a Russian Slobodan Milosevic armed with nuclear weapons.<sup>1</sup>  With almost one-third of the voters still undecided and popular discontent with Russia's current situation so widespread, it will be difficult, though not impossible, for Yeltsin to win.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Electoral Behavior.</b> According to recent polls, over 70 percent of the Russian people blame Boris Yeltsin for their difficult economic situation; 92 percent consider their economy to be in "bad" or "critical" condition.<sup>2</sup>  In a poll taken in January 1996, 56 percent of the respondents said Yeltsin should resign immediately.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This distress is understandable. While privatization has occurred, the main beneficiaries have been the old communist elite and the criminal element. With the rule of law conspicuously absent, Russian society has fallen prey to an unprecedented wave of crime and corruption. Many in the electorate believe that the situation is Yeltsin's fault, and so are attracted to the communists. Indeed, over 50 percent of those polled indicated that they would not fear a Communist Party takeover.<sup>3</sup>  In fact, many see the communists as the only party capable of providing a social safety net and safeguards against rampant crime.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The elderly, who make up Russia's most active voting bloc, are staunchly pro-communist, nostalgic for a mythic Soviet past, and opposed to reforms by a margin of two to one. By contrast, young voters under 30 years old tend to be pro-reform, but their support for Yeltsin is soft, and their turnout is expected to be low.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Election Mechanics.</b> Russian law allows anyone who registers and collects one million signatures to run for president. The Central Electoral Commission (CEC), nominated jointly by both houses of the Russian parliament and the president, approves the signatures and certifies the candidates as eligible to run. In 1996, 42 candidates threw their hats in the ring, and 11 were approved by the CEC. A voter turnout below 50 percent would invalidate the election, in which case Yeltsin would remain in office and new elections would have to be scheduled within three months.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Russian elections are conducted by paper ballot: pre-printed sheets of paper on which voters check off the names of their preferred candidates. The results are aggregated by local and regional electoral commissions and then transferred electronically to a central computer run by the CEC. Reportedly, the security service in charge of electronic communications (known by the Russian acronym FAPSI) is in charge of the data processing. It is controlled by the Yeltsin administration, a fact which raises some questions concerning the reliability of the vote count.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the runoff, scheduled for 15 days after the results of the first round are counted if no candidate wins a clear majority, the two top candidates will face each other. Presumably, they will be Boris Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov. Currently, Yeltsin is slowly pulling ahead of his formidable rival.
<p>

<b>BORIS YELTSIN: THE SITTING CZAR</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At 65 years of age, Boris Yeltsin has all the advantages and handicaps of incumbency. While he is blamed for falling living standards and other social ills, he is also a known quantity and a guarantor of stability. Despite his communist roots, Yeltsin has cast himself as an anti-communist during this campaign.<sup>5</suP>  Certain sectors of Russian society, especially the business elite and intellectuals, fear a communist restoration and prefer Yeltsin as the lesser of two evils. Yeltsin is particularly strong with urban, educated voters under 35 years old and with the business community.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But Yeltsin's anti-communist claims are somewhat disingenuous. The survivors in his administration are former party <I>apparatchiks</I> or communist industrial managers, including hard-line chief of staff Nikolay Yegorov, Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, and many others. Radical reformers have not fared nearly as well. Over the past four years, they have been forced out of the Yeltsin government, and Soviet-era <I>nomenklatura</I> now occupy most of the key posts. This phenomenon was epitomized by the nomination of the hard-line Russian Foreign Intelligence Service chief, Yevgenii Primakov, to the post of Foreign Minister in the fall of 1995. Primakov spent a lifetime in the Soviet foreign intelligence service, becoming one of Leonid Brezhnev's top Middle Eastern policymakers. He has personal ties to the Islamic fundamentalist regime in Tehran, as well as to both Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Muammar Qadhafi.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin increasingly has adopted old communist symbols as a way to take votes away from Zyuganov. For example, he gave an order to have the old red banners flown during the most recent celebration of V-E day on May 9. Moreover, surrounded by generals, he delivered a speech from the podium on top of Lenin's mausoleum and addressed the veterans as "comrades."  He has become more favorably disposed to the idea of interfering in the Russian "near abroad."  Indeed, Russian troops are stationed in Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Belarus, and Tajikistan, and Russia is pursuing an ambitious policy of integrating the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the loose confederation formed upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. This integration includes cooperation between the former KGB security services as well as among border guard troops, joint air defenses, and far-reaching economic policy coordination.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin has brought in a number of leading politicians, including some democrats, to work on his campaign. His former chief of staff, Sergei Filatov, former First Deputy Prime Minister and architect of privatization Anatoly Chubais, and Independence Television (NTV) Executive Director Victor Malashenko are among the leading Russian liberals working for him. Former acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar has endorsed Yeltsin, despite their bitter disagreements over the war in Chechnya.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to the pitfalls faced by any incumbent, Yeltsin has made several mistakes that have come to haunt him. First, he still has not ended the fighting in Chechnya, despite the recent cease-fire which may or may not hold. Even if Chechnya remains a part of the Russian Federation, the high casualty figures (over 30,000 dead and more than 400,000 refugees) and the sheer brutality of the war will dog Yeltsin throughout the election.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin's Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, is extremely unpopular not only inside the Russian armed forces, but with the general population as well. He is held responsible for the abysmal performance of the Russian military in Chechnya and for the widespread and growing corruption. Grachev is famous for his opulent lifestyle and goes by the nickname "Pashka the Mercedes."  Reformers want to replace Grachev with a civilian, but they have been thwarted by military leaders who resist both civilian control of the armed forces and overdue reforms of the bloated and rusty Russian war machine. Yeltsin apparently either prefers to stick with the loyal and controllable Grachev or is incapable of finding a suitable replacement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of Yeltsin's biggest political failures has been his refusal to create a political party of his own. The 500,000-strong communists are the leading political force in the country, beating the Yeltsin campaign in grass-roots organizing, turn-out-the-vote tactics, and pre-election meetings. Yeltsin controls the electronic media and the state budget. Everywhere he goes, he promises state subsidies for enterprises and other would-be constituencies. But most Russian voters are fed up with his promises. Lacking a political base outside of government, Yeltsin may discover -- as Central and East European reform governments already have -- that controlling the media is no guarantee of victory.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Rampant crime and corruption continue to plague Yeltsin's presidency. He could use a crime fighter in a prominent position, such as head of the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) or head of the Internal Security Services (FSB). Instead, the current Minister of the Interior, who is in charge of the police, is known more for opposing privatization and denouncing foreigners than for combating crime. General Mikhail Barsukov, Director of the FSB and Yeltsin's confidante, has lately embarked on a spy-catching mission, hurting Russia's relations with the West in the process. His latest "success" was uncovering an alleged British spy ring. Yet the arrest may have been little more than a cover-up for Russian organized crime outfits supplying the Irish Republican Army (IRA) with weapons, and possibly with nuclear materials.<sup>7</sup>  Yeltsin's lack of leadership in the war on crime has been a great handicap, raising serious questions about the extent of corruption in his administration.

<p>
<b>GENNADY ZYUGANOV: THE COMMUNIST CHALLENGER</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin's main challenger is Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.<sup>8</sup>  The 52-year-old Zyuganov is a quintessential Communist Party <I>apparatchik</I> who rose steadily through the ranks of the Soviet power structure, only to have it destroyed by Gorbachev's <I>glasnost</I> and <I>perestroika</I>.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov believes in the imminent collapse of Western civilization. He refers to the West as "ultra-materialist, selfish and spiritless" and regards the reforms of the 1980s as the greatest treason executed against Russia by Western intelligence agencies and their agents in Russia (the reformers). He also has condemned both former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin as traitors.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov deeply distrusts the West and is preoccupied with restoring Russia's "old glory."  He articulates the frustration of those who see Russia as a wounded superpower betrayed by its leadership and relegated by scheming adversaries to the sidelines of history. Parallels between pre-Hitler Germany, which had just lost World War I, and Russia, which was defeated in the Cold War, are too obvious to be ignored.<sup>9</sup>  Russian communists and nationalists, like the German Nazis before them, are appealing to the sort of militant and xenophobic nationalism that leads inevitably to disastrous military adventures.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov has revised communist ideology, making it more nationalistic and imperialistic than in the Soviet era. He offers an ideology to fill the spiritual void left by the collapse of the USSR -- something Yeltsin has failed to do.<sup>10</sup>  But Zyuganov's message is poisonous. He speaks and writes about a Western conspiracy, led by the U.S. and aimed at destroying first the Soviet Union and then Russia. As Zyuganov tells it, Gorbachev and Yeltsin are traitors, and the U.S. is the embodiment of all that is evil in the world; corrupt and materialistic, the U.S. and the West are doomed. At the same time, however, Zyuganov and his aides talk about the need for trade and investment with the West, and Zyuganov touts himself as a pragmatic, even pro-business Russian leader when speaking to Westerners. Like Lenin, Stalin, and Brezhnev before him, Zyuganov talks the tough anti-Western line at home but tries to portray himself as an innocuous reformer interested in Western investment when talking to Western audiences.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Flirting with God.</b> In their attempt to build a broad nationalist-communist coalition, the "new" communists have even dropped the traditional atheism from their party's platform. Today, an open believer can be a member of the party, but only if he is a member of "the three Russian traditional denominations" -- Orthodoxy, Islam, or Buddhism. This newly professed religious tolerance does not apply to Protestants, Catholics, or Jews, however, despite their deep roots in Russia. According to the communist-sponsored draft law on religion (vetoed previously by President Yeltsin), these minority denominations would become subject to severe regulation by the state. Unchecked, the communists conceivably could move to ban Western-based Protestant denominations outright. In order to steal religion's thunder, Zyuganov has announced that the socialist ideas he espouses are grounded in the 2,000-year-old Christian tradition and have deep roots in the Russian Orthodox Church.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While not personally charismatic, Zyuganov is a master tactician whose organizational skills have won grudging praise from his opponents. He organized the resurgence of the Communist Party after the blow it suffered in the 1991 coup. He won in court against proceedings initiated by the Yeltsin administration to ban the party in 1993 and then led the party to electoral victory in the Duma elections of December 1995. Zyuganov also is credited with building a broad coalition with the nationalists for the 1996 presidential elections.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Communist Party has the strongest organization in Russia. No one, including President Yeltsin, can match its network of political hacks, propagandists, union organizers, and influence peddlers. The party enjoys unparalleled popularity in the cash-starved military, obsolete heavy industry, and inefficient agricultural sectors and has largely restored its network of grass-roots cells in factories, schools, universities, and government offices. As in Soviet times, membership is by co-optation only, and three recommendations from party members in good standing are needed in order to join. Thus, the party is not a mass political movement in the Western sense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov is considered a moderate by Communist Party standards, and there are many, both within and outside the party, who are more hard-line than he. Some of these allies, such as Viktor Anpilov, head of the Marxist-Leninist "Labor Russia" movement, support Zyuganov only on condition that he drop any kind of social democratic rhetoric. Anpilov believes in shooting and jailing political opponents and is vitriolic in his denunciations of the West. In the future, Zyuganov may be challenged and replaced by a more orthodox communist; he also could be challenged successfully by such other contenders as Valentian Kuptsov, former chairman and current number two figure in the party, or Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznev.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While Yeltsin and Zyuganov most probably will remain the two front-runners for the presidency, three other candidates could break into the second round of elections. If Yeltsin stumbles -- for example, if he is incapacitated or there is a major terrorist event, possibly triggered by the war in Chechnya -- one of the following candidates could appeal to Russian voters and cut Yeltsin out of the runoff elections.

<P>
<b>GRIGORY YAVLINSKY: THE REFORMERS' BEST HOPE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of "Yabloko," a reformist party with social democratic leanings and the only free-market party left in the Duma, is projected to receive about 10 percent of the popular vote in the first round of the upcoming elections. His supporters are those who did not gain property or power in the economic reform but still have anti-communist, pro-free market, and democratic convictions. His core support is in large cities, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, among students, the intelligentsia, and some entrepreneurs. Yavlinsky rose to prominence by attacking former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar and President Yeltsin for mistakes committed during the implementation of economic reforms, although today he admits that Gaidar's reforms were "mostly correct."<sup>11</sup>  He is the author of the reformist 500-day program, which was rejected by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 and never implemented.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Born in Lviv, Ukraine, and 44 years old, Yavlinsky is the most Westernized of all the presidential candidates. He speaks English well and has a long-standing academic relationship with Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Western free-market economists sometimes consider his policies too Keynesian and inflationary, and many of the policies he advocates, such as raising pensions and salaries in the state sector, could lead to increased public spending and inflation if implemented.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yavlinsky strongly opposes the war in Chechnya, and his criticism of Yeltsin's policies in Chechnya have split traditional democratic reformers. Those who support the war, such as former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, also support Boris Yeltsin; those who oppose the war -- for example, Andrey Sakharov's widow Elena Bonner and Yeltsin's former Human Rights Commissioner, Sergei A. Kovalev -- support Yavlinsky. Yavlinsky criticizes the Yeltsin administration for violating human rights (especially in the Chechen conflict), allowing corruption to spread, and neglecting the rule of law. He also favors full economic integration of the Commonwealth of Independent States under the aegis of Russia. Such a merger would include a common market of goods, services, and labor, and possibly a single currency. At the same time, however, Yavlinsky recognizes the need for these countries to preserve their independence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yavlinsky lacks a strong party machine, is a poor campaigner, and has largely run out of funds. In addition, many in the democratic camp have not forgiven his vitriolic attacks on former Yeltsin Prime Minister and democrat Yegor Gaidar. Today, it does not appear that Yavlinsky can beat either Yeltsin or Zyuganov in the first round of elections; therefore, he is unlikely to be a strong challenger in the second round.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin and Yavlinsky have conducted negotiations that could lead to Yavlinsky's withdrawing his candidacy in favor of Yeltsin, but these talks so far have been inconclusive. Yeltsin, hoping to receive several million of Yavlinsky's votes, has stated that, if re-elected, he would offer Yavlinsky the post of First Deputy Prime Minister in charge of economic reform.<sup>12</sup>  This post, formerly occupied by the dynamic Anatoly Chubais, is occupied currently by industrialist Vladimir Kadannikov, who lacks strong credentials as a reformer. Yavlinsky is holding out, hoping for a strong showing in the first round of the elections, and possibly that he will be offered the post of Prime Minister if Yeltsin's position seems desperate enough. As his price for supporting Yeltsin for president, Yavlinsky also is demanding an end to the war in Chechnya and the firing of some the hard-liners in the current administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yavlinsky could win in his campaign dealings with Yeltsin, or he could destroy his political future and reputation. If his demands are accepted, and if he can secure some guarantees that Yeltsin will not fire him, he could jump-start the economic reforms, end the war in Chechnya, and become the recognized leader of the democratic camp, greatly enhancing his chances of becoming the next president of Russia. He also could be pushed aside by Yeltsin after the election, meeting the same fate as Gaidar and Chubais. In short, lacking a strong political party machine, financial support, and executive experience, Yavlinsky could join the Yeltsin administration without enough power to accomplish anything, condemning himself to a swift political demise.
<p>

<b>VLADIMIR ZHIRINOVSKY: THE WILD CARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky became an internationally recognized figure when his organization, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), gained almost 25 percent of Russia's electoral vote in the State Duma elections on December 12, 1993. His main slogans in the 1993 campaign were "I will not allow anybody to abuse Russians" and "I will make Russia rise from its knees."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zhirinovsky was a military intelligence officer before becoming a lawyer. He later worked for a KGB-run organization which established and maintained contact with foreign students. Allegations by Mikhail Gorbachev and Alexander Yakovlev, as well as these early intelligence connections and mysterious cash inflows early in his party's activities, indicate that the Russian security services launched his political career. In the December 1995 Duma elections, Zhirinovsky garnered over 10 percent of the vote, well ahead of predictions. He is projected to receive about the same percentage, or somewhat less, in the June presidential elections.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, he is running the most low-profile campaign in his political history, freely proclaiming that Yeltsin is going to be re-elected. This is most uncharacteristic behavior for the ambitious Zhirinovsky, who normally would conduct the most aggressive campaign, heavily emphasizing media coverage and mass rallies. Many observers speculate that his passivity indicates that the Russian security services may still control Zhirinovsky, and that Yeltsin's entourage has been able to neutralize him as a threat. Moscow-based observers believe that Zhirinovsky either was bought off or was blackmailed into silence. Meanwhile, Zhirinovsky states publicly that he is focusing his political effort on the year 2000, building his party and leaving someone else to take responsibility for the disastrous situation of the Russian state.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The name of Zhirinovsky's party is dangerously misleading. Many Westerners probably assume the Liberal Democrats really are liberal and democratic. In fact, however, they are neither; if anything, they are national socialists. Launched in the latter years of the Soviet Union with the encouragement and participation of top Communist Party and KGB officials, the LDPR is an ultra-nationalist party that stands for Russian imperial revival. While declaring limited support for markets and private property, Zhirinovsky favors a large government sector in the economy and a strong military-industrial complex. His statements on the restoration of the Russian Empire, including Alaska, Poland, and Finland, are particularly troublesome. In his book <I>The Last Thrust South</I>, he said that he will not rest until Russian soldiers wash their boots in the Indian Ocean. His foreign political allies include Jean Marie Le Pen's French National Front, the German and Austrian Neo-Nazis, and Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath party.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Publicly audacious, Zhirinovsky has become one of the most successful post-communist politicians. The LDPR today is the second-largest political party in Russia, second only to the communists. With many regional and local organizations and several party newspapers, its organization is larger than anything the reformers, or even President Yeltsin himself, can claim. A gifted speaker with a sense of humor and a penchant for one-liners, Zhirinovsky is probably Russia's best political campaigner. He performs well on television and is entertaining when interviewed. He also has gained popularity with many young voters through his intensive use of pop and rock music and his regular and open discussion of sex. He shamelessly promotes himself through brand names, such as Zhirinovsky vodka and clothing, and owns a Zhirinovsky store in Moscow which sells Zhirinovsky T-shirts, rock and punk music, and even Zhirinovsky matchboxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zhirinovsky's past election successes have sent chills through Russians, Eastern Europeans, and citizens of the former Soviet republics. He stands for the restoration of the Russian Empire as a unitary state, and for an aggressive foreign policy in Central Europe and the Middle East. He would accomplish this through military power, which could lead to a major clash with the West. Any sign of his advance to the pinnacle of power in Russia would be tantamount to a political earthquake.
<p>
<b>GENERAL ALEXANDER LEBED: NO COLIN POWELL</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
General Alexander Ivanovich Lebed emerged at the front of Russia's political stage in 1994-1995, when he served as commander of the 14th Army Russian troops occupying part of Moldova. For a while, he was the most popular politician in Russia. Currently, he is polling at about 5 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed was the classmate of current Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who was also Lebed's commander and mentor in the paratrooper academy in the city of Ryazan. Initially, his career was attached to Grachev's; they both fought, for example, in Afghanistan. As the USSR was collapsing, Lebed was involved in "peacemaking" operations, suppressing popular rebellions in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Lithuania.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed positioned himself as a tough crime fighter, the outsider who feels the pain of ordinary people and of the military rank and file. He fought the appointment of the notoriously corrupt General Matvey Burlakov as first deputy defense minister in the fall of 1994, with the result that Burlakov was fired. To protest corruption in the Trans-Dniester region, he resigned from the parliament of this ethnically Slavic enclave. While the Soviet and Russian military was collapsing, Lebed managed to build and train a surprisingly fit military force.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed retired from command of the 14th Army in June of 1995, losing the aura of the persecuted hero speaking for the disgruntled Russian army. He is seen by some in the career military as having pushed the army toward confrontation with the defense minister and the president, eroding the military's neutrality and its position "outside of politics."  Lebed also is faulted by some for using his command to boost his political image.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed's political career has turned out to be less spectacular than his military adventures. He is not only blunt, but abrasive. He has stated publicly that "to conduct diplomatic negotiations with some parliament to receive power" and "maneuver" is not his style.<sup>14</sup>  "For idiots who did not get it the first time," he once told a press conference, "I repeat, I do not comment on Chechnya."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the December 1995 Duma elections, Lebed was vice chairman of the nationalist Union of Russian Communities, headed by Soviet-era industrial stalwart Yurii Skokov. The general and his party did poorly in these elections, primarily because of Skokov's mismanagement of the campaign. The Union failed to garner enough votes to be represented in the Duma, damaging Lebed's stature as a challenger for the presidency in the upcoming elections of 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If he ever did become president or even defense minister, Lebed might push Russia toward confrontation with her neighbors and the West. He has said repeatedly that enlarging NATO to include Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia would be a <I>casus belli</I> for World War III. "The West is wiping its feet all over Russia," he has said. He is deeply suspicious of the West, and particularly of the U.S., and as the quintessential Soviet military man sees Russia expressing herself as a Great Power only through military strength and territorial aggrandizement. Still, he seems to have mellowed, tends to identify himself as an anti-communist and anti-establishment, and has received a crash course in market economics from the Moscow liberal economists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite his appeal, the majority of the Russian public believes that an active-duty or even a former military man should not be president. Lebed's chances today do not seem particularly high, though he could siphon off some of Zyuganov's and Yeltsin's support.


<P>
<b>"THIRD TIER" CANDIDATES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All of the following candidates are registered to run in the elections, although none appears to have a good chance of achieving a strong showing in the first round.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Aman Geldy Tuleev.</b> This hard-line communist leader was born in Krasnovodsk, Turkmenistan, in 1944. A graduate of the Novosibirsk Railroad Engineering Institute, he served from March 1990 to October 1993 as speaker of the Kemerovo Region Soviet. In 1991, Tuleyev ran for president of Russia, finishing fifth. Since April 1994, he has served as speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the Kemerovo Region. Tuleyev is a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. For reasons probably better known to party insiders, he has promised to withdraw his candidacy and endorse Gennady Zyuganov but has not yet pulled out of the race. Tuleev is close to Zyuganov politically and is seen as a reserve player for the communists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Martin Shakkum.</b> A dark horse candidate with ties to the powerful Russian military industry, Martin Shakkum was born in the Moscow region in 1951. He graduated from a military engineering academy, earned a degree in civil engineering by correspondence, and holds a Ph.D. in political science. He worked for the Institute of Space Research from 1976 to 1978, after which he held a sequence of managerial positions in construction (in the Mosinzhremont and Glavmosoblstroy state-run companies). In 1990, Shakkum became CEO of the RIDA joint enterprise. He currently is first vice president of the International Fund of Economic and Social Reforms (the Reform Fund), which started out as moderately reformist but now takes increasingly hard-line positions. In 1992-1993, Shakkum served as a consultant to former Vice Premier Georgy Khizha, who was in charge of the military-industrial complex in the Yeltsin cabinet and known as a hard-liner. Since April 1996, Shakkum has led the Russian Socialist Popular Party. He is a nationalist and anti-Western politician.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Vladimir Bryntsalov.</b> This colorful candidate represents the nascent Russian business class. Bryntsalov was born in 1946 in the city of Cherkessk in Stavropol province. After graduating from the Novocherkassk Polytechnic Institute in 1969, he taught at the Cherkassk Polytechnic College and then worked in construction. In 1987, he started an agricultural cooperative. Toward the end of the 1980s, Bryntsalov became head of the Moscow Drug Manufacturers' Association, which later became Ferane, a major joint-stock enterprise. A multimillionaire, Bryntsalov is a Duma member (elected in December 1995) and both founder and leader (since April 1996) of the Russian Socialist Party. Bryntsalov espouses a combination of nationalist and socialist views.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Yuri Vlasov.</b> This nationalist candidate was born in 1935. He was the superheavyweight world champion in weight-lifting in 1959, 1961, 1962, and 1963, and Olympic superheavyweight champion in 1960. Vlasov set many weight-lifting records and was nicknamed "the strongest man on Earth."  He also was the young Arnold Schwarzenegger's role model. A 1959 graduate of the Zhukovsky Air-Force Engineering Academy, he later became a writer.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yuri Vlasov presents himself as a "patriot" fighting communism and the Zionist conspiracy against the Russian people. He participated in the December 1995 parliamentary elections on the list of the leftist Power to the People but failed to gain a seat in the Duma, losing to Konstantin N. Borovoi, a prominent businessman and leader of the right-of-center Party of Economic Freedom, in Tushino.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Svyatoslav Fyodorov.</b> Fyodorov is a successful and prosperous eye surgeon who recently has gone into politics, polling at only about 6 percent in the current presidential race. He was something of a national hero even under Brezhnev. In 1995, he formed his centrist Workers' Self-Government Party. He advocates the mass creation of joint stock companies to guarantee workers a share of profits, the removal of most taxes, and a ban on the export of most raw materials. He presents himself as a third force in Russian politics, claiming that he draws his inspiration from former U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot and China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Mikhail Gorbachev.</b> The former Soviet leader is still popular in the West for his role in ending the Cold War and bringing about the end of the Communist Party's monopoly on power. But his popularity at home is close to zero, and no major political force has ventured to back him. Only some aging Moscow intellectuals sing his praises, and even the news-hungry Russian media are ignoring the man who helped bring down the Soviet empire. His chances in the elections are close to zero.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The fact that the presidential elections are taking place at all indicates how far Russia has progressed on the road to freedom. But the fact that there is no viable democratic, pro-free market front-runner demonstrates how long it will be before Russia achieves genuine democracy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Russian democrats, with the exception of the left-of-center Grigory Yavlinsky and his Yabloko, erred in failing to create a viable political party. This failure has contributed significantly to their loss of voter appeal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, the June elections present the Russian voters with a rather unhappy choice. If they vote for Yeltsin, they will be choosing haphazard reforms accompanied by lawlessness and corruption. If the communists win, the majority of Russian voters may be choosing a massive renationalization of property and an attempt to restore the Russian empire.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A communist victory in Russia this summer would be a major setback for democracy, although it would not necessarily be a vote of no confidence against free markets and democracy. The Yeltsin administration's implementation of reform has been extremely inept, mired in a degree of corruption unprecedented even by Russian standards. Instead of attaining a market economy, the Russian voters have been confronted largely by a caricature, in many cases presided over by the same old Soviet <I>nomenklatura</I> clad in new suits and driving new cars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A communist ascendancy most probably would result not in a new totalitarianism, but in severe crisis and the final disillusionment of the Russian people with the communist idea.<sup>15</sup>  Despite difficulties and setbacks, the ideas behind free markets and political democracy are developing roots in Russia, especially among the young generation. Neither the old nor the "new" communist and nationalist ideologies appears to have the power to mobilize the people and resources of today's Russia to create a second version of the Soviet Brave New World.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some Western leaders and policymakers are remarkably unconcerned about the prospects of a victory by Communist Party candidate Gennady Zyuganov in the Russian presidential elections on June 16. Thinking that a communist return to power in Russia will be no different than it was in Poland or Slovakia, these Westerners appear to believe that a communist victory in Russia will not disrupt the burgeoning "partnership" between Russia and the West.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, the report translated here paints a different picture. Written by hard-line members of a nationalist-communist coalition that supports Zyuganov for president but maintains close ties with such nationalists as Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the document contains advice for Russian military planners that is profoundly disturbing for the United States and the West. No amount of "mirror imaging" in the U.S. or Western democracies can obscure the meaning of Russian hardliners as rendered in their own words.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the report's main points:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Russia should be moving aggressively to adopt a nuclear deterrence posture for perceived non-nuclear threats. Strategic nuclear forces should be the highest priority.
<p>
<li>Russia should be able to fight at least one full-scale regional war, one smaller-scale conflict, and at least three "peacemaking" operations outside its borders.
<p>
<li>The U.S. and NATO remain Russia's enemies. Other foes include Turkey and countries of the former Soviet Union such as the Baltic States.
<p>
<li>Russia's armed forces should be drastically reorganized on the basis of smaller, highly mobile units.
<p>
<li>Russia should be prepared to undertake military operations to reconquer the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union. These operations would include seizing command-and-control sites, "eliminating" the political-military leadership, and deporting "some categories" of the hostile population, presumably to the Russian hinterland.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The authors of these positions are analysts who advise the president and the Russian General Staff on military and security matters. One author is Lieutenant General Valeriy Dementyev, who was once Deputy Chief of Armaments in the USSR Ministry of defense, and today is an analyst with the Institute for Defense Research (known by its Russian acronym INOBIS, <I>Institut oboronnykh issledovanii</I>) in the town of Kaliningrad near Moscow. The other author is Anton Surikov, a defense analyst formerly associated with the USA-Canada Institute and also an analyst at the Institute for Defense Research. The secretive INOBIS is financed by the Russian General Staff, military-industrial enterprises, and the Atomic Energy Ministry, and conducts classified research. It was founded by senior figures from the KGB and the Russian military-industrial complex. Also instrumental in its founding was Yuri Maslyukov, Zyuganov's chief economic policy maker and the former head of the USSR's Central Planning Authority (the all-powerful GosPlan). INOBIS reportedly enjoys an attentive audience at the Ministry of Defense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
People like Surikov and Dementyev advise Communist Party leader Zyuganov, radical nationalist Zhirinovsky, and President Boris Yeltsin's Atomic Energy Minister, Viktor Mikhailov. Even if Zyuganov loses the presidential elections, the views expressed in this report will influence Russian military and security policy. Many in the Russian armed forces and security services support a more aggressive stance for Russia -- a viewpoint clearly expressed in this document.

Conceptual Theses of the Strategy of Reforming The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation</h3>

<b>Deterrence and Defense</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The defensive character of the policy of the Russian Federation (RF) in the military area and the absence in Russia of aggressive intentions was proclaimed in the <I>Basic Provisions of the Military Doctrine of the RF</I>, unveiled in 1993.<sup>1</sup>  This thesis, however, is in need of clarification in terms of the precise tasks that the Armed Forces face. Among them, first of all, three basic tasks should be singled out:
<P><ul>
<li>The Armed Forces must have the capability to deter effectively the threat of nuclear attack on Russia and on the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which have signed the agreement on collective security. In this, the talk is exclusively about deterrence, because national military thought acknowledges the impossibility of victory in a global nuclear conflict on the strategic level.
<p>
<li>The Armed Forces should be aimed both at deterring a large-scale military attack on Russia and the CIS by foreign governments or a coalition thereof using conventional armaments, and deterring and repelling military aggression from the outside that has more limited goals. Deterrence of such threats can be nuclear.
<p>
<li>The Armed Forces must have the capability to conduct local wars and carry out peacemaking operations, primarily within the bounds of the former USSR, taking into account that the former Soviet Union is a zone of Russian vital interests and home to 25 million ethnic Russians. Currently, the Russian Federation is conducting two local wars on the territory of the former USSR -- in Chechnya and Tajikistan. Besides that, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are fulfilling peacemaking functions that are in fact deterring Georgia and Moldova from commencing aggression towards Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Trans-Dniester.<sup>2</sup>  Taking into account the practices of 1990-1996, the demand must be put forward, in part, for the capability to wage local wars within the bounds of the former USSR. The Armed Forces should be able to take part simultaneously in at least one local war of high intensity, at least one "slow" local war, and at least three "frozen" local conflicts and peacemaking operations.
</ul><P>
<b>Russia's Enemies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The thesis of the <I>Basic Provisions</I> is that Russia has no outside enemies. Experience has demonstrated the falseness of this thesis. Because of Russia's weak government and the progressive degradation of its military and economic potential, outside enemies are making themselves known in a bolder and more open fashion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Currently, Russia's basic probable enemies remain the United States and the NATO countries. The United States has a vast nuclear missile potential which, if used, can destroy Russia as a state. It was created with the goal of nuclear blackmail of the USSR and was oriented mainly at carrying out a first nuclear strike. At present, in spite of ongoing reductions within the framework of START 1, orientation toward a first strike not only has not disappeared, but actually has been increased. This is due primarily to the policy of the [American] authorities, particularly the U.S. Congress, toward revision of the ABM Treaty of 1972 and creates the prerequisites for development and subsequent deployment of a strategic ABM system by the year 2003.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In contrast to the Warsaw Pact Treaty Organization, not only has NATO, led by the USA, not been dissolved, but the decision already has been made to enlarge it. NATO's infrastructure, despite the reduction of personnel and armaments taking place under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, is still oriented toward actions in an eastern direction. The preservation of its basic military infrastructure gives it an opportunity to build up its troops quickly should such a decision be made. Although, as of today, the potential of NATO conventional forces is not sufficient to conduct a large-scale offensive operation against the Russian Federation similar to Hitler's invasion of 1941, over time these forces can be augmented and advanced to the borders of the Russian Federation. In this light, the plans for NATO eastern expansion look clearly aggressive. Moreover, in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary measures are now being taken to adapt the infrastructure, airport network, communications, etc., for NATO use. One Hungarian airport, without prior permission, has been turned into an American military base.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It should be noted that the experience of the U.S. and NATO in the Persian Gulf in 1991, and in the former Yugoslavia in 1995-1996, demonstrates that the [Western] bloc today has sufficient potential to carry out military operations with limited goals on the periphery of post-Soviet territory. In this scenario, the greatest danger is presented by aggression from three possible directions: first, because of Norway's recent decision to expand NATO military activity in the north of the country, from the north against the Russian Federation's Northern Fleet on the Kola peninsula; second, in connection with the discussion about creating a 60,000-strong Baltic Corps from German, Danish, and Polish detachments, from the northwest in the form of military intervention by NATO in case of a conflict between Russia and the Baltic countries; and third, in light of the calls being heard to grant the countries of the Caspian basin NATO security guarantees similar to those given to the countries of the Persian Gulf, from the south, where the key role is assigned to a member of NATO -- Turkey.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Turkey possesses an army of 600,000. Its navy is already bigger than the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Turkey has unilaterally altered the status of the Black Sea straits, threatening Russia's interests. It has voiced numerous military threats toward Russia's ally Armenia with regard to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey is attempting to attract into its sphere of influence the Turkish-speaking and Muslim regions of the former USSR. It has been proven that Turkish officials supported [President] Dudaev's illegal military detachments in Chechnya. They also assisted the "Gray Wolves" organization in Azerbaijan and a number of other nationalistic military detachments throughout the CIS.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Japan, which is an ally of the United States and has territorial claims against the Russian Federation, might also be considered a potential enemy of Russia. Today, Japan does not have sufficient military power to start an aggressive military operation against Russia in order to take the islands of the Southern Kurils by force, but it does have the necessary potential to expand its Armed Forces quickly.
<p>
<b>China and Iran Are Not Enemies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Obviously, the fact that Russia and China are neighbors must not be ignored when planning the development of the Armed Forces. At the same time, the military policy of the Russian Federation should be formed with extreme caution with respect to China. The U.S., seeing China as a potential enemy, is interested in creating a military confrontation between Russia and China.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similarly, the U.S. has a clear interest in the confrontation between the Russian Federation and Iran, another American enemy. The "Islamic threat" to the CIS is used as an argument to promote a similar confrontation. After a close examination of this problem, however, it becomes clear that the extremist movements in the CIS that operate under pseudo-Islamic slogans are relying as a rule not on Iran, but on pro-Western regimes in the Muslim world: Turkey, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In light of the above, it is not practical to view Iran and China as probable enemies of Russia, at least in the near future, because there are no objective causes for confrontation between the Russian Federation and those countries.
<p>
<b>Recreating the Empire</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Within the territory of post-Soviet Russia, the main enemies are the forces of aggressive nationalism that operate with support from outside and have armed forces of their own: armies, police, and other militarized detachments of the Baltic states; Dudayev's illegal armed forces; Tajik opposition illegal armed forces; and others. The main causes of conflict involving the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation within the territory of the former USSR are the following:
<ul><p>
<li>Ethnic discord and genocide of national minorities. Examples of such conflicts where Russian Federation (USSR) Armed Forces were used, directly or indirectly, would be Trans-Dniester in 1992, the Prigorodniy region in Northern Ossetia at the end of 1992, Southern Ossetia in 1991-1992, and Abkhazia in 1992-1993.
<p>
In the near future, ethnic conflicts probably will have two major causes. First, as a result of the events of 1991, Russians are a divided people. Therefore, their objective tendency to reunite will become stronger as time goes on. Second, in all former USSR countries, except for Belorussia and perhaps Ukraine, ethnic minorities are subjected to discrimination.<sup>3</sup>  This is most clearly evident in the Baltic countries where, with the encouragement of Western institutions, human rights violations based on ethnic origin are part of official policy. The Baltic countries seem to be the most potentially explosive in terms of the possibility of new areas of conflict that could involve the Russian Federation's Armed Forces.
<p>
<li>Attempts by nationalist forces to seize power by armed force or to hold power in some republic of the former USSR. Examples include Tajikistan in 1992-1996, Lithuania in January 1991, Georgia during the winter of 1991-1992 and at the end of 1993, and Azerbaijan in January 1990 and the summer of 1993.
<p>
<li>Territorial claims against the Russian Federation and illegal attempts to seize sea and inland water resources that belong to Russia. Up to now, direct Russian participation in such armed conflicts has been avoided. But it is not out of the question, particularly because of the Baku government's policy of annexing part of the Caspian Sea, an inland body of water the rights to which should be shared equally by all countries bordering the region. Another potential source of conflict is the part of the Baltic Sea area that belongs to Russia but is claimed by Lithuania. It also is known that the ethnocratic regimes of Tallin and Riga are claiming a part of the Russian Federation's Northwestern territory.
<p>
<li>The desire of certain forces in the former USSR, primarily in the Baltic countries, to become a part of the NATO alliance. In such cases, one cannot exclude preemptive use of force by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation to stop decisively any practical steps that might be taken by armed nationalist detachments to implement their provocative plans.
</ul><p>
<b>Budget Priorities</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Obviously, in the near term, reform of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces will be conducted under conditions of deep economic crisis. Thus, the decisive factor in choosing among possible reforms will be that the budget for the Armed Forces and military-industrial complex is limited. One of the main requirements will be to minimize the country's budget for defense. This, in turn, means that the established practice of allocating funds equally among the existing branches of the Armed Forces will have to be abandoned.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is necessary to determine which programs are crucial to sustaining the Armed Forces' ability to accomplish their main objectives and guarantee their financing. At the same time, it is unavoidable that programs which do not have a high priority will have to be financed from the "leftovers" of the military budget. Despite the importance of the transition to a professional army in the near future, it will be impossible to avoid using the draft to raise manpower. The Armed Forces will have to be reduced to 1.2 million servicemen.
<p>
<b>The Main Deterrent: Strategic Nuclear Forces</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In resolving the task of nuclear deterrence on the strategic level, the basic role should be played by strategic nuclear forces and systems supporting their combat functioning. Without strategic nuclear forces, Russia cannot exist as an independent, unified state. The task of sustaining them should be given the highest priority and should be fully financed. As of today, [Russia's] strategic nuclear forces face three major problems:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Degradation of strategic nuclear forces.</b> This concerns primarily the naval component of the strategic nuclear forces, in which the scheduled maintenance of weapon systems is constantly being violated and the operational strength of strategic nuclear submarines has gone down drastically. Since 1990, not a single new strategic nuclear submarine has been launched; considering the life cycle of submarines in the naval strategic nuclear forces, this means they could disappear within 15 years. It is most important to finish the scientific research and test construction work needed to create strategic nuclear submarines of a new generation which will carry new ballistic missiles by the years 2000-2003, as well as to ensure that these strategic nuclear submarines are brought into service at the rate of 2-3 submarines every two years.
<p>
<li><b>Absence of clarity regarding the quantitative framework within which it is planned to develop strategic nuclear forces.</b> In 1994, START I was implemented. START II was signed but is not yet ratified. With regard to the naval and aviation components of the strategic nuclear forces, the existence of uncertainty concerning the fate of the treaty does not affect seriously their future development. According to START II, the naval strategic nuclear forces can be armed with 1,750 warheads after 2003. Roughly the same quantity was to be allowed under START I. Aviation strategic nuclear forces, which historically have played a very insignificant role in the national nuclear triad, will have 93 heavy bombers with approximately 500 cruise missiles, including 19 Tu-95 heavy bombers and several dozen heavy bombers acquired in Ukraine by agreement. The production of additional heavy bombers is very costly and thus is hardly advisable.
<p>
A more complex situation exists in units of the Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF). According to START II, which requires the liquidation of ICBMs with MIRV warheads, the SRF by the year 2003 can rely on approximately 1,000 single-warhead ICBMs. At present, there are 350 mobile SS-25s with single warheads, which are to be replaced in the next few years, as their useful life expires, by "Topol-M" ICBMs. According to the agreement, Russia will have 105 MIRVed ICBMs, which are to be "unloaded" until only one warhead each remains, and 90 single SS-18 ICBMs placed into refitted silos. To support the START II quota for the number of warheads, Russia will have to form more than 10 additional divisions of mobile ICBMs with approximately 500 "Topol-M" ICBMs by the year 2003 -- in other words, practically double the number of mobile, single-warhead ICBMs. Another possible option is to build new silos for new ICBMs. Even with priority financing, it is very difficult for the SRF to do this within such a limited time frame.
<p>
In general, the START II treaty is rather paradoxical. It calls for quick liquidation of more than 200 MIRVed Russian ICBMs, part of which could still be used for another 4-5 years. At the same time, in order to maintain quantitative parity with the U.S., several hundred single-warhead ICBMs should be deployed, and possibly placed into newly built silos, even as some of the old silos are to be destroyed under START II. Note that the United States plans to go from START I to START II in a different fashion. It will eliminate only 50 "MX" missiles, 4 "Ohio" strategic nuclear submarines, and 28 heavy bombers with cruise missiles. The main cuts are to be accomplished by "unloading" the missiles and storing the warheads in special storage facilities. At any moment, this stockpile, which the United States emphatically refuses to destroy, might be put back into operation on U.S. missiles. As a result, taking into account the potential for "quick loading" of these missiles, the U.S. will surpass Russia by 1,000-1,500 warheads.
<P>
Russia's refusal to follow START II will bring onto the agenda the issue of supporting MIRVed ICBMs. Analysis proves that this problem can be solved in principle. Different options are available. For instance, additional SS-18s can be purchased from Ukraine. Also, purely Russian MIRVed ICBMs can be designed; a 120-ton liquid fueled missile with 10 warheads could be created in 3-5 years after the appropriate decision. In the next 5-7 years, 300 such missiles can be placed into existing silos. Given these facts, in spite of widespread misconceptions, spending for this project could be quite moderate. At the stage of scientific research and test construction work, the amount would be several percent less per year than the amount allocated to "rebuild" Chechnya in 1996. At the development stage, given that the warheads would be available, production and installation of 300 of such missiles would be three times cheaper than the cost of constructing in the same period 500 "Topol-M" ICBMs in their mobile version or in new silos, as discussed above in relation to START II.
<p>
<li><b>Flaws in the command and control structure of the strategic nuclear forces.</b> It is proposed, within the framework of measures for development of the strategic nuclear forces, to design in an organized manner a single, self-contained operational command and control system for all groupings of strategic nuclear forces, including support systems, based on the administrative structure developed in the Strategic Rocket Forces. Practical implementation of this proposal could be achieved within a year after the appropriate decision is made. The main reasons such a step is necessary are the increased demands for combat readiness in the strategic nuclear forces, economy of means, and elimination of parallel structures. It would be advisable to transfer the Military Space Forces to the Strategic Rocket Forces to bring under their functional control the Missile Attack Warning System, the Space Control System, the Moscow ABM System, and corresponding testing sites. The naval and aviation strategic nuclear forces (functionally left in the Navy and Air Forces, respectively) also should be transferred to the single operational command and control of the strategic nuclear forces.
<p>
At the present time, several hundred thousand servicemen, a third of them officers, are performing their military service in groupings of the strategic nuclear forces. In the Strategic Rocket Forces, for all practical purposes, combat crews of officers carry out in practice 100 percent of the direct functional duties connected with exploitation of the weapons. As for the draftees, they primarily carry out functions as guards and perform auxiliary tasks in supporting combat readiness, technical support, etc. A similar situation, as a whole, characterizes the other components of the strategic nuclear forces and their support systems. It is proposed that the ratio between professionals and conscripts be maintained in the future as well.
<p>
Since the U.S. and NATO possess conventional forces and armaments potentially sufficient to conduct military operations with limited goals on the periphery of post-Soviet territory, it is necessary to provide for deterrence of such actions by the probable enemy. Currently, functions for deterring aggression from the most probable directions are given:
<ul><p>
<li>In the north (the naval bases on the Kola peninsula), to forces of the Leningrad Military District (MD) and Northern Fleet (NF).
<p>
<li>In the northwest, (the Baltic region), to forces of the Leningrad MD, Kaliningrad special region, and forces of the Baltic Fleet.
<p>
<li>In the south (the Caucasus-Caspian region), to forces of the North Caucasus Military district; subunits of the Russian Armed Forces on bases in Gyumri and Yerevan (Armenia), Tbilisi and Ahalkalaki (Georgia), Batumi (Adjaria), and Gudauta (Abkhazia); forces of the Caspian Flotilla; and the Black Sea fleet.
</ul><p>
Analysis shows that the existing deterrence potential of the Russian Federation Armed Forces in these directions might be insufficient to deter aggressive action by the probable enemy. Strengthening these forces by carrying out a long-term buildup in the number of troops and armaments in regions of probable conflict could be hard to achieve economically. In light of this, as a priority task facing the Armed Forces, it is proposed to create, within a year after a decision is made, Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces numbering about 10,000 servicemen. Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces could operate as a reserve of the Supreme High Command and, on a long-term basis, could assume the function of deterring the probable enemy from conducting military operations with local goals.
<p>
For this proposal to be implemented at the initial stage, it is suggested to supply the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces with 10-12 missile and aviation complexes equipped with conventional precision weapons from the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and Air Forces. These missile and aviation complexes, while remaining functionally a part of the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and Air Forces, and based deep within Russian territory during peacetime, would be subordinated operationally, through a Main Directorate of the General Staff specially created for these purposes, to the Supreme High Command of the Russian Armed Forces. During a threatening period, Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces, by decision of the Supreme High Command, could be redeployed to the region of possible conflict and aimed on especially important targets deep in the probable enemy's territory.
<p>
In the event plans for the eastern expansion of NATO are realized or new directions of possible aggression appear (for instance, the Southern Kuril Island), it would be expedient to increase the number of the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces' missile and aviation complexes to 30-50 units. At the same time, units of missile artillery and aviation complexes could be armed with nuclear weapons. To demonstrate persuasively to a probable enemy the RF's determination to impede any NATO advancement into the territory of the former USSR, some Operational-Tactical Deterrent Force units also could be moved up to the borders, particularly the Russian-Norwegian border; to Russian military bases in Armenia, Georgia, Adzharia, and Abkhazia; to the Kaliningrad special region; and into Belorussia, to which President A. G. Lukashenko has agreed in principle.
</ul><P>
<b>The Mobile Forces: Mainstay of the Russian Army</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is advisable when waging local wars within the former USSR to give the main functions to special elite units: Mobile Forces of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, which also must have priority designation. Not intended for participation in extended military conflicts, these units could be used on a short-term basis in holding actions and to repel aggression from abroad against Russia and the CIS using conventional weapons. They also could be designated for peacekeeping operations under the aegis of CIS, as well as the UN and other international organizations. It is advisable to form Mobile Forces, up to 90,000 strong, based on Airborne troops and using some units of naval infantry, over a year after a corresponding decision is made. Functionally, naval infantry would stay under Navy command and would be transferred to operational Mobile Forces command only for the conduct of special operations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For five years after forming these Mobile Forces, it is suggested that recruitment be exclusively on a contract basis. After the process of turning them into a professional force is complete, Mobile Forces should be fully staffed and given all kinds of heavy armaments and equipment. Moreover, the number of naval infantry should be increased with the assistance of the Baltic Fleet, Black Sea Fleet, and Caspian Flotilla, which are located in potential conflict areas of the Caucasus and Baltic countries. Special attention should be paid to the creation of naval infantry in the Caspian region because of the extremely high probability of conflict arising from the unresolved problem of the status of the Caspian shelf.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is important to equip Mobile Forces with military transport aviation (MTA), which will belong functionally to the Air Forces and be operationally subordinate to the Commander in Chief of the Air Forces but required to carry out orders of the Mobile Forces. The need for MTA aircraft designated to move personnel and military equipment, including heavy military equipment, is estimated at 100 aircraft. Most of the aircraft in MTA available today are not functioning. Therefore, about 30-40 additional aircraft should be brought into service because of the extreme importance of the tasks performed by the Mobile Forces.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A typical special operation involving Mobile Forces and aimed at liberating a large area of the former USSR from nationalists should be based on the following principles. The commander of the operation is appointed and should receive a legally valid order. The date and time of the operation then are set. A rigid system of unified command is established so that operational command over all utilized forces, regardless of departmental subordination and affiliation, is concentrated in the hands of a single person.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the first stage, aviation, special military intelligence (GRU) forces, and special Federal Security Services (FSB) and Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) groups carry out strikes for the purpose of destroying or seizing the most important enemy targets and eliminating the enemy's military and political leadership. Then Mobile Forces, with the support of army and frontline aviation and naval forces, crush and eliminate enemy forces and take over their territory. After that, subunits of Ground Forces and Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, RF, preferably with some combat experience, move in. They establish control of the most crucial locations and carry out "cleansing" of the territory. Then, with the help of militia formed out of the pro-Russian part of the local population, they establish control over the territory and ensure the elimination of nationalists and deportation of some categories of citizens from certain locations. It should be emphasized that until the end of the special operation, local authorities are needed only insofar as they are useful in supporting military control over the territory.
<P>
<b>Winners and Losers</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Military intelligence plays a most important role in achieving the main goals of the Armed Forces. Making the GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate) and its subunits and structures more effective should be given the highest priority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To implement these proposals, half the personnel of the Armed Forces would have to go to the four most important components of the Armed Forces named above, which also should be given priority in financing. Because the economic situation in the country is difficult, the other half of the Armed Forces would have to exist under tight financial limitations.
<ul><p>
<li><b>The Navy is the most expensive of the Armed Forces.</b> A differentiated approach is needed here. Naval strategic nuclear forces cannot be underfinanced. The situation is more complex with respect to providing for the combat stability of naval strategic nuclear forces. The system exists and should be preserved, but this does not require building large ships. Aircraft carriers are an exception, since two carriers each are needed in the Pacific Fleet and Northern Fleet to meet military goals. There are only two at present, and the country's economic situation does not allow for two more.
<p>
To provide for anti-submarine warfare in oceanic theaters of military operations (TVD), there are in service submarines and ships equipped with special arms. This equipment should be maintained and ships and submarines currently under construction should be finished, but no new ones should be built for the time being.
<p>

With respect to combating enemy aircraft carriers, there are no battle groups now in place. Our recommendation is to maintain the status quo and concentrate on retaining existing levels.
<p>
With reference to landing support for naval infantry, the appropriate infrastructure was built by the USSR. It is important not only to stop its destruction, but also to continue its development, since costs will not be high but will allow it to perform tasks of the Mobile Forces with great effectiveness.
<p>
In protecting sea communications, special attention should be paid to protecting lines of communication with the Kaliningrad Special Region. At the same time, activities in the remote oceanic regions should be limited.
<p>
The existing system for the coastal defense of the Russian Federation should be supported and developed, since no big investments are needed here. Finally, it is necessary to abandon the tasks of combating transatlantic shipments of U.S. forces and combating the enemy's surface ships and submarines armed with cruise missiles.
<p>
<li><b>There are two large groups in the Ground Forces today. </b>One was deployed in the Far East Military District and Trans-Baikal Military District during the time of tense relations with China. In subsequent years, it was degraded less than other groups. Another large group was developed for obvious reasons in the North Caucasus Military District. It is reasonable to continue to support these groups. For the North Caucasus Military District, this means confirming the exception of District units from the treaty on Conventional Forces Reductions in Europe at the May conference of participants. It is unacceptable that the issue of the North Caucasus Military District be linked with the proposal made by a number of countries that the numbers of Russian forces in the Kaliningrad Special Region be cut; in light of Poland's and the Baltic countries' plans to join NATO, the very fact that the issue of the Kaliningrad Special Region has come up seems both ambiguous and a provocation. A limited number of Ground Forces are located in the strategically important Leningrad and Moscow Military Districts. From the west, Moscow is covered by only two army divisions. As there is no danger of a large-scale invasion of Russia similar to the invasion of 1941, the development of forces to the west of Moscow should not be hurried. But in the event the Eastern European countries join NATO and the infrastructure for an invasion force appears, Russia will be forced to respond accordingly. One possible response might be to recreate the Belorussian Military District and deploy Ground Forces and frontal aviation of the Air Forces there.
<p>
Also, since it currently is difficult for Russia to maintain parity with NATO in conventional weapons, the primary emphasis should be assigned to tactical nuclear deterrence of the threat of non-nuclear attack by NATO forces. This approach will require arming the Rocket Forces, Ground Forces, and frontal aviation of the Air Forces with nuclear weapons and will be much less expensive than providing a non-nuclear deterrent force for a non-nuclear invasion. In general, the present weakness of Russia dictates reliance on nuclear weapons, including tactical weapons. Today, the only possible way to deter NATO is through nuclear deterrence. At the same time, should the relationship between Russia and China change, the same approach can be used in Central Asia and the Far East.
<p>
An important problem in the Ground Forces is revision of the list of units in military districts and the discovery of units which can be cut. It is advisable to limit the number of divisions to 30-35, of which 15-20 could be manned with conscripts and work on combat readiness while the other 15, evenly spread around the country, would be cadre and would serve as a base in preparing the mobilization reserve. At the same time, preparation of the mobilization reserve should be conducted within the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Border Guards.
<p>
<li><b>In units of the Air Forces, special attention should be concentrated on maintaining military transport, frontal aviation, and aviation of the strategic nuclear forces, which could be used by the Operational-Tactical Deterrent Forces and Mobile Forces, at the required level.</b> A major task is preserving qualifications of flying personnel. The Air Defense of military districts should be given to the Air Forces from the Troops of Air Defense, disbanding the latter units but retaining their combat readiness requirements. The missile attack warning system, space control system, and Moscow ABM System, as well as their corresponding testing grounds, would be transferred to the Strategic Rocket Forces. The Air Defense system that is maintaining CIS perimeter defense also would be transferred to the Air Force. Another possible solution is to give it to the Federal Border Guard Service. This would be logical, because they are not now able to defend against a massive air attack from the probable enemy. The circle of tasks resolved by them, in fact, is limited to early warning of an unsanctioned intrusion of CIS airspace and interception of individual targets. This is more a function of the Border Guard, not the Armed Forces. Moreover, the Federal Border Guard Service looks after the ground and marine border. It would be logical to close the loop by giving them the air component as well.
<p></ul>
<b>Legislative Priorities</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is proposed that in the immediate future, it is necessary to prepare and confirm in the Federal Assembly (parliament) a national security doctrine and a military doctrine for the Russian Federation. Based on these doctrines, a five-year plan of reform for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation should be developed and adopted.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This current document can be used both to prepare the national security and military doctrines and to prepare the plan of reform for the Armed Forces.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Bill Clinton will meet President Boris Yeltsin of Russia for the sixth time at the Moscow nuclear safety and security summit on April 19-20. In addition to the United States and Russia, the G-7 states and Ukraine will participate in the summit. The heads of state will discuss nuclear reactor safety, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and nuclear terrorism. Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin also will meet separately to discuss a broad range of bilateral issues. This will be their last official meeting before Russian voters cast their ballots in the June 16 presidential elections. Clinton's counterpart faces an uncertain political future, and so do U.S.-Russian relations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 The United States has a stake in the outcome of the Russian presidential elections. The most desirable result -- a pro-Western democratic reformer in the Kremlin -- is very unlikely. The worst-case scenario will be the victory of hard-line communists led by Gennady Zyuganov. In the December 1995 elections, communists, nationalists, and their allies captured over 46 percent of the popular vote for the Duma (the lower house of the Russian parliament).<sup>1</sup>  A communist takeover will turn Russia back in time, to central planning, human rights violation, re-militarization, and aggressive foreign policy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Boris Yeltsin today draws criticism from many Russian democrats. He backtracked on the program of radical reforms he spearheaded in 1991-1993. He looks and acts increasingly authoritarian and at times, erratic. Free market and democratic reforms in Russia have stalled. Until recently, Yeltsin was trailing the most popular candidate, Communist Party leader Zyuganov, by at least 5 percentage points. According to the latest polls, Yeltsin is closing the gap, running almost neck-and-neck. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another dangerous contender for the presidency is Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an anti-American ultra-nationalist with a penchant for political surprises and a strong track record in the elections. Victory for Zyuganov or an increase in Zhirinovsky's influence would gravely endanger any hope for democracy and market reforms surviving in Russia. A communist or a nationalist at Russia's helm could place that country, with its considerable military power, on a collision course with the United States in Central Europe or the Middle East. Thus Yeltsin increasingly looks to be the lesser of two evils, and on that basis merits qualified U.S. support.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Russian-American relations have been deteriorating for some time. Russia has been drifting away from the West, as demonstrated by disagreements over the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the START II nuclear arms treaty, and the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty. There also have been differences over the sale of Russian nuclear reactors to Iran, the sale of weapons to rogue Third World regimes, and the continuing brutal war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton should not sweep these disagreements under the rug at the Moscow Summit. Nor should he cave into Russian demands in the hopes of boosting Yeltsin's chances in the June elections. This would be seen by many Russian voters as unacceptable meddling in Russian internal affairs and a sign of American weakness or naivete. Moreover, even a modest endorsement of Yeltsin's bid for the presidency would further alienate the many Russians who dislike Yeltsin. An endorsement could backfire, providing Yeltsin's opposition with political ammunition to attack him as an "American puppet." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Therefore, at the Moscow summit, President Clinton should:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Be firm</b> in expressing American support for democracy, elections, free markets, and individual rights in Russia, discouraging both Yeltsin and the hard-liners from seeking anti-democratic solutions.
<p>
<li><b>Voice strong support</b> and American commitment for independence, sovereignty, and the territorial integrity of the New Independent States (NIS).
<p>
<li><b>Denounce</b> the atrocities in Chechnya which have led to heavy loss of civilian life. 
<p>
<li><b>Oppose</b> the sale by Russia of nuclear reactors to Iran.
<p>
<li><b>Support</b> NATO expansion, making clear that it does not threaten Russia.
<p>
<li><b>Avoid</b> negotiating on arms control issues.
</ul><p>
<b>THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF YELTSIN AND U.S.-RUSSIAN RELATIONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A dark cloud hovers over President Yeltsin's election prospects. His political platform is murky. Critics say that he has abandoned democratic principles and policies in favor of populism and political survival. The war in Chechnya, severe economic difficulties, and rampant crime and corruption have drastically eroded the popularity of his administration. Polls show Yeltsin's approval ratings are barely in the 15-20 percent range. While his entourage insists that the elections will take place as scheduled, many in Russia question whether they will, or whether the vote count will be fair.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yeltsin today is not the popular democrat the world watched in admiration as he overturned the Soviet Union in 1991. He is presiding over the return of hard-line Soviet nomenklatura to top positions of power. He has lost the support of many Russian reformers, and is pursuing a foreign policy that is increasingly confrontational with the U.S. and the West. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton has placed personal relations with Boris Yeltsin above U.S. policy objectives. As Yeltsin's popularity plummeted, Clinton fed the flames of Russian resentment toward the U.S. by giving the Russian president unequivocal support, especially after the canonnade of the Russian Supreme Soviet in 1993 and the beginning of the Chechen war in 1994. As a result, the U.S. is now perceived by many in the Russian political elite as partisan and uncritically supportive of Yeltsin's faltering policies. The Clinton policy has endangered the ability of the U.S. to maintain a relationship with democrats in Russia who oppose President Yeltsin.
<p>
<b>ARMS CONTROL: NO COMPROMISES ON AMERICAN SECURITY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the announced agenda of the multilateral summit on civilian nuclear safety was not to cover arms control, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin decided in the fall of 1995 to add a bilateral Russian-American summit during President Clinton's Moscow visit. The addition of the bilateral summit could tempt the Russians to raise issues related to arms control that were not on the agenda for the multilateral summit and which the U.S. side will be unprepared to address. These may include:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Amendments to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.</b> The Russians may press their demands to amend the ABM Treaty so that the treaty's restrictions extend to the now-unrestricted development and deployment of defenses against short-range missiles. The Russians also may demand that Russia and other former Soviet republics be established as treaty successors to the Soviet Union. Congress has expressed its interest in amending the treaty to ease restrictions on developing and deploying defenses against long-range missiles, and Russia may inquire about these congressional plans. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Negotiations on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).</b> Russia may inquire about the Clinton Administration's plans to conclude a CTBT this year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Ratification of the 1993 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II).</b> The Russian Duma has yet to consent to the ratification of START II, which cuts U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals to 3,500 deliverable warheads each. Russian representatives may press the U.S. to accept either changes in START II itself or limitations on U.S. arms not covered by START II in order to gain acquiescence of the Duma.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Ratification of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).</b> The U.S. Senate has not yet ratified the CWC. The Russians may inquire if the U.S. will ratify this treaty, which bars the development, stockpiling, and deployment, as well as the use, of chemical weapons by participating states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration should make it very clear to the Russians that it will not negotiate on arms control issues at either the multilateral or bilateral summit in Moscow. Arms control negotiations should take place only at forums established specifically for addressing these issues. Mistakes of historic proportions can be made at <i>ad hoc</i> arms control negotiations. Therefore, arms control issues should not be raised by the U.S. delegations during the Moscow visit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

If representatives from Russia or other states raise these arms control issues during the Moscow visit, U.S. representatives, including the President himself, should have prepared responses in the form of unilateral statements to foreclose any negotiations on the relevant subjects. U.S. representatives should state explicitly to their counterparts that the unilateral statements are not subject to further discussion in the Moscow talks.
<p>
<b>THE MOSCOW SUMMIT AGENDA: SUPPORTING U.S. INTERESTS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To support U.S. interests at the Moscow summit, President Clinton should:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Be firm in expressing American support for democracy, elections, free markets, and individual rights in Russia</b>, discouraging both Yeltsin and the hard-liners from seeking anti-democratic solutions to Russia's problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should develop a Russian policy based on the support of ideas and interests, not on the fate of individual politicians. The U.S. should support democracy and free markets, as well as political forces advocating these ideas. Yeltsin is the elected president of Russia and was a key figure in bringing about the collapse of the Soviet communism. Today, however, some of his policies and his personal style are controversial, and his popularity is low. There are many other democratic reformers, including former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, presidential candidate Grigory Yavlinsky, and human rights activists Sergei Kovalev and Yelena Bonner, who disagree fundamentally with Yeltsin's policies on economic reform and Chechnya. Clinton would be well-advised to meet with these pro-Western reformers to demonstrate his support for the democratic and free-market path for Russia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Voice strong support and American commitment for independence, sovereignty, and the territorial integrity of the New Independent States (NIS).</b> The President should make clear that furtive or bullish attempts to extend Russian domination in the "near abroad," especially in the Ukraine and the Baltic states, would result in American countermeasures across the spectrum of the Russian-American relationship.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should oppose Russian attempts to impose a sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union. Moscow is attempting to re-establish its "sphere of influence" in neighboring regions that were once a part of the Soviet Union. Recent evidence of this is the customs union created with Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan on March 29, 1996, and the Commonwealth of Sovereign Republics, known by its Russian acronym SSR, signed with Belarus on April 2, 1996, in Moscow. While these agreements were largely voluntary, the Kremlin may employ a combination of economic, diplomatic, and even military means in the future to achieve integration of what Moscow calls its "near abroad" -- the Baltic States, Ukraine, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The U.S. should not endorse the creation of a Russian sphere of influence in the CIS, as President Clinton reportedly did in a recent conversation with Boris Yeltsin.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Preventing the emergence of a Russian empire in the lands of the former Soviet Union should be a top Western priority. Yet the Clinton Administration until recently was very tolerant towards Russian assertiveness in the "near abroad."<sup>3</sup>  The Clinton Administration also has been too slow to recognize the importance of countries in the region other than Russia. For example, without Ukraine, the Russian empire cannot be recreated and will have only limited access to the heart of Europe. Ukraine's independence is an important Western interest. Azerbaijan controls vital oil and gas reserves, while Georgia is situated in a strategically crucial location in the Caucasus. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Denounce the atrocities in Chechnya which have led to heavy loss of civilian life.</b> The President should call for a cessation of hostilities in Chechnya and an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mediation effort in the conflict.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should support a negotiated solution to the Chechen war that would keep Russian territorial integrity intact, but also recognize the aspirations of the Chechen people for autonomy. Overt Russian military action in Chechnya began on December 12, 1994, when the army marched on the capital city of Grozny. The city was destroyed by a brutal aerial, tank, and artillery assault. Since the start of the campaign, over 30,000 people have been killed, scores have been wounded, and more than 400,000 became refugees. Until now, the Russian army has failed to find a military solution to the Chechen problem, which resulted in a political disaster for Yeltsin. Yeltsin's critics in Moscow have said that a secret order was given to the Russian troops in Chechnya to destroy the civilian population of villages that support the rebels. The cease-fire declared in summer 1995 collapsed. On March 31, 1996, Yeltsin called for yet another new peace plan and a negotiated solution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Oppose the sale by Russia of nuclear reactors to Iran.</b> The U.S. should offer the Russians an alternative deal that would sidetrack the reactor sale to Iran. One possibility is a modernization program to upgrade the safety of the dangerous and obsolete Russian nuclear reactors. If Yeltsin refuses, the U.S. should retaliate by cancelling the $1 billion in Export-Import Bank credits to lease civilian aircraft to Aeroflot.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Russian-Iranian nuclear reactor deal must be a higher priority at U.S.-Russian summits. The Clinton Administration did not highlight this issue sufficiently at the 1995 Clinton-Yeltsin summits, passing it to the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission, which failed to find a solution. This is a serious mistake. The Islamic regime in Tehran is buying two Russian-made nuclear reactors capable of producing plutonium that can be enriched to become weapons-grade raw material for atomic bombs. Russia is interested in selling even more reactors to Tehran. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has opposed this sale, believing it could endanger both Russian and Western security. But the sale is going through anyway, primarily because of pressure from the powerful Ministry of Atomic Industry (MinAtom), headed by Victor Mikhailov, and because of the short-sightedness of Russia's top nuclear industry officials. If Tehran wants an additional source of electricity, Russia could sell electrical power from its own ample resources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Support NATO expansion, making clear that it does not threaten Russia.</b> Moscow should not have veto power over NATO's decisions to add new members. The U.S. should support NATO enlargement, but keep the door open for Russian participation in the European security dialogue. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has paid lip service to the issue of NATO enlargement to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, but has done very little to make it happen. Some observers accuse the Administration of promising Russia not to expand NATO in 1996 in exchange for cooperation on peacekeeping in Bosnia. NATO enlargement is aimed at wiping the results of Yalta and the Potsdam post-World War II division of Europe from the map. If these countries do not join NATO, they will be left in a strategic gray zone which Russia may try to exploit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should make a political commitment to bring Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and possibly Slovakia into NATO. The 1994 Contract With America stipulated that NATO enlargement, should be a high U.S. national security priority. Russian and Western military experts need to discuss the contingencies of expansion, to make it more transparent, and if need be, to assuage Russian fears.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Russia has voiced many security concerns regarding NATO expansion. Some of these are illegitimate, such as trying to maintain Russian arms exports to the former Warsaw Pact satellites, or intimidating the Baltic States. Others are more legitimate, such as questions about where nuclear weapons will be stationed. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While Russia's security concerns should be discussed in bilateral and multilateral negotiations, Russia should not be given a veto power (<i>droit de regard</i>) to define who will be accepted into the enlarged Atlantic Alliance and under what circumstances. Moscow's worries can be allayed in protocols and memoranda of understanding. However, under no circumstances should the NATO treaty be changed or amended under Russian pressure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Inform the Russians that further negotiations to draft a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) are fruitless.</b> Clinton should tell Yeltsin that the U.S. will withdraw its representative from the negotiations in Geneva and will resume nuclear tests as soon as preparations allow. In keeping with the recommended position that the U.S. not participate in arms control negotiations during the Moscow visit, Clinton should not raise this issue himself, but respond with a unilateral statement only if pressed by the Russians.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should not be seeking a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. U.S. representatives are engaged in negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to draft a treaty on banning nuclear tests. The negotiations come at a time when the U.S. has observed a moratorium on testing that was supposed to be honored by the other four nuclear weapons states (China, France, Great Britain, and Russia). But China and France already have conducted tests in violation of the moratorium. The Clinton Administration is now trying to determine whether Russia conducted a secret test. The tests by other nuclear powers only demonstrate the necessity of further testing to maintain the reliability and effectiveness of the existing U.S. nuclear arsenal and to modernize it. Instead of negotiating a ban on testing, the U.S. should state its determination to maintain its nuclear deterrent through a prudent testing program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Inform Russia that non-strategic missile defenses are not subject to the restriction of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.</b> Clinton should warn Yeltsin that the U.S. Congress is likely to adopt legislation requiring that the negotiations in Geneva be expanded to include matters related to easing treaty-based restrictions on strategic missile defense systems. Again, this warning should be issued only if Russia raises the question of amending the ABM Treaty. Clinton should not raise the issue himself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should not be expanding the scope of the obsolete ABM Treaty to restrict theater missile defenses. There are four issues of importance relevant to the ABM Treaty. First, the U.S., Russia, and several other countries are involved in negotiations to establish a dividing line between shorter-range theater missile defenses, which are not subject to the restrictions of the ABM Treaty, and strategic missile defenses, which are subject to the treaty. Second, there is the question of designating a successor state or successor states to the Soviet Union under the ABM Treaty. Since the Soviet Union, not Russia, signed and is bound by the ABM Treaty, there is a question of which country or countries are legally bound under the treaty. Third, congressional leaders introduced a missile defense bill on March 21, 1996, which, among other things, would require the Clinton Administration to negotiate changes in the ABM Treaty to allow the deployment of an effective national missile defense system. Thus, the intent of Congress is to move beyond the ABM Treaty, not preserve it. And, finally, there is the matter of the legal form these agreements will take. It is becoming increasingly clear that Congress, and the Senate in particular, will object to agreements in these three areas if they do not take the form of formal amendments (protocols) to the ABM Treaty, which are subject to Senate advice and consent as required by Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Be prepared to issue a unilateral statement on START II, if the issue arises, to the effect that the U.S. will not agree to changes to the text of the treaty, or impose limitations on military systems not subject to the treaty.</b> If the Russians do not raise the this issue, then the U.S. should remain silent on the issue of START II. However, if pressed by the Russians, Clinton should inform Yeltsin that so long as no changes in the treaty text are demanded by Russia, the U.S. will proceed to formal ratification of the START II Treaty. On January 26, 1996, the United States Senate consented to the ratification of the START II Treaty. The treaty requires both Russia and the U.S. to reduce their strategic nuclear arsenals to 3,500 deliverable warheads on each side. However, the Russian Duma has not yet consented to ratification and there is speculation that it may not do so unless the U.S. agrees to concessions. These demands could come in the form of modifications to START II itself or restrictions on U.S. military systems outside the scope of the treaty, including new ABM Treaty restrictions on U.S. missile defense systems. The U.S. should steadfastly resist these demands, if they are made.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Be prepared to issue a unilateral statement, if the issue should arise, to the effect that the U.S. may want to re-negotiate the Chemical Weapons Convention.</b> If the issue of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is raised during the Moscow summit, the U.S. should inform Russia that the U.S. Senate may not consent to the ratification of the CWC. Since the Russian Duma may not ratify the CWC either, the U.S. and Russia should consider drafting a joint request to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to re-negotiate the CWC. This unilateral statement should be issued only if the Russians raise the issue and should not be subject to further discussion.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should be seeking an alternative to the Chemical Weapons Convention. The U.S. Senate is now considering whether to consent to the ratification of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The CWC requires all participating states (as of January 16, 160 states have signed the convention) not to develop, retain, deploy, or use chemical weapons. The CWC will enter into force when 65 countries ratify it. So far only 47 states have done so. Russia has signed the CWC as well.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The CWC does not serve U.S. interests. It undermines the U.S. chemical deterrent by barring America from retaining such weapons. Further, Russia has been dragging its feet on fully declaring the size of the chemical stock it inherited from the Soviet Union, as required by a 1989 understanding with the U.S. The best outcome for both the United States and Russia regarding the future of the CWC would be a new treaty modeled on the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This would designate the U.S. and Russia as weapons states and allow them to retain a chemical deterrent.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton must safeguard American national interests at the Russian summit and avoid compromises or concessions on important security issues. Above all, he must avoid being drawn into discussions on arms control. With the end of the Cold War and the diminished threat from the former Soviet Union, arms control need no longer occupy the central place it once held in the relationship between the two countries. There is no reason for side meetings or a bilateral engagement that goes beyond the stated purpose of the summit. If arms control issues are brought up by others, the President should limit himself to unilateral statements of the U.S. position. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is always inherent pressure at widely publicized international meetings to produce "breakthrough" agreements or some tangible results. If the results of the Moscow summit promise to be sparse, the President may be tempted to turn to arms control for an agreement which he can bring home as proof of his foreign policy prowess. In particular he may succumb to pressure to accept new ABM Treaty limitations on theater missile defenses. If this happens, the price of other benefits from the Moscow summit -- for example, an agreement on nuclear reactor safety  -- may prove too high. The American people have seen too many summits in which the vaunted results served merely to disguise unilateral concessions on arms control that harmed the nation's security.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The President must also be careful not to justify any agreement that emerges from the summit on the grounds that it will strengthen Boris Yeltsin. In fact, the President should not under any circumstances appear to interfere in Russia's electoral politics. Clinton should support Russian market and democratic reforms, not individual presidential candidates. He should welcome continuous integration of Russia into the international economic, investment, and information networks. He can acknowledge the pain of democratic and market reform, but call upon the Russian people to join the outside world from which they were separated by communist dictatorship for 70 years. By following this agenda in Moscow, President Clinton will be able to promote both U.S. national security and Russian democracy.

<h3>NO IMF LOANS TO RUSSIA</h3>
<a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen, Ph.D.</a><br>

<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 447<br>
February 16, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is considering granting Russia a $9 billion loan, and the U.S.-run Export-Import Bank may provide an additional $1 billion to boost Russia's flagging civilian aircraft industry. President Bill Clinton strongly supports the IMF loan, hoping that it will bolster Boris Yeltsin's faltering presidency. But giving Russia a handout will not advance U.S. interests or help the Russian economy. The loans do not guarantee more responsible budgetary policies in Moscow. Nor do they lead to much-needed structural reforms, including agriculture and land privatization. Moreover, the loans do not secure Russia's peaceful conduct toward her neighbors, greater foreign policy cooperation with the U.S., or other American interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Economic reforms in Russia are faltering. First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, the last remaining reformer in Yeltsin's cabinet, was forced to resign on January 16, 1996. He was sacrificed to appease Yeltsin's nationalist and communist critics. Now Yeltsin has left himself without any senior political figure capable of formulating and coordinating free-market reforms. Chubais's replacement, Vladimir Kadannikov, was the protectionist director of Russia's inefficient auto-making giant VAZ, whose low-quality products have long been the laughingstock of Europe. Kadannikov is hardly the economic policy leader to steer Russia to a stable free market.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A succession of young, reform-minded economists did much to shift the Russian economy to a free-market course over the past four years. Despite their efforts, Russia's economic house is still not in order. The inflation rate in 1995 was between 120 and 130 percent. Budget deficits are very high, and privatization has failed to raise the revenues to reduce them. Moreover, election campaign pressures have forced Yeltsin to break budgetary constraints and promise billions of dollars in credits and payments to industry groups with the strongest lobbying clout. For example, about $4 billion was earmarked for the defense industry for a state-directed conversion program, and $2.2 billion in wage arrears has been promised to workers in the state sector. The notoriously inefficient Russian miners, who went on strike in December 1995, were promised another $2 billion. $3.3 billion has been pledged to the agricultural sector. Half a billion dollars went to pensioners, and over $1 billion will be paid to officers and soldiers in the armed forces.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Instead of implementing a package of comprehensive economic reforms, attempting to balance the budget, and lowering taxes, the Russian government is following economic policies which only exacerbate the problems. These policies include:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Industrial subsidies.</b> Moscow is giving billions of dollars to inefficient state-owned enterprises. These include the military industry as well as agricultural machinery and aviation manufacturers.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Stalled land privatization and subsidies to the state-owned agricultural sector.</b> The pro-communist agrarian lobby succeeded in derailing the emergence of private farming. Despite its immense agricultural potential, Russia still needs food imports and still suffers from low agricultural productivity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Lack of military reform.</b> Russia's armed forces are oversized at 1.5 million servicemen. They also are poorly organized and inefficient, as demonstrated by their embarrassing performance in Chechnya. The armed forces need to be cut. Instead, the Ministry of Defense has demanded a 55 percent budget increase for FY 1996, and was granted a 16 percent real term increase by the state Duma.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Maintaining the bloated bureaucracy and state sector.</b> Russia today has more bureaucrats than the whole of the Soviet Union, which was almost twice as large. Moreover, many sectors of the Russian economy, such as health care, still are owned and operated by the state, which puts an additional drain on the federal budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Anti-investment policies.</b> More than $12 billion a year leaves Russia and is deposited in foreign bank accounts. Such capital flight denies the Russian economy investment and taxable income. According to the Russian Central Bank's Hard Currency Monitoring Department, over $4 billion a year is transferred illegally out of the country through fictitious import invoices alone. Why is this happening?  Because the government's economic policies are making Russia an inhospitable place to invest, especially compared to East Asia, Central Europe, Latin America, and other emerging markets. Instead of offering a handout to the Russian government, the IMF and the World Bank ought to provide policy advice to decrease the rates of taxation, boost the rule of law, and encourage investment in order to make the Russian economy more attractive for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Forgiving foreign debts.</b> While asking the IMF for loans, Moscow is forgiving an $8 billion debt owed by Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi, a $3 billion debt created by the Sandinista government of Nicaragua, and $250 million owed by Ethiopia. All these debts were generated when the Soviet Union was exporting the revolution and supplying Marxist regimes with weapons.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Russia's problems are not only economic. They are political as well. Russia may be on the brink of a takeover by unreformed communists led by Gennady Zyuganov, former ideology department chief of the Central Committee of the U.S.S.R. Communist Party. The irony is that this may be accomplished through the ballot box in the June presidential elections. Zyuganov, who is running first in the opinion polls, has promised to restore the U.S.S.R. "by voluntary means."  He is followed in the polls by ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has declared that he will restore the Russian Empire and possibly expand it even further into the Middle East.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If a hard-liner like Zyuganov or Zhirinovsky were to win the presidential elections in June, IMF credits would be going to a retrograde regime with little or no interest in reform. Under these circumstances, IMF credits would be throwing good money after bad. Moreover, there is a chance that these loans would never be repaid, since under a communist government Russia could sever relations with the IMF and the World Bank.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Leading Yeltsin administration officials, such as Interior Minister General Anatoly Kulikov, and Communist deputies in the Duma are discussing how to reverse privatization and stop the economic reforms in their tracks. Communists and their allies control the majority of the Duma's committees and the powerful Duma Executive Council. Without a clearer picture of the future direction of Russian politics and economic policies, the IMF loans are ill-advised. It makes no sense to approve the IMF loan until the rest of the world knows what kind of regime will be using the money.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nor does it make sense to loan Russia money while it is prosecuting the war against Chechnya. According to estimates by Russian economists, this war costs over $4.5 billion a year. The IMF should not subsidize such a war, or any other military ventures into which a future Russian hard-line president might drag the country.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Clinton Administration should not be lobbying the IMF on behalf of Russia. These loans will not boost the cause of reform. At best the money will be wasted; at worst, it could be abused by some future anti-Western leadership. Either way, money will be thrown at problems which cannot be solved easily and which will not go away with the stroke of an IMF pen.

December 4, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
On December 17, 1995, over 100,000,000 Russians are expected to go to the polls and vote for 450 members of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, or Federal Assembly. Half the members will be elected from winner-take-all single-mandate electoral districts.<sup>1</sup>  The other half will be elected from party lists in proportion to their total national vote, with 5 percent the minimum threshold for party representation. <p>Under the Russian constitution, the State Duma's power is limited in favor of the presidency. The Duma, therefore, has little say in formulating government policy. However, the upcoming election will reveal the balance of political forces in Russia, and its results will be difficult for President Boris Yeltsin and his administration to ignore. Moreover, some Russian experts view the parliamentary elections as a primary that will indicate popular support for candidates in the presidential election planned for June 1996. The Duma elections undoubtedly will have a significant impact on Russian policy, both foreign and domestic. 
<p>
According to the Russian Justice Ministry, 262 political parties have been registered, and by the end of September 1995, 63 electoral blocs and alliances had been recorded by the Central Electoral Commission. A large majority of the parties running for the State Duma are tiny, with no solid base of national support. By October 22, 1995, only 42 had managed to submit the 200,000 supporter signatures required in order to begin their electoral campaigns. Approximately 5,500 candidates are on the party lists, and 2,691 are running in the single-mandate constituencies.
<p>
Despite the number of parties in this race, the Russian public is largely indifferent. Feeling deceived by the politicians, people are disillusioned and openly skeptical about the value of the elections. Few voters study and compare party platforms, much less attend political rallies. Polls show that people would rather vote for well-known personalities, such as movie actors, military figures, and cultural icons. Almost all parties have such luminaries among the top three names on the party lists. In the top twelve electoral blocs alone, there are three actors and four generals.
<p>
Opinion polls also show that less than 39 percent of young people (ages 18-24) are going to vote, versus 71 percent in the 67-89 age group. The great strength of the communists is that their voters (primarily age 55 and older) have a high turnout rate. The Communist Party is highly motivated to return to power now, before its electoral base vanishes. With economic issues and populist and nationalist slogans dominating the rhetoric, and only a 25 percent turnout required, it is little wonder that the election results may favor the nationalist and leftist parties. 
<p>
Based on the latest public opinion polls, the expected results for those on the party lists are as follows:<P>
<ul>
<li> Communists, 10-15 percent;
<p>
<li> <i>Yabloko</i>, 10 percent;
<p>
<li> Women of Russia, 10 percent;
<p>
<li> Agrarian Party, 7-10 percent;
<p>
<li> Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (Zhirinovsky), 7 percent;
<p>
<li> Russia's Democratic Choice, 5-7 percent;
<p>
<li> Congress of Russian Communities--KRO (Lebed, Skokov), 5-7 percent.
</ul><p>

<b>PARTIES, PERSONALITIES, AND PROGRAMS</b>
<p>
What follows is a sketch of the main contenders in the coming electoral race. As the field is crowded, only those parties which currently appear most likely to exceed the 5 percent threshold of the national vote, or which have platforms of particular interest, are discussed.
<p>

<b>Russia's Democratic Choice-United Democrats</b>
<P>
Forecasts predict that Russia's Democratic Choice could get from 5 to 7 percent of the votes in December. This bloc strongly advocates freedom and democracy, private property, free-market economics, the rule of law, anti-inflationary and stabilization measures, and democratic military reform. Although it opposes Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's view that "the stage of liberal reforms is over," Russia's Democratic Choice generally supports the economic policies of the government.
<p>
Former First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, who heads the party in the Duma, is this bloc's leader. Internationally known human rights advocate Sergei Kovalev is in second place on the party's electoral list. Lydia Fedoseyeva-Shukshina, widow of writer and actor Vassily Shukshin, is in third place. The bloc includes a number of different parties:  Gaidar's Russia's Choice, with its nearly 60 regional chapters throughout Russia; the Social Democracy Party headed by Mikhail Gorbachev's chief ideologist, Alexander N. Yakovlev; and the Peasants' Party led by Federation Council (upper chamber of parliament) member Yuri Chernichenko. 
<p>
Russia's Democratic Choice finds itself in a difficult situation. The left-wing and nationalist opposition, as well as some government officials, attributes all failures of the reforms to Gaidar and his party. Gaidar has never openly distanced himself from the errors made by his government or by his successor, current Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin. Now his unwillingness to attack the government could cost him votes. His supporters are mainly young and middle-aged intellectuals and businessmen who have become unhappy with the government's overregulation and inability to protect them from crime and corruption. 
<p>

<b>Forward, Russia</b>
<p>
Duma member and former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov is first on the party list of Forward, Russia. Second comes Bella Denisenko, formerly a Russia's Choice activist and Deputy Health Minister, followed by Alexander Vladislavlev, a technocrat and former vice president of the centrist Civic Union under Arkady Volsky in 1993. Until he was removed recently by stockholders, Vladislavlev was the CEO of Moscow's failing ZIL automotive plant.
<P>
Fedorov is a constant critic of the government. He opposes new International Monetary Fund loans and credits to Russia, fearing that they will only increase Russia's already very high foreign debt. He favors tax reform, including a reduction in the tax burden, deep cuts in government spending, and downsizing of the federal bureaucracy. Private land ownership is one of Forward, Russia's top priorities.
<p>
Fedorov's stand on expanding NATO to include Eastern European countries such as Poland and Hungary is unique. He insists that Russia should announce its intention to join NATO because the West's response would indicate its true attitude. He also feels that NATO membership is needed to strengthen Russian democracy. Nevertheless, he is strongly opposed to the expansion of NATO without Russia.
<p>
Fedorov's movement is an "inside-the-Beltway" phenomenon, with little support in the Russian regions (<i>oblasts</i>). Some members have left and joined Chernomyrdin's pro-government Our Home Is Russia party. Fedorov lacks a team of prominent politicians and public personalities to ensure name recognition for his movement. The expectation is that he will find it difficult to attain the 5 percent of national votes required to attain seats in the Duma, although he is campaigning aggressively. 
<p>

<b><i>Yabloko</i> (Apple) </b>
<p>
The <i>Yabloko</i> bloc is named for its three founders:  Grigory Yavlinsky, Yuri Boldyrev, and Vladimir Lukin. In the fall of 1995 Boldyrev dropped out because of political differences with Yavlinsky and other members of the bloc. The <i>Yabloko</i> list today includes Duma Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Vladimir Lukin2 in second place, with Duma member Tatiana Yarygina in the number three slot. <p>The <i>Yabloko</i> bloc is headed by Grigory Yavlinsky. A relatively young, energetic, and extremely ambitious political contender, Yavlinsky is the most popular politician in Russia. His sole rival is General Alexander Lebed of the Congress of Russian Communities (KRO) movement. Unlike Gaidar and Fedorov, Yavlinsky was never a member of the reformist government which imposed so many unpopular measures on the population, and he never fails to criticize the government and its errors. His name is associated with the famous "500 Days" program of radical reform which was shelved by Gorbachev in 1990 under pressure from the orthodox communists. Because of this, Yavlinsky enjoys the image of a prophet shunned by his country. 
<p>
Yavlinsky claims that his party represents the interests of the middle class -- engineers, scientists, teachers, and qualified workers. These social strata have been losers under the reforms. His political platform is a combination of center-right and social-democratic slogans. On the one hand, he calls for private property and the protection of individuals against bureaucratic rule. On the other hand, he insists on increased government involvement in education and health. 
<p>
<i>Yabloko</i> committed some minor violations of the complicated regulations when submitting the party list to the Central Electoral Commission (as did many other electoral blocs) and was denied registration in November 1995. The case went to the Supreme Court, and the Commission's decision was reversed one week later, but not before the uproar had generated a great deal of publicity in <i>Yabloko</i>'s favor. Partly because of this publicity, the party's chances for success are high:  It could be the only democratic party to draw support in low double-digit figures. The question is how disciplined its voters will be on election day. In some single-mandate constituencies, other democratic parties have withdrawn their candidates in favor of <i>Yabloko</i> nominees.
<p>

<b>Democratic Russia-Free Trade Unions</b>
<p>
The Democratic Russia bloc was formed on the basis of Russia's oldest democratic organization, which emerged as an anti-Soviet and anti-communist entity in 1990. Its co-chairmen are Galina Starovoitova, former advisor to President Yeltsin, and Duma members Lev Ponomarev and Father Gleb Yakunin. Democratic Russia used to be part of Russia's Choice but left because of Gaidar's loyalty to the government. The party remains a stronghold of anti-communist and anti-totalitarian politicians, most of whom suffered during the Soviet regime as dissidents or prisoners of conscience.
<P>
Having failed to reach an electoral agreement with Yavlinsky or Gaidar, Democratic Russia is united in the campaign with the Russian Labor Confederation, which includes a dozen free trade unions and the Shield Military Union. The latter opposes the Defense Ministry's failing policies. The main objective of the bloc is "to awaken the electorate disillusioned by bureaucracy."  Its electoral campaign will focus on criticizing the neo-communist <i>nomenklatura</i> and its anti-popular economic policies and corruption. 
<p>
Democratic Russia ran into difficulties registering with the Central Electoral Commission and withdrew in the fall of 1995. On the national lists, the party has chosen to support <i>Yabloko</i>, but its leaders intend to run independently in the single-mandate constituencies.
<p>

<b>Economic Freedom Party</b>
<p>
Led by Konstantin Borovoy, one of the best-known entrepreneurs in Russia, this party's platform is based on the slogan "protecting investors' rights."  The party consistently champions free-market economics and deregulation and is openly anti-government. The Moscow regional list is headed by libertarian dissident Valeria Novodvorskaya, who was involved in anti-government activities in the former Soviet Union and was the only dissident detained during the "liberal" Gorbachev era. Borovoy's and Novodvorskaya's behavior and declarations, such as calling the current Russian government "fascist," often shock the public. Because it is primarily Moscow-based and has little support nationally, the Economic Freedom Party is unlikely to surpass the 5 percent threshold.
<p>

<b>CENTRIST PARTIES AND BLOCS</b>
<p>
<b>Our Home Is Russia (<i>Nash Dom Rossiya</i> -- NDR)</b>
<p> 
This bloc, headed by Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, was created on Yeltsin's initiative to provide an alternative to extremist forces on the left and right. It represents the interests of the post-Soviet <i>nomenklatura</i>, which is working to retain its political power and acquire wealth through privatization. Our Home Is Russia essentially represents Russia's current status quo and has much to lose if defeated. Virtually all government resources are at its disposal, and most ministers and local governors are members. 
<p>
This bloc favors further reforms but fails to follow a truly democratic pattern. Chernomyrdin openly advocates "strengthening the role of the government in the regulation of all spheres of Russian life."  He also suggests that the government tackle social problems. The NDR is determined to "fight the forces striving to undermine the constitutional basis of the state, abolish the presidency and redistribute property."
<p>
Chernomyrdin has chosen Nikita Mikhalkov, a popular movie actor, as number two on the NDR list. Number three is General Lev Rokhlin, commander of the Russian forces that captured Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, in February 1995. NDR lists are being formed in all of Russia's 89 regions. The government-run media are singing its praises, and the massive campaign is yielding results. Though formed only recently, the NDR is fourth in the polls at 12-15 percent, following the communists, <i>Yabloko</i>, and Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats.
<p>
The government is already taking costly populist steps, including wage hikes, subsidy increases, and unrestrained lending, to solidify the NDR's position for the upcoming elections. The party is gambling that the inevitable inflation caused by these measures will set in only after the elections.
<p>

<b>Ivan Rybkin's Electoral Bloc</b>
<p>
This bloc is headed by and named for Ivan Rybkin, Speaker of the State Duma and former head of the pro-Communist Agrarian Party (profiled below). Currently led by Ivan Lapshin, the Agrarians favor a strong state role in agriculture. Rybkin's bloc emerged as part of Yeltsin's attempt to create two broad, centrist parties within the existing establishment, one of which (the NDR) would be pro-government and the other of which would play the part of "loyal opposition."  However, it did not take long for federal and local officials and bureaucrats to grasp the advantages of Chernomyrdin's NDR. Therefore, most of them joined the NDR instead of Rybkin's bloc. Moreover, Rybkin's failure to be sufficiently critical of government policy cost him the support of his own Agrarian Party. 
<p>
Two small parties that had joined the bloc initially -- the United Industrial Party and the Federation of Independent Trade Unions -- left to run an independent campaign. Three top figures on Rybkin's initial party list -- Afghan War hero and former Deputy Defense Minister General Boris Gromov, well-known economist Stanislav Shatalin, and a popular singer named Yosif Kobzon -- also defected because of Rybkin's failure to oppose the government. 
<p>
Rybkin's platform is not captivating the electorate. It calls for social justice, law, order, creativity, and realism, mirroring the slogans of the NDR. However, Rybkin's charisma and perceived common sense could still attract the electorate to vote for him personally. His standing has been improving, partly because of mistakes by his opponents and partly because of his increased criticism of the government. However, despite recent gains, the question of whether Rybkin can make the 5 percent threshold remains open.
<p>

<b>THE LEFT</b>
<p>
<b>Communist Party of the Russian Federation</b>
<p>
The Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), headed by longtime Soviet Communist Party <i>apparatchik</i> Gennady Zyuganov, is one of the major anti-reformist forces in Russia. Its constituency is largely seniors who have suffered moral, political, and economic loss during the reform period. Their strong nostalgic sentiment and the lack of apparent prospects for a better future make them an active and well-organized force in contrast to the comparatively passive and irresolute democrats.
<p>
True to form, the communists are experts in manipulating public discontent with reform. They exaggerate the hardships, focus on the "humiliation of the nation," and predict "the extinction of the population."  The party platform calls for the de-nationalization of private property, direct government regulation of the economy, and restoration of the Soviet political system. It also advocates restoration of the Soviet Union and confrontation with the capitalist West. This movement undoubtedly represents an open threat to the nascent democracy in Russia, and even partial implementation of its goals could unleash social conflict. Few believe that the communists will fully re-nationalize the already privatized industries, but their effort to redistribute wealth could destabilize the political and economic situation.
<p>
Zyuganov's main partners in the CPRF are Svetlana Goryacheva, Yeltsin's bellicose opponent in the former Russian Supreme Soviet, and Aman Tuleyev, a regional boss from Kemerovo and Yeltsin's opponent in the 1991 presidential election. Among other well-known figures on the list are August 1991 coup leaders Anatoly Lukyanov, the former USSR Supreme Soviet Speaker, and Victor Ilyukhin, Chairman of the Duma Security Committee and a former prosecutor who once charged Mikhail Gorbachev with "high treason" for dismantling the Soviet state.
<p>

<b>Other Communist Groups</b>
<p>
The CPRF is not the only communist organization running for the Duma. Others have coalesced into a radical communist bloc called Communists-Working Russia-for the Soviet Union, which expects to attract voters positioned to the left of Zyuganov and pledges an even stronger commitment to restoring the communist system. Zyuganov is not expected to carry large cities like Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Ekaterinburg because of strong support for reformers in these cities. However, the CPRF should enjoy greater support in smaller cities and towns in the so-called red belt south and east of Moscow. The nationwide network of local party chapters which remained virtually intact after the collapse of the CPSU constitutes an unsurpassed political machine. This represents a significant electoral advantage for the communists, who are expected to get up to 15 percent of the vote.
<p>

<b>Agrarian Party</b>
<p>
The Agrarian Party is headed by Ivan Lapshin, Chairman of its Duma faction and director of the Lenin's Legacy state farm (<i>sovkhoz</i>) on the outskirts of Moscow. The party's political slogans and electoral base are much the same as those of the communists:  pensioners, state farm managers and workers, and members of collective farms. Since agricultural reform has been slow and timid, the system remains essentially as it was under the totalitarian regime:  dominated by all-powerful collective farm chairmen at the expense of poor peasants. Most collective farms supposedly have been reshaped into "joint-stock companies," but these companies are a fiction. In fact, there is virtually no private farmland, and the few private farmers that exist are harassed and persecuted by the rural communist networks.
<p>
The Agrarians criticize the present regime as "anti-popular, anti-national and anti-peasant."  Granting people private ownership of land is, in Lapshin's words, "a diabolic enterprise which will ruin the social and economic stability of the country."  Regarding the communists as their closest allies, the Agrarians also call for restoring the power of the Soviets and restoring the USSR. In addition, they demand that the agrarian sector be made a top priority in national economic policy. 
<p>
The party's electoral list is one of the largest in Russia:  437 names, of which 270 are on the federal list and 167 intend to run in single-mandate constituencies. The Agrarians have a stable electorate in the countryside which is easily controlled. A local Agrarian boss can make life unbearable for those who dare challenge the party in the elections. Thus, a 5 percent vote is virtually guaranteed. However, the party has a much slimmer chance in the cities, where nearly 70 percent of the Russian population lives. All in all, the Agrarians could gather up to 10 percent of the votes in the Duma elections.

<p>
<b>THE NATIONALISTS</b>
<p>
Russian nationalist parties that favor a strong state and a return to an imperialist system occupy a broad space in the political spectrum.
<p>
<b>Liberal Democratic Party of Russia</b>
<p>
The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) is headed by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the party's Duma faction and a lawyer with strong intelligence community connections. The LDPR's platform is based largely on the ideas of Russian chauvinism, which have become widespread in the wake of the Soviet breakup. Zhirinovsky manipulates the Russian people by evoking xenophobic sentiment, anti-Semitism, and racial hatred for non-Russians such as Azerbaijanis, Chechens, and Uzbeks. His electorate is comprised of those unable to advance either in the old Soviet Union or under the current system:  the unemployed, unqualified workers, and retired and acting military officers. Zhirinovsky also attracts the rank and file in the armed forces, members of the military-industrial complex, and elements of the Russian "mafiya" who applaud his anti-Western declarations and defiance.
<p>
Though Zhirinovsky is not opposed to private property in principle, some redistribution in favor of his supporters undoubtedly would take place if he came to power. Therefore, some influential economic forces in the country, anxious to capitalize on this redistribution, covertly support the LDPR while openly supporting other parties. Fearing expropriation, many Russian businessmen wish to "diversify the risk" of doing business in Russia.
<p>
Zhirinovsky's popularity, however, is faltering. Some of his slogans and rhetoric have been taken up by the present government and by his nationalist competitors. His electorate is unpredictable, although he could still do well among soldiers who vote under the tight control of the many officers who share Zhirinovsky's views. Since the nationalist leader supports increases in the defense budget, the Army continuously flirts with him; Defense Minister Pavel Grachev even promoted him to Lieutenant-Colonel in the reserves -- two ranks higher than the rank of captain he used to hold.
<p>
The LDPR will easily make the 5 percent level, but it will not get the 30 percent which Zhirinovsky has predicted. A more likely figure is 7 percent. If he gets over 15 percent, Zhirinovsky will likely throw his hat into the ring in next June's presidential election.
<p>

<b>Congress of Russian Communities (KRO)</b>
<p>
The Congress of Russian Communities is headed by Yuri Skokov, former Yeltsin ally, former National Security Council Secretary, and a military-industrial chieftain. However, Skokov is not the most popular and charismatic figure in the KRO. Much more popular is retired General Alexander Lebed, former commanding officer of the 14th Army and number two on the party list. Lebed was the most popular Russian politician during the summer months.<sup>3</sup>  The third spot, behind Lebed and Skokov, is occupied by Sergei Glaziev, an archopponent of the current regime and protectionist foe of free-market reforms who advocates stronger government involvement in the economy.<p>The Congress of Russian Communities calls for countering centrifugal and separatist trends in Russia and for protecting the Russian minorities in the so-called Near Abroad. However, its support base seems to be more concentrated abroad than in Russia proper. Skokov, an uncharismatic Soviet-era technocrat, is not very popular. His support comes mainly from the ranks of the military. Lebed presents himself as an honest man with a "law and order" message, but many intellectuals abhor his rude manners. Both Skokov and Lebed, however, could rally the support of rank-and-file officers and the military-industrial complex. It is expected that the Congress of Russian Communities will make 5 percent in the elections.
<p>
<b><i>Derzhava</i> (Great Power) Movement</b>
<p>
The Congress of Russian Communities is being challenged by the <i>Derzhava</i> (Great Power) Movement headed by Alexander Rutskoy, former deputy to Yeltsin and one of the October 1993 mutiny leaders. Rutskoy can expect some support from the officer corps since he is a veteran and an Afghan War hero. Evoking memories of Russia's imperial and religious past, he calls for "a restoration of Holy Russia as a Unitarian state in its natural borders," implying the pre-World War I borders of czarist Russia. 
<p>
Rutskoy accepted two defectors from Zhirinovsky's party and found them places on his own list. His number two man, chief campaign organizer Victor Kobelev, is one of these. Third on the list is Konstantin Dushenov, former spokesman for the famous ultra-nationalist Bishop Ioann (John) of Kronstadt and the Ladoga, in the St. Petersburg region. To boost fund-raising, Rutskoy also has put some "New Russian" businessmen on his party list. This policy evoked a wave of protests from veterans of the nationalist movement, who accused Rutskoy of staging an "anti-patriotic coup" and of turning the party into a "social-criminal movement."  Their subsequent withdrawal from the party left Rutskoy weakened. 
<p>
Like <i>Yabloko, Derzhava</i> was denied registration by the Central Electoral Commission, but the Supreme Court has overturned that ruling. Rutskoy's group is among those that are unlikely to clear the 5 percent hurdle.
<p>

<b>Union of Patriots</b>
<p>
Another nationalist bloc with the slogan of "protecting the Russian man" is the Union of Patriots. Formed on the basis of the Russian National <i>Sobor</i> (Union) organization and headed by ex-KGB General Alexander Sterligov, this bloc also includes two of the August 1991 coup instigators, industrial manager Alexander Tizyakov and Army General Valentin Varennikov. Russian National <i>Sobor</i> supporters include devout Russian Orthodox believers and paramilitary Cossacks, as well as the military-industrial complex. The bloc probably will not achieve the 5 percent threshold.
<p>

<b>For the Motherland</b>
<p>
Nationalist-oriented Afghan War veterans and some trade unions are backing yet another nationalist opposition bloc, For the Motherland, headed by Vladimir Polevanov. Vice-premier and Privatization Minister for Yeltsin for six months in 1994-1995, Polevanov was dismissed for opposing the government's privatization policy. Second in the party ranks is Commander in Chief of Airborne Troops Evgueni Podkolzin, who enjoys the respect of the military and has criticized the Defense Ministry for its poor handling of the Chechen campaign. Famous ice-hockey goal-keeper Vladislav Tretyak is also high on the party list, but his presence is unlikely to give For the Motherland the capacity to surmount the 5 percent hurdle.

<p>
<b>SPECIAL-INTEREST ELECTORAL BLOCS</b>
<p>

<b>Women of Russia</b>
<p>
The Women of Russia movement is headed by Alevtina Fedulova, Deputy Speaker of the current Duma, longtime communist, and <i>Komsomol</i> (Young Communist League) <i>apparatchik</i>; Yekaterina Lakhova, leader of the party's faction in the Duma and advisor to the president on family issues; and Galina Klimantova, chairman of the Duma Women, Family and Youth Issues Committee. The movement claims to represent specific women's interests, focusing on welfare issues, improving women's social status, and anti-discriminatory employment measures. Such slogans are likely to attract some of the female electorate and may give the movement the 5 percent of votes it needs to get into the Duma. 
<P>
On many economic and political issues, Women of Russia is close to the communists and Agrarians. However, its voting record in the Duma has not been as close to that of the communists as many had expected. The movement has about 80 candidates on the federal list and over 20 in the single-mandate districts.
<p>

<b>Environmental Protection Party of Russia</b>
<p>
The Environmental Protection Party of Russia (KEDR/Cedar) is an ecological movement. Popular TV anchorman Leonid Yakubovich, prominent businessman Artem Tarasov, writer and <i>Novy Mir</i> literary journal chief editor Sergei Zalygin, and cosmonaut Musa Manarov top the party's list. KEDR/Cedar unites 40 environmental movements and has 224 candidates on its federal list and 115 in the single-mandate districts. However, its chances to make the 5 percent threshold are slim.
<p>

<b>Trade Unions and Industrialists of Russia-Union of Labor</b>
<p>
Trade Unions and Industrialists of Russia-Union of Labor was formed by former components of the Rybkin bloc -- the Russian United Industrial Party of Vladimir Shcherbakov, Mikhail Shmakov's Federation of Independent Trade Unions, and Arkady Volsky's Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. This group pledges to "revive domestic industries, insure high employment, obey the law, ease ethnic tensions and revitalize the Russian state."  Similar to Volsky's Civic Union back in the 1993 elections, however, it is not likely to make the 5 percent threshold.
<p>
<b>Others</b>
<p>
Electoral blocs based on specific interests include such associations as the Beer Lovers' Party, Christian-Democratic Union-Russian Christians, the Protection of the Disabled Party, the Lawyers' Association, the Pensioner Protection Party and its bloc, and the "Nur" Moslem Movement. Although each of these parties succeeded in obtaining the 200,000 signatures needed to begin a campaign, the 5 percent threshold may be an insurmountable barrier. Their expectations probably can be realized only in single-mandate constituencies where some of their famous leaders are candidates.
<p>
The role of the military in the upcoming election deserves special attention. Although the armed forces cannot submit a party list, there are over 100 active duty officers on various party lists and running in single-mandate constituencies. Defense Minister Grachev has openly encouraged the political involvement of the officer corps, including running for office in uniform, in the hope they will lobby for military interests in the new Duma. Grachev put his Deputy Chief of the General Staff, three-star Colonel-General Anatoly Bogdanov, in charge of this operation. Some military units reportedly have deployed their own TV studios to advertise their commanders' campaigns.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
With the exception of the communists, no electoral bloc will win more than 10-12 percent of the Duma seats. Presidential analyst Marc Urnov forecasts that only the Communist Party, the Agrarians, Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats, <I>Yabloko</i>, Our Home Is Russia, and the Congress of Russian Communities will be able to clear the 5 percent hurdle. The Duma will be split into a multitude of minor factions cooperating or confronting each other on each individual issue.
<p>
<b>Ascendancy of the Nationalists and Leftists.</b>  A shift toward the leftist and nationalist parties is widely predicted. A pronounced nationalist-leftist orientation in the Duma could trigger attempts to revise the existing constitution. The Duma may wish to curtail the powers of the president and enhance its own. Under these circumstances, the president would likely veto almost all laws passed by the Duma. (So far, only 20 percent of passed legislation has been rejected.) The upshot would be a return to the confrontation and crisis that resulted in the storming of the old Russian Parliament in 1993.
<p>
<b>Unpleasant Surprises.</b> Particularly dangerous is the possibility of increased criminal power in the Duma. According to some estimates by the Interior Ministry, 25 to 30 percent of the newly elected members will be influenced by criminal organizations, either openly or covertly. If true, these delegates would use their power to entrench criminal groups even further in Russian society. These corrupt deputies could become a ruling majority in the Duma regardless of party affiliation.
<P>
The possibility of postponement or annulment of the election by the president cannot be excluded. A violent extremist action could serve as the pretext for such action. Certain forces in Yeltsin's inner circle are determined to preserve their own position by preventing a new Duma from coming to power. A low turnout at the elections (less than 25 percent of eligible voters) also might provide a legal basis for declaring the December elections invalid and governing without the Duma. 
<p>
As the elections draw near, attempts on the part of potential losers to delay them or change the rules of the game are becoming more pronounced. Loopholes in the electoral legislation are the main pretext for such disruptions. For example, a large group of Duma deputies has requested the Constitutional Court to examine the 5 percent threshold rule and other issues, but were rebuffed by the Court. All major parties oppose any last-minute revision of the electoral legislation and are very much against postponing the elections. 
<p>
Technical issues, such as where a party is placed on the ballot, are also important. The drawing of lots which took place November 10, 1995, for example, gave first place to Women of Russia and second to Rutskoy's <i>Derzhava</i>. This puts them at an advantage, as most people tend to vote for familiar candidates whose name first meets the eye.
<p>
The United States has little ability to influence the outcome of this election. Nevertheless, the American government, including Congress, should continue sending a clear message to the Russian political elite and public that it supports Russia's advance to democracy and a free-market economy. The U.S. also should make it clear that a significant communist or nationalist gain could undermine the progress of reform in Russia and imperil international stability and security. To assuage some Russian fears, the U.S. should emphasize once again that potential NATO expansion is targeted not against Russia or its people, but against extremist forces that could usurp power. 
<P>
Observers should watch for fraud and doctoring of election results. American and other Western observers might contribute by helping to ensure fair play. However, some Russian experts believe that Western observers could be duped into endorsing a "stolen" election. Observers will be concentrated mainly in the big cities, where public opinion tends to be democratically oriented and fraud would be opposed. Meanwhile, villages and small towns, where it is easier to tamper with ballots, will not be watched closely by outsiders. It is no accident that the communists, the Agrarians, and Zhirinovsky's faction blocked the Duma's adoption of a bill on public supervision of the elections. Major fraud also could be committed not at polling stations, but later, when the votes are being counted.
<P>
Whatever occurs at the polls in Russia in December, one thing is certain:  These elections are a critical test for Russian democracy. They also are a dress rehearsal for the even more important presidential elections which will take place in Russia in June.

<h3>MESSAGES CLINTON SHOULD DELIVER AT THE U.S.-RUSSIAN SUMMIT</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen, Ph.D. </a><br>
Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 435<br>
October 23, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center>
<p>
President Bill Clinton is planning a positive, "feel-good" summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on October 23, 1995, in New York City. This event takes place as an intense parliamentary campaign is underway in Russia which ultimately may cast a shadow over Boris Yeltsin's political future and imperil U.S.-Russian relations. Popular support for Russian nationalist leader General Alexander Lebed and the recent Communist victory in the Volgograd local elections indicate that the tide of Russian political opinion may be turning against Boris Yeltsin.
<p>
U.S.-Russian relations are too important to waste on a "feel-good" summit. The President needs to be preparing the ground for what could be a challenging period in U.S.-Russian relations. He needs to get down to business, not only dealing with such issues as Bosnia and NATO expansion, but positioning the U.S. for a time when Boris Yeltsin may no longer be president of Russia.
<p>
<b>America's Russian Challenge.</b> Russia's recent outcry over the NATO bombings in Bosnia exposed a former superpower in search of an identity and led by an increasingly combative political establishment. Russia's foreign policy is becoming more anti-Western, as evidenced by the opposition to NATO enlargement, the planned sales of nuclear reactors to Iran, and threats to breach the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has been weakened by intrigues and is about to be dismissed by President Yeltsin. Suspicion of the West is growing in Moscow. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, presidential foreign policy advisor Dmitrii Ryurikov, General Evgenii Primakov, head of the foreign intelligence service, and General Alexander Korzhakov, ubiquitous Chief of the Kremlin guard, all tend to be anti-Western and against reform. They also are in positions of major influence over Yeltsin's foreign and security policies. 	
<p>
<b>Yeltsin's Political Weakness.</b> Yeltsin's internal position is precarious. His public approval ratings hover between 9 and 15 percent, and his chances of winning a presidential bid do not look bright. The polls consistently show that several Russian politicians, such as Lebed and Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the YABLOCo party, would be able to defeat him in an election. Two "centrist" parties were launched in May:  Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin's Our Home Russia and Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin's Accord. The first is polling around 10 percent, and the second has yet to get off the ground. According to high-level Russian sources, some in Yeltsin's circle are considering canceling the presidential elections altogether. Thus, Yeltsin and his team could be swept away by a cadre of anti-Western nationalists if the presidential elections slated for the summer of 1996 actually take place. Alternatively, Yeltsin could be rendered more prone to a coup if he fails to hold the elections and undermines his remaining legitimacy. 
<p>
President Clinton needs to take stock of the new winds blowing in Russia. He must prepare U.S. policy for the likelihood that Russia may be on the verge of a major political crisis. At the New York summit, the President should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Support democracy and free-market principles rather than particular Russian leaders.</b> Clinton's unwavering support of Yeltsin, particularly in the wake of the October 1993 attack on the Russian Supreme Soviet and the Chechnya operation, have already cost the U.S. a great deal of goodwill among both Russian nationalists and reformers. The chances are good that Clinton or the next American President will have to deal with a new set of players in Moscow. The U.S. cannot afford to appear partisan. Clinton should be firm in expressing American support for democracy, elections, free markets, and individual rights in Russia. He should play down his support for the personal political fortunes of Boris Yeltsin.
<p>
<li><b>Proceed with caution in bringing Russian peacekeepers to Bosnia.</b> While the U.S. should support a sustainable, long-term peace settlement in Bosnia, it is too early to negotiate the specific details of Russia's military involvement in a peacekeeping operation. Nevertheless, President Clinton should declare that, in principle, the Russian armed forces will be welcome to support peace in Yugoslavia, but only if American troops are committed to the peacekeeping mission.1  Clinton should be careful not to jeopardize NATO's operational control over the entire peacekeeping mission. Russian troops could play a positive role in such important tasks as mine-sweeping, logistics, and communications. In these areas, the Russian military could cooperate with its NATO counterparts. However, Clinton should not agree to integrating Russian troops into the NATO command and control structure. This leaves open the possibility of a Russian "occupation sector" inside Bosnian Serb territory. The presence of Russian troops on the ground could prevent further NATO air strikes in the event the peace treaty collapses. 
<p>
<li><b>Reaffirm that NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia.</b> Many in Moscow are expressing deep concern about NATO expansion. The summit is a good opportunity for President Clinton to make clear to Boris Yeltsin and the Russian people that the North Atlantic alliance harbors no hostile intentions toward them. While NATO enlargement will occur, Russian participation in the Partnership for Peace and Moscow's dialogue with Brussels should be expanded simultaneously. NATO enlargement will expand the zone of peace and stability in Europe. Such a zone is in the interests not only of Europe, but of Russia, Belarus, and other countries of the former Soviet Union as well. 
<p>
<li><b>Oppose a unilateral breach of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty.</b> The Russian military is threatening a unilateral breach of the CFE treaty. Specifically, Moscow insists on reviewing upwards the limits it imposes on the number of tanks and cannon permitted on the ground. President Clinton should oppose such an asymmetrical approach. These issues can be renegotiated within the framework of the treaty. If Russia remains determined to deploy more treaty-limited equipment on its southern flank, then the U.S. should seek a <i>quid pro quo</i> -- relief from the 1972 ABM Treaty, which is impeding the U.S. ballistic missile defense program.

<li><b>Offer incentives to cancel the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran.</b> The radical regime in Tehran has launched a bid to acquire nuclear weapons and has ordered two nuclear reactors from Russia. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not support this sale, which could endanger both Russian and Western security. The deal is being promoted by the powerful atomic industry ministry (Minatom) and its chief, Viktor Mikhailov. Iran, with its formidable oil and gas resources, does not need nuclear power. If Tehran wants an additional source of electricity, Russia could sell electrical power from its own ample resources. In addition, to compensate Russia for the lost reactor sales, the U.S. could increase its Russian uranium import quota or cooperate in building safer nuclear reactors on Russian soil.
<p></ul>
This is not the time for a "feel-good" summit with the Russians. Although the President's time with Boris Yeltsin is limited, he has enough time to deliver some important messages, not only to Yeltsin, but to all of Russia and the world. The U.S. is still committed to democracy in Russia, but that cause no longer has a single human face. At the New York summit, President Clinton should be looking ahead, preparing the ground for what may well be a rocky road in future U.S.-Russian relations.

Book Review: Martin Malia: The Soviet Tragedy
 -- Heritage </title>

<h2>August <i>Insider</i> -- In Focus: Book Review</h2>

<b>
The Soviet Tragedy: A History of Socialism in Russia, 1917-1991<br>
Martin Malia (New York: The Free Press, 1994)</b>
<p>
While good books on American history and domestic politics continue to multiply, the same cannot be said of international politics and American foreign policy. For those who are interested in the central conflict of the twentieth century -- the Cold War -- there is good news in the form of Martin Malia's The Soviet Tragedy. A respected, former professor of history at Berkeley, Malia may be best known as Z, the author who exposed the distortions of revisionist Sovietologists and analyzed the potential for the crumbling of the Soviet regime in his 1990 article "To the Stalin Mausoleum." Now Malia offers a masterful study of Western Sovietology and its translations of the Soviet regime and its practices.
<p>
Two models have dominated the field of Soviet studies: first, the totalitarian school that was pioneered in the 1950s, which argued that the Bolshevik revolution was communist and imposed in fact by an intellectual elite and that Lenin and Stalin established and extended a totalitarian state; second, the anti-totalitarian school, which, as it gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s, maintained that pluralism, consensus building, and compromise characterized the Soviet Union, Lenin, and Stalin's successors. The revisionist anti-totalitarian model has influenced several generations of scholars, students, journalists, and policymakers, many of whom continue to contend that the Cold War ended with Stalin or, certainly, under Khrushchev. They foresaw and generally applauded a convergence between democracy and socialism, and they adduced dtente under Brezhnev as evidence. In this view, Ronald Reagan caused a second Cold War, and Mikhail Gorbachev deserved every accolade as man of the decade. Noteworthy exceptions to revisionism --such as Robert Conquest, Richard Pipes, and Malia-- constitute a pilloried minority.<P255D>
<p>
According to Malia, the totalitarian model is more correct than the anti-totalitarian model. To qualify as a totalitarian dictatorship, the classic definition requires an elaborate ideology, a single mass party, terror, a technologically conditioned monopoly of communication, a monopoly of weapons, and a centrally controlled economy. Malia never disputes the totalitarian nature of the Soviet system. But he qualifies his approval of the totalitarian model, since the rigidity of this model does not explain well "the obvious mellowing of the Soviet system in the decades after Stalin's death."
<p>
Malia suggests that Eastern European intellectuals, such as Poland's Adam Michnik, and other survivors of communism supply the deficiencies of the totalitarian model. Eastern Europeans applied totalitarian to a regime in which total control was the basic aspiration, while realizing that such a regime did not have to (and could not) exercise total control over its population. Explains Malia: "It did not mean that such regimes were omnipotent in performance, but rather that they were omnicompetent in their institutional structure. In short, it was not Soviet society that was totalitarian; rather, it was the Soviet state." While seeing the whole of the totalitarian objective, it is possible to distinguish between the "high totalitarianism" of Stalin and the routine totalitarianism of Brezhnev.
<p>
Malia imparts a lucid history of Soviet domestic and foreign policies, which is especially detailed where newly released information bolsters his argument. Throughout his discussion, he threads a sophisticated analysis of the Hegelian and Marxist foundations to socialism. Academic or not, readers will benefit particularly from his assessments of 1939-1953, 1982-1988, and 1989-1991. Unlike most other Western Sovietologists, Malia grasps that the Cold War began in 1917, that the Soviet Union made great gains during World War II, and that the East-West conflict then hardened in the postwar era. He also verifies the impact of Reagan's policies on the USSR, including SDI as a "technological and economic challenge the Soviets could neither ignore nor match." To explain the death throws of the USSR, Malia draws the important distinction between the profound and proximate causes of the great crash of 1989-1991. He does not make the mistake of attributing the demise of the USSR only to internal economic factors; rather, he assays that economic decline and its discrediting of ideology are the most important proximate causes. It is crucial to see these proximate causes of the Soviet collapse as "parts of a pattern arising from the nature of that system itself." As Malia concludes, socialism was founded on the profound Myth of radical egalitarianism and then transformed into the Lie: "In sum, there is no such thing as socialism, and the Soviet Union built it."
<p>
For those not embroiled in the ongoing academic warfare over the Cold War, Malia's points may seem manifest. The documents that are now available vindicate his position. To date, however, Malia's book --with its combined understanding of the Soviet regime and its practices, its rise and fall, and its interpretersis unique in the study of the Cold War.

<center><h3><a name="introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h3></center>
	The Senate soon will vote on legislation authorizing $673 million in aid to Russia and the Newly Independent States (NIS) in FY 1996 and another $619 million in FY 1997.<p>

	In making this vote, the Senate will face some difficult choices. Foreign aid is more unpopular than ever, and aid to Russia, Ukraine, and other post-Soviet states is coming under heavy scrutiny. Moreover, U.S.-Russian cooperation is ebbing. Moscow's refusal to stop the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran has made it difficult to justify aid to Russia. So, too, has Russia's heavy-handed intervention in Chechnya.<p>

	Given these circumstances, Russian aid should be re-examined and applied to areas that not only make a difference, but also fit into an overall strategic plan. Properly applied, the transfer of market and democratic "know-how" can promote U.S. interests in the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union, increasing Russia's chances for a smooth transition to democracy and a free market. Therefore, Congress should continue aid to support the growth of democratic capitalism in Russia. This aid should be used to help democratic reformers, who face growing challenges from extremists. The most important programs in achieving this goal are those that develop market institutions, foster economic reform and privatization, and enhance the rule of law and democratic politics. <p>

	In addition, U.S. assistance in dismantling the former Soviet nuclear arsenal (the Nunn-Lugar program) should continue. Americans see reducing the Russian strategic threat as a worthwhile investment in U.S. security. However, this program should not be a sacred cow. The U.S. General Accounting Office and independent writers have reported serious flaws in this program, such as the use of U.S. taxpayers' funds for Russia's nuclear modernization and defense conversion. These flaws must be remedied. Congress should refocus the Nunn-Lugar program on its original purpose -- dismantling the Russian nuclear, chemical, and biological arsenal.<p>

	While fostering democratic capitalism in Russia serves U.S. national interests, many of the aid programs administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) do not. They often are poorly conceived and executed. For the last thirty years, AID and its traditional contractors have not worked in Eastern and Central Europe. Instead, they have operated in the Third World. As a result, AID officials and contractors lack the area and linguistic expertise needed to support the great post-communist transformation in Europe and the NIS. AID needs to upgrade its regional skills in the NIS, focus more of its efforts on developing democratic capitalism, and ensure that more aid funds go to Russian reformers, and not to American bureaucrats and experts.<p>

	As the Senate considers aid to Russia and the NIS, it should add conditions to this aid and refocus the program to make it more effective and relevant to the particular needs of its recipients. Specifically, the Senate should:<p>
<ul>
<li>Demand that the Administration suspend negotiations to reschedule the Russian and Soviet debt to Western creditors if the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is completed. The reactor sale is on hold pending negotiations between Vice President Al Gore and Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could block the Clinton Administration's agreement to reschedule Russia's debt if the sale to Iran goes through.<p>

<li>Condition U.S. support for IMF credits to the Russian government on a cease-fire in Chechnya. If Russia wants to be treated as a civilized member of the Western alliance, it must end the war in Chechnya. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could condition IMF or World Bank appropriations on the Russian government's compliance with a cease-fire and negotiations to settle the conflict in Chechnya.<p>

<li>Create an independent board to manage aid to Russia and the NIS. This board could set clear goals for U.S. aid to Russia and uphold democratic development as one of its top priorities. The Senate could help create this board by amending the foreign aid authorization bill.<p>

<li>Reprogram $225 million to develop democracy in Russia and the NIS by abolishing the Commodities Import Program (CIP) and the Russian Officer Resettlement Program. The $90 million CIP is a giveaway for U.S. businesses selling oil and gas technology to Russian industry. It should be eliminated and the funds used to further democracy in Russia, as should the $135 million earmarked for housing displaced Russian military officers. <p>

<li>Make democratic development a top priority. By amending the authorization bill, the Senate could demand that the Russian aid program focus exclusively on the development of democracy, the rule of law, and free markets. Many of AID's programs are unfocused, ineffective, and all too often intended to advance pet liberal causes, not democratic capitalism.<p>

<li>Target grants directly to democratic institutions in Russia and the NIS. Russians receive very little American help in fighting against human rights violations, media censorship, or racism, Most of the funds go to Americans purporting to help Russians, but Russian democrats can do far more with this money than American  "experts."<p>

<a name="seige"><h3><center>RUSSIAN DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISM UNDER SIEGE</h3></a></center>

	Russian democracy and free markets are in deep crisis. Ten years after the beginning of Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, members of the former Communist Party elite still control the levers of power in Moscow as well as in the provinces. They are also in charge of Russia's vast properties and natural resources. Chaotic privatization has given many former Communist Party officials personal ownership of factories and other assets over which they used to exercise only administrative control. <p>

	The influence of old Soviet bureaucracy extends to foreign trade, the privatization process, and the issuing of business licenses. Russians often say that government bureaucrats, not entrepreneurs, are the richest people in the land. This elite may have given up its Marxist slogans, but it remains deeply committed to state intervention, government regulation, and the unbridled exercise of power. More often than not, Russian nationalism is touted in place of Marxist internationalism as a cover for the same old thing --   personal greed. <p>

	Ordinary Russians are deeply and understandably disenchanted with the direction reforms have taken. The majority of the population has lost interest in the political process, as evidenced by the low turnout of less than 25 percent in the most recent local and regional elections.<p>

	Support for political extremists on both the left and right is growing. Moreover, an increasing number of voters have cast their ballots for Russian Communist Party (RCP) candidates in recent elections. Running on an anti-government, anti-establishment, and anti-corruption platform, the communists are a favorite for the December 1995 elections to the Duma, the lower house of Parliament.<p>

	The Military Wild Card. The Russian armed forces also are disenchanted with the reform process. They oppose a Western-style democracy for Russia and yearn for a ruler with a "strong hand."  Military troops voted heavily for ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky in December 1993. The armed forces today are polarized between the majority of the officer corps, who believe that the military is grossly mismanaged, and a small group of generals around Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who use their positions for personal enrichment. The Russian Army feels defeated and nostalgic for the Soviet period, when it enjoyed high status and large budgets. <p>

	This situation has been made worse by the war in Chechnya, in which tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have participated in killing citizens of their own country. In the 1980s, veterans of the Afghan war contributed to the swelling ranks of Russian organized crime. They also flooded the extremist nationalist movements. This could well be repeated after Chechnya, further destabilizing Russia's feeble democracy.<p>

	Authoritarian Renaissance. Democracy is under siege as well. The Yeltsin administration has done little to promote the rule of law in Russia. It rammed through the 1993 Constitution, establishing an "imperial" presidency with little but an advisory role for Parliament. Such democratic reformers as former Acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, Vice Prime Minister Gennadii Burbulis, Human Rights Commissioner Sergei Kovalev, Ethnic Policy Advisor Galina Starovoitova, and many others have been pushed out of the government. The most influential group in the Kremlin today includes Yeltsin's Chief of Bodyguards, General Alexander Korzhakov, and First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, who is in charge of the military-industrial complex. Even Yeltsin's Chief of Staff, Sergei Filatov, has complained that presidential aides are forced to communicate by writing notes to each other because their phones and rooms are wiretapped.<p>

	The political role and power of Russia's historically strong spy agencies are growing. In September 1994, the Foreign Intelligence Service, headed by KGB veteran General Evgenii Primakov, published its own policy statement advocating strengthened Russian domination of the whole area of the former Soviet Union, the so-called near abroad. According to Primakov's agency, Russia must re-consolidate all the Newly Independent States under its tutelage regardless of the West's opposition.<p>

	On April 6, 1995, President Yeltsin signed the State Duma law reorganizing the secret police, then called the Federal Counterintelligence Service and known by its Russian acronym, FSK (Federalnaya Sluzhba Kontrrazvedki). This agency, the successor to the Second Chief Directorate of the KGB, is now called the Federal Security Service (Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti, or FSB). It has been granted wide powers to conduct investigations and perform surveillance in total secrecy. The scope of its activities was broadened to cover a wide range of internal security threats ranging from organized crime to political extremism to corruption.<p>

	Threats to Free Media. The Yeltsin administration is tightening its control over the electronic media, especially the national television stations. The provincial media also are under heavy pressure from the local chiefs of administration, who have been pressured by Yeltsin to "toe the line."  In late 1993, former Pravda journalist Boris Mironov was appointed chairman of the State Committee on Press. Before he was fired in the fall of 1994, Mironov funneled huge subsidies to hard-line ultra-nationalist newspapers. "If to be a Russian nationalist means to be a fascist, then I am a fascist," he said.<p>

	Vlad Listyev, Director General of the largest Russian TV network and a popular talk show host, was gunned down in the entrance to his apartment building on March 1, 1995. On October 17, 1994, investigative reporter Dmitrii Kholodov of Moskovskii Komsomoletz was murdered by an exploding briefcase. Kholodov was investigating corruption in the military at the time. Others have been slain while investigating organized crime. Journalists in the regions have been tortured and killed. The print media are coming under increasing pressure, as the Moscow government owns printing presses and manipulates the prices of newsprint as well as subsidies to newspapers. <p>

	The Russian government continues to play a dubious role in the media scene. It refuses to privatize television stations and printing plants. The official newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta publishes anonymous attacks on Yeltsin's opponents, such as media tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky, who has been accused of launching a "putsch" against Yeltsin. Formerly allied with democratic presidential candidate Grigory Yavlinsky and Moscow mayor Yurii Luzhkov, Gusinsky is a political foe of a powerful group in Yeltsin's entourage. The State Duma thus far has failed to eliminate the right of the government to establish media outlets, while it has expanded the list of circumstances under which the government is empowered to shut them down.<p>

	Criminalization of Politics. Rising crime also is endangering democracy in Russia. The recent gangland-style murder of three Duma deputies may have been the work of professional hired killers. So far, no arrests have been made. Moreover, a senior Russian Interior Ministry expert warns against the growing influence of Russian mafiosi "among law enforcement organs and other organs of power."Whole areas of Russia are becoming the domain of organized crime. But the Yeltsin administration is notoriously ineffective in fighting crime and corruption. Despite draconian decrees, known criminal figures remain unpunished and free to penetrate the Russian body politic. At the same time, the hard-liners are exploiting the public's fear of lawlessness to advance their own political goals.<p>

	Organized crime is reaching the highest echelons of power. In the summer of 1994, a Moscow mafia don, Otari Kvantrishvili, was killed by a sniper's bullet. Kvantrishvili headed a powerful political party, Sportsmen of Russia, which was better organized and financed than some legitimate parties represented in the Duma. A prominent criminal, Vladimir Podatev from Khabarovsk, nicknamed "the Poodle," is launching a national political career by becoming a member of the Presidential Public Chamber Human Rights Commission. Podatev is also the leader of a local political movement called Unity, a first step toward attaining office in a national election.<p>

	The Fascist Threat. Extremist Russian nationalism, often identified as neo-Nazism or fascism, is another threat to Russian democracy. The nationalists comprise a broad spectrum, from Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party, which is well-represented in the Duma, to the National Republican Party of Nicholas Lysenko, who was elected to the Duma by a St. Petersburg district. Zhirinovsky's delegates comprise 22 percent of the State Duma. Altogether, the nationalists are expected to get over 30 percent of the vote in the December 1995 elections.<p>

	Nationalists also find political support from Gennadii Ziuganov's communists and Vladimir Barkashov's Russian National Unity movement. The nationalists are united in their hatred of the United States and the West. Some are anti-Semitic, while others passionately hate dark-skinned "Caucasians" -- Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, and Central Asians.<p>

	Russian fascists are involved in extensive paramilitary training programs, conducted with the full knowledge and complacent inaction of the authorities. One of their most important leaders, judo black belt Vladimir Barkashov, claims to have 10,000 well-trained fighters under his command. The Russian security services put this number at 2,000. Other organizations, such as Zhirinovsky's Falcons, the Werewolf Legion, the National Republicans, and Pamyat, have from several dozen to several hundred stormtroopers each.<p>

	Unfortunately, some officials in Russia's law enforcement agencies, including KGB spin-offs, the police, and even the prosecutor's office, often sympathize with and support political extremists. Defectors from Barkashov's organization warn that a deliberate attempt by the neo-Nazis to penetrate the military and security services is under way.<p>

	Russian law enforcement and security services are incompetent in fighting ultra-nationalists as they are in combating organized crime. For example, the police failed to keep Alexei Vedenkin, a prominent Russian fascist, in pre-trial detention after he pledged on national television to kill Duma Defense Committee Chairman Sergei Yushenkov and Yeltsin Human Rights Commissioner Sergei A. Kovalev. After two weeks in jail, he was released by a Moscow judge on a technicality. Meanwhile, Vedenkin's Russian National Movement has bought up a large packet of shares in the Siren Three consortium, which will control plane ticket reservations all over Russia and the former Soviet Union.<p>


<a name="nis"><h3><center>WHY AID RUSSIA AND THE NIS?</h3>
</a></center>
	Despite the rocky road to reform, Russia has not reverted to its old-style totalitarian ways. Nor is it an ultra-nationalist dictatorship. Despite the chaos of its transition, there are reasons for hope. Privatization has allowed many Russians to acquire or start small businesses. Others have become owners of Soviet-era factories. More Russians are employed today in the private sector than at any time since 1917. The reforms in Ukraine are about to take hold. The nascent capital markets and commodity exchanges are breeding rough-and-tumble capitalists -- the kind that build personal fortunes. The entrepreneurial class is more involved in politics than ever. Pressure to formalize the legal infrastructure needed to conduct business is growing.<p>

	Political pluralism also is growing. There are at least ten large political parties or movements in Russia. In addition, dozens of political parties will compete in the December 1995 elections. The independent media are providing blunt and courageous coverage of Chechnya, despite government attempts to manipulate them. While some Russians yearn for a "strong hand," 70 percent want democratic elections and a free press. Moreover, support for reforms is highest where it matters most -- among urban educated citizens under the age of 35.<p>

	Nor has Russia embarked upon a Bolshevik-style retaking of the former Russian empire as it did under Lenin and Stalin. The Russian military is bogged down in Chechnya and Central Asia. Despite calls from nationalists to rebuild the USSR, ineptitude and corruption in the army and the lack of popular will to pay the price do not bode well for Russian revanchists. After Chechnya, the Russian leadership probably will think twice before ordering tanks into any other rebellious area. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's repeated attempts to distance himself from the fiasco in the Caucasus, and the Duma's     relentless attacks on President Yeltsin over Chechnya, indicate that Russia's elites are  seeking new ways to settle political crises.<p>

	Almost eighty years ago the West abandoned Russia to the Bolsheviks. Today, it is in America's interest to encourage Russia to follow a new direction and make its domestic and international behavior more benign. At the same time, the U.S. should support the independence and viability of the other post-Soviet states as a balance against a possible Russian resurgence. Reformers in Moscow, Kiev, and other parts of the NIS have asked repeatedly not only for technical assistance to build democratic and market institutions, but also for support of non-governmental alternatives to state services and functions. Properly implemented, U.S. assistance should be fulfilling these needs. <p>

	The crisis of Russian democracy is deep, but there is hope. U.S. assistance to democrats in Russia and parts of the NIS possibly could help end this crisis. Without U.S. aid, however, it will only get worse.<p>


<a name="bird"><h3><center>AID'S INEFFECTIVE PROGRAMS:<br> TOO MUCH BIG BIRD, TOO LITTLE DEMOCRACY</h3>
</a></center>
	Saying that aid can make a difference in Russia is one thing. Saying that current aid programs are doing the job is another. Many current U.S. aid programs to Russia and the NIS are not doing the job. They are often ineffective and should be reorganized. As the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has noted: <p>

	[M]uch of AID's technical assistance effort in the New Independent States and Central and Eastern Europe has produced little positive result. Closed procurement practices and AID's own lack of experience in the region has too often led to the awarding of contracts to organizations who themselves have little regional or area competence. In many instances, AID has relied on its network of contractors which have experience in the poorest developing nations. The result has often been wasteful expenditures on contractor field office infrastructure, poor recruitment of participants and expensive, and misdirected short-term training in the United States which has had negative impact on NIS professionals participating in the program.<p>

	Certainly the problem has not been lack of money. Congress has appropriated almost $3.7 billion in aid to Russia since the assistance program began in 1992. Out of these funds, AID obligated $2.5 billion, but only $1.2 billion has been spent. In addition, only $126 million was obligated and $49 million spent on "democratic pluralism initiatives" in the whole of the NIS (see Appendix). Funds for building democracy in the NIS comprised only about 5 percent of AID's total budget; by contrast, management costs make up about 5 percent to 10 percent. Clearly, promoting democracy is AID's budgetary stepchild.<p>

	While some AID programs are successful, many are expensive, lack a coherent overall strategy, and are ill-conceived and poorly executed. For example, not a single U.S. law school or law office received AID funds to execute an AID-sponsored program in the NIS. Yet establishing the rule of law is one of the most important prerequisites of democracy. AID's rule of law program has been severely criticized by legal professionals both in Russia and the U.S. They argue that too few lawyers, lawmakers, judges, and prosecutors have been involved to make a significant impact. The program does not sponsor the long-term education of Russian lawyers in U.S. law schools. Nor has AID succeeded in placing a significant number of American legal advisors in Russian ministries, the Duma, or the Supreme and Constitutional Courts. American jurists have had precious little impact on Russian legislation and regulations.<p>

	Instead of providing adequate support for rule of law programs, what has AID been doing?  Funding Big Bird in Russia. Despite the fact that Russia already produces superb children's films and television programs, AID has granted $2 million to the Children's Television Workshop, a money-making venture affiliated with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, to produce a Russian version of the American TV program Sesame Street. Why does a group like CTW, which is worth millions, need taxpayer money to set up shop in Russia?  And what does giving exposure to the Russian-speaking equivalent of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch have to do with developing democracy and the rule of law? <p>


<a name="capitalism"><h3><center>SUPPORTING DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISM IN RUSSIA</h3></a></center>

	Properly focused and administered, aid to Russia and the NIS serves American interests. AID could help prevent Russia from becoming a crime-ridden "mafiacracy," a source of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons proliferation, and a destabilizing factor in the global financial and commodities markets. Many Russian democrats wish for the same things. <p>

	In order to assist the transformation to democratic capitalism in Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet republics, the Senate should:<p>
<ul>
<li>Demand that the Administration suspend negotiations to reschedule the Russian and Soviet debt to Western creditors if the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is completed. The nuclear sale was the topic of discussions between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin at their May summit in Moscow. The two agreed to refer the matter to the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission for further negotiation. During those negotiations, Vice President Gore should make it clear that the U.S. and Russia cannot have a normal and friendly relationship if the sale goes through. <p>
</ul>
	In the meantime, Russia wants a sweeping rescheduling of half its $130 billion debt to the West by the end of this year. At the same time, Yeltsin asked the G-7 leaders at the Halifax summit in June to accept Russia into the Paris Club as a creditor to Third World countries for their Soviet-era debts. This is an opportunity for the U.S. Senate to demand Russia's cancellation of the Iranian nuclear deal. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could demand that Russia's debt not be rescheduled if the deal goes through. The U.S. could relax access to its nuclear and commercial satellite launch markets for Russian companies as compensation for canceling the Iranian transaction. <p>
<ul>
<li>Condition U.S. support for IMF credits to the Russian government on cease-fire in Chechnya. The U.S. cannot and should not challenge the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. Like any other state, Russia has the right to ensure its sovereignty. However, this right does not justify the extreme means employed against the people of Chechnya. Other measures short of war should have been taken. For example, a Federal Treaty model, which is working in the case of Moscow's relations with Tatarstan, was not seriously tried in Chechnya.<p>
</ul>
	Last spring, the U.S. supported $6.6 billion in International Monetary Fund credits to Russia. In view of Moscow's intransigence in Chechnya, the Congress should condition any future U.S. support for IMF financial assistance on a cease-fire and negotiations to settle the conflict. The U.S. should demand that all hostilities be stopped, especially those affecting innocent civilians, and that negotiations be successfully concluded, either bilaterally or through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Until such time, the Senate should consider amending the foreign aid authorization bill to demand that the U.S. suspend its financial assistance to Russia through such multilateral organizations as the IMF, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank. This position would strengthen the hand of Russians who are calling for an end to the hostilities in Chechnya and for a negotiated solution.<p>
<ul>
<li>Create an independent board to manage aid to Russia and the NIS. AID has poorly managed U.S. aid programs for the NIS. An independent board, nominated jointly by Congress and the President, should take over the management of these programs and refocus them on building democratic capitalism in the NIS. (A modified board for all assistance projects was suggested by Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), but was voted down in committee.) This board could include representatives from the State and Commerce Departments as well as area experts and representatives of the U.S. corporations involved in the NIS.<p></ul>

	There is precedent for creating such a board. The presidentially appointed Board of International Broadcasting (BIB) for forty years successfully administered Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Members of this nonpartisan board included such prominent Americans as Malcolm Forbes, Jr., James Buckley, Frank Shakespeare, and Lane Kirkland.<p>
<ul>
<li>Reprogram $225 million to develop democracy in Russia and the NIS by abolishing the Commodities Import Program (CIP) and the Russian Officer Resettlement Program. Under the CIP, $90 million worth of U.S.-made oil and gas equipment is to be given to Russia's most profitable industry, the hydrocarbon energy sector. The program should be abolished. The CIP is supposed to improve the Russian balance of payments and to assist in repaying Russia's debt to Western creditors by allowing Russia, with U.S. support, to drill for and sell more oil in the world market. AID bureaucrats hope that more productive American equipment will boost the Russian state-run energy sector. However, all the CIP would do is prop up the inefficient state-owned Russian energy industry. Experience in Russia shows that Western equipment alone is not a panacea. Capital investment, such as CIP-funded equipment, will not alleviate the problems of systemic mismanagement that plague the Russian oil and gas industry. Only privatization and massive Western investment will resolve the problem once and for all. The funds saved from abolishing CIP should be reprogrammed into democracy-building programs.<p></ul>

	So, too, should funds from the program to build housing for Russian military officers. Under orders from President Yeltsin, the Russian army participated in the slaughter of civilians in Chechnya. The funding for Russian officer resettlement was cut by the House Foreign Operations Subcommittee this spring. The Senate restored this funding in conference, but reduced it from the $155 million requested by the Clinton Administration to $135 million. This money would be spent better on democracy-building programs. <p>
<ul>
<li>Make democratic development a top priority. Thus far, AID's Democratic Initiatives Program is unfocused and suffers from hidden agendas. For example, AID will spend $500,000 on a program administered by Winrock International to enhance the "development and operation of a united group of women's NGOs in Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. to facilitate interaction, cooperation and collaboration in the building of a democratic society in the former Soviet Union."  Russia needs to build democratic institutions and the rule of law. It does not need American liberals telling Russians how to organize feminist groups.<p></ul>

	Far more important would be programs that train Russians to run election campaigns and organize grass-roots groups and referenda. This aid should be given to such democratic parties as Russia's Choice, Yabloko, and the Economic Freedom Party. Public organizations involved in significant reform of legislative and judicial bodies or in public education, such as the Foundation for Parliamentary Development and the newly established Anti-Fascist Foundation, also deserve support.<p>

	U.S.-funded programs need to employ qualified Russian reformers, who understand their politics and culture far better than AID contractors with little experience in Russia. Most AID democracy development programs have been awarded to traditional contractors who know more about AID's lengthy and complex contracting process than they do about Russia, Ukraine, and other NIS countries. Russians and Americans living in Moscow complain that these contractors spend large amounts of AID money to "educate" themselves about the problems. Why hand out perks to friends of AID bureaucrats when Russian democrats could do the job for less money?<p>

	To focus aid programs on building democracy in the NIS, Congress should establish priorities for democratic assistance. Funds should go to Russian and American organizations that:<p>
<ul>
<li>Train Russians and other NIS citizens to run and manage elections and electoral campaigns;<p>

<li>Foster the use of public opinion research;<p>

<li>Help organize democratic grass-roots organizations;<p>

<li>Educate Russians in fundraising techniques;<p>

<li>Develop political parties;<p>

<li>Develop Western-style academic programs in law, business, and market economics;<p>

<li>Use the existing legal system to prosecute neo-Nazis for violations of laws;<p>

<li>Post Western legal advisors in the legislatures, government ministries, regional administrations, the court system, and the Attorney General's office;<p>

<li>Help develop administrative law that allows citizens to challenge central and local governments in the courts;<p>

<li>Work to develop constitutional law;<p>

<li>Draft democratic legislation;<p>

<li> Assist in law enforcement, such as setting up neighborhood watches, anti-crime hotlines, and witness relocation programs; and <p>

<li>Train legislators, judges, and lawyers in the rule of law.<p>

<li>Target grants directly to democratic institutions in Russia. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could direct more funds into democracy-building programs administered by the Eurasia Foundation and National Endowment for Democracy. The Eurasia Foundation and NED directly fund Russian grass-roots organizations, like the Memorial Society, which is fighting against human rights violations in Chechnya, and the Glasnost Foundation, which promotes the reform of Russia's secret services. These are examples of organizations that deserve Western support. Private American institutions such as The Heritage Foundation, the Krieble Institute, and the Soros Foundation have accumulated experience in working with Russian institutions and could help identify appropriate recipients and personnel for targeted U.S. assistance.<p></ul>


<h3><a name="conclusion"><center>CONCLUSION</a></h3></center>

	Russian democracy is in a danger zone. While U.S. aid alone cannot save democracy in Russia, it certainly can improve its chance of surviving. Clearly, America has an interest in a democratic Russia. Assisting Russia's transition to democracy is as important as were the de-Nazification of Germany and the reforming of Japan after World War II. But the Clinton Administration has failed to rise to the challenge. Time is running out. U.S. aid programs need to be refocused not on the traditional development goals of the foreign aid bureaucracy, but on building democracy and free markets.<p>

AID'S DEMOCRACY PROGRAMS IN THE NIS

	The AID-funded Democratic Pluralism Initiatives Project includes the following programs:  Political Development, Rule of Law, Public Administration/Local Government, and Civil Society and Media. <p>

	The strategic aim of these programs is to accelerate NIS transition to democracy and a market economy. Their task is to strengthen civil society and its institutions, train market specialists and civic leaders, and encourage the transition to a more benign political culture. <p>

	Following is a brief summary of the major AID initiatives in the NIS. <p>

	Political Development Program. A large part of the AID funding in this program goes to the two U.S. party institutes. Since 1992 the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute have received over $10 million each. These institutes fund seminars and education for political party activists, conferences, and exchanges. The International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) has received over $6 million. It is involved in training for and supervision of electoral processes. The AFL-CIO's Free Trade Union Institute has received $3.5 million. Other organizations, from the New York-based Freedom House to Indiana University, have received grants that as a rule are less than $1 million.<p>

	The Rule of Law. These programs are executed by three contractors. The largest contract, worth over $18 million, is in the hands of ARD/Checchi and Company, a traditional AID contractor. Other awards amounting to $5.6 million have gone to the American Bar Association's Central and East European Law Initiative. The Central Asian component of the Rule of Law program, worth $5.5 million, was awarded to yet another traditional AID contractor, Chemonics. These contractors provide a variety of services, from commenting on legislative drafts to jury trial training and the education of judges and prosecutors.<p>

	Public Administration and Local Government. This program is administered by the Research Triangle Institute ($19.5 million), World Learning ($2.2 million), and several smaller contractors. The program focuses on bringing Russian and NIS local officials and professionals to the U.S. to learn the techniques of city management.<p>

	Civil Society and Media. This program funds such media projects as Internews, a Moscow-based independent TV news production operation.<p>

CORRUPTION IN RUSSIA: 

NO DEMOCRACY WITHOUT MORALITY</h2><br>



<h3>By Barbara von der Heydt1</h3>
</center><p>
Corruption threatens to strangle the new democracy of the former Soviet Union in its infancy. <i>Glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i> have been replaced by <i>naglost</i> (brazen insolence) and <i>perestrelka</i> (shootouts). Whether order based on both freedom and responsibility can emerge from the rubble of collapsed communism is an open question. There is no rule of law, no clear definition of property rights, no genuine democracy or market economy for most of the newly freed peoples. 

<p>

Criminal elements have joined forces with the corrupt bureaucrats of the old guard to form networks of collusion. The old <i>nomenklatura</i> still have a chokehold on the country; they may have new business cards, but they are still in power.2  Corruption extends from the police through the courts, into the highest levels of the present government, confirms Alexander Gurov, director of a security research institute at the Ministry of Security, formerly the KGB. "Before, the criminals tried to influence officials with bribes," says Gurov. "Today they already have their own lobby in the government and the parliament -- not to mention the police and the prosecutor's office."3
<p>
Duma experts have issued a report estimating that 25 to 30 percent of the members who will be elected to the parliament in the coming December elections will represent influence of the criminal structures, either openly or covertly, and will be a significant force capable of influencing policy decisions to benefit the mafia.4  No real economic or political force is capable of implementing an anti-corruption campaign, because it is increasingly difficult either to do business without encountering illegal or corrupt practices or to get elected without the money they produce.

<p>

What Russians call the <i>mafiya</i> is a generic term encompassing organized crime, although it is not one organization under a "godfather."  Those operating in the shadow economy are outside the boundaries of legality, but there are varying shades of gray. Not all of those outside the law are involved in extracting or paying protection money. 

<p>



<b>A Moral Vacuum</b>

<p>

The explosion of criminality, corruption, and mafia activity is evidence of a moral crisis of major dimensions. When communism collapsed, it left behind the legacy of a moral vacuum, claim many Russians. What fills this vacuum will determine the future of Russia. Even though half the Russian populace lives in poverty today, the moral needs are even more acute than the economic ones. As economist and former St. Petersburg legislator Mikhail Dmitriev observed, "The economic problems are not a crisis. Give us ten years and we'll be a normal country. But the moral crisis is far more serious."5
<p>
The Communist Party and its ideology of Marxism-Leninism were the source of collective moral authority. Now that the ideology has been rejected, its subjects are cut free of any moral mooring. Russians characterize the result as total disorientation. Alexander Zaichenko, former economic advisor to Mikhail Gorbachev, describes the lingering socialist malaise as "collective responsibility and individual irresponsibility."6  Under the communist regime, "There was a strict but hypocritical code of behavior," claims Evgueni Volk of the Heritage Foundation's Moscow office. "Everyone knew what he was eligible to steal."7  Now there is "freedom with neither responsibility nor morality," says Alexander Mitroshenkov, editor of Poesk.8 
<p>
The result is visible in Russia's prisons, where detainees wait for a trial in cells so overcrowded that they can sleep, sit, or stand only in shifts. The Deputy Director of the Russian Federal Prison System, Valery Orlov, reflects on the explosion of criminality:  "In a law-abiding person, there is something holy left. If it is absent, he turns to robbery, crime, violence, and murder, mainly for material gain. Such a person doesn't feel responsible for his own actions."9

<p>
<b>Communism's Poisonous Legacy</b><p>
Alexander Solzhenitsyn claims that the communist system was deforming, destroying the personality to make it governable. The legacy of communism is the poison left in its former subjects. Vaclav Havel, in his New Year's address in 1990, made the diagnosis:  "We have become morally ill because we have become accustomed to saying one thing and thinking another."  The children of communism learned to speak one way among family and closest friends, and another way outside the inner circle. The result is "moral schizophrenia." 

<p>

In the introduction to <i>Remaking Russia</i>, an intriguing collection of contemporary thought from Russia's leading publicists and scholars, Richard Pipes writes, "[I]t can be argued that Russia's gravest problems are not economic.... Communism's most ruinous legacy lies in the moral and psychological sphere:  economic failures appear as a consequence rather than cause of Russia's current predicament."10 
<p>
Mikhail Dmitriev diagnoses the traits in his own nation:  "The legacy of totalitarianism in human character is a combination of personal irresponsibility and aggression. Everything was decided from above, and there was no risk-taking. Now the people are not capable of combining risk-taking and responsibility." 

<p>

Russian writer Fazil Iskander claims, "The transition from a rather enduring totalitarian regime to democracy has brought unimaginable psychological difficulties along with it. Under a totalitarian regime, it was as if you were forced to live in the same room with a violently insane man.... Many people in Russia have been gripped by anguish, rage, and an all-encompassing suspiciousness."11 
<p>
People who had reason not to trust under the old regime find it hard to do so today. Those who were absolved of responsibility before often find it a burden now. People denied the opportunity to make decisions earlier are paralyzed now when they must decide; socialism bred passivity and penalized personal initiative. People who have never lived in an open society have little practice in resolving conflicts peacefully. The ideology which preached hatred and class struggle sowed seeds of strife, suspicion, and confrontation. If there are no moral boundaries from within, and no external limits, all things are permitted. Those who lived in what Solzhenitsyn called the "culture of the lie" find it hard to live transparent lives in harmony with truth.12   
<p>
Among the most alarming symptoms of sickness are those in young people. Young Russians were asked last year what professions they would like to pursue. A majority answered they would prefer racketeering and prostitution because they could "earn hard currency, travel and meet people."  In a poll of Russian children this spring, they were asked what would prevent them from stealing. Of 100, 99 answered they would be afraid of getting caught. One said he would not steal because it is wrong.

<p>



<b>Democracy Is Not Enough</b>

<p>

	In the absence of internal law of the human heart, no laws of a state can create good citizens or a good society. As Edmund Burke observed, those who are not governed from within must be governed from without. In the absence of moral renewal in Russia, the institutions of democracy and a market economy cannot take root and flourish. Corruption will choke them. Democratic institutions are value neutral and no guarantee of wise or moral policy. They must be filled by the character of a nation. Sociologist Mikhail Tarusin makes the crucial point: 

<blockquote>

	Democracy is only an outward form, which can be used for good or evil. Hitler came to power democratically, and so could Zhirinovsky. .. .. .. If we don't have the moral tradition, we have no future.13 
</blockquote>
No sustained period in the history of Russia has permitted ownership of private property and fostered the responsibility to manage it or one's life autonomously. Neither a reliable framework of laws nor the moral foundations of a market economy and democracy are evident in Russian culture today, although brief flowerings are to be found in the country's history.
<p>
In <i>Remaking Russia</i>, Vyacheslav Ivanov asserts, "What is lacking above all is the legal, ethical, and psychological basis necessary to establish new market relations. Without fundamental change, the feeling of instability, giving rise to fraud and frustration, will persist."14  As the chaos increases, so do the calls for a "strongman" to impose order.

<p>
<b>Deadly Consequences of Corruption </b>
<p>
Evidence of corruption and collaboration with organized crime abounds. According to a report prepared for Boris Yeltsin by the Analytical Center for Social and Economic Policies, three quarters of Russia's private enterprises pay 10 percent to 20 percent of what they earn to criminal organizations.15  Some 40,000 state and privately run companies, including most of the country's banks, are controlled by 150 criminal syndicates.16  Altogether there are as many as 3,000 to 5,000 gangs.17  Known generically as the <i>mafiya</i>, these interlocking bands of organized crime exercise control over their own specific regions of a given city, a region of the country, and a segment of the economy. Some specialize in forging documents, others in drug and weapons trafficking, illegal monetary transactions, auto theft, prostitution, smuggling of raw materials and military hardware, extortion, bribery, and executions.18
<p>
Paying protection money to them has become a normal cost of doing business for many. Those who refuse to pay may discover an auto bomb, an arsonist, a kidnapper, or an assassin's bullet waiting for them. 
<p>
Politicians vowing to crack down on crime have become its victims. Three members of the Russian Duma have been shot in gangland-style executions. The leader of the Christian-Liberal Party of Crimea was executed in June 1994, as was his successor two months later. The Chairman of the National-Democratic Party of Georgia was gunned down in December 1994.19   
<p>
Those who have uncovered corruption and brought it to light publicly have done so at their peril. Vladislav Listyev, Russia's popular TV journalist, who had recently been appointed executive director of Russian Public Television, was gunned down March 2 this year. Listyev had begun revising policies on advertising revenues to break the "circle of corruption."20  No traces of the hitmen have been found. As one Muscovite observed wryly, "Who wants to investigate Listyev's death?  He will be next."
<p>
When the 27-year-old journalist Dimitri Kholodov pursued the whiff of corruption, he discovered evidence of illegal arms sales by the Red Army forces withdrawing from Germany. His investigation led him to the top:  Matvei Burlakov, former commander in chief of the forces in Germany, to the military intelligence, and to Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. On October 17, 1994, the journalist was murdered with a booby-trapped briefcase he had been told contained incriminating evidence. The killers have not been found. The Moskovsky Komsomolyets has charged Grachev and other top military officers with complicity in Kholodov's assassination.

<p>

Corruption among the police is rampant. When a new Russian car was stolen this May in Moscow several days after a Duma advisor purchased it, he reported it to the local police. They advocated getting in touch with the criminal elements in his region, suggesting that he could get the car back by paying half its original purchase price. The police offered to help him contact the mafia. This kind of maneuver has become standard procedure, confirm other Russians.21  Rings of auto thieves in Europe smuggle cars from Germany to Poland, or into the Czech Republic -- so many that insurance companies have placed agents on site to purchase cars back from the mob. 

<p>



<b>Violent and Economic Crime Rising</b>

<p>

The Russian Ministry of the Interior reports that in 1994 violent crime increased, as did economic crime. Police recorded 5,000 murders in Moscow alone in 1993; there were 10 percent more in 1994. Kidnappings increased threefold last year, with 272 cases in Moscow alone. Smuggling rose dramatically, 13 times the amount discovered in 1993. Illegal currency transactions were up 60 percent. Three times as many investors were deceived in 1994, losing $4 billion worth of investments.22  More than 14,000 persons were reported missing last year, feared to have been killed by gangs who duped them into signing over rights to their privatized apartments in return for lifetime support. These victims, many of them elderly women, simply disappeared.23  Some 16,600 cases of criminal activity by government officials were reported for 1994, about a third of them involving bribery. However, these statistics on crime most certainly represent only a fraction of the reality. 

<p>

The report by the Russian Ministry of the Interior also documents threatened acts of sabotage for ransom in 1994. A criminal band demanded $1 million not to poison the city water system of the town of Vladimir. In Maikop, bandits demanded $100,000 not to blow up a hospital. In both cases, the criminals were arrested and the act thwarted, but the potential for such future threats is obvious and chilling. 

<p>

Former KGB agents are now employed in industrial intelligence, peddling their information to the highest bidder. Military weapons are routinely stolen and sold to gangsters:  nearly 6,500 cases of such theft were reported in 1993, including machine guns, hand grenades, and explosives.24  More menacing yet are the attempts of organized crime to steal nuclear material for sale on the international black market. Mikhail Yegorov, head of the organized crime department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, acknowledges 47 investigations into attempts to steal radioactive materials in Russia.25  However, German intelligence sources estimate the number of sales of nuclear material from former Warsaw Pact countries and the former Soviet Union at "between 300 and 350."26
<p>
Natural resources such as timber, oil, and precious metals have been hemorrhaging over the borders of Russia. The Russian Interior Ministry claims smuggling of oil and other resources jumped 50 percent from 1992 to 1993.27  Copper, nickel, and cobalt are bought up at subsidized local prices and spirited over the borders for lucrative sales abroad. Although Estonia produces no metal, enough passed through it in 1993 to make the tiny country one of the world's largest metal exporters.28

<p>
<b>The Geese That Lay Golden Eggs</b>
<p>
It is no accident that laws limiting such activities have not been passed in Russia. There is a substantial segment of the existing power structure which benefits from these transactions. The first people to profit from "privatization" were party functionaries who seized profitable capacities for themselves, rechristening them with new names to sound like Western firms. The Russian newspaper Golos claims 80 percent of the joint ventures involve former KGB officers. Organized crime has linked arms with the old guard and new legislators to protect these geese which lay golden eggs. 

<p>

Those under mafia protection can circumvent the prohibitive taxes, which can take 80 percent of income all told. At those rates, a mafia contract for 10 percent to 20 percent looks like a godsend. Confiscatory tax rates are one of the strongest incentives toward collusion with the mafia. With total tax levels between 55 percent and 80 percent of net income, and theoretically up to 120 percent of profits, no one in their right mind pays all the taxes that are due. Because the mafia net extends into the offices that review tax collection, and into the banks which extend credit, the squeeze to collaborate is inexorable.

<p>

The problems facing Russia are acute, if not overwhelming. In order to encourage stable reform in Russia, it is necessary to identify short-, medium-, and long-term strategy to combat criminality and encourage the growth of a healthy society. No amount of aid will be sufficient to solve Russia's problems. The fundamental problems must be addressed from within. Rather than trying for a "quick fix," the U.S. should acknowledge that major change in the former Soviet Union may be measurable in generations rather than years.

<p>

There are three levels where action is needed:  immediate measures Russians can take, measures the U.S. can take, and U.S.-Russian cooperative efforts.

<p>



<b>What Russians Can Do Now</b>

<p><ul>

<li>Reform tax laws to non-confiscatory levels. As long as total tax rates hover between 55 percent and 80 percent, the incentive to collaborate with the mafia to avoid them will remain exceedingly attractive. 



<li>Define property rights and enforce them. Ownership of the land on which buildings stand is still enshrouded in legal fog in Russia, permitting authorities to act arbitrarily in collusion with criminal elements. 



<li>Pass new legislation on banking and securities. The laws of three years ago are long outdated in light of the rapidly changing economic situation. Until the law is up to date, unscrupulous operators will continue to dupe investors. 



<li>Penalize fraud and aggression. Only a fraction of the criminals are apprehended, and fewer yet actually tried and sentenced. If there are no consequences for crime, it will continue to increase. 



<li>Require public disclosure of public servants' income. At present, bureaucrats on the take can easily collect illegal income and bribes with no fear of revealing sources. 



<li>Protect witnesses. At present, there is no provision to encourage truthfulness among those who know of corruption but have good reason to remain silent. 



<li>Increase cooperation across international borders in apprehending criminals, weapons, nuclear material, and drugs. Sophisticated criminals benefit from the snafus between international law enforcement agencies.

</ul>

<p>



<b>What the U.S. Can Do Now</b>

<p>

U.S. efforts to help Russia at the government level have not been effective. Representatives Richard Gephardt (D-MO) and Robert Michel (R-IL) delivered tough criticism last year, complaining "there remains a yawning gap between America's good intentions and the actual performance of our assistance programs."29  Delays, personnel problems, and bickering have thwarted assistance. Exacerbating the problem is AID's inexperience in this region of the world and its slow learning curve. AID's experience in Africa is not transferable; nor are most of its usual contractors appropriate.30 
<p>
Delivering the goods in Russia is no easy task. Much humanitarian aid and funding for training programs have disappeared into black holes of corruption. The old structures which ruled Russia before are virtually all still in place. They were corrupt before and still are. Few Westerners have taken the time and effort to dig down into a given institution to discover an honest person at the middle level who can be trusted. Large grants to public institutions are almost certain to end up in the Swiss bank accounts of the top administrators and not in the hands of those intended to benefit. Conversely, hefty consulting fees to Westerners have enriched them, but seldom helped the Russians in need.

<p><ul>

<li>The entire strategy of assistance must be revamped, based on personal accountability and cultural prudence. Much of what has been done through foreign aid should be privatized. There are organizations in the private sector which have years of experience in Russia; they should be called on in contracting assistance for the Newly Independent States.31  A partnership between the public and private sectors is needed, with the emphasis on mobilizing the private sector both in the U.S. and in the NIS.

<li>Train Russian police, lawyers, and judges in the moral foundations of a rule of law. Nowhere in their educational system was there such training available, and there is an acute shortage of qualified personnel. Western legal foundations have the resources to train promising Russians and to assist in drafting new law needed now. More student scholarships are needed, as are programs to retrain professionals. Reaching out through legal foundations in Russia like that of Duma advisor Anatoly Pchelintsev is a place to start.32 

<li>Train Russian entrepreneurs in the moral foundations of a market economy. As long as business ethics is an oxymoron, the economy will remain a jungle. Economist Alexander Zaichenko trains businessmen in the principles of organization, but also exhorts them to deal honestly. Zaichenko is building groups for "Fair and Ethical Business" to help them help each other preserve integrity. His protegees have succeeded in setting up new businesses and creating jobs.33  The Canadian government has lauded his group as the most effective of ten they have funded. His organization needs computers and Western investors looking for reliable Russian partners.

<li>Target loans to Russian businessmen of integrity with accountability. The approach of Enterprise Development International in granting microloans to budding businesses puts the incentives in the right place. The Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE) is advancing private enterprise and market institutions which support democratic development. Encouraging self-sufficient small businesses will create jobs and opportunities in a country struggling to make the transition from a planned economy.



<li>Create "Spheres of Integrity" in the economy. This intriguing concept was developed by Czechs to break the stronghold of corruption there. Business associates make a covenant with each other to honor contracts and deal honestly, even if it is not possible in the rest of the outside world.34  Where there is light, the darkness recedes.
</ul><p>
The same principle applies to focusing aid to a limited number of geographic regions where the U.S. can make a difference. A country stretching over ten time zones is too big to help with diffuse efforts. Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Vladivostok, and the Ural mountains region are good candidates for focused efforts.

<p>

German assistance to the former Soviet Union has taken this approach. Undersecretary of the Interior Horst Waffenschmidt has concentrated aid on six regions, building up an infrastructure with honest partners to create "<i>Insel der Hoffnung</i>," or "Islands of Hope."

<p><ul>

<li>Help television transmit the values underpinning democracy. Russian bureaucrats are dragging their feet to privatize their media. Former dissident Mikhail Kazachkov has founded "Freedom Channel-Persona" for broadcasting in Russia. Endorsed by Yelena Bonner, this team produces award-winning programming to lay the foundations of a free society. Highly motivated, professional, and effective, this group focuses on principles like respect for the individual in developing a pluralistic civil society. They need broadcast equipment and program funding to establish a Russian version of C-SPAN. They have applied for AID assistance, but in vain. 



<li>Use the Russian media to tell the story of freedom. Russian newspapers are willing to run articles on the foundations of democracy and the market economy, and on morality. German businessman Waldemar Murjahn has placed articles on the Christian roots of morality in such newspapers as <i>Argumenti i Fakti, Komsomolskaya Pravda, Literaturnaya Gazeta</i>, and <i>Poesk</i>. The combined press runs total one billion, and the costs were modest.



<li>Keep the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on the air. Anybody who thought the job was over when communism collapsed is wrong. Restructuring the post-communist order is at least as tough as opposing communism, and there is no blueprint. An entire culture is seeking reorientation. What passes for democracy today is a far cry from the real thing. 

</ul><p>

More ominously, criminal elements are brazenly executing those who uncover corruption. The slayings of journalists Dimitri Kholodov and Vladislav Listyev illustrate the deadly consequences of telling the truth. An international source of reporting is needed to offset Russian media likely to be increasingly intimated by organized crime or political extremists.

<p>

<b>Note for U.S. budget cutters</b>:  No new funds needed. See the proposals of Ariel Cohen of The Heritage Foundation on reprogramming $225 million by abolishing the Commodities Import Program and scrapping the Russian Officer Resettlement Program.35  AID obligated $2.5 billion but expended only $1.2 billion for combined FYs 1992-95.36  It is just as well:  most of this could be done far better in the private sector anyway. 

<p>
<b>In for the Long Haul</b>
<P>
There is no way that Russia can become a true democracy with a flourishing market economy overnight. Overcoming 70 years of communism is difficult enough, but the problem is deeper yet. Nowhere in the entire history of Russia was there a sustained period of personal freedom linked to economic and political sovereignty for the individual. The transitions of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary to democratic capitalism may not be smooth, but they are taking place because these countries are returning to a form they once knew. The roots were in the culture, even if they had been buried for a time. That is not the case with Russia. It may well take many years before the Russian culture can unlearn the traits inculcated under communism and the czars and become a culture which restrains itself by choice rather than by force.

<p>

Investing in human resources through scholarships and training programs, enabling help for self-help, and strengthening the private sector and civil society there are likely to yield long-term benefits. Only if Russians are equipped to master their own problems can they revitalize their society from within to make Russia a country which is free, democratic, and stable.

<p>

The U.S. has a great deal to offer toward this end. However, Western efforts to help Russia and the former Soviet republics have been thwarted for a variety of reasons. There is an increasingly allergic reaction of Russians to the arrogant and often ignorant Westerners who have descended on their country. Cultural sensitivity is needed, as is patience. Russia does not want to be a Western knock-off, as a growing number of Russians are quick to point out.

<p>

There are many Russians who have identified the problems of their country and who are eminently qualified to address the needs for both political reform and moral renewal. They stand in the strategic realms of academia, in the media, and in grass-roots movements. America can help best not by trying to make Russia a copy of itself, but by nurturing indigenous Russian efforts. In the words of Vitaly Zhurkin, Director of the Institute of Europe in the Russian Academy of Sciences, "These are Russian problems, and we need Russian solutions."37 
<p>
There are areas where Russians have asked for Western help, or have acknowledged a special role the West can play.
<p><ul>
<li>Foster the growth of Russian civil society. It was the cells of civil society that contributed to unraveling communism throughout the entire East bloc, and it is precisely here that the culture can be reknit. Clusters of grass-roots organizations of lawyers, farmers, teachers, writers, businessmen, and doctors are proliferating, but they have little or no knowledge of each other. Newsletters and data-base exchanges would permit them to help one another. They need computers and fax machines from the West, as well as organizational know-how. 

<p>

The private sectors of America and Europe are needed to help, through thousands of partnerships. The Center for Civil Society is tackling this task honorably, but much potential in America is still untapped.38 

<p>

Until there is growth of a genuine civil society to create culture separate from the state, the threat of a totalitarian throwback will loom large. It is in our own interest to insure that this not happen.

<p>

<li>Create a Resource Bank for Western groups aiding the NIS. There is a wealth of private sector initiatives in the West which are active, motivated, and largely unaware of one another. For understandable logistical reasons, few have an overview of the vast array of needs and possibilities in the East. There is a crying need for an "honest broker" to simply connect the existing resources from those who want to help with receivers. This is a task for the private sector in the U.S.

<p>

Resource materials on the private sector helping from the West exist. A <i>Compendium</i> of nearly 700 U.S. nonprofit activities in Central and Eastern Europe and the New Independent States has been published by the Citizens Democracy Corps. There is also an excellent catalogue of <i>East-West Christian Organizations</i>, listing nearly 700 church and para-church organizations providing assistance.39

<p>

<li>Build bridges between academics, cultural, religious, and economic and political leaders. Networking in the Western sense is non-existent. But until cultural and political reformers make a common cause, they cannot succeed. They do not know or trust one another, and will remain ineffective until they converge. This is one place where the U.S. can render a service by helping to knit up the fabric of a fragmented society, both in the public and private sectors.



<li>Support Russians revamping their school curriculum and retraining teachers. Dr. Aleksandr Abramov, President of the Moscow Institute for Development of Educational Systems, heads an effort with a team of 200 Russian intellectuals who have developed new textbooks of non-revisionist history, literature, and books which include moral teachings. They also offer training seminars for educators, many of whom are genuinely seeking a new orientation. Further manuscripts are ready, but the titles cannot be printed without financial sponsorship. Some of Abramov's books adopted into the Russian curriculum have press runs of a million. The potential to reach the coming generation is staggering.40  Abramov has applied for an AID grant but has received nothing. 

<li>Give intellectual ammunition. The way to moral renewal in Russia is through its own writers, claim many Russians. A rich literature articulates morality and virtue, stemming from such writers as Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Pasternak, Solzhenitsyn, and Pushkin. A <i>Book of Virtues</i>, organized along the lines of Bill Bennett's book,41 could compile the Russian vision of such virtues as self-discipline, compassion, responsibility, friendship, work, courage, perseverance, honesty, loyalty, and faith. How can young Russians better learn virtue than from the best of their own cultural roots?42

<li>Equip teachers now required to teach "ethics and morality" in Russian schools, replacing "scientific atheism" in the curriculum. Most teachers have neither new textbooks nor anything in their own education to prepare them for this task. 

</ul><P>

It is possible to reach them:  Waldemar Murjahn from Germany has single-handedly sponsored a series of articles on morality for the past two years in the Russian publication <i>Uchitilskaya Gazeta</i>, which is sent to all teachers in the former Soviet Union. The publication is willing to accept other material, not only on morality, but on the foundations of a democracy and market economy.43   

<p>

The impact of such efforts should not be underestimated. As Vyacheslav Ivanov writes, 

<blockquote>

	The present-day revival of freedom in the arts may have most significant social results. The cultural and educational consequences of the recent economic reforms may become even more important than all other aspects of the changes.44

<b>Mobilize the Private Sector</b>

<p>

The most active segment of the private sector stepping in to fill the gaps left by the collapsed state has been the religious community. Forbidden from charitable works under the communists, parishioners of various denominations are now tending the children of Chernobyl, prisoners, the aged, the homeless, and the handicapped. There are significant ways the U.S. can help by enabling Russians to care for their own. In a cash-strapped country where people used to look to the government for their security, such people are providing help no one else can.

<p>

There is religious freedom now, but there are winds blowing which would limit that of the denominations which are not Russian Orthodox. Some elements of the Orthodox Church are extremely hostile to Protestantism and Judaism and have made a common cause with nationalist extremists. However, there is spiritual hunger in Russia, and there are increasing numbers of highly motivated believers eager to put their faith into practice. Here are concrete needs America's believers can help meet by helping Russians to help themselves.

<p><ul>

<li>Support efforts in the private sector to retrain prisoners. Former prisoners of conscience are actively reaching detainees to help them begin a new life. Yakov Dukhonchenko in Ukraine, and Ivan Fedotov and Alexander Ogorodnikov in Russia are successfully turning lives around.45  Supplying them with the equipment to run a bakery, or seeds to plant farms, enables prisoners to be honestly self-sufficient when they are released.  

<p>

"Faith, Love and Hope" is an initiative run by Natalia Vyssotskaya which teaches women prisoners in Russia skills which will serve them once they are released. It has received the approval of the Patriarch of Moscow.46 

<p>

<li>Support efforts to scoop the youth off the streets. One of the most effective ways to fight juvenile crime is preventive care. Church-related groups are taking teenagers in off the street and teaching them job skills other than racketeering and prostitution, the favored choices of many young Russians. Providing sewing machines, tools, and job training is an investment in a productive future. Linking American youth to these fledgling help organizations could provide motivation for both.



<li>Keep the door open for churches. An enormous amount of humanitarian assistance and aid for training has poured in from Western churches and para-church organizations. Unfortunately, as the door opened for such groups, every variety of exotic sect and cult descended on Russia as well. Add to that the Russian Orthodox Church's hostility to other denominations, and it becomes clear why there are Russians in power trying to slam the door to the West.

</ul><p>

Twice legislation limiting access to Russia by other denominations has been presented to Yeltsin, and twice he has refused to sign it into law. A new amendment was also rejected by Yeltsin on May 22 this year.47  Although it was intended to block totalitarian sects like Japan's Aum Shinrikyo while preserving room for responsible groups, Yeltsin surprised its proponents by rejecting the amendment as too restrictive.48

<p>

Mikhail Gorbachev realized nearly ten years ago that for <i>perestroika</i> to be effective, the religious segment of Russia needed to be mobilized. Gorbachev reasoned that the country needs workers who do not drink on the job and do not steal, as a matter of principle.49  The same is true today. Now that the state has collapsed, charitable work caring for the homeless, the aged, and penniless pensioners is sorely needed. People of faith in Russia are stepping in to fill the gaping holes. Believers abroad can, and do, help them. 

<p>

However, elements of both the government and the Russian Orthodox Church oppose the influence of the foreign religious community. The days of the open door may be numbered. 

<p>



<b>Obedience to the Unenforceable</b>

<p>

This is a realm beyond that of policy. It is one in which it is only possible to answer for one's own conscience. Duma member and former dissident Valerie Borschov has observed:  "The main problem is society's passage from communism to democracy without passing through a stage of personal renewal   .... Society cannot be renewed, but individual persons can."50 

<p>

The founders of America structured its government on the premise that man is endowed with abilities and responsibilities and a moral obligation to his Creator. They also understood man's propensity for evil, and therefore created a system of laws and institutions of government designed to limit the amount of damage we could inflict on one another. The Founding Fathers knew very well that order in a free society depends on the character of its citizenry. Adam Smith knew that a market without benevolence and a moral foundation would yield immoral business. The American experiment, which fused the concept of limited government with a market economy, flourished as long as the morality of the country did so. It can function only as long as its citizens are governed by what Midge Decter astutely terms "obedience to the unenforceable." 

<p>

A sense of personal, transcendent morality was all but eradicated in the communist countries. But arguably it has deteriorated in the West as well. As products of a secularized culture, whose roots in the Judaeo-Christian heritage have been largely forgotten and wrenched from the public domain, we have little to offer. How can we communicate what we no longer hold ourselves? 

<p>

The experiment of communism attempted to eradicate God. Its ideology was not agnostic, but aggressively atheistic:  Jews, Christians, and Moslems were all anathema. Communists silenced, imprisoned, and executed untold numbers of men and women of faith. There may be more modern martyrs than in any previous century. 

<p>

The virtues of personal restraint and homage to the transcendent, which are embodied in the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, and the Torah, are remarkably consistent. Judaism and Christianity are unanimous in condemning murder, stealing, and lying while acknowledging our need for family, forgiveness, and a right relation to our Creator. The harmony of the world's great religious teachings on these basic precepts reveals an immutable Natural Law each faith has discovered.51 

<p>

These eternal precepts were replaced by the secularized religion of Marxism-Leninism. We are in the process of trading them for secular humanism and materialism. As Russian sociologist Mikhail Tarusin puts it, "A non-believer is unpredictable, can do anything. A believer has in his soul a system of restraints. When the Russian people realize this, maybe there will be hope for change."

<p>

The same is true for Americans. Any culture which no longer acknowledges eternal truths unravels morally. We see the results not only in the former communist countries, but in our own. If we attempt to raise the banner of virtue and honor, it is for ourselves as well. 

<p>

Russian poet and novelist Fazil Iskander describes his despair, but also his hope for Russia. The truth of his words transcends our borders. 

<blockquote>

	 The great bluff of communism is being replaced by the provincial bluff of nationalism.... In our confused, dark time, who will restore our appetite for creation?  Darkness can be opposed only by light and clarity. We need a natural authority with a clearly expressed will to good, with a clearly creative program, with clear laws that defend the work of those who create. But while bickering continues in the structures of power, while the representatives of national authority hang on one another like exhausted boxers, we cannot expect any creative energy. Hatred reigns. When the earth becomes parched for lack of love, it is irrigated with blood.... It is high time for us to resign ourselves to changing our slovenly universality to an honest particularity. Thus we will be closer to eternity.52

<h3> Report From Russia: Politics, Economics, and The NATO Expansion Issue</h3>
<p>
By Evgueni Volk, Director, Heritage Foundation Moscow Office, before the Political Committee of the North Atlantic Assembly on May 28, 1995.
<p>
	The domestic situation in Russia and the NATO expansion problem are closely interrelated and influence each other in a number of important directions. It is extremely difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of such an interaction, but it seems obvious that the process will be long, complicated, and even painful.
<p>
	Russia is undergoing a difficult transition in its social, economic, and political systems. The point of departure is more or less clear:  Russia was once a totalitarian communist system. As for the point of destination, no public consensus yet exists. When speaking of democracy, civil society, the rule of law, and the market economy, the Russian people differ in their understanding of these concepts. Moreover, the psychological legacy of the past has engendered a negative attitude toward these internationally accepted values. The pace of reforms has been significantly hampered by a lack of agreement concerning these values.
<p>
	Nevertheless, recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in building a genuine democratic system. The privatization process is one of them. Its main outcome to date has been the gradual formation of a new entrepreneurial class with private ownership and commercial and political initiative. Despite its numerous controversial features, privatization generally continues, and it is the chief litmus test for Russian economic reform.
<p>
	Politically, a free electoral system is the principal result of reform. It is the first experience for the Russians in choosing their representatives to the legislative power and, by this, influencing the policy of the government.
<p>
	The freedoms of the press and expression are another major gain of the Russian reform. They guarantee the irreversibility of the democratic process. The mass media also play a significant part in the system of checks and balances, and their position is hard to ignore. However, the press is often subjected to intimidation and financial pressure from legal and illegal centers of power.
<p>
	Russian reforms are facing severe obstacles. No real anti-totalitarian revolution has taken place, and the communist <i>nomenklatura</i>, ill-equipped for a democratic environment, remains the source of political and economic power. In many cases privatization merely legalized the monopolistic control of industrial giants on the market, entailing inflation and stagnation. And the market has yet to break down Russia's highly militarized economy.
<p>
	Executive power is far stronger than the legislative power and is further consolidating its position. In fact, Russia's bureaucracy is more powerful, wasteful, and arrogant than its Soviet predecessor. A lack of public control mechanisms contributes to an unprecedented spread of corruption. People feel unprotected against arbitrary bureaucratic rule.
<p>
	The Russian economic mentality is still largely based on paternalist and egalitarian ideas. People believe that the government should take care of them in every situation. This provokes an increase in overregulatory governmental functions, with direct interference in all the spheres of economic life. Bureaucratic control over the economy is growing. Egalitarian trends predetermine a negative attitude toward industrious and wealthy people who succeeded in building their well-being by honest labor. This is particularly true in rural areas, where private farmers are discriminated against and preference is given to the old collective farms. The vested interest of the old economic <i>nomenklatura</i> in preserving its economic power hinders the progress of reform and impedes the efficiency of production.
<p>
	The weakness of democratic political and economic institutions has contributed to the rising crime rate. About 75 percent of private companies have to pay up to 20 percent of their income as protection money to mobsters. More and more people are joining businesses owned and operated by criminals. The law enforcement agencies are highly corrupted. The taxation rate is so high (up to 90 percent of income) that the majority evades it by concealing revenues.
<P>
	The Russian political scene demonstrates the weakness of Russia's democratic institutions. There exist several hundred political parties, but very few of them have influence and virtually none can get an overwhelming majority in the parliament. Confrontation between center-right democrats and left-wing communists continues, and the centrist parties are not playing a significant role. Democrats are not in good shape, as people tend to attribute the failure of reform to their ideas rather than to a lack of persistence in their implementation. But neither communists nor nationalists have any efficient remedies. Attempts to consolidate a "centrist" party of power such as Chernomyrdin's "Our Home-Russia" are made again and again, but only time will show how solid this bloc will be.
<p>
	Many of the political differences of the parties arise from different economic interests. The sectors of the economy that depend on further international cooperation (such as the oil, gas, trade, and banking industries) are internationalist and more open to the West. Others that suffer either from competition with the West (such as the agricultural sector and consumer industries) or from the relaxation of tension (such as the military-industrial complex) are more isolationist and nationalist.
<p>

<b>RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY AND NATO EXPANSION</b>
<p>
	The collapse of the Soviet Union brought about a profound crisis in Russia's national identity. Russia's role as a world power has decreased, and an inferiority complex has emerged. As a result, Russians are becoming more nostalgic for the Soviet past when their country was, in their eyes, more powerful and wealthy. Many Russians still view themselves as Soviet and not Russian citizens and believe that the disintegration of the USSR was a mistake. The rise of a nationalist sentiment, including its aggressive component, is a response to political and economic challenges the society faces. Psychologically, many people doubt that the newly independent states are truly independent. The feeling of Orwell's "Big Brother" is as widespread as the conviction that these states cannot survive without Russia. 
<p>
	 The idea of a "great power" today is based largely on nuclear potential. It clearly does not rest on Russia's economic performance. Two-thirds of the Russian population live below the minimum subsistence level. According to all major social and economic indicators, Russia can hardly be regarded as a prosperous country. This engenders a bitterness that is often the fuel of extremist political parties.
<p>
	The expectation after the demise of communism was that the Western alliance would pay for Russia's transition to democratic capitalism. When it became evident that this would not occur, Russians were profoundly disappointed. The result has been a rising anti-Western mentality among the Russian people. This sentiment is easily manipulated by communists and extreme nationalists.

<p>	The Chechen crisis shocked Russian society. It clearly exposed the fact that little had changed in the new democratic Russia. Excessive secrecy, anti-democratic decision-making, neglect of impartial expertise and public opinion, lies, and brutality toward peaceful citizens were rampant throughout the Chechen operation, as they were during Soviet times as well. Few Russians doubt the criminal nature of Dudayev's regime in Chechnya. But they ask how he was allowed to gain power and to obtain enormous amounts of weapons. Until there is a definite political answer, no prospects for a peace settlement are feasible. The guilty are seeking ways to evade responsibility by waging a bloody war to wipe away all evidence of their crime.
<p>
	Foreign policy issues are not that important to the average Russian. The ordeal of day-to-day survival is far more important for a large majority of Russians. But for exactly these reasons, some politicians are trying to change the subject from their domestic policy failures to foreign policy. In this respect the NATO expansion issue is the perfect target for channelling popular discontent into a foreign policy issue.
<p>
	The Russian attitude toward the NATO expansion debate is 99 percent domestically motivated. The following ingredients create a nutrient medium for resisting NATO expansion plans, irrespective of their true nature and timing:  the alleged failure of the Western development model, disappointment with insufficient Western assistance, the growth of nostalgic pro-communist and xenophobic sentiments brought about by low living standards, an aggressive nationalist and isolationist stand, and weakness of democratic tradition and institutions.
<p>
	The Russian public, in fact, knows very little about NATO. Nearly 100 percent of the common people, if asked about the issue, would say that NATO was an "aggressive military bloc."  The power of the Cold War stereotypes is still great, and even Russian politicians -- some deliberately, some unintentionally -- suffer from myopia as far as NATO is concerned. While never doubtful of the peaceful intentions of the U.S., U.K., Germany, or France individually, Russians easily and illogically become fearful of the NATO alliance as a whole.
<p>
	The Russian debate on NATO is lacking in expertise and competence. The NATO evolution process -- through the Harmel Report to the Declaration in Rome and others -- is completely overlooked, as are numerous non-military spheres of action, including political consultation, and economic, scientific, and ecological cooperation. Restricting NATO to a mere military function is a favored means for its opponents to criticize it. Unfortunately, little has been done in recent years by NATO and the Russian democratic movement to dispel the alliance's false image with the Russian public. No matter what the reason -- a lack of political will or resources -- there is no excuse for this failure.
<p>
	I share the views of those Russians who see no problems with NATO expansion. I even welcome it. The North Atlantic alliance remains the most efficient and viable security structure in the world. It has long ceased to be just a military alliance (if it ever was) to become a politically motivated organization projecting and disseminating democratic values. Political goals have always been central to this strategy, and the 50 years of peace in Europe can be attributed to NATO's resolve to defend freedom and democracy. The plans to incorporate new members mean further guarantees of democratic and stable development in Central and Eastern Europe with no threat to anybody.
<p>
	Only people with a confrontational mentality can presume that the NATO enlargement will jeopardize Russian security interests. But should, to Russia's great misfortune, those interests be usurped and misinterpreted by extremist forces, NATO would undoubtedly act in keeping with its political and military deterrence function in order to maintain international security and stability.
<p>
	Russian political forces who associate themselves with the Western alliance are by no means numerous. But this fact does not mean that there is an anti-NATO consensus, as some people in Moscow claim. The absence of an accepted national security strategy provides ground for arbitrary interpretation of national interests and threats and challenges. It prevents Russian foreign policy from adopting a consistent, long-term approach to any international problem. As a result, the NATO expansion issue cannot be put in proper perspective. Thus, old Soviet-era prejudices often get the upper hand in the debate. 
<p>
	 Of course, the Russian military has a vested interest in opposing NATO expansion. In order to survive and maintain a high profile, the armed forces believe that they must have a clearly identified and strong adversary. NATO is the largest military power closest to the Russian borders, and wishful thinking can easily attribute the "enemy image" to it. Moreover, cooperation with NATO requires that the armed forces be more open in the way they conduct their business. This is something the Russian military is not used to. After the Chechen events it seems clearer that traditional secrecy was designed largely to conceal the limitations rather than merits of the Soviet Army, and this trend is likely to persist. Finally, existing arms control agreements do not suit the Russian military, as they impose restrictions on their ambitious military plans and programs.

<p>	Regardless of the obstacles, NATO expansion should proceed in conformity with European and global security and stability interests. NATO may not be perfect, but no other more efficient mechanisms exist on the continent. I appreciate the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's important political role in the West-East dialogue (since I participated in its diplomatic process, too). However, the OSCE has not shown itself to be an adequate substitute for NATO. As far as the CIS security structure is concerned, its shape undoubtedly faces serious difficulties, and the ultimate result is still unclear.
<p>
	In the course of its expansion, NATO should be well aware of misperceptions and apprehensions that are sometimes exaggerated in Russia. Political and informational effort should be made to dispel them. Therefore: 
<p><ul>
<li>Versatile bilateral cooperation between NATO and Russia should develop; <br>

<li>The new generation of Russian politicians, military men, and researchers should be more resolutely involved in NATO and North Atlantic Assembly activities; <br>

<li>The issue of NATO special educational programs for Russia should be addressed;<br>

<li>The Russian military should be brought under civilian and public control to avoid future Chechnyas; and<br>

<li>Russia's active participation in the Partnership for Peace program is a precondition for building up mutual confidence and security.
<p></ul>
	If these steps are taken, close political contacts between NATO and Russia could develop into a special partnership. Russia's full membership in NATO, which looks quite improbable today, could become a reality in the 21st century.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>





Algeria is engulfed in a bloody civil war that has claimed around 40,000 lives since January 1992. 
In that month the Algerian army seized power, ousted President Chadli Benjedid, and canceled 
parliamentary elections to avert a takeover by Islamic radicals, or "Islamists."  The provisional 
military government and the loose coalition of Islamists who seek its overthrow have fought to a 
standstill. It is gradually becoming clear that neither side is likely to score a decisive military 
victory. Unless this civil war is halted, Algeria will disintegrate into political chaos that could 
destabilize the entire region. But as bad as Algeria's situation is now, an Islamist victory would be 
even worse.
<p>
A radical Islamic victory in Algeria would pose significant long-term threats to U.S. interests in 
North Africa, the Middle East, and the Muslim world generally. The triumph of Muslim militance 
in Algeria, at a minimum, would embolden Islamists elsewhere in the Islamic world to redouble 
their revolutionary efforts, increase subversive pressures on pro-Western secular regimes, and 
encourage further opposition to the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. In the worst case scenario, a 
radical Islamic Algeria could become another Iran -- a base for actively exporting anti-Western 
revolution, terrorism, and anarchy. 
<p>
The Clinton Administration has distanced itself from the beleaguered Algerian military regime and 
has established diplomatic contacts with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), the umbrella group of 
radical Islamic organizations opposed to the secular regime. The President and his advisers believe 
this policy will lay the groundwork for a political settlement in Algeria. But FIS leaders increasingly 
have lost control over the ultra-radical guerrillas who do most of the fighting and adamantly reject 
compromise with the Algerian regime. It makes little sense to conduct a dialogue with leaders who 
cannot deliver a negotiated peace even if they wanted to do so. Moreover, reaching out to Algerian 
Islamic "moderates" is counterproductive because it undermines the ability of secular Arab regimes 
to resist the surge of militant Islam.
<p>
Supporters of the dialogue with the FIS argue that it will lead to better Algerian-American relations 
in the event that Islamic revolutionaries come to power. This dangerously wishful thinking flows 
from the false premise that Western powers can co-opt radical Muslim movements through 
negotiation, dialogue, and compromise, practices valued in democratic societies but not in radical 
Islam. Any Islamist leaders that come to power in Algeria after years of bloodshed inevitably will 
be virulently anti-Western. Their totalitarian ideology uncompromisingly rejects Western values, 
which are perceived to threaten the purity of Islam, and is hostile to Western interests. Moreover, 
the political dynamics of revolutionary struggle favor militants at the expense of moderates, who 
tend to become increasingly irrelevant as political violence intensifies.
<p>
The Clinton Administration appears to be making the same mistakes in Algeria that the Carter 
Administration made in Iran. By reaching out to Islamic revolutionaries and undertaking a political 
dialogue, the Administration puts American national interests at risk and loses credibility with 
nervous allies battling their own Islamists. The Carter Administration's over-eager courting of Iran's 
revolutionary provisional government backfired in November 1979, when Iranian radicals seized 
American diplomats as hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The Clinton Administration's 
courtship of Algeria's FIS is even more misguided because it could help boost Algerian Islamists to 
power by demoralizing the embattled military regime in Algiers.
<p>
The United States has relatively little direct influence over what happens in Algeria in the coming 
months. What little leverage it has should be used to help block the rise of Islamists hostile to 
American values and interests, not to ease their path to power. The sad truth is that any power-
sharing arrangement between the regime and the Islamic opposition would be the first step toward a 
complete victory for the Islamists.
<p>
Instead of seeking to ingratiate itself with FIS "moderates" who are likely to be squeezed out of 
power and discarded by their more radical rivals if Islamists take power, the U.S. should:
<P><ul>
<li> Break diplomatic contacts with the FIS. These contacts risk undermining the Algerian 
government with no real benefits for the U.S.
<p>
<li> Halt efforts to pressure the Algiers regime into a suicidal power-sharing arrangement. Power-
sharing would only be a prelude to an Islamist takeover. 
<p>
<li> Cooperate with France and other allies to help buy time for the regime. Washington should help 
Algeria reschedule its heavy debt burden, although it cannot afford to give direct economic aid.
<p>
<li> Seek to deprive Algerian Islamists of external support. The U.S. needs to increase economic and 
diplomatic pressures on Iran and Sudan, which aid Algerian Islamists, and cooperate with European 
allies to reduce the flow of arms and money from Algerian expatriates in Europe.
<p>
<li> Prevent future Algerias. There is little the U.S. can do in concrete terms to solve Algeria's 
immediate crisis. The Algerian government has been a repressive failure, but the Islamist 
alternative would be worse. The U.S. should encourage the Algiers regime to adopt free-market 
economic reforms and cautious democratic reforms, although this will be difficult while the regime 
is fighting for survival. The U.S. is likely to have more success encouraging long-term political, 
economic, and educational reforms that can help other secular Arab regimes avoid Algeria's 
mistakes.
</ul><P>


<B>ALGERIA'S POLITICAL BREAKDOWN</b><P>

Algeria's plunge into civil strife was precipitated by three intertwined crises -- economic, social, and 
political -- that undermined the legitimacy of the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) regime. 
The FLN had spearheaded Algeria's bloody eight-year war for independence and dominated Algeria 
for 30 years after it won independence from France in 1962. Although it enjoyed considerable 
prestige based on this success, it squandered its popular support by building a one-party socialist 
state that badly mismanaged Algeria's deepening economic, social, and political problems.
<p>
The FLN nationalized large portions of the economy and built a Soviet-style command economy. It 
undertook an overly ambitious industrialization program that led to the development of swollen, 
inefficient state enterprises. The regime collectivized Algeria's thriving agricultural sector and 
experimented with "socialist villages" designed ostensibly to develop the economy and modernize 
society. The burgeoning state bureaucracy grew increasingly corrupt and inefficient. The 
mismanaged socialist economy was kept afloat by Algeria's oil and gas revenues, but the 1985-1986 
fall in energy prices dealt a body blow to the economy, reducing oil revenues from $12.5 billion in 
1985 to $8 billion in 1986. Rather than institute free-market economic reforms to revive the 
economy, the FLN regime borrowed heavily abroad. By the early 1990s, Algiers was forced to 
expend most of its oil and gas income -- roughly $8 billion to $9 billion per year -- just to finance 
its mushrooming $26 billion external debt. 
<p>
This economic crisis exacerbated a fundamental social crisis posed by rapid population growth and 
declining living standards. Algeria's population surged from 10 million in 1962 to its current level 
of 28.5 million (and continues to grow at the rapid rate of about 3 percent per year).   Peasants 
uprooted from the countryside, in part because of the regime's mismanagement of agriculture, 
crowded into the coastal cities in search of scarce housing and jobs. Algerians grew profoundly 
disenchanted with the FLN's one-party rule and its inability to deal with such persistent problems as 
high unemployment (now estimated to run about 25 percent, but much higher for younger workers), 
chronic food shortages, overcrowded housing, rising prices, and an overburdened infrastructure. <p>
The standard of living fell sharply following the 1985 decline in international oil prices, with 
private consumption per capita plummeting 18 percent between 1985 and 1992.  
<p>
Widespread discontent over the regime's mismanagement of the economy and resentment of the 
socialist pretensions of the ruling elite boiled over into anti-FLN riots that swept many Algerian 
cities in October 1988. Although they began as a spontaneous protest in a working class 
neighborhood in Algiers against austerity measures imposed by the regime, the mass 
demonstrations subsequently took on an Islamist cast and spread from the capital to other cities. 
The army was deployed to halt attacks on government buildings, state enterprises, and FLN 
political offices. Roughly 500 people were killed and $250 million in damage was inflicted on 
government facilities before the riots were suppressed after five days of bloodshed. 
<p>
Stunned by the scope of the political violence, President Benjedid undertook a series of reforms to 
open up the political system and defuse opposition. A new constitution was approved by national 
referendum in February 1989, and the parliament approved the transition to a multi-party system in 
July 1989. The chief political challenge to the FLN came from the FIS, formed in March 1989 as a 
coalition of more than 20 Islamist groups dedicated to creating an Islamic state ruled by the Sharia, 
Islam's sacred law. The FIS quickly mobilized a mass following, drawing its strongest support from 
the urban poor and Algerian youths who sought a sense of purpose and identity in a society that 
presented them with a bleak future of diminishing opportunities. The FIS got a head start over other 
opposition parties because it enjoyed an informal support network in the mosques and was 
bolstered by heavy funding from Islamists in Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Persian Gulf emirates.
<p>
The FIS also profited from the miscalculations of President Benjedid, who greatly underestimated 
its strength. Despite the fact that a July 1989 law banned political parties based on "sectarian 
practice" and "intolerance," the government recognized the FIS as a legal party in September 1989. 
Benjedid may have hoped to use the growing challenge posed by the FIS to offset FLN hard-liners 
opposed to his reform program. Or he may have allowed the FIS to operate openly in a 
Machiavellian attempt to scare voters into supporting the FLN. 
<p>
Benjedid's approach clearly backfired. In the June 1990 municipal and district elections, the first 
free elections since Algeria gained independence, the FIS decisively defeated the FLN, winning 54 
percent of the popular vote to the FLN's 28 percent. Although the Islamists won control of 850 of 
Algeria's more than 1,500 municipalities, this vote was not an accurate barometer of their true 
strength. The FIS benefited from a boycott of the elections by several secular parties that led 38 
percent of the electorate to abstain from voting. Others cast ballots for the FIS as a protest vote 
against the FLN.  
<p>
Despite this electoral setback, Benjedid pressed ahead with his plans to move rapidly toward multi-
party legislative elections to restore the FLN's shattered political legitimacy. He unwisely designed 
a winner-take-all electoral system that would magnify the number of parliamentary seats awarded to 
the leading political party, perhaps assuming that the pre-election gerrymandering of electoral 
districts would guarantee an FLN victory. For its part, the FIS became increasingly aggressive in 
politically attacking the regime, organizing civil disobedience, calling for general strikes, and 
appealing to army officers to rebel against the FLN regime. The June 1991 elections were 
postponed when violent political protests erupted over the FLN-engineered electoral reforms. 
Martial law was declared and thousands of Islamists were arrested. Despite this, the FIS was 
allowed to participate in the legislative elections, rescheduled to take place in two rounds of voting 
in December 1991 and January 1992. 
<p>
The first round resulted in an FIS landslide. Although the FIS actually received 1 million fewer 
votes than it had at the peak of its popularity in the June 1990 municipal elections, the misguided 
electoral reforms magnified its victory.   The FIS gained 188 of the 230 seats contested in the first 
round, eclipsing the FLN, which picked up only 15 seats. The non-Islamist vote was severely 
fragmented, and many voters opted for the FIS rather than their preferred parties because they 
feared their vote might be wasted under the winner-take-all system. Shocked by the size of the 
Islamists' political victory and suspecting that President Benjedid had cut a deal with the FIS, the 
army ousted Benjedid on January 11, 1992, canceled the elections, banned the FIS, and set up a 
transitional authority, the five-man High State Council (HCS).

<p>
<b>SPIRALING POLITICAL VIOLENCE
</b><P>
Although many Algerians were relieved that the army had stepped in to block an Islamist takeover, 
the new regime lacked a solid base of support. To remedy this, the HCS chose Mohammed 
Boudiaf, an unblemished hero of the revolution against the French who had opted for self-exile, as 
the new prime minister. Boudiaf led a crackdown against the Islamists, who had gone underground 
and had begun an escalating campaign of armed attacks against the regime. But Boudiaf also 
asserted his independence from the entrenched elite that had run Algeria for their own benefit and 
made clear his intention to root out corruption in the FLN-controlled state bureaucracies. Boudiaf 
was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards on June 29, 1992, possibly because he was regarded 
as a threat to hard-liners within the army and FLN.
<p>
The Islamist camp also was fractured by internal political rivalries and disputes. Once the FIS was 
forced underground, its unity partially dissolved, and radical splinter groups proliferated and grew 
stronger. The military wing of the FIS, the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS), has become increasingly 
independent of the political leadership, much of which is under arrest or in exile. Local guerrilla 
leaders, known as emirs, have waged largely autonomous struggles against the government, and 
unaffiliated groups have opportunistically engaged in rising levels of criminal activity.
<p>
In early 1992, militant Islamists formed the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), one of the most ruthless 
and violent Islamic revolutionary organizations in the world. Founded by Algerian veterans of the 
Islamic jihad (holy war) against the Soviet and Afghan communist forces in Afghanistan, the GIA 
adamantly opposes any negotiated settlement with the government and scorns the FIS for its 
willingness to consider a dialogue with the regime. While the AIS has focused its attacks on the 
regime, particularly on police and military personnel, the GIA has unleashed a fierce terrorist 
campaign against a broad array of civilian targets, including secular opposition leaders, journalists, 
artists, academics, and foreigners. 
<p>
The GIA has chosen such a wide variety of targets because it is fighting a cultural war, not just a 
political war. It seeks to impose its vision of pure Islam on Algerian society by violently eliminating 
Western cultural influences that it considers a threat to that vision. Because it fears that secular 
education "undermines the jihad" by "taming" Algeria's youth, the GIA has sabotaged or destroyed 
roughly 700 schools and murdered over 200 teachers.   It has assassinated intellectuals, particularly 
those that write in French, as symbols of the francophone elite that it wishes to destroy because of 
that elite's secular and "Westoxicated" values.   GIA and other fanatical Islamist terrorists have slit 
the throats of young school girls for not wearing veils that conform to their view of Islamic 
modesty. They have impaled the decapitated head of a hapless contractor on the satellite television 
antenna that he was installing, because in their eyes he was helping to spread the decadent values of 
Western culture. The GIA also has killed more than 100 Algerian religious leaders with whom it 
disagreed.  
<p>
GIA terrorism increasingly threatens foreigners as well as Algerians. More than 90 foreign 
expatriates have been assassinated in Algeria since the GIA issued an ultimatum for foreigners to 
flee the country in September 1993 in an effort to undermine the regime. The GIA also has exported 
its indiscriminate brand of terrorism in an effort to deprive the Algiers regime of foreign support. 
Four GIA terrorists hijacked an Air France passenger jet on December 24, 1994, and planned to 
crash it into the streets of Paris on Christmas day. Fortunately, French commandos stormed the 
plane while it was refueling in Marseilles and killed the terrorists before they could deliver their 
gruesome Christmas offering.   The GIA on October 7, 1995, also admitted responsibility for a 
series of eight terrorist attacks in France that had killed eight people and wounded 130 since July.  
 On October 17, it struck again, setting off a bomb on a crowded Paris commuter train and 
wounding 29 people. 
<p>
The GIA's terrorist tactics, particularly its use of massive car bombs and kidnappings, are similar to 
those of Hezbollah (Party of God), the pro-Iranian Lebanese Islamist group. This is not surprising, 
since the GIA is believed to enjoy clandestine support from Iran and has dispatched representatives 
to meet with Hezbollah leaders and with Iran's Minister for Intelligence, Ali Fallahian, who 
oversees much of Iran's terrorist and subversive operations.   U.S. officials maintain that Sudan 
also assists Algerian Islamists by allowing Iran to use Sudanese territory as a transit point for arms 
and ammunition smuggled through Chad and Niger to Algeria.   The Algerian government broke 
relations with Iran and Sudan in 1993, charging that both Islamic regimes supported Algerian 
terrorists. 
<p>

<b>CURRENT STALEMATE AND GRIM FUTURE
</b><p>
There is no end in sight to the killing, which has claimed an estimated 40,000 lives since January 
1992. As the conflict has intensified, both the Islamists and government security forces have 
become more indiscriminate in their use of force, leaving many Algerians fearful and resentful of 
both sides. The army controls the urban centers, large towns, and oil and gas facilities, but central 
authority is gradually crumbling. Islamists, increasingly dominated by the GIA, control wide areas 
of the countryside, many villages, and poor neighborhoods in many cities. Even the most secure 
bastions of government supporters are subject to terrorist attacks.
<p>
The government's security forces are stretched thin, battling against roughly 20,000 insurgents who 
are assisted by extensive support networks.   The military employs about one-third of its 155,000 
forces against the Islamists. It prefers to deploy only professional military units, because many of its 
conscripts have defected to the rebels. Senior officers are said to distrust young officers with the 
rank of captain or lower.   The regime relies on a paramilitary gendarmerie of roughly 30,000 and 
the police to perform most internal security tasks. By one estimate, it can rely on about 63,000 men 
for security operations but can raise this to about 90,000 in a crisis for a short period of time.   The 
government also announced in March 1995 that it will organize and arm up to 50,000 men in local 
militias. Such militias are likely to be unreliable, except perhaps in the mountain strongholds of 
Algeria's Berber minority, which generally is secular and hostile to Islamist doctrines.
<p>
The Islamists have had some success infiltrating the security forces and assassinating key 
government officials. In March 1994, they attacked a prison, allegedly with inside help, and freed 
more than 900 prisoners. But the GIA and other groups also have been penetrated by government 
intelligence services. This has allowed the internal security forces to target the commanders of the 
revolutionary Islamic forces, killing several of them. In March 1995, the army struck a devastating 
blow against the GIA, ambushing roughly 900 guerrillas and killing hundreds of them in a running 
battle that lasted several days in the rugged Ain Defla region, 90 miles west of Algiers.  
<p>
The government claims that it now has the upper hand in the fighting, but this remains to be seen. 
Hundreds of Algerians continue to die each week, but there is little chance the army can score a 
military knockout with the Islamists so well entrenched throughout Algeria. It is more likely that a 
bloody stalemate has set in, with both sides too exhausted to win a decisive victory. While the 
regime commands little enthusiastic support, it has the passive acceptance of most of the 
population. Moreover, the GIA's terrorist excesses have tarnished the appeal of the Islamists and 
provoked a backlash. More young men now appear to be defecting from the insurgents than from 
the army. 
<p>
The military regime tentatively has sought a political resolution to Algeria's predicament, but has 
found no acceptable interlocutors willing and able to halt the bloodshed. In October 1993, it created 
a Commission for National Dialogue, which sought to prepare the way for elections. The political 
parties declined to participate, ostensibly because they did not wish to "legitimize" the regime. But 
opposition parties also have been intimidated by ruthless terrorist attacks by the GIA, which rejects 
any form of compromise with the regime.   The High Security Council appointed Liamine Zeroual, 
a proponent of dialogue, as President on January 31, 1994. General Zeroual, a career military man 
and devout Muslim who had resigned from the army in 1988 to protest the harsh repression of the 
October 1988 riots, had been persuaded to return as Defense Minister in July 1993. Zeroual had 
engaged in secret contacts with imprisoned FIS leaders before becoming President and quickly 
made it clear that he was prepared for political dialogue with all political factions, including the 
FIS.  
<p>
Throughout most of 1994, the two top FIS leaders, Abassi Madani and Ali Belhaj, who had been 
imprisoned since July 1991, refused to enter political negotiations with the regime unless all FIS 
prisoners were released and Zeroual agreed to immediate elections. They relented and agreed to 
start discussions in September 1994 when promised unhindered contact with other FIS leaders. The 
two were moved from prison to a loose form of house arrest, but little came of the talks. The FIS 
leaders, apparently perceiving Zeroual's gesture as a sign of weakness, demanded a purge of the 
army and refused to call for an end to the violence. The talks had broken down by late October.
<p>
Opposition leaders briefly revived hopes for a fruitful political dialogue when they met in Rome, 
Italy, in January 1995 under the auspices of Sant' Egidio, a Catholic lay group. In Rome, eight 
prominent opposition politicians representing the major political parties, principally the banned FIS, 
the FLN, and the Socialist Forces Front (FFS), agreed to a "national contract" that set conditions 
under which talks with the regime could begin. They called for the regime to recognize the FIS as a 
political party, release its leaders, and proceed with multi-party elections. Significantly, the 
"contract" did not require the FIS to commit itself unequivocally to democracy. The FIS made its 
commitment contingent on "the framework provided by our religion," a vague formulation that can 
be interpreted any way the Islamists see fit. The Zeroual regime understandably rejected the Sant' 
Egidio declaration, which also was denounced by the fanatical GIA and the increasingly militant 
AIS. 
<p>
Nevertheless, Zeroual maintained contact with the imprisoned FIS leaders, Madani and Belhaj, 
through a presidential adviser. These contacts finally were broken off in July 1995, with each side 
accusing the other of bad faith. The Algiers regime now is pressing ahead to hold presidential 
elections on November 16, despite the refusal of the major opposition parties to participate.
<p>

<b>U.S. INTERESTS AND ALGERIA
</b><P>
The military regime fighting for survival in Algiers is not a pro-Western ally. Since independence 
in 1962, Algeria has been ruled by radical Arab nationalists who have imposed Soviet-style 
economic policies and supported anti-Western liberation movements while staking out a claim to 
leadership of the nonaligned movement. Since the Algerian government was not aligned with the 
West in the Cold War, Washington has no moral obligation to align itself with the regime clinging 
to power in Algiers today. <p>

 But Washington does have a major stake in the outcome of the struggle inside Algeria. This is 
because the triumph of Islamic revolutionaries in Algeria, the largest state in North Africa, will 
have strong and lasting impact on the region, the Arab world, and radical Islamic movements 
throughout the Muslim world. A successful Algerian Islamic revolution probably would have a 
greater effect on the Middle East than the 1979 Iranian revolution. Unlike Iran, Algeria is 
predominantly an Arab nation, and its people are Sunni (orthodox) Muslims, not members of the 
smaller Shiite branch of Islam. This closer cultural affinity and Algeria's revolutionary history 
would give Algerian Islamists an entree into other Arab societies that Iranians do not enjoy.
<p>
Specifically, a revolutionary Algeria would undermine U.S. interests by posing a threat to:
<p><ul>
<li>Pro-Western Arab secular regimes. An Islamist regime is likely to provide sanctuary, training, arms, 
advice, and moral, political, and material support to Islamist movements elsewhere in the region. 
The Algerian "Afghanis" already have established links with a wide variety of other Islamists, both 
during the war in Afghanistan and in training camps in Pakistan and Sudan. Exiled FIS leaders have 
made contact with a wide array of Islamic radicals in Europe. Even if the Algerians should neglect 
to support their counterparts in other countries (an unlikely prospect), their success will embolden 
other Islamic revolutionaries, providing a psychological boost to those who will see it as a 
vindication of Islamism and a harbinger of things to come in their own countries. 
<P>
<li>The countries most strongly threatened would be Algeria's neighbors, Tunisia and Morocco. Both 
already have suffered terrorist attacks at the hands of Algerian Islamists.   Egypt, which has 
managed to survive an upsurge of Islamist terrorism since 1992, also would face the possibility of 
Algerian aid to Egyptian Islamists channeled through Sudan. All of these governments have a 
strong hold on power and enjoy considerable popular support. They are by no means dominoes to 
be toppled easily. But the spillover effects of Islamic revolution in Algeria will exercise a long-term 
destabilizing influence in the region that harms U.S. allies and gratifies anti-Western forces.
<P>
<li>Containment of international terrorism. The triumph of Islamic revolution in Algeria will be a 
victory for ruthless and indiscriminate terrorism. Not only are other Islamists likely to imitate the 
tactics and strategy of Algeria's GIA, but Algeria's new rulers -- if they should win -- are unlikely to 
discard terrorism as an instrument of policy. Islamic Algeria, like Iran, Sudan, and Afghanistan 
before it, is likely to become a haven and base for Islamist terrorist groups. 
<P>
<li>Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. The Algerian revolution is likely to electrify disgruntled 
Palestinians and help strengthen the appeal of Islamist groups such as Hamas and the Palestinian 
Islamic Jihad. Algeria's Islamists vehemently reject any compromise with Israel and would 
cooperate with Iran, Sudan, and Palestinian Islamists to block a permanent settlement. The 
galvanizing effect of Algeria's revolution also would limit the degree to which cautious secular 
Arab regimes could take risks to support further peace efforts.
<P>
<li>Nonproliferation efforts. U.S. intelligence agencies in January 1991 discovered a nuclear research 
reactor that Algeria was building secretly with Chinese assistance. It is believed to be part of a 
clandestine nuclear weapons program.   After it was discovered, the Benjedid government 
announced that Algeria would sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it did in January 
1995, probably to help ensure continued Western support. But signing the treaty and accepting the 
accompanying inspection regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency cannot guarantee that 
the present regime or a future regime will abstain from developing a nuclear weapon. Saddam 
Hussein's nuclear efforts demonstrated how easy it is to get around IAEA "safeguards."  A nuclear-
armed revolutionary Islamic Algeria, just 200 miles from Europe's southern shores, is a chilling 
possibility that would pose a critical threat to NATO allies, regional friends, and American forces in 
the Mediterranean basin. Moreover, an Islamist regime in Algiers might consider sharing nuclear 
technology or materials with Iran, Sudan, or radical Islamic terrorist groups. 
<P>
<li>Western access to energy. Algeria has the fifth largest reserves of natural gas in the world and ranks 
14th in oil. It is a major energy exporter, the third largest source of the European Community's 
natural gas imports. Its importance is likely to grow when the Europe-Maghreb gas line, scheduled 
to be completed in 1996, links Algeria to Spain via Morocco. Although any regime that comes to 
power in Algiers will have an interest in continuing energy exports to maximize export income, 
Islamic revolutionaries will be prone to subversive and terrorist activities that are likely to disrupt 
the operations of the pipeline through Morocco or the Transmed pipeline bringing Algerian gas to 
Italy via Tunisia. Support for international terrorism also could trigger international economic 
sanctions that would disrupt the flow of Algerian gas to Western markets. Algerian support for 
Saudi Islamists, who provided FIS with considerable financial support,  would increase the risk of 
destabilization in Saudi Arabia, which in turn could disrupt the flow of Saudi oil exports and push 
up world oil prices.
<P>
<li>Human rights. Although the Algerian military regime has abused human rights in its desperate 
struggle against Islamist terrorists, these abuses are dwarfed by the ruthless and indiscriminate 
campaign of terrorism and intimidation unleashed by the Islamists. For example, secular women 
have been a favorite target of Islamic extremists, who have imposed "temporary marriages" -- rape 
-- on those they despise. If the Islamists seize power, Algeria's human rights situation is sure to 
worsen as they seek vengeance on the supporters of the current regime and struggle for power 
among themselves.
</ul>
<P>Given the grave threats that a revolutionary Islamic regime would pose to American foreign policy 
goals and security interests, the overriding U.S. goal in Algeria should be to prevent an Islamist 
takeover. Yet current U.S. policy is to ease Algeria's transition to "democracy" by including the FIS 
in a power-sharing arrangement that leads to national reconciliation. <P>
This is wishful thinking that 
dangerously undermines U.S. interests by making it easier, not more difficult, for Islamists to seize 
power in Algeria.

<P>
<b>U.S. POLICY TOWARD ALGERIA
</b><P>
The Clinton Administration has shunned high-level diplomatic contacts with the Zeroual 
government, concerned that such contacts will be interpreted by the Islamists as unconditional 
support for the regime. No senior U.S. official has visited Algiers since 1992. Moreover, American 
diplomats began discreet talks with Anwar Haddam, a high-level FIS representative based in 
Washington, in late 1993. The ostensible purpose of these talks is to pull the FIS into a political 
dialogue with the regime that will lead to a political settlement. But such a dialogue is doomed 
unless the FIS disavows terrorism -- in which case it will be attacked by the GIA and other 
militants. 
<p>
The Administration's policy is based on a number of questionable assumptions:<p><ul>
<li>That the FIS is willing and able to halt terrorism.
<P>
<li>That the FIS is willing to play by the rules of democratic politics.
<P>
<li>That the regime is willing to accept a suicidal power-sharing agreement.</ul><P>

None of these assumptions is realistic. The Administration's policy therefore is understood more 
properly as an insurance policy that it hopes will improve the chances of good relations with the FIS 
if and when it comes to power. Advocates of a dialogue with the FIS hope to prevent the U.S. from 
becoming the "Great Satan" in Algerian eyes, as it did in the eyes of Iranian Islamists. But this 
effort to placate Islamic revolutionaries is doomed to failure. Algerian Islamists already are 
convinced of U.S. perfidy by virtue of their ideology. They hate America as much for its culture, 
which they believe promotes corruption and decadence in their own societies, as they do for its 
policies. Years of bloody struggle are not likely to dilute their hostility, particularly if they are 
successful in shooting their way to power. 
<P>
The Clinton Administration would do well to remember that it was the Carter Administration's 
attempt to stage a rapprochement with the provisional Iranian government that triggered the biggest 
explosion in U.S.-Iranian relations, the 444-day hostage crisis of 1979-1981. Islamic militants 
seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in large part to discredit the provisional government of Prime 
Minister Mehdi Bazargan and preclude the normalization of
Iranian-American relations.   Radical fears of Iran-U.S. rapprochement were fed by a November 1, 
1979, meeting in Algiers between Bazargan, Iranian Foreign Minister Ibrahim Yazdi, and Carter 
National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. The Carter Administration's well-intentioned 
dialogue with Iranian moderates ultimately benefited Iranian hard-liners, who used it to oust 
Bazargan and poison U.S.-Iranian relations. The Reagan Administration also suffered a major 
policy setback when it tried to cultivate Iranian "moderates" to secure the release of American 
hostages held in Lebanon. 
<P>
 The Clinton Administration should halt its risky efforts to cultivate Algerian moderates. If they 
truly are moderates, the political dynamics of revolutionary struggle increasingly will marginalize 
them and limit their usefulness to the U.S. Furthermore, an American embrace actually could 
accelerate their demise by helping hard-liners in the GIA or in the FIS itself to discredit them. 
<p>
The U.S. should work to combat and contain Islamists, not to tame them -- a risky course that 
cannot be accomplished with any certainty. The Clinton Administration therefore should:
<p><ul>
<li> Break diplomatic contacts with the FIS. American diplomatic talks with Algeria's Islamists 
undercut the Zeroual regime by suggesting that Washington is hedging its bets and working to 
establish good relations with the prospective victor in the bloody civil war. This eventually could 
undermine confidence in the regime and encourage defections. Diplomatic talks also confer a form 
of legitimacy that strengthens the Islamists' sense of manifest destiny and confirms their belief in 
Western weakness.   While breaking contacts with the FIS and tilting toward the Zeroual regime 
may increase the risk of Algerian terrorist attacks on U.S. targets, continuing a dialogue is no 
guarantee against such attacks. In any event, the U.S. must take every precaution to improve 
security against terrorism.  
<p>
<li> Halt efforts to pressure the Algiers regime into a suicidal power-sharing arrangement. Given the 
brutality of the ongoing low-intensity war, it is unrealistic to expect the combatants to agree to 
genuine power-sharing arrangements. Power-sharing has become a euphemism for gradual Islamic 
takeover. Once placed in government positions, the Islamists would quickly consolidate their power 
and infiltrate the internal security forces. The military regime knows this and will not accept such a 
disguised form of surrender. Rather than publicly pressure the regime to negotiate with Islamists, 
which only undermines the regime and strengthens the Islamists, the U.S. should privately urge the 
regime to broaden its political base. The U.S. also should make it clear that it advocates political 
dialogue with the secular opposition parties, not the Islamists. Washington should resist the 
temptation to meddle in Algerian politics in a vain effort to ingratiate itself with the Islamists. Such 
appeasement will only make things worse by feeding the Islamists' sense of power and disdain for 
the weak-willed West. It would be a tragedy if the U.S. helped Islamists win through negotiations 
what they are incapable of winning for themselves. 
<p>
<li> Cooperate with France and other allies to help buy time for the regime. France bolstered the 
Algiers regime with $1.2 billion of foreign aid last year and has taken the lead in lobbying the 
International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club of creditor governments to lower Algeria's heavy 
debt burden. The IMF provided a $1 billion standby credit in April 1994 for rescheduling its debt 
and a $1.8 billion loan in May 1995 to support its cautious free-market reforms. The Paris Club 
rescheduled $3.4 billion of debt in July 1994, which cut Algeria's debt service ratio from 75 percent 
in 1993 to 30 percent in 1995.  
<p>
The U.S. gives no economic aid to Algeria beyond $550 million in loans under the Commodity 
Credit Corporation program for imports of American agricultural commodities and $2 billion in 
loans guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank to U.S. corporations, primarily involving construction 
of the Europe-Maghreb gas pipeline. Given its shrinking foreign aid budget, Washington cannot 
afford to provide direct aid to Algeria. But it can and should cooperate with France to secure aid 
from international lending institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. Washington also should 
lobby Saudi Arabia and the other oil-rich Persian Gulf emirates to come to Algeria's aid. Finally, 
the U.S. should encourage Algeria to undertake free-market economic reforms that can fuel 
economic growth and create jobs that help alleviate Algeria's socioeconomic crisis. This will be 
especially difficult in the prevailing civil turmoil, but Algeria's long-term economic prospects 
depend on it. 
<p>
<li> Seek to deprive Algerian Islamists of external support. The FIS has strong grass roots that enable 
it to impose taxes on "liberated" territory and siphon aid from radicalized groups of Algerians living 
in exile in Europe, particularly in France. But the GIA also receives considerable aid from Iran and 
Sudan. The U.S. should seek to cut this aid by punishing Iran and Sudan on as many fronts as 
possible. Senator Alfonse D'Amato's proposed legislation to ban all U.S. trade with Iran and punish 
corporations that continue such trade, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Act of 1995, would be a 
step in the right direction. Washington also should press Saudi Arabia to crack down further on the 
financial support that wealthy Saudi Islamists have provided to Algerian Islamists. U.S. intelligence 
agencies should cooperate with their European counterparts to reduce the flow of money and arms 
to Algerian insurgents from Algerian expatriates in Europe.
<p>
<li> Prevent future Algerias. There is little Washington can do in the short run to defeat Islamic 
revolutionaries in Algeria. But in the long run, the U.S. can seek to prevent friendly secular regimes 
in other Arab countries from making the same mistakes that Algeria's FLN regime made. This 
means:
<ul>
<li> Encouraging free-market economic reforms that fuel economic growth and provide jobs and hope 
to the unemployed youth who serve as the vanguard of Islamic revolutions. 
<p>
<li> Encouraging the emergence of a European Union-Maghreb free-market area to bolster export-
driven job growth in North Africa.
<p>
<li> Encouraging the development of secular political parties that can give voice to political 
opposition and keep Islamists based in mosques from attaining a monopoly over political protest.
<p>
<li> Taking a go-slow approach to democratization. The U.S. should stress the building of civil 
society and pluralism, not just holding elections. Algeria's rush to elections gave the Islamists an 
advantage over other political movements that were not as organized or prepared.
<p>
<li> Paying more attention to the education of the young. Islamists gained a solid foothold in Algeria 
in part because the Algerian government carelessly imported hundreds of Egyptian teachers who 
sympathized with the Muslim Brotherhood as part of its "Arabization" program in the 1970s. The 
U.S. should encourage North African states to duplicate the Tunisian model of education, which 
has greatly reduced the appeal of radical Islam among the young.
</ul></ul><P>

<b>CONCLUSION
</b><P>
Algeria's fate will be decided by Algerians. But the U.S. can and should apply the lessons it learned 
from its experience with Iran to avoid making Algeria's situation worse. Rather than try to appease 
Islamists, an approach that is doomed to failure, the U.S. should break off its dangerous flirtation. 
Islamic "moderates" are a mirage. They cannot be depended upon to restrain terrorism or deliver a 
political settlement. Washington should work to isolate the Islamists and help prevent them from 
seizing power, not facilitate a cosmetic power-sharing agreement that enables them to seize power. 
<p>
There is no short-term solution to Algeria's problems. The U.S. should focus instead on long-term 
political, economic, and educational reforms, as well as appropriate security measures, that can 
prevent future Algerias. If Islamists do seize power, the U.S. must work with France, Morocco, 
Tunisia, Egypt, and other interested countries to devise and implement a patient, firm, and 
concerted containment policy to prevent the spread of Islamic revolution from Algeria.

Boutros Boutros-Ghali on June 19 proclaimed his intention to seek a second five-year term as Secretary General of the United Nations, shrugging off the Clinton Administration's indecisive behind-the-scenes efforts to induce him to step down after his term expires on December 31, 1996. A second term for Boutros-Ghali would be a disastrous setback for the cause of U.N. reform. The Secretary General not only has dragged his feet on long-overdue organizational and managerial reforms, but also has sought aggressively to expand both his own power and that of the already overextended U.N. bureaucracy. Now that the Clinton Administration's efforts to dissuade Boutros-Ghali from clinging to power have failed, the Administration should mount a relentless diplomatic campaign to block his plans for a second term and work to find a more suitable successor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The next Secretary General should be someone who will systematically reform the U.N.'s bloated bureaucracy, root out the U.N.'s long-standing bias against free market economic policies, and consolidate U.N. operations to focus on the tasks that the organization was designed to accomplish and is best-equipped to fulfill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Boutros-Ghali already has squandered his opportunity to put the U.N. on the right footing. In 1993, the Secretary General sought to suppress a report by Under-Secretary General for Administration and Management Richard Thornburgh which concluded that "The United Nations presently is almost totally lacking in effective means to deal with fraud, waste, and abuse by staff members."  Boutros-Ghali subsequently established an Inspector General's office, as recommended by the report, but refused to give it the independence it must have to do its job effectively.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Under Boutros-Ghali's leadership, the U.N. has accelerated its slide toward bankruptcy. The U.N. budget has increased 20 percent since 1991. Expanded peacekeeping missions have pushed up peacekeeping costs from $700 million in 1990 to $3.5 billion in 1994. But instead of slashing spending, Boutros-Ghali has sought to boost funding. Last January, he proposed that the U.N. acquire the power to levy taxes on fossil fuels, international travel, and currency transactions. Instead of forcing the U.N. to live within its means, he wants to empower the organization to acquire new functions, such as a standing army under his command that could lead to even more costly and dangerous peace-enforcement missions. These power grabs by the empire-building Secretary General are troubling because they set back reform efforts and dilute the U.N.'s accountability to member states. Moreover, they represent an infringement on and usurpation of the sovereignty of those member states. Boutros-Ghali's long-term agenda appears to be to acquire the trappings of sovereignty for the U.N., transforming it from an international organization composed of 185 member governments into a supranational government directed by an increasingly independent and powerful Secretary General.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.N. Secretary General is chosen in two steps: The Security Council nominates a candidate to the U.N. General Assembly, and the General Assembly then must approve the selection by majority vote. In practice, the power to select a new Secretary General rests with the Security Council, since the General Assembly has never rejected its nominee. A successful candidate must have the backing of nine of the Security Council's 15 member states, including all five permanent members (Britain, China, France, Russia, and the U.S.). This gives Washington veto power over the selection of the U.N.'s highest official.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Yet, despite Boutros-Ghali's poor record, the Clinton Administration has been dragging its feet on exercising its veto over a second term. Administration officials until recently held off on taking a public position to avoid a confrontation with the Secretary General and the countries that support his plans for a second term. In the absence of a clear signal from Washington, alternative candidates remained reluctant to challenge the incumbent Secretary General openly. He enjoys the strong backing of China, France, and Russia, while Britain has signaled that it will not stand in his way. Only the U.S. can deny Boutros-Ghali another term, given his assiduous cultivation of African and Asian support in the General Assembly, but the Clinton Administration until recently remained asleep at the switch.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Now the Administration must veto another term for Boutros-Ghali and find a suitable successor who will:<ul>

<p><li><b>Advocate aggressive organizational, personnel, and managerial reform of the U.N.</b> A dynamic reformer is needed to shake the entrenched U.N. bureaucracy from its lethargy, overcome decades of mismanagement, and end hiring practices based on political criteria and patronage. The top-heavy organizational structure of the U.N. secretariat needs to be streamlined; modern management techniques should be imposed; and a powerful Inspector General independent of the Secretary General should be established to root out waste, fraud, and abuse. The U.S.-backed "unitary U.N."  concept should be adopted to enhance coordination among disparate U.N. agencies and eliminate wasteful duplication of effort. The U.N.'s budget process needs to be revamped to make the relationship between cost and functions "transparent."

<p><LI><b>Support free-market economic reforms.</b> The U.N. long has been permeated by advocates of discredited statist economic policies that have been tried and discarded by many of its member states. The time has come to lift the dead hand of socialism from the U.N.'s rudder. The next Secretary General should seek to eradicate the U.N.'s hostility to free-market economic policies and forcefully lead U.N. organs to promote entrepreneurial liberty and legal safeguards for property rights as a way to stoke economic growth by unleashing the private sector.

<p><li><b>Focus the U.N. on what it was designed to do and is best able to do.</b> The U.N.'s most important mandate is to help maintain international peace and security through collective measures. But the organization's reach has exceeded its ability to accomplish this task as peacekeeping increasingly has become peace-enforcement, as in Bosnia and Somalia. The U.N. needs to step back from the overly ambitious peacekeeping schemes and the standing army proposed by Boutros-Ghali and focus its efforts on more limited goals. The new Secretary General also must recognize that the U.N. has limited capabilities and move to redirect U.N. efforts toward realistic goals in other areas as well. The U.N. should abandon unreachable utopian goals such as "eradicating poverty" or "health care for all by the year 2000."  Instead, its economic and social programs should concentrate on attainable goals and useful activities such as providing disaster relief and assisting refugees in the world's poorest regions. The U.N. should get out of the foreign aid business altogether. Its efforts to promote economic development and nation-building have produced meager results at exorbitant cost.

<p><li><b>Stake a claim to leadership by virtue of administrative ability and accomplishments, regardless of national origin.</b> The Secretary General's primary responsibility is as chief administrator of the U.N. secretariat, which has roughly 10,000 employees. This requires considerable managerial skill, particularly if a radical overhaul of U.N. operations is to be accomplished. The new Secretary General should be chosen without regard to national origin. The current practice of limiting candidates to nonaligned countries is a relic of the Cold War. 
The U.N. desperately needs to recruit an energetic reformer as Secretary General to consolidate its operations, overhaul its bureaucracy, resolve its financial crisis, and lead it into the next century. Boutros-Ghali squandered the opportunity to carry out these tasks and would be even less likely to accomplish them in a second term. The U.S. must insist that the next Secretary General be mindful that the U.N. is an international organization, not a supranational government. The U.N. needs more of a secretary and less of a general.

<a href="fyi101t5.gif">Table 5</a>: Recipients of  U.S. Foreign Aid and Their Votes Against U.S. Supported Issues in the U.N.<br>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last year, Congress tried to cut the U.S.  foreign aid budget as part of its plan to reduce wasteful government spending and balance the federal budget deficit.  Moreover, both houses of Congress passed legislation that would have abolished the Agency for International Development, the U.S.  agency responsible for most of America's $13 billion foreign aid program, along with most of its functions.  Because the Clinton Administration fought these proposals, Congress was unable to make more significant cuts in foreign aid or eliminate these wasteful government functions.
The Clinton Administration says foreign aid supports America's interests overseas.  It claims, for example, that U.S.  aid helps America gain influence with countries around the world and that these countries generally support America's foreign policy goals.  A quick look at the facts, however, shows that these arguments are groundless.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One measurement of America's influence around the world is the voting records of U.S.  foreign aid recipients in the United Nations.  If a direct connection exists between foreign aid and winning friends overseas, as the Administration asserts, recipients should be voting with the U.S.  in the U.N.  most of the time.  In fact, they do not.  The data show that most recipients of foreign aid vote against the U.S.  most of the time.  Consider the following fact gathered from the 1995 U.N.  session:
<p><ul>
<li><b>64 percent of U.S.  foreign aid recipients</b> voted against the U.S.  a majority of the time.
<p>
<li><b>India,</b> the fifth-largest recipient with some $157 million in U.S.  foreign aid this year, voted against the U.S.  83 percent of the time.  That is as often as Cuba and more often than Iran.
<p>
<li><b>The ten countries</b> that voted against the U.S.  the most frequently will receive over $212 million in foreign aid in FY 1996 (see <a href="fyi101t1.gif">Table 1</a>).
<p>
<li><b>Seven of the ten largest recipients</b> of U.S.  foreign aid voted against the U.S.  a majority of the time (see <a href="fyi101t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
<p>
<li><b>Of the ten countries</b> that voted with the U.S.  the most often, nine are former Soviet bloc countries (see <a href="fyi101t3.gif">Table 3</a>).
<p>
<li><b>Egypt,</b> the second largest recipient of American foreign aid, voted against the U.S.  67 percent of the time.  This is worse than the 1994 session, when Egypt voted against the U.S.  65 percent of the time.  Egypt will receive some $2.2 billion in U.S.  foreign aid in FY 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Haiti,</b> where President Bill Clinton sent American troops to restore deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, voted against the U.S.  60 percent of the time during the1996 session.  Despite this, the U.S.  will send some $124 million in foreign aid to Haiti in FY 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Mexico,</b> where President Bill Clinton fought for a $40 billion international economic bailout, most of which will come from U.S.  taxpayers, voted against the U.S.  58 percent of the time.  In addition to its $40 billion economic bailout plan, the Clinton Administration has endorsed another $25 million in foreign aid for Mexico.
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There may be many reasons why a country votes with or against the U.S.  at the U.N.  But it is clear from these data that foreign aid does not win friends where it counts:  in supporting U.S.  diplomatic initiatives at the United Nations.  Clearly, the U.S.  foreign aid program in general, and under the Clinton Administration in particular, has done little to justify public confidence that tax dollars are being used wisely by America's foreign aid bureaucracy.  President Clinton has defended two of his biggest foreign policy and economic initiatives -- "restoring" democracy in Haiti and the economic bailout of Mexico -- as in the U.S.  national interest.  Yet these countries seem to care little about Americas interests when it comes to supporting the U.S.  at the U.N.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should evaluate the extent to which U.S.  recipients of foreign aid support America's national interests.  U.N.  voting records clearly show that a majority of recipients of U.S.  foreign aid vote against the U.S.  most of the time.  In fact, the data show that some of these countries actually undermine U.S.  interests abroad.  For example, South Africa, America's sixth largest recipient of foreign aid is quickly extending relations to some of America's biggest enemies:  Cuba, Iran, and Libya.  This fiscal year, South Africa will receive some $132 million in U.S.  foreign aid.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why, then, is the U.S.  spending so much money on countries that obviously care little about America's interests abroad?  And why is the Clinton Administration fighting to save this program when most Americans are opposed to it?  This year, when the U.S.  foreign aid budget is scrutinized by Congress as a target for reaching a balanced budget, Congress would do well to cut the program further and seek to abolish the Agency for International Development.

<title>The U.N. Tax: Not Now, Not Ever -- Heritage</title>

<center>
<h3>THE U.N. TAX: NOT NOW, NOT EVER</h3>

Thomas P. Sheehy<br>
Jay Kingham Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs<br>
<P>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 445<br>
February 9, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
wants to give the U.N. the authority to tax Americans and others around the world. In expressing 
frustration over the perilous state of his organization's finances, the U.N. chief made known his 
support for U.N. taxes during a January lecture and follow-up media discussion at Oxford 
University. Soon afterwards, several prominent Members of Congress made clear their opposition 
to this scheme. In the Senate, Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), Foreign Relations Committee 
Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC), and several other Senators have sponsored a bill which bars U.S. 
payments to the U.N. if it attempts to implement a tax. Similar legislation has been introduced in 
the House.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Senator Dole and others are right to oppose U.N. taxes on 
Americans. They recognize that the problem with the U.N. is not a lack of funding. Years of U.N. 
funding by America and its allies have allowed the organization to become bloated and poorly 
managed. The real problem with the U.N. is twofold: its resistance to reform and its subtle yet 
growing infringement upon national sovereignty.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Seeking Independence.</b> The U.N. is in a state 
of financial crisis. It is owed roughly $2.5 billion in overdue assessments from its member states. 
The U.S., the U.N.'s largest financial supporter (paying 25 percent of its budget), accounts for some 
$1 billion of this amount, but Washington is not alone. Roughly half of the U.N.'s 185 member 
states have not paid their full U.N. dues. Under Secretary General for Administration and 
Management Joseph Connor admitted a few weeks ago that the U.N.'s financial situation is 
"precarious and headed for the brink."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Boutros-Ghali believes that giving the U.N. taxing power 
could eliminate or minimize the problem of overdue bills from member states. He also thinks it 
would give the U.N. a greater degree of financial independence. At Oxford University, the 
Secretary General said, "It is time to seriously address the need for a United Nations that can 
operate on a secure and steady independent financial foundation."  The Secretary General discussed 
a range of international taxes, including taxes on fossil fuels, international travel, and currency 
transactions -- for example, a tax of a British pound on every non-domestic airplane ticket. This is 
not the first time the Secretary General has expressed sympathy for a U.N. tax. In 1992, he 
suggested that the U.N. tax either international arms sales or international air travel to pay for its 
peacekeeping operations. At Oxford, the Secretary General told the British Broadcasting Company, 
"I'm sure we will win in the end and that we will obtain from the international community [an 
understanding] that we need to have our own income."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Secretary General's proposals were not made off the 
cuff. The idea of giving the U.N. financial independence through taxing power is supported by 
some member states and the U.N. bureaucracy. Numerous proposals to tax international goods and 
services, the use of the oceans and outer space, and international financial transactions have been 
made in the General Assembly. The <i>Human Development Report</i>, a publication of the 
United Nations Development Program, a foreign aid organization, has championed a global tax to 
fund the U.N. system. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, Australian Foreign 
Minister Gareth Evans, and Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto have publicly endorsed 
various U.N. tax ideas. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>U.N. Ambitions.</b> The Secretary General's 
confidence is in keeping with the expansive course he has set for the world body. As the first post-
Cold War Secretary General, Boutros-Ghali assumed office at a time of high expectations for the 
U.N. This was the era of the "New World Order," as pronounced by President George Bush in 
1991. In his 1992 report <i>Agenda for Peace</i>, the Secretary General suggested that national 
sovereignty was weakening now that the Cold War had ended. This climate of opinion set the stage 
for the U.N. peacekeeping operation in Somalia, which essentially assumed sovereignty over that 
war-wracked country. Boutros-Ghali also supports the creation of a U.N. standing army that would 
be under his command. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The ability to control territory and command an army, like 
the ability to tax, represents the exercise of sovereign power. The U.N. should never have this 
power; it would be a usurpation of the constitutional rights of the American people. These rights are 
protected by the U.S. government, not the U.N. The U.N. does not represent the interests of 
Americans; it represents the interests of its 185 member states, many of which are undemocratic 
and repressive.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Real Problem at the U.N.</b>The real 
problem at the U.N. is not a lack of funding. In fact, U.N. spending has been mushrooming, and 
that is the real problem. The U.N. regular budget has increased 20 percent since 1991. 
Peacekeeping costs have ballooned to $3.5 billion a year in 1994; in 1990, peacekeeping cost less 
than $700 million a year. As might be expected, such increases in spending have been accompanied 
by serious waste. In fact, the U.N. system wastes much of its approximately $10 billion budget. For 
example:
<p><ul>
<li> In 1995, the U.N. scrapped a never-used $1 million turnstile security system at its New York 
headquarters. The reason: The turnstile clocks would have tracked the arrival and departures of 
U.N. employees.
<p>
<li> Various agencies of the U.N. spent approximately $1 million a day at the height of the Somalia 
peacekeeping operation in 1993. This included renting hundreds of apartments equipped with air 
conditioning. After all this, the Somalia mission was a failure.
<p>
<li> In 1995, the U.N. spent some $500,000 for a two-week conference on the Sustainable 
Development of Small Island Developing States. The U.N. spent $15,000 to fly representatives 
from the Western Sahara to this conference in Barbados. No one explained how the Sahara Desert 
qualified as a "small island developing state."
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.N.'s problems go beyond waste and corruption. The 
U.N. needs a major organizational overhaul, and its bureaucracy needs to be trimmed. But the 
Clinton Administration has not been successful in promoting reform at the U.N. The U.N. Inspector 
General office it supported has been limited in scope and characterized as a "disappointment" by 
Representative Lee Hamilton (D-IN) and Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), two Members of 
Congress who have long championed U.N. reform. More telling is the Administration's admitted 
failure to keep the U.N. budget in check. In December, a high-ranking U.S. official at the U.N. 
noted that the organization's 1996-1997 budget is "higher than we would have preferred and 
recommended."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even if the Administration did push for fundamental 
reform, however, it would not find an ally in the Secretary General. Boutros-Ghali has not 
demonstrated any desire for real change. He ordered that a 1993 report critical of U.N. reform 
progress, written by then Under Secretary General for Administration and Management Richard 
Thornburgh, be suppressed. If given more independence from critical review, which Boutros-
Ghali's tax proposal implies, the Secretary General presemably would become even less interested 
in reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Conclusion.</b> Senator Dole, Senator Helms, and 
others were right to oppose the U.N. tax idea. The Clinton Administration also was right to reject 
Boutros-Ghali's tax proposal. But U.N. bureaucrats have not given up hope. In September 1996, the 
U.N. Working Group on Finances will submit a report on financing to the U.N. General Assembly. 
This report may very well recommend a U.N. tax scheme. If it does, the proposal may gain support 
from other countries, leaving the U.S. once again in the position of being pressured by other nations 
to adopt U.N. proposals that harm American interests. If this happens, the Clinton Administration 
needs to make clear to the U.N. and other countries that U.N. taxes are unacceptable. The last thing 
the U.N. needs is more money and less accountability.

<title>The UN's 50th Anniversary: Time for Reform, Not Celebration</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>THE U.N.'s 50th ANNIVERSARY: TIME FOR REFORM, NOT CELEBRATION</h3>
By Thomas P. Sheehy<br>
Jay Kingham Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum 434<br>
October 20, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>


The Clinton Administration and many other governments worldwide have been turning up the rhetoric for the United Nations' 50th anniversary. The celebration is set to culminate early next week when most heads of state, including President Bill Clinton, address the U.N. General Assembly. Amid all the standard accolades for the U.N., the President is bound to raise the issue of reform. Even Ambassador Madeleine Albright, who is second to none in her enthusiasm for the U.N., says the world body is an "elephantine" organization in need of reform. But to reform the U.N., the Clinton Administration will have to do more than talk. Among other steps, it will have to:<p>
<ul>
<li>Cut funding for U.N. peacekeeping,
<p>
<li>Eliminate funding for big U.N. conferences, and
<p>
<li>Eliminate funding for the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</ul><p>
<b>Working Around the Edges.</b> In large part because the 104th Congress is increasingly skeptical about the value of the U.N., the Clinton Administration has given U.N. reform a sense of urgency. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a September 25 address to the General Assembly, declared that "The U.N. bureaucracy should be smaller, with a clear organizational structure and sharp lines of responsibility."  Christopher then went on to propose a "concrete agenda" of reform which includes ending programs that have achieved their purpose, consolidating overlapping programs, downsizing regional economic commissions, adopting a moratorium on big conferences, streamlining the Secretariat, extending the scope of the Inspector General to the entire U.N. system, and expanding Security Council membership. Several other proposals would affect peacekeeping, including subjecting proposed missions to more rigorous scrutiny.  
<p>
These measures, while welcome, would change the way the U.N. operates only marginally. Expanding the scope of the Inspector General will matter little as long as the office remains what Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and Representative Lee Hamilton (D-IN) call a "disappointment."  Former Under-Secretary General for Administration and Management Dick Thornburgh wrote in 1993 that "The United Nations... is almost totally lacking in effective means to deal with fraud, waste and abuse by staff members."  It appears that the Inspector General, recently established and lacking essential powers, has not been the remedy.
<p>
The sincerity of the Clinton Administration's commitment to some of these reforms is doubtful. The moratorium on big conferences, for example, is odd given that the Administration has boasted frequently of its participation in these events. Vice President Al Gore went to the Cairo Conference on Population and Development in 1994; the Vice President accompanied Hillary Clinton to the Copenhagen Social Summit last March; and Mrs. Clinton and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala attended the recent Fourth Women's Conference in Beijing. The Clinton Administration's opposition to these wasteful talkfests rings hollow. 
<p>
<b>Toward Real Reform.</b> Instead of waiting for the U.N. bureaucracy to act, the U.S. should take the lead in pressing for needed reforms. Specifically, the U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Cut funding for U.N. peacekeeping.</b> U.N. peacekeeping has grown considerably in size and scope over the last several years. There now are 16 peacekeeping operations worldwide, and the U.S. peacekeeping bill is some $1.1 billion a year, up from only $64 million in 1988. Many U.N. peacekeeping missions have floundered, most notably in Somalia and Bosnia. Generally, these are "second generation" peacekeeping missions in which U.N. forces enter hostile environments in the hope of forging peace and providing humanitarian aid. These misguided efforts have brought the U.N. close to financial ruin. The U.N. peacekeeping account is now nearly $1 billion in the red. 
<p>
Despite opposition from the Clinton Administration, Congress has moved to reduce America's contribution to U.N. peacekeeping. The House in June cut one peacekeeping account to around $425 million, which is some $100 million less than last year. (The U.S. funds peacekeeping through several accounts.) A Senate bill -- the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995 (S. 908) -- gradually reduces the annual U.S. contribution to peacekeeping to some $200 million by 1999. If implemented, these reductions would ensure that the U.N. sticks to traditional peacekeeping operations, such as in Cyprus, and would put a stop to the risky and senseless expansion of U.N. peacekeeping operations to include "peace-enforcement." 
<p>
<li><b>Eliminate funding for big U.N. conferences.</b> These conferences cost millions of dollars and typically are long on rhetoric and short on achievement. The Social Summit, for example, focused on "Creating Jobs" and "Building Solidarity," two objectives well beyond the capabilities of a one-time gathering of national and international bureaucrats. The 1996 City Summit to be held in Istanbul will develop a "global plan of action" to address every conceivable urban problem, including crime and transportation inadequacies. If the U.S is truly interested in ending support for blatantly counterproductive programs, it should withdraw its funding for the City Summit now. 
<p>
<li><b>Eliminate funding for the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).</b> The UNDP is one of a bewildering array of specialized agencies in the U.N. system. It is charged with, among other objectives, "contribut[ing] to a sustainable expansion of the world economy."  Essentially, the UNDP is a foreign aid program. These activities are beyond what should be the scope of the United Nations:  acting primarily as a forum for discussion of international security matters while undertaking such other focused activities as humanitarian relief efforts. Moreover, the notion that foreign aid can promote economic development has been proven fallacious. The countries which have lifted themselves out of poverty, such as Chile and Hong Kong, have done so largely because they were deprived of foreign aid, not because they received any money from the U.N. 
</ul><p>
The Clinton Administration recognizes that the U.N. badly needs reform. Even the President, who once embraced "assertive multilateralism," has come to recognize that the U.N. wastes U.S. taxpayer dollars. The Administration is misguided, however, in thinking that its reforms go far enough. Much more needs to be done. The Congress has the opportunity to promote the establishment of a realistic U.S.-U.N. relationship, one in line with the U.N.'s limited accomplishments and potential. With its American funding reduced, the U.N. will be forced to adopt discipline in taking on peacekeeping missions and reduce the number of its wasteful undertakings. Otherwise, the current U.S. reform campaign will be yet another wasted opportunity on the long road to reforming the U.N.

<h2>THE U.N. AT FIFTY: NO KEY TO PEACE</h2><br>
By <br>Thomas P. Sheehy<br>
Jay Kingham Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #419<br>
June 9, 1995<br>

<hr size="3" width="50%"><br></center>


	President Bill Clinton will be in San Francisco on June 26 to participate in the 50th anniversary celebration of the signing of the United Nations Charter. It was in June of 1945 that war-weary America took the lead in founding the U.N., harboring high hopes that it would become a major force in advancing world peace. But the U.N. has failed to live up to these expectations. After 50 years it has become clear that the U.N. is only a marginal player in establishing international peace.<p>

	President Clinton apparently believes otherwise. In his recent New Hampshire discussion with House Speaker Newt Gingrich, President Clinton suggested that the U.N. had been instrumental in keeping the peace during the Cold War. The President soon after corrected himself by noting "that the United Nations didn't keep all the peace in the last 50 years." <p>

	While in San Francisco the President should be careful not to exaggerate the U.N.'s importance. The U.N. has been, and will continue to be, of only marginal relevance to international peace and security. Suggesting otherwise only sets the stage for future policy debacles involving the U.S. military. The President also should resist committing U.S. support to anything other than traditional U.N. peacekeeping operations, such as in Cyprus, where peacekeepers act as buffers between parties who have ceased hostilities.<p>

	Flawed Premise. U.N. peacekeeping turns disastrous when it takes the form of "peacemaking."  Many factors have contributed to U.N. peacekeeping failures in Somalia, Bosnia, and elsewhere, including poor U.N. organization and inevitable disagreements over objectives among nations contributing troops. These shortcomings have led many to suggest such reforms as upgrading U.N. peacekeeping facilities in New York and establishing a standing U.N. army. The problem with peacemaking, however, is more fundamental.<p>

	When trying to deter one or more combatants from achieving their goals through the force of arms, the essence of "peacemaking," U.N. forces quickly become just another group of combatants. In Bosnia, for example, U.N. peacekeepers essentially are warring with the Bosnian Serbs. U.N. forces playing this role are unlikely to succeed in coercing combatants into peace. The constrained mandates which the U.N. typically issues, moreover, do not allow for the complete destruction of the military capabilities of combatants, which often is a prerequisite to political settlements.<p>

	More important, the countries providing peacekeepers have considerably less interest in the conflicts than do the forces their troops are fighting. As casualties are incurred, pressure mounts to bring the troops home. The Bosnian Serbs understand this very well. The result is often a half-hearted and ultimately futile operation that suffers casualties in vain, as the U.S. did in Somalia.<p>

	When major states, particularly the U.S., are unwilling to suffer casualties in conflicts of little direct interest to them, they often are derided for a lack of "leadership."  Many critics of Washington's policy on Bosnia have suggested that the U.S. is shirking its international responsibility as a leader by shying away from the inevitable casualties that would result from forcefully intervening in that centuries-old conflict. Some commentators even have suggested that the U.S. hesitancy to intervene in Bosnia and elsewhere, including Somalia before President Bush committed troops there, is immoral. The "immoral" policy, however, is to suffer casualties in a conflict with no bearing to American national security and soon after to abandon the U.S. commitment, as was done in Somalia. <p>

	Calculations of the national interest undermine the notion of global collective security upon which the entire U.N. approach to security is based. The fact is that nations never have, nor will they ever, consider a threat to peace anywhere as a threat to peace everywhere. Members of the League of Nations were unwilling to defend Ethiopia against Italian aggression in 1935; the Europeans and Americans are unwilling to mount a vigorous defense of Bosnia today.<p>

	U.N. Way or No Way? Recognizing global collective security as a myth is not tantamount to saying that no collective action is possible or even necessary. Collective action on a regional basis, such as in NATO and during the Persian Gulf War, whether or not it is sanctioned by the U.N., undoubtedly is the best way to maintain international peace and stability. <p>

	It is a red herring to suggest, as the Clinton Administration does, that without the U.N. the U.S. will be forced "to act alone or not at all."  This represents an odd reading of history. The U.S. has acted in concert with allies in most of its international conflicts. NATO, perhaps the most successful security pact in history, is a multilateral, not international, organization. The real fear of many who raise the "all or nothing" canard is not for American security, but for the prestige of the U.N., which suffers considerably without active American participation.<p>

	The Next 50 Years. Some analysts and politicians argue that the U.S. should use the U.N. only to serve its interests. The archetype is President Bush's securing U.N. approval for the Persian Gulf War. Proponents of this modus operandi must recognize, however, that using the U.N. in this way establishes a precedent for future U.S. action. As a result, bypassing the Security Council has become more politically difficult. <p>

	This trend is particularly troubling because U.S. influence within the Security Council is likely to diminish. The Security Council may be expanded beyond its current five permanent and ten rotating members. Brazil, India, Nigeria, Japan, and Germany have been discussed as possible members to possess veto power. The Clinton Administration has expressed support for granting permanent Security Council seats to developing countries. Any Security Council expansion, of course, will diminish U.S. influence, making the achievement of approval for U.S. actions to defend its national interest more difficult, particularly as many of the states represented in the U.N. today share none of the values enshrined in the U.N. Charter.<p>

	It is wrong to blame the U.N. for foolish American policies. The U.N. cannot force America to act against its security interests. It did not drive President Bush to send U.S. troops to Somalia or order Washington's European allies into their Bosnia quagmire. U.N. influence is more subtle. It is exercised mainly through U.S. policymakers who want either to hide behind the U.N. to avoid action or, conversely, to use it to drag the U.S. into conflicts which it should otherwise avoid.<p>

	While in San Francisco, the President should remember an unassailable fact about international politics:  The U.N. does not transcend "mere" national interests. Rhetoric which belittles the American national interest, however indirectly, only encourages debacles like Somalia. The loss of 30 lives in that failed U.N. operation is a high price to pay for an empty dream.<p>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">J</FONT></B>ust the other day, it seems, the national debate about the U.S. role in the United 
Nations turned for the most part on the issue of money--on U.S. contributions and U.N. 
waste, and how reducing the former might diminish the latter. That issue remains. In 
1994, the U.S. spent no less than $3.5 billion on a largely dysfunctional U.N. system--
with scant returns as measured by U.S. national interests. (See sidebar.)</P>
<P>	But the debate has a scary new dimension. The U.N. is reinventing what used to 
be called "peacekeeping." In the last several years, that do-good concept has been 
stretched to encompass a range of U.N. operations that typically involve the use of force, 
even the waging of war. Moreover, President Clinton's U.N. representatives are willing 
collaborators in developing a one-size-fits-all justification for multilateral interventions 
that bear only the most attenuated relation to U.S. interests--if any at all.</P>
<P>	And that, along with peacekeeping's mounting bills, adds up to serious business 
indeed.</P>
<P>	It is now the business of the 104th Congress. As a component of its Contract with 
America, the House of Representatives already has passed the National Security 
Revitalization Act, which reins in the wild proliferation of U.N. peacekeeping, limits U.S. 
participation in these operations, and imposes some controls on U.S. contributions to the 
U.N. generally. The next orders of business are to fend off efforts in the Senate to weaken 
these provisions--which constitute only a minimal package--and then to be vigilant 
about implementation. The question still to be answered is what the U.N. is worth to us--
whether, that is to say, the U.S. gets back in national priorities anything commensurate 
with its $3.5 billion annual investment.</P>
<P>	Ten years ago, there was a consensus in the United States that radical surgery was 
called for. Numerous studies and investigations, many of them instigated by the U.N. 
itself, had revealed a pattern of waste, mismanagement, and duplication (see sidebar, page 
66). The U.N.'s socioeconomic agenda called for the redistribution of wealth from the 
industrialized democracies to the less-developed countries of the Third World. On the 
political side, national-liberation movements (good) and colonialism (bad) were the 
buzzwords of choice.</P>
<P>	As a result, a Democratic-controlled Congress in 1984 overwhelmingly approved 
the Kassebaum-Solomon Amendment to the authorization of the U.S.'s 25 percent share 
of the U.N.'s administrative budget. The terms of the amendment seemed unambiguous: 
Shape up, impose fiscal discipline on yourself, and move toward some form of weighted 
voting on the U.N. budget in the General Assembly, with "bonus" votes for big 
contributors in rough proportion to their contributions, or else suffer an annual 20 percent 
withholding of the U.S. payment.</P>
<P>	Now, let the record show that Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and 
Representative Gerald Solomon (R-NY) had the right idea then--that the U.N. had to be 
reformed if ever it were to become a useful agent of world order--and it is the right idea 
still. But for the most part, Kassebaum-Solomon failed. Congress is now back at work on 
the problems of a dysfunctional U.N., using the power of the purse as one lever of 
reform. The problems have deepened, however, both in complexity and in their deadly 
import. The U.N. has recently engaged in the promiscuous use of force under the 
authority of resolutions that may violate its own charter, and the Clinton administration 
has been willing, even eager, to plunge into the resulting swamp.</P>

<H3>The Peacekeeping Trap</H3>
<P>	Kassebaum-Solomon <I>redux</I> is embodied in the new House act; and, in the Senate, 
a companion bill covers some of the same ground. Both are reasonable first cuts at 
shaping a long-term policy. U.S. costs and U.N. waste are still at issue. But these bills 
focus on U.N. peacekeeping--which is itself a misnomer, and a dangerously misleading 
one.</P>
<P>	The U.N. peacekeeping budget and its expansive peacekeeping agenda are 
escalating out of control. In 1994, the U.S. was assessed almost $1.2 billion for what the 
U.N. calls peacekeeping operations. (The U.S. share is supposed to be fixed at 30.4 
percent, but in fact has crept up to 31.7 percent.) On top of that, the U.S. volunteered in-
kind operational support services--ranging from air- and sealift to armored personnel 
carriers to state-of-the-art communications and intelligence assets--that are valued in the 
House bill's "findings" at $1.7 billion in 1994. (Sources within the national-security 
establishment set their value at close to $2 billion. The administration claims that a major 
part has been reimbursed, but exactly how much is unclear.) These costs were skimmed 
off U.S. defense appropriations that were never intended for peacekeeping or any other 
U.N. program.</P>
<P>	This has contributed to a state of unreadiness in the U.S. military. Appearing 
before a House appropriations subcommittee on January 25th, General John 
Shalikashvili, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and Defense Secretary William 
Perry conceded as much. They attributed about half of a $2.6 billion defense 
supplemental request to "unanticipated" U.N. peacekeeping costs: $600 million for Haiti 
alone, another $312 million for Bosnia, and lesser amounts for other operations.</P>
<P>	As recently as 1990 or 1991, U.N. peacekeeping was pretty much just that: the 
assignment of ad hoc U.N. forces to monitor truces, police cease-fires, and provide 
buffers between contending parties. These forces prided themselves on scrupulous 
neutrality, and were deployed with the agreement of the parties. The models were 
Kashmir, Cyprus, Lebanon, or the Sinai (where it all began in the 1950s). These were the 
renowned Blue Helmets, drawn from the armed forces of smaller countries (such as Fiji, 
Ghana, Ireland, and Norway); they collectively and deservedly received two Nobel Peace 
prizes. The U.N. peacekeeping budget was appropriately modest and generally 
predictable from year to year. A decade ago, the entire U.S. contribution to the U.N. for 
all programs was less than the U.S. assessment for peacekeeping alone in 1994 
(excluding the "free" support services).</P>
<P>	But now U.N. peacekeeping means almost anything--feeding the hungry, 
responding to "911 calls" (Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's favorite 
formulation), holding elections, building national infrastructure--that the U.N. wants it to 
mean. And this is a U.N. that is avidly seeking "new" missions in the post-Cold War 
world.</P>
<P>	In Cambodia, peacekeeping meant preparing for "free and fair" elections in what 
essentially remains a war zone. Yet the Vietnam-controlled regime that lost the elections 
is still effectively in power. Cost: in excess of $2 billion.</P>
<P>	In Somalia, peacekeeping meant pacifying warring tribal factions, then feeding 
the war's innocent victims, then (unsuccessfully) running the principal warlord to ground. 
Now the warring factions are back at it. Cost: $1.5 billion and counting, plus 30 
Americans and scores of other troops dead. In Haiti, peacekeeping meant invading a 
sovereign country (without opposition or casualties, fortunately) to restore a deposed 
president. With operational control now passing from the U.S. to the U.N., there are 
disquieting signs that violence could resume. Cost: as much as $1 billion so far, and no 
telling how much more for how much longer (one estimate is about $180 million for the 
next six months).</P>
<P>	In Bosnia and Croatia, peacekeeping has become surreal. A force of almost 
25,000 keeps open supply lines to civilian populations--whenever the Serbs choose to let 
the convoys through. The U.N. command has demarcated various "safe havens," which 
the attacking Serbs have violated with impunity. Retaliatory NATO airstrikes, which 
require U.N. concurrence, have been too little, too late. This U.N. peacekeeping force 
cost more than $1 billion in 1994. A "peace-enforcement" operation of open-ended 
duration, with peace nowhere in sight, may require at least 50,000 troops at an annual 
cost of $3 billion. The recently retired U.N. commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Sir 
Michael Rose of the United Kingdom, may have said more than he intended in a BBC 
documentary: "We are not here to protect or defend anything other than ourselves or our 
convoys."</P>
<P>	The point is not that these U.N. operations are all without merit. But all of them 
were set in motion under Chapters VI and VII of the U.N. Charter as responses to "threats 
to peace and international security"--and, except for Bosnia, where even the U.N. claims 
only a "humanitarian" mission, not one of them meets that rigorous standard. They are of 
questionable legitimacy, and the U.S. picks up 31.7 percent of the tab.</P>
<P>	Besides paying the biggest share of the bills, the U.S. has acceded to all of these 
operations as one of the Security Council's permanent five. In Haiti and Somalia, the U.S. 
committed armed forces as well. Right now, anywhere from 50,000 to 70,000 U.S. 
military personnel are assigned to U.N. peacekeeping operations. (Exactly how many is 
in dispute. The House puts the number at 70,000; Perry testified to "just under 50,000" as 
of late January.) Some are serving in war-zones, some are off-shore or in aerial 
surveillance and interdiction missions, some are in support roles. But all are serving 
under the authority only of U.N. Security Council resolutions as implemented by the U.S. 
commander-in-chief.</P>

<H3>What Can Be Done?</H3>
<P>	This is the range of problems that Congress now confronts. The bills pending in 
Congress address the issue of U.S. contributions to an open-ended U.N. entitlement 
program in the guise of peacekeeping. But they also raise a genuine constitutional issue: 
the commitment of U.S. armed forces--arguably, the ultimate exercise of public 
authority--without the explicit consent, or even involvement, of Congress.<P>
</P>	The House act passed in February inhibits, but does not prevent, the president 
from engaging U.S. armed forces in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and in particular from 
putting U.S. forces under "foreign" and/or U.N. command. (In the latter case, the U.S. 
officers in direct command of U.S. troops would retain the right to report to and to appeal 
any orders they receive to "superior U.S. military authorities." The president, moreover, 
would have to state in a prior legal memorandum to Congress the grounds for believing 
that such an action is not a violation of the Constitution; the burden of proof is on the 
president.) The president has to give Congress 15 days prior notice of any action 
contemplated or, in an emergency, report within 48 hours afterward. The president has to 
justify the action taken as "necessary to protect national security interests of the United 
States," and project as best he can both the cost and the duration of the operation. These 
requirements should have a chilling effect on the president's propensity to undertake such 
commitments lightly. One can only wonder, had this been the law at the time, how the 
president would have justified our engagements in Somalia or Haiti, and on the grounds 
of what "essential" U.S. national interest.</P>
<P>	There is more. The House act makes it very difficult indeed to fund any expansive 
U.N. peacekeeping operations at all, especially new ones. Effective October 1, 1995, 
there is to be a 25 percent cap on the U.S. share of U.N. peacekeeping--period. 
Moreover, no defense appropriations can be used for any U.S. contributions to U.N. 
peacekeeping, whether assessed or voluntary: All contributions have to be funded 
explicitly, from earmarked appropriations. Finally, the president is required to present an 
annual accounting of the "fair market" value of all voluntary in-kind contributions 
provided to the U.N. in the prior year and, unless reimbursement is received, offset the 
total "incremental" cost of these contributions against the U.S. assessment for the year 
ahead.</P>
<P>	The loophole opened here, and it's a huge one, is the definition of "incremental." 
Presumably the base pay of U.S. military personnel would be the same whether or not 
they served in a U.N. peacekeeping operation. But what about tanks and jeeps and 
aircraft, or air- and sealift? How in such cases are add-ons computed, as against the 
"base" cost of the U.S. military establishment's sophisticated hardware? And how are 
costs assigned to wear and tear on the U.S. forces as well as to providing necessary 
downtime and retraining? The proof of this effort to restrain peacekeeping costs will 
depend on the rigor with which the test is applied. Chairman Benjamin Gilman (R-NY) of 
the House Committee on International Relations estimates that the offset will be in the 
range of $300 million to $400 million, rather than the $1.7 billion for total voluntary 
contributions in 1994.</P>
<P>	In his first address to the U.N. General Assembly, in September 1993, President 
Clinton said that he favored a 25 percent cap on U.S. peacekeeping assessments and that 
the U.N.--and he might have added, the U.S. representatives there--would simply have 
to learn to say "no" to all but the most urgent requests for "peace" operations. The bills 
now in Congress take him at his word.</P>

<H3>How Not to Reform the U.N.</H3>
<P>	It is instructive to recall the lessons of the Kassebaum-Solomon experience. No 
sooner had the amendment taken effect than the ranks of the U.N.'s leadership were filled 
with born-again reformers. The fewer the U.S. dollars, the greater their zeal. The then-
Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, appointed a select experts' committee that 
very nearly--the Soviets said "no" at the last minute--recommended a major U.N. 
restructuring that would have satisfied about 99 percent of the amendment's intent. The 
experts' committee was able to enact the requirement that the administrative budget could 
move from committee to the General Assembly plenary only by consensus. This 
consensus procedure amounted to a U.S. veto on the U.N. budget.</P>
<P>	But a veto is only as good as the will to use it. Budget growth in the following 
two years was held to zero, but not a finger was laid on the waste, duplication, and 
overlap, nor on the obsolete programs that beset the U.N. then, and still do. On the basis 
of that two-year record, the president--Ronald Reagan himself--certified to Congress 
that the "spirit" of Kassebaum-Solomon had been satisfied, and full U.S. funding 
resumed.</P>
<P>	The U.N. paid no price at all for the endemic inefficiencies and uncontrolled 
spending that gave rise to the congressional reforms in the first place. The dollars that 
were withheld are now being paid up. These are the very "arrearages," in fact, that have 
fueled charges that the most generous contributor to the U.N. is the world's number one 
deadbeat.</P>
<P>	There are some obvious lessons to be drawn from this experience. First, merely 
focusing on the process by which the administrative budget is adopted is not enough. The 
loophole of "going along" is too big, and offers too easy a way out. Second, the budget 
itself is not quite the issue: the programs funded by the budget, and the priorities among 
them, have to be scrutinized year after year. Finally, for any U.N. reforms to take firm 
hold--which calls for a persistent effort by the U.S., leading a coalition of the like-
minded within the U.N.--the president and Congress have to be reading off the same 
page. Most of the job, in fact, has to be done by presidential appointees and the 
permanent bureaucracy responsible to them. Congress can (and should) establish the 
benchmarks; but, in the absence of determined executive action, nothing much will be 
accomplished.</P>

<H3>Tightening the Screws</H3>
<P>	This time around, Congress is considering sterner measures: a stronger version of 
last year's Pressler amendment. Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) tied full U.S. funding of 
U.N. operations to the president's certification that an independent U.N. Office of 
Inspector General was up and running. This, in turn, was a follow-up to the key 
recommendation of the Thornburgh Report, in 1992-93, that an inspector general with 
clout was essential to jump-start meaningful U.N. reform. The House act requires the 
withholding of 50 percent of the U.S. peacekeeping assessment and all voluntary 
contributions every year, as well as 20 percent of the regular assessment, pending the 
president's annual certification that an independent U.N. inspections office is in operation 
and that the inspector general has been chosen on the basis of professional credentials, 
has subpoena power over U.N. personnel and records, issues annual and unexpurgated 
public reports, and that the inspector general's recommendations are being implemented.</P>
<P>	Congress, for its part, has to be prepared not to take "yes" for an answer. The best 
way for the U.S. to save money is for the U.N. not to waste it--and that means probing 
behind the numbers to the U.N. programs that ought to be trimmed back, or zeroed out, or 
rejected in the first place. Congress must be on the right track, because administration 
witnesses are already warning of the imminent collapse of the West--maybe even of 
U.N. peacekeeping as we now know it--if this total legislative package is enacted. And 
that, of course, is the point.</P>
<P>	I would add two modest proposals to the package. First, the U.N. ought to 
overhaul the present scales of assessments. Congress should require the president to open 
negotiations at once to revise both the administrative and peacekeeping assessment scales 
within one year. Capping the peacekeeping assessment at 25 percent is only a start: all of 
the allocations, which are supposed to correspond to the GNPs of the U.N. members, are 
hopelessly out-of-date. Russia, for example, pegged at 10 percent for the administrative 
budget and 11.5 percent for peacekeeping, pays too much. China, on the other hand, 
which claims a GNP in excess of $2 trillion, pays less than 1 percent on both scales. The 
spread overall is from 25 and 30.4 percent for the U.S. (for the administrative budget and 
peacekeeping, respectively) to one-hundredth of 1 percent for 85 countries--close to a 
majority of the U.N.'s total membership of 185. Saudi Arabia and Brunei are ranked 
equally with Benin and Bangladesh.</P>
<P>	A second proposal refers to the sidebar on "The High Cost of U.N. Membership": 
What in fact do we spend on the U.N., on all of its various parts, including also the value 
of the in-kind voluntary services that the U.S. routinely contributes? No one, as best I've 
been able to determine, keeps an authoritative ledger; someone ought to. Congress should 
require that the president submit an annual, comprehensive U.S./U.N. budget request. 
That way, we might better be able to answer the question with which we began.</P>

<H3>What Is the U.N. Worth to Us?</H3>
<P>	On balance, I believe the answer has to be "not much." Even if the U.N. were to 
be substantially reformed--which in my judgment is very unlikely--the answer would be 
only slightly more upbeat.</P>
<P>	The U.N. is what we made it. There is little evidence that, in the late spring of 
1945, the U.N.'s founders had any inkling of the proliferation of mini-states that would 
result from the breakup of the colonial empires in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. 
Simply gathering together all the countries in the world into one grand and ill-assorted 
institution did not then, and does not, now constitute a "community" at all, and certainly 
not a community of like-minded liberal democracies with a consensus on how to design 
and maintain the framework of a tolerable world order. Yet that is the fundamental 
premise built into the U.N. Charter--which today is essentially a fraud.</P>
<P>	At least half, and as many as two-thirds, of the U.N.'s 185 members should, on 
the Charter's own principles, either be expelled or suspended. Yet they comprise a 
working majority of the U.N. General Assembly. They adopt the budget, allocate 
resources, and permit a significant part of these resources to be wasted. Much of the 
waste, as noted already, is on redundant socioeconomic programs that they perceive to be 
beneficial to themselves; the rest pays for plum jobs in the Secretariat for their own elites. 
The fact that these programs do more harm than good, by confirming them in their bias 
toward statism, cuts little ice. The U.N. is their organization. Not surprisingly, they use it 
in their own interests.</P>
<P>	Now, it will be objected that all this is beside the point, that the General Assembly 
itself is beside the point: simply a shadow-play, in which the mini-states debate toothless 
(if often mischievous) resolutions that nobody heeds. Subsidizing this exercise is, so the 
argument goes, the price we pay for maintaining a functioning U.N. when we need it.</P>
<P>	"When we need it": This always is the mantra of last resort. It apparently refers to 
those "threats to peace and international security" to which only the U.N. Security 
Council can respond with force or the threat of its use. Thus Warren Christopher argued, 
in vigorously opposing the limits on U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping, that their 
effect would be to force the U.S. to "go it alone." It's either the U.N., such as it is, or 
isolation. But "going it alone" looks not so bad, if it means standing aside from, even 
vetoing, ill-defined, open-ended "peace" operations that arguably exceed the U.N.'s 
authority and certainly exceed its capabilities or demonstrated competence. Secretary 
Christopher may make unapologetic isolationists of us all.</P>
<P>	In some circumstances, our government's own judgment of the national interest 
may coincide with U.N. Security Council resolutions mandating forceful responses to 
"threats to peace." North Korea's invasion of the South was one such circumstance, 
Iraq's aggression against Kuwait another. But in both cases, it was the prior U.S. 
judgment, and its firm commitment to resist aggression, that carried the day in the 
Security Council. The U.S. and its like-minded allies would have taken the actions they 
deemed necessary, with or without the cover of U.N. resolutions. It may well be, in fact, 
that the U.N. served more to inhibit than to unleash the resulting "peace-enforcement" 
operations, and limited their effectiveness as a consequence.</P>
<P>	Looking back over these last 50 years of U.S. national security policies, what is 
most striking is the almost total absence of the U.N. from the historical record. When 
something does matter, whether it is an alliance to deter aggression (NATO) or carrying 
out an effective foreign assistance program (the Marshall Plan) or negotiating the rules of 
free and fair international trade (GATT), the United States invariably has entered into 
multinational engagements with the genuinely like-minded. This should come as no 
surprise. It is the mark of a serious country, seriously pursuing its national interests.</P>
<P>	Most of the U.N.'s success stories have in fact been those of the results-oriented 
specialized agencies--as, for example, the virtual eradication of smallpox (WHO), the 
care and feeding of refugees (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), and the 
green revolution in South Asia (several agencies involved). Many of these agencies 
predate the U.N. itself. And the most successful have been those most careful to insulate 
themselves from the "political" U.N. in New York.</P>
<P>	For now, it is probably enough just to cut back on the U.S. commitment to the 
U.N., to be discriminating in acceding to the use of force in U.N. "peace" operations, and 
to prevent as much costly mischief as possible. The approach being taken by Congress 
seems about right--but no less will do.</P>
<P>	The threat to withhold consensus on the administrative budget, vigorously 
applied, could squeeze a useful amount of fat from the Secretariat. Insisting on an 
independent inspector general is not about to produce a lean and mean U.N. bureaucracy 
overnight, but every little bit helps. In the specialized agencies, picking and choosing 
among programs worth supporting--as we do in UNESCO, even as a non-member--
makes a lot of sense. A runaway Security Council calls for particular vigilance, and an 
ever-ready veto, which the total package of congressional limitations should satisfy--yes, 
Mr. Secretary, even at the risk of "going it alone."</P>
<P>	I fear that putting the U.N. out of its misery altogether would incur unacceptable 
costs. The predictable firestorm among our allies would weaken relationships that are far 
more important to us than the U.N. itself. It may be cowardice, or it may simply reflect 
the enormous effort involved in fundamental U.N. reform for a rather modest payoff. But 
I would settle for putting the U.N. back in its box and keeping our eye on it. A wary eye, 
and a parsimonious one.</P>

<H3>The High Cost of U.N. Membership</H3>

<P>	Somewhere in the United States Budget for Fiscal Year 1996 there is an entry for 
just about everything, from midnight basketball to research on the reproductive cycle of 
fruit flies. But search as you will, nowhere in that huge tome that documents the roles and 
responsibilities of $1.6 trillion's  worth of national government is there a total for 
projected U.S. contributions to the United Nations.</P>
<P>	The U.N. is not exactly a new kid on the block. It will celebrate its 50th birthday 
this June; and after tens of billions of dollars in U.S. contributions over the years, it might 
be supposed that someone would want to assess the value to us of membership in this 
multinational conglomerate. A total annual budget figure would help.</P>
<P>  To get started on such an evaluation, here are the numbers for the 1994 calendar year, as 
best as I have been able to put them together:</P>
<UL><LI>  The U.S. share (25 percent) of the U.N. administrative budget, which funds all 
Secretariat staff and programs: $298 million.
<LI>  The U.S. share (31.7 percent) of the peacekeeping budget: $1.2 billion.
<LI> U.S. contributions to all U.N. specialized agencies (World Health Organization, Food 
and Agriculture Organization, High Commissioner for Refugees, et cetera): $368 million, 
exclusive of capital contributions to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.</UL>
   Cumulative total: almost $2 billion.<BR>
<P>   This total does not include the value of goods and services that the U.S. contributes 
voluntarily to the U.N. system as a whole. For U.N. peacekeeping operations alone, 
voluntary contributions in 1994 represented about $1.7 billion in "fair market" value, and 
some sources put the total in excess of $2 billion. (The administration claims some of this 
total has been reimbursed, but does not say how much.) For other programs, a reasonable 
estimate is even more difficult for an outsider, but there is a steady flow of experts from 
the Washington bureaucracy to U.N. headquarters, and similar ties with the specialized 
agencies. Add in these numbers, and the total approaches $4 billion.</P>
<P>	That isn't small change. Now that we know roughly what membership costs us, 
the question we need to answer: What does our investment in the U.N. buy us?</P>


<H3>The U.N.'s Waste, Fraud, and Abuse (sidebar)</H3>

<P>	In 1992 and 1993, former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh served as 
U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management with a specific 
mandate to evaluate the U.N.'s effectiveness. After a year on the job, he prepared a report 
on U.N. mismanagement and waste and tried repeatedly to galvanize the secretary general 
into effective action. In frustration, he went public with his recommendations and 
testified on March 5, 1993 before the House Subcommittee (of International Relations) 
on International Security, International Organizations, and Human Rights. Here are some 
highlights of his report and testimony:</P>

<B>Inspector General.</B> Key recommendation: to uncover "waste, fraud, and abuse" within 
the Secretariat, an independent, professional Inspector General has to be named, with full 
subpoena power over U.N. personnel and records.<BR>
<B>Peacekeeping Field Operations.</B> A McKinsey & Co. management audit uncovered no 
less than $100 million in annual waste owing to duplication and overlap, managerial 
incompetence, and lack of communications within the field structures.<BR>
<B>"Featherbedding."</B> One example: 500 typists employed to transcribe the dictation of 
translators. Use of basic word processors would save about $20 million a year.<BR>
<B>Financial Management.</B> McKinsey & Co. recommended improvements in foreign 
exchange transactions, centralization of cash management, and automated payments. 
Projected annual savings: $12 million to $15 million.<BR>
<B>Career Service.</B> Nearly 90 percent of all staff assessments are positive. As Thornburgh 
notes, not only does incompetence carry no penalty, there is no incentive for meritorious 
service. Top jobs in the U.N. Secretariat are compensated up to 150 percent of 
comparable U.S. supergrades--and it's all tax-free.<BR>
<B>"Consultants."</B> Although it is in violation of the U.N.'s own regulations, top bureaucrats 
are routinely "retired" (with lump-sum separation pay up to $500,000) and then 
immediately rehired as "consultants" at 85 to 100 percent of previous pay.<BR>
<B>Procurement.</B> In 1990-91, of 5,450 contracts let, only 17 percent were put out for 
competitive bidding, contrary to U.N. regulations for all except "emergency" cases.<BR>
<B>Printing.</B> About two-thirds of all printing needs are generated during the annual three-
month General Assembly. Yet the print shop is fully staffed year-round. Contracting out 
during peak times would, according to Thornburgh and a 60 Minutes investigation 
(broadcast September 20, 1993), save "tens of millions" annually.<BR>

 <H3><I> STAY OUT OF UNESCO </I></H3>
Executive Memorandum #403<br>
        by Thomas P. Sheehy<br> 
    January 27, 1995 
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

The Clinton Administration is weighing a U.S. return to the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott wrote last December that a return to 
UNESCO, from which the U.S. withdrew in 1984, "remains high on our 
agenda." Rejoining UNESCO, however, would be a serious mistake. 
UNESCO is poorly managed, suffers from a vague mandate, and duplicates 
the efforts of other U.N. agencies and private organizations. Moreover, there 
is no need for the U.S. to rejoin because it already participates in the best 
UNESCO programs. 
<P>
Established in 1946 and headquartered in Paris, UNESCO today is the third-
largest specialized agency in the U.N. system. It has 182 member nations and 
an annual budget of some $450 million. UNESCO attempts to foster 
international intellectual cooperation in a wide range of fields, including 
communications, education, and oceanography. These activities include 
collecting statistics on school enrollments and education spending in member 
states. UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) 
promotes scientific research on the world's oceans. UNESCO also undertakes 
development programs in several fields, providing education-related 
fellowships and grants, for example. Its World Heritage Commission (WHC) 
aims to protect historic sites and natural landmarks by providing financial aid
for restoration, technical advice, and training. 
<P>
Reagan Withdraws. 
<P>
The Reagan Administration withdrew from UNESCO in 1984 largely because 
the agency had become highly politicized. When the U.S. left, many 
UNESCO programs and debates focused on disarmament, "collective rights," 
and other themes which Washington believed were departures from 
UNESCO's original mandate. Moreover, these activities, driven by East Bloc 
and Third World countries, were hostile to free markets and a free press. 
UNESCO became a hotbed of agitation for the so-called New World 
Information and Communications Order (NWICO), which would have 
sanctioned government licensing of reporters. 
<P>
The Reagan Administration also criticized UNESCO for its top-heavy, over-
centralized bureaucracy. The lavish lifestyle which UNESCO afforded 
Director General Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow throughout the 1970s and early 
1980s, including his opulent penthouse above UNESCO headquarters, also 
aggravated U.S. officials. Moreover, during these years UNESCO had the 
most unrestrained budgetary expansion in the U.N. system. 
<P>
A Return to UNESCO? 
<P>
Today's UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor Zaragoza has introduced 
some management reforms. As a result, he has won over the U.S. State 
Department to the view that the U.S. should rejoin UNESCO. The State 
Department believes that American concerns expressed ten years ago and 
reaffirmed by the Bush Administration have been addressed adequately. 
Clinton Administration officials have suggested that only budgetary concerns 
are keeping the U.S. from rejoining; full membership would cost Washington 
$65 million a year. 
<P>
Rejoining UNESCO, however, would be unwise for several reasons. 
<P>
REASON #1: UNESCO has serious management shortcomings. A 1993 
General Accounting Office (GAO) report notes that UNESCO has made little 
progress in remedying its overly centralized bureaucracy. UNESCO has too 
many of its personnel and activities based in its headquarters and not in the 
field. Employees, the GAO reports, are hesitant to leave behind their Parisian 
lifestyles. The resulting centralization complicates and reduces the 
effectiveness of UNESCO's activities. It is difficult, for example, to help a 
country develop its communications facilities when programs concerning this 
issue are centered in Paris. Moreover, the GAO reported a planned 66 percent 
budget increase for 1994-1995 in the Participation Program, a reserve fund 
for special programs and grants which UNESCO insiders have described as a 
"slush fund" for the Director General. 
<P>
REASON #2: Rejoining UNESCO would send the wrong signal about U.N. 
management reform. That UNESCO management is flawed should come as 
no surprise. The U.N. itself is poorly managed. Former Under- Secretary 
General for Administration and Management Dick Thornburgh, in a scathing 
1993 report, wrote: "The United Nations presently is almost totally lacking in 
effective means to deal with fraud, waste and abuse by staff members." 
Current U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright acknowledged last 
year that Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's reform efforts have been 
disappointing. While Boutros-Ghali has no direct control over UNESCO, the 
U.S. would be sending the wrong signal concerning how serious it is about 
U.N. reform if it were to rejoin UNESCO now. 
<P>
REASON #3: UNESCO's mission lacks focus. UNESCO was chartered "for 
the purpose of advancing, through the educational, scientific and cultural 
relations of the peoples of the world, the objectives of international peace an
the common welfare of mankind." This mandate is too broad and only 
encourages confusion about the agency's mission. The State Department in 
1990 reported that confusion about UNESCO's mission has resulted in "a 
work program of astounding breadth, with resources spread so thinly that it 
has often been difficult to discern any measurable impact." This assessment 
remains valid today. The most efficient and valuable organizations within the 
U.N. system are those that pursue clearly defined tasks: technical 
organizations like the Universal Postal Union and the International 
Telecommunications Union. 
<P>
REASON #4: UNESCO activities are redundant. The activities of UNESCO 
are duplicated by other U.N. organizations. The World Health Organization, 
for example, promotes awareness about AIDS, as does UNESCO. In fact, 
Boutros-Ghali has recognized that this problem exists among U.N. economic 
and social development programs. He is quoted in Thornburgh's 1993 report 
as complaining that "Duplication is widespread; co-ordination is often 
nominal; bureaucratic battles aimed at monopolizing a particular subject are 
rife; and organizational objectives are sometimes in conflict." Rejoining 
UNESCO would be a step away from the consolidation the U.N. system 
desperately needs. Moreover, UNESCO's educational programs also are 
duplicated by a host of public and private American organizations, including 
the U.S. Agency for International Development and the German Marshall 
Fund. 
<P>
REASON #5: The U.S. already benefits from the best of UNESCO. The U.S. 
currently participates and enjoys full voting rights in those UNESCO 
programs that it considers worthwhile, including the World Heritage 
Commission and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. By 
spending no more than a few million dollars annually, the U.S. supports these 
activities while avoiding the added costs of UNESCO overhead. Instead of 
rejoining UNESCO, the U.S. should be working to spin off its worthwhile 
operations to non-UNESCO organizations. The IOC, for example, could 
become part of the World Meteorological Commission. 
<P>
The U.S. has done well for ten years without belonging to UNESCO. The few 
truly worthwhile UNESCO activities are open to U.S. participation without 
U.S. membership. There is a plethora of poorly managed U.N. organizations 
and commissions with murky mandates and elusive goals which need the U.S. 
more than the U.S. needs them. UNESCO fits this description. This is no time 
to rejoin.

<title>AID Should Release Economic Freedom Report Now - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>AID SHOULD RELEASE ECONOMIC FREEDOM REPORT NOW</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 464<br>
October 16, 1996 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Concerned over the wastefulness of America's foreign aid program, Congress last year mandated that the Agency for International Development (AID) submit a report on the status of economic freedom in countries receiving U.S. aid. The report was due this summer. It is now October, however, and still no report. The Clinton Administration should fulfill its obligation under the law and submit AID's economic freedom report to Congress immediately.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Economic Freedom Report.</b> The appropriations bill for foreign operations, passed in November 1995 and signed into law by President Clinton in February 1996, requires AID to "submit to the appropriate congressional committees an annual report providing a concise overview of the prospects for economic and social growth.... For each country, the report shall discuss the laws, policies and practices of that country that most contribute to or detract from the achievement of this kind of growth."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why this report has not been completed is a mystery. The reason certainly cannot be a lack of resources. With operating expenses of $465 million, 2,400 permanent employees, and some 6,000 long-term contractors and consultants, AID should have had no difficulty finding the resources to produce such a report and submit it to Congress on time.<sup>2</sup>  Nor can the reason be a lack of information on levels of economic freedom in the world. There now are three privately produced studies this subject: The Heritage Foundation's <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i>, Freedom House's <i>World Survey of Economic Freedom</i>, and the Fraser Institute's <i>Economic Freedom of the World</i>. While there are minor differences among these studies in the methodologies used to measure economic freedom, all three agree that economic freedom is essential to economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most likely reason for AID's failure to submit its report is the low priority the foreign aid bureaucracy gives to economic freedom. For example, of the $12 billion in foreign aid spending, AID earmarks only 13 percent for what it calls "achieving sustainable development."  Of this 13 percent, most of money is spent to protect the environment, educate the poor, control populations, and immunize infants. Some of these programs may be useful, but they hardly qualify as programs aimed at promoting economic growth in less developed countries. A well-educated person living in a clean environment and given good health care will not be able to enjoy those benefits if private property is outlawed, there is no rule of law, and people are not free to work. Economic freedom, not environmental or population controls, creates economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>AID's Neglect of Economic Freedom.</b> This failure to understand the central role of economic freedom in economic development is a principal reason for AID's failed approach to foreign aid. The Heritage Foundation's 1996 <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i> evaluates the level of economic freedom in 142 countries. Examining taxation, trade and investment, banking, regulation, monetary, and other policies, the <i>Index</i> demonstrates that of these 142 countries, those with the greatest economic freedom also are the richest. Conversely, those that are the most economically repressed are the poorest. Consider the following:
<p><ul>
<li> Of the 76 countries ranked as "mostly unfree" or "repressed," 35 have received U.S. foreign aid for at least 36 years, many for as long as 52 years;
<p>
<li> Of these 35 countries, 25 are no better off economically today than they were before receiving aid;
<p>
<li> Of these 25, 13 actually are poorer today than they were over three decades ago.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The evidence in the <i>Index</i> demonstrates what many economists have known for years: No matter how much foreign aid is pumped into less developed economies, they will not grow economically until they begin to free their economies from excessive government constraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was Congress's belief in this fact that prompted it last year to require that AID submit a report on economic freedom. Critics of AID will be watching to see how reliable and accurate it will be in evaluating the economic policies of U.S. aid recipients. They will be scrutinizing AID's assessment of barriers to U.S. exports, whether American companies are free to invest in other countries, and whether aid recipients still do not respect private property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With over 8,000 employees, consultants, and contractors, and $465 million in operating expenses, AID surely has enough resources to fulfill its legal obligations to Congress and the American people. By not submitting its report on economic freedom to Congress, AID is violating a specific congressional directive. Whether AID is finally giving economic freedom the attention it deserves cannot be known until it submits its report. However, one thing is already clear: The agency remains one of the most poorly run and ineffective in the U.S. government. AID should release its report on economic freedom immediately.

<p>

The National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the leading American organization promoting democracy throughout the world, is in danger of being gutted. On August 1, the Senate Appropriations Committee eliminated all funding for the NED after the House voted in favor of the Clinton Administration's entire budget request of $30 million. The NED's future now is in the hands of the full Senate, which has an opportunity to restore funding for NED when it takes up the Commerce, Justice, and State Department appropriations bill in the next few days.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Senate Appropriations Committee's action against the NED is shortsighted. The NED is a valuable weapon in the international war of ideas. It advances American national interests by promoting the development of stable democracies friendly to the U.S. in strategically important parts of the world. The U.S. cannot afford to discard such an effective instrument of foreign policy at a time when American interests and values are under sustained ideological attack from a wide variety of anti-democratic forces around the world. The NED deserves the full funding already approved by the House.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>NED Is Still Needed.</b> The National Endowment for Democracy is a nonprofit grantmaking institution created in 1983 to strengthen democratic institutions and foster democratic values around the world. It is not an official  U.S. government agency, although it does receive federal funds. The NED supports nongovernmental groups in 90 countries. It funds democratic activists through direct grants, or works through American grant recipients, including four "core" institutions:  the Center for International Private Enterprise, the Free Trade Union Institute, the International Republican Institute, and the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The NED has played an important role in providing aid to democratic movements in the former Soviet bloc, China, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Nicaragua, Vietnam, and elsewhere. It has provided material support to grass root organizations to help emerging democracies assemble the building blocks necessary to sustain a stable democratic system:  representative political parties, a free-market economy, independent trade unions, and a free press. The NED's  timely support has served as a lifeline to dedicated democratic reformers battling a wide variety of anti-American dictatorships. For example, the NED has aided Lech Walesa's Solidarity movement in Poland, Harry Wu's human rights efforts in China, and independent media outlets in the former Yugoslavia. Russian political activists affiliated with the NED also played a major role in President Boris Yeltsin's successful re-election campaign against the reinvigorated Communist Party earlier this year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The principal argument cited by the NED's critics is that the NED is no longer needed because the Cold War has ended. But the promotion of democracy is an American interest that transcends the Cold War. The Reagan Administration's creation of the NED was not a cynical tactic for undermining U.S. adversaries, but a reflection of the core American values of liberty, democracy, and free enterprise. Ronald Reagan correctly perceived that the U.S. needed to address the Soviet ideological challenge as well as the Soviet military threat. The NED was a cost-effective way to encourage captive nations to liberate themselves without committing the U.S. to a prohibitively risky and costly military crusade to free them from communism. While there is no monolithic security threat or ideological challenge to the U.S. at the present time, supporting democratic forces abroad remains both a moral and a practical imperative.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Soviet communism has collapsed, but communist regimes continue to dominate China, Cuba, North Korea, and Vietnam. And ex-communists masquerading as nationalists still control several of the Soviet successor states. Moreover, new-style communist parties have sprung up to compete with pro-Western democrats in recent elections inside the old Soviet bloc. Communists have been voted back into power in Hungary, Lithuania, and Poland. Despite the wishful thinking of the "end of history" triumphalists, democracy is not the inevitable outcome of the political evolution of post-communist societies. In the words of former Lithuanian President Vitautas Landsbergis, who was defeated by ex-communists in Lithuania's 1994 elections, "There is no guarantee that democracy will flower in the soil that was polluted for fifty years by communism."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The NED's job is far from finished. Despite the considerable progress made in recent years, two-fifths of the world's people continue to live under authoritarian rule. While communism has collapsed in many countries, democracy will take many years to become firmly rooted. Economic problems, international conflicts, and the growth of political, ethnic, national, and social tensions could trigger backlashes against democratic reforms. Embryonic democracies remain vulnerable not only to communists, but to military coups, fundamentalist politico-religious movements, and authoritarian parties. Both the Russian Bolsheviks and the German Nazis seized power after their countries undertook failed democratic experiments.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Promoting Democracy Furthers U.S. National Interests.</b> The U.S. has a stake in the promotion of democracy and the rule of law. Western-style democratic governments are the least likely to threaten American interests. Their political pluralism and focus on commercial activities tend to encourage international stability. In the past, democracies rarely have fought wars with other democracies. Therefore, consolidating democracy in formerly hostile states, such as Russia, helps to enhance America's long-term security. Democratic reforms also facilitate free-market reforms that lead to international trade and investment opportunities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Funding the NED is a prudent investment because it is far less expensive to aid friendly democrats than it is to defend against hostile dictatorships. By contributing $30 million of democratic "venture capital" to the NED, the U.S. government could forestall the need to spend billions of dollars for defense in the future -- for example, in the event Russia reverted to a hostile dictatorship. The NED's aid to grass-roots organizations also is more cost-effective than direct government-to-government aid, which often is siphoned off by foreign or American bureaucrats. The NED is not a big government bureaucracy. It has the flexibility to channel aid to effective grass-roots organizations for short-term projects that can be adjusted quickly to adapt to changing political conditions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The NED's strong track record led the seven immediate past Secretaries of State to support continued funding in a joint letter to congressional leaders in September 1995. The case for funding the NED remains a compelling one. As House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) has noted, the NED "represents the American people's bipartisan commitment to a world in which the principles of democracy prevail."  Slashing NED funding would signal to a world hungry for American leadership that the U.S. is withdrawing from active engagement in international affairs. This not only could demoralize reformers who have taken heavy personal risks to advance the cause of democracy, but could give encouragement to anti-democratic regimes and movements.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the Cold War has ended, the global war of ideas continues to rage. American interests and ideals remain threatened by deeply entrenched communist regimes, neocommunists, aggressive dictatorships, radical nationalists, and Islamic fundamentalists. Given this reality, the U.S. cannot afford to surrender the ideological battlefield to these enemies of a free and open society. The National Endowment for Democracy deserves continued funding as a prudent investment for safeguarding the future.

<title>OPIC-ing the Taxpayer's Pocket - Heritage</title>

<h3><font size="+2">OPIC</font>-ING THE TAXPAYER'S POCKET</h3>
By Brett D. Schaefer<br>
Research Assistant<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 458<br>
September 3, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When it returns from its August recess, the House of Representatives is expected to consider H.R. 3759, the Exports, Jobs, and Growth Act of 1996, which authorizes appropriations for the Trade and Development Agency (TDA) and export programs of the International Trade Administration (ITA) for fiscal years 1997 and 1998. But the heart of the Act extends the authority of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to engage in new commitments through 2001 and doubles the statutory limits on OPIC's insurance and financing activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

OPIC insures overseas investments by U.S. businesses against loss to expropriation, political instability, and unforeseen contingencies, such as currency inconvertibility. It also issues investment guarantees and direct loans to U.S. businesses for international investments. The agency was created by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to complement the federal government's trade policy and development activities. Specifically, OPIC is charged with increasing U.S. exports and assisting American private capital in the development of less developed countries (LDCs) and countries in transition from non-market to market economies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Strangely, no one seems to notice the irony of using a government-run program to encourage other countries to end government interference in their economies. Congress should not expand OPIC's funding and authority. OPIC is another form of corporate welfare and accomplishes nothing that cannot be performed better in the private sector, without risk to U.S. taxpayers.
<p><ul>
<li><b>OPIC could cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars.</b> Proponents insist that OPIC makes a profit and actually decreases the deficit. But while OPIC did make $167 million in profits last year, largely from revenues of U.S. treasury bonds, this figure does not take into account the amount that U.S. taxpayers are obligated to pay as underwriters of OPIC-insured investments. In 1995 alone, OPIC issued policies covering $8.6 billion of investment. The accumulated value of insured investments is many times this amount. American taxpayers typically are liable for 90 percent of the insured investment in the event the policy must be paid.
<p>
Additionally, beginning in 1987, OPIC began dabbling in venture capital, one of the riskiest areas of the financial industry. Starting with the Africa Growth Fund, OPIC began creating numerous funds to encourage investment in less developed countries. These funds have several things in common: They are involved in the world's riskiest markets, are subject to little control or oversight by OPIC, and rarely turn a profit. These funds also have been growing precipitously, from $70 million at the beginning of the Clinton Administration to over $814 million last spring.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC "socializes" risk while privatizing profits. </b>Foreign investment is an important avenue for development in LDCs. U.S. foreign direct investment totaled $612 billion in 1994, with nearly one-third invested in the developing world, a total far exceeding the U.S. foreign aid budget. OPIC insured a very modest portion of this investment; the rest was insured by private businesses. Yet business and political advocates continue to argue that developing nations would not receive foreign direct investment without OPIC. The truth is that OPIC has become a corporate welfare program that subsidizes investment insurance and loans for private businesses. <i>Fortune</i> 500 companies realize large profits while the taxpayer buys the insurance to offset their investment risk in less developed countries.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC's development agenda has been ignored.</b> H.R. 3759 uses export promotion to justify increasing OPIC's insurance and lending authority, but discussion of OPIC's second mission -- its development agenda -- is curiously absent. This is because OPIC actually works against the best interests of LDCs. Representative Sonny Callahan (R-AL) claims that "as long as these countries, such as India, do not have a track record of adherence to free market principles, OPIC is needed."  In fact, however, OPIC is not needed. It encourages countries to maintain harmful economic policies, such as refusing to guarantee property rights, engaging in harmful regulatory policies, demanding oversight of investments, and insisting on government ownership of whole sectors of the economy. It simply is not wise to engage in business in such an environment. To attract foreign investment, countries need to enact free-market economic policies. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Chile, and the Czech Republic have done so with marvelous success. However, OPIC continues to encourage investment in less developed countries regardless of their economic climate.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC does not promote exports effectively.</b> Not one country receiving OPIC insurance policies or loans is among the top 10 destinations of U.S. exports, despite the fact that four of the top ten (Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore) are developing nations. OPIC focuses on countries that cannot attract foreign investment on their own because of their poor economic policies and dangerous instability. Instead of letting these countries reap what they sow, OPIC rewards them with investments underwritten by American taxpayers.
<p>
Additionally, OPIC employs many restrictions on its lending and insuring practices that have nothing to do with the viability of the investment. For example, many countries that fit the normal criteria for OPIC political insurance and loans are ineligible because they do not meet U.S. standards in such areas as human rights, environmental concerns, and workers' rights. Countries that are excluded from OPIC lending for these reasons include South Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Mexico. In other words, political correctness is more important than maximizing the return on taxpayers' money.
<p>
<li><b>OPIC competes with the private sector.</b> One of the justifications for OPIC is that there supposedly are no alternatives in the private sector. But numerous private-sector businesses specialize in political risk insurance, including American International Group (AIG), EXEL Ltd., and Mid Ocean Ltd. OPIC competes directly with these private-sector institutions and offers advantages beyond the resources of privately held companies. OPIC political risk insurance is backed by the U.S. government, whose resources far exceed those of a private insurer. OPIC offers subsidized insurance premiums at rates far below market rates. OPIC policies extend for 20 years, while the private sector in most instances cannot issue policies for longer than three or seven years for reasons of risk. OPIC continues to compete unfairly with the private sector, despite the fact that its authorizing language instructs it specifically to promote the development of private-sector political risk insurers.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

At the very least, OPIC should be required to limit its activities to those which complement rather than undermine the activities of private-sector political risk insurers. OPIC, for example, could supplement private political risk insurance by issuing policies for the time window beyond that typically offered by the private sector. Ideally, however, OPIC should be eliminated and its commitments privatized.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents claim that OPIC cannot easily be privatized. To bolster this claim, they cite an independent study which estimated that privatization would cost American taxpayers between $500 million and $700 million. This is a large sum, but it pales in comparison to the potential cost to U.S. taxpayers if major economic or political upheavals occur in areas of the world with OPIC-insured projects. The potential liability to the U.S. is in the billions -- in effect, a global version of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s, for which the American taxpayer is still paying.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. government should not intrude in areas where the private sector is willing and able to do the job, can do it more efficiently, and can do it without forcing American taxpayers to underwrite risky ventures. Encouraging foreign investment is an admirable goal, but it should not come in the form of government subsidies to private U.S. firms -- subsidies that discourage economic reform in the target countries and put the American taxpayer at risk.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Bill Clinton has recommended that the United States give more money to institutions like the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/html/Welcome.html">World Bank</a>. The Clinton Administration has obligated the U.S. to contribute $800 million to one of the Bank's agencies, the International Development Agency.<sup>2</sup>  This is about $100 million more than was requested for the last fiscal year. Spending more on the World Bank ignores the overwhelming evidence that its programs have done little to promote economic growth in less developed countries. Moreover, it ignores the economic lessons of what really causes countries to develop.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since its founding in 1944, the World Bank has been involved in over 165 countries. The Bank argues that less developed countries stand little chance to prosper economically without substantial subsidized loans from the developed world. It further contends that it is uniquely positioned to meet this challenge and that it must continue to transfer capital to poor countries.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank is wrong. The data show that most long-term recipients of World Bank money are no better off today then they were when they received their first loan. Many are actually worse off. Consider the following:
<p><ul>
<li>Of the 66 less developed countries receiving money from the World Bank for more than 25 years (most for more than 30 years), 37 are no better off today than they were before they received such loans.
<p>
<li>Of these 37 countries, most (20 in all) actually are poorer today than they were before receiving aid from the Bank.
</ul> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Former less developed countries that have prospered over the past 30 years did so by freeing up the productive forces of their economies. The best examples are Hong Kong and Singapore. Even though a country like Singapore received a small amount of money from the World Bank, the evidence shows that what most effected economic growth was not World Bank aid, but economic freedom.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress would do well to take a critical look at the World Bank's history and programs. If it does, it will find that the Bank's approach to economic development has not worked. Rather than let the Bank try to reform itself, as it claims it has tried repeatedly to do in the past, the U.S. should withdraw financial support altogether. Specifically, the U.S. Congress should:
<ul><li>
<b>Phase out financial support for the World Bank.</b> Last year the U.S. paid $1.2 billion to the World Bank. In addition, the U.S. has pledged some $28 billion to the World Bank that has not been disbursed. However, the Bank can call on the U.S. at any time to disburse funds up to this amount. While it would be best to end any future liabilities by terminating all World Bank funding immediately, at the very least Congress should begin to phase out funding for the Bank by cutting this year's budget request to no more than 50 percent of the current level. All funding should be terminated by 2002.
<p>
<li><b>Seek a General Accounting Office audit of World Bank lending practices.</b> The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) long has analyzed the effectiveness of such foreign aid programs. A new study should be commissioned to analyze the effectiveness of current World Bank lending practices.
<p>
<li><b>Make remaining funding contingent on public access to World Bank records and information.</b> The World Bank is a highly secretive organization, which blocks the ability of outsiders to monitor its effectiveness. Congress should make further funding contingent on the full release of World Bank records and information.
<p>
<li><b>Require that the Administration provide Congress with a report on the level of economic freedom in World Bank recipient countries.</b> Congress should require the U.S. Representative to the World Bank, Jan Piercy, to provide it with a report detailing the economic conditions that exist in countries that receive World Bank loans and grants.
</ul><p>
<b>WHAT IS THE WORLD BANK?</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Officially named the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the World Bank was founded in 1944 by the 44 nations that met at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to establish a new post-war international economic system. Today, the Bank has 178 members; only 12 nations are not members. The United States is the largest contributor, providing some $53 billion since 1944.<sup>3</sup>  Even though the U.S. has reduced its funding as a percentage of the Bank's total deposits from 29.3 percent in 1965 to 17.5 percent in 1995, it remains the Bank's largest donor and has pledged more money to the Bank than any other country.<sup>4</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
World Bank members provide contributions based on the size of their economies. The larger and wealthier the economy, the more the country is likely to give. A country's voting power is based on the amount of its contributions. Since the U.S. is the biggest donor, it therefore has the most voting power.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank is governed by several bodies. These are:
<p><ol>
<b><li> The Board of Governors.</b> Overall authority resides with a president and a board of governors. The board includes one individual from each member country. It meets annually to receive a report on financial matters from the executive directors, an elected group of 25 representatives from the Bank's total membership. The board also reviews any other matters that the executive directors present to it.
<P>
<b><li> Executive Directors.</b> General operations are overseen by a 25-member group of executive directors: one representative from each of the five largest donors (the United States, Japan, Germany, France, and Britain) and 20 elected by the remaining 174 donor countries. This group reviews loan proposals submitted by the president of the Bank and has the final authority to approve or decline a loan.
<p>
<b><li> The President.</b> The president of the World Bank is appointed by the executive directors, typically for a five-year term. Though no written article requires it, traditionally the president is an American. The current president, James D. Wolfensohn, formerly an international investment banker, was appointed to a five-year term on June 1, 1995.
</ol> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Arms of the World Bank.</b> There are several institutions that make up the World Bank, each with a unique mission. Throughout its 50-year history, members of the Bank have created many arms, known collectively as "the World Bank Group."<sup>5</sup>  These are the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Each has its own mission and goals.
<p><ol>
<b><li> The International Finance Corporation (IFC).</b> The Bank established the IFC in 1956 to provide loan guarantees and subsidized loans to businesses in less developed countries. These loans, usually long-term, are focused on equity investment (like stock markets) and similar lending. Interest rates are supposed to be the going market rates, which vary between countries and with the proposed project. Maturity on the loans is generally 13 years, with a grace period of up to eight years. Some 80 percent of the funding is borrowed by the Bank from international financial markets and through public bond issues. The rest is borrowed from the IBRD. Each year, the IFC approves some $4 billion to $5 billion in new financing.<sup>6</sup>  In 1995, the U.S. contributed $36 million to the IFC.
<p>
<b><li>The International Development Association (IDA).</b> The Bank established the IDA in 1960 to provide assistance to poor countries that cannot afford to borrow money from the IBRD. The funds are provided separately by donor nations and through IBRD investment profits. Two types of loans have been offered through this branch of the Bank: IDA credits and Special Fund credits. The IDA no longer makes Special Fund credits, but many are still in effect. Special Fund credits were granted with a 50-year maturity and a 10-year grace period during which no interest was applied. The interest rate on these credits is merely 0.75 percent. IDA credits are now the IDA's sole lending vehicle. They have the same service charge as was applied to the Special Fund credits. They also have the same 10-year grace period, but a shorter maturity of 35 or 40 years.
<p>
The United States also is the largest shareholder in the IDA, holding some 15 percent of the total votes in 1995. The U.S. has contributed some $21 billion since 1960,<sup>7</sup> and contributed $1.1 billion in FY 1995 alone.
<p>
<b><li> The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).</b> The Bank established the ICSID in 1966 to promote an increased flow of international investment to areas of the world where foreign investors chose not to invest. The ICSID arbitrates disputes, helps put countries seeking investment in touch with investors, and provides advice, analysis, and studies on investment opportunities around the world.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<b><li> The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).</b> The Bank established MIGA in 1988 to remove some of the risk for investors investing in poor countries. MIGA provides investors with guarantees on many types of investments. It also provides governments with advice on improving their investment climate to attract more foreign investment. MIGA may insure up to 90 percent of an investment, with a current limit of $50 million per project. In 1995, it guaranteed some $672 million in investments and had another $210 million in outstanding credits.<sup>9</sup>  The U.S. contributed $22 million to MIGA in 1995.
</ol> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>How the World Bank Makes Loans and Grants.</b> Each year the Bank considers many loans. Though loan proposals officially are submitted by the president of the Bank to the executive directors, in reality the executive directors often work with the president's staff to develop proposals. Thus, the approval process is often merely a formality. The United States has no veto power over Bank loans, and the Bank frequently approves loans that the U.S. has opposed.<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Bank's funds are derived from country contributions and from investments the Bank makes in financial markets. The Bank sells bonds and other debt securities to pension funds, insurance companies, corporations, other banks, and individual investors. Its original source of income is contributions by member countries. Countries receiving loans are charged an interest rate, currently 7.27 percent. This rate is adjusted every six months. Maturity on the loans is generally from 15 to 20 years, with a five-year grace period.
<p>
<b>HISTORY OF THE WORLD BANK</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank has undergone a major transformation since it started in 1944. The Bank claims it has kept up with change to deal with the new challenges facing less developed countries. This contention is debatable, but it is true that the fundamental mission today is substantially different from what it was in 1944.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Lender of Last Resort.</b> In the beginning, the Bank's primary mission was to loan money to the war-ravaged countries of Western Europe and Japan to help them get on their feet after World War II. These loans were intended to help rebuild roads, bridges, electrical plants, and other public facilities and enterprises.<sup>11</sup>  Japan and the European countries would use World Bank loans when private bank loans were not forthcoming. Many private commercial banks refused to lend these nations money because they were bad risks, some of them having defaulted on World War I and post-World War I debts.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From 1944 to the mid-1950s, most World Bank loans went to the developed countries in Europe that had suffered extensive damage in World War II. Therefore, even though the Bank loaned some $543 million for the reconstruction of Europe, the money was absorbed by countries that essentially were advanced developed economies with strong economic foundations in banking, property rights protection, the rule of law, functioning courts, and borders open to foreign investment.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because these countries already had the basic building blocks of an advanced economy, they were able to put the World Bank loans to productive use. Yet U.S. private investment in post-war Europe played a larger role in reconstruction than the World Bank. The World Bank loaned Western European countries $543 million from 1945-1950, while U.S. private investment was $1.76 billion for the same period.<sup>12</sup>  Therein lies the real success story of Europe's recovery. While it is true that funding from the World Bank, other financial institutions, and the Marshall Plan helped rebuild war-torn Europe, the biggest impact on Europe's economic recovery came from private foreign investment.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>An International Welfare Agency.</b> By the late 1950s, it became clear that the World Bank had served its purpose. Europe and Japan were well on their way to recovering from World War II. Private foreign investment was pouring into these regions to take advantage of their renewed economic strength. America realized its economic dominance in the world as U.S. investment flowed abroad to fuel economic development and growth. At this time, the Bank faced a fundamental choice: It could dissolve because its major goal had been met, or it could evolve into something not imagined by its creators.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Eventually, the World bank decided on the second course. By the mid-1960s, the Bank began to transform itself from a lender of last resort to an international welfare agency to assist the poor and less developed countries of the world. In 1960, for example, the Bank created the International Development Agency (IDA), which makes subsidized loans to poor countries either unable to afford private commercial loans or regarded as bad credit risks. Even though the original mission statement made casual reference to the "less developed" world, the Bank's founders largely had envisioned this as purely advisory. Yet the Bank began to give more than advice to less developed countries; in the 1960s, it began to give them substantial loans. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>McNamara's Brainchild.</b> The mastermind of this transformation was former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, who took charge of the World Bank in 1968. To fund McNamara's new international welfare clearinghouse, the Bank had to seek ever-increasing levels of contributions from donor countries. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Also under McNamara's watch, the Bank formulated a new concept, called "sustainable development," that became the IDA's principal mission. Stated simply, this means that less developed countries can achieve sustainable levels of economic development only if enough resources are transferred from wealthy countries to poor countries. If loans are any measure of success, McNamara was "successful" indeed. By 1981, when McNamara resigned as president of the World Bank, lending had grown more than tenfold, from $883 million to $12 billion. World Bank lending and grants continue to grow, today totaling over $20 billion.<sup>13</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The World Bank remains fully committed to this kind of thinking, with most of its bureaucrats dedicated to the McNamara dogma. A book published in 1995 by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to commemorate their 50-year anniversary claims that "This institutional evolution has been matched by a changing approach to development. The early focus on discrete projects has evolved into a broader emphasis on policies, strategies, and institutions, and a more holistic approach to development.... [The World Bank] Group's primary concern is to help borrowers reduce poverty and improve living standards by promoting sustainable growth and investment in people."<sup>14</sup>  In other words, the World Bank is not the institution created in 1944 by the Bretton Woods Agreement; it has changed from lender of last resort to international welfare agency.
<p>
<b>DECADES OF FAILED POLICIES</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While many of the Bank's economists are free to acknowledge the importance of macroeconomic reform in the recipe for economic growth, many of the Bank's officials continue to place too much emphasis on the importance of multilateral institutions to less developed countries. For example, former World Bank President Lewis T. Preston said in 1995: "Of fundamental importance, the Bank Group has evolved from being simply a financier of development to being also a trusted advisor on development, sharing its global experience of what does and does not work and helping its member countries to apply the lessons.... Fifty years of experience have validated the Bank Group's fundamental objective today: helping borrowers reduce poverty and improve living standards through sustainable growth and investment in people."<sup>15</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thus, the Bank seems to claim not only that it has been successful at reducing poverty and improving living standards in less developed countries, but also that its continued existence is vital to the economic prospects of less developed countries in the future. Yet all the evidence shows that this is not true. Since its inception, the World Bank has provided over $356 billion to countries around the world, mostly to the less developed world.<sup>16</sup>  But most recipients are no better off today than they were before receiving such aid. In fact, many are worse off. Consider the following:
<p><ul>
<li>Of the 66 less developed countries receiving money from the World Bank for more than 25 years (most for at least 30 years), 37 are no better off today than they were before they received such loans (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>);<sup>17</sup>
<p>
<li>Of these 37 countries, 20 actually are worse off today than they were before receiving aid from the World Bank (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>);<p>

<li>Of these 20, eight have economies that have shrunk by at least 20 percent since their first World Bank loan (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>); and<p>

<li>The remaining 17 countries have economies today that are essentially the same as when they first received aid from the World Bank (see <a href="bg1082t1.gif">Table 1</a>).
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While many countries are no better off today than before they received money from the World Bank, some have performed particularly poorly.
<ul>
<li>From 1965 to 1995, Nicaragua received over $637 million in World Bank aid. Its per capita gross domestic product in 1965, measured in constant 1987 U.S. dollars, was $1,752. Today it is only $875, some 50 percent less than before Nicaragua received any aid.
<p>
<li>The African country of Niger received over $589 million in World Bank aid from 1965 to 1995. Yet its per capita GDP has shrunk by 54 percent, from $605 in 1965 to $280 today.
The evidence shows that the World Bank has a poor track record. One might expect that at least half of its recipients would be better off economically today then before they started receiving such aid, but this is not the case. Many are actually worse off. After nearly three decades, it seems clear that most long-term recipients of World Bank loans still are not achieving "sustainable development."
</ul><p>
<b>WHY WORLD BANK PROGRAMS FAIL</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The main reason for a lack of economic growth in these countries is a corresponding lack of economic freedom. A lack of economic freedom prevents countries from creating wealth and prosperity, and a recent worldwide survey of economic freedom finds that many World Bank recipients have economies that are mostly not free or repressed. <I>The 1996 Index of Economic Freedom</I>, published by The Heritage Foundation, analyzes the level of economic freedom in 142 countries.<sup>18</sup>  The study considers ten economic factors -- trade, taxation, government consumption, monetary policy, banking, foreign investment, wage and price controls, private property rights, regulation, and black markets -- and categorizes each country as having a "free," "mostly free," "mostly not free," or "repressed" economy. The findings of the study demonstrate that a majority of World Bank loan and grant recipients do not have significant levels of economic freedom:
<p><ul>
<li>Of the 60 long-term recipients of World Bank aid that were graded in <I>The 1996 Index of Economic Freedom</I>, 37 have economies that are "mostly not free" or "repressed" (see <a href="bg1082t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
<p>
<li>Only 23 long-term recipients of World Bank aid have economies that are "mostly free," and none have economies that are "free" (see <a href="bg1082t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thus, most long-term recipients of World Bank loans and grants still do not have significant levels of economic freedom. Moreover, those recipients that have performed particularly poorly are the least economically free:
<p><ul>
<li>he 18 countries whose economies have shrunk since they have been World Bank recipients, 16 have either "mostly not free" or "repressed" economies (see <a href="bg1082t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Economic prosperity is not forthcoming in these countries because they do not have economic freedom. Rather, most have high taxes, barriers to trade, restrictions on foreign investment, banking systems in disarray, onerous government regulations, bad monetary policies, extensive wage and price controls, and large black markets. To be sure, 23 long-term recipients of World Bank aid do have mostly free economies, but most of these are in Latin America, an area which has benefited from several years of economic reform. Thus, their categorization as having mostly free economies is a recent phenomenon.<sup>19</sup>  It is good that they are making progress, but given the evidence elsewhere in the world, it would be difficult to attribute this progress to help from the World Bank.
<p>
<b>HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE: MODELS OF GROWTH WITHOUT WORLD BANK AID</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The poor record of the World Bank in delivering on its promise of economic development can be demonstrated not only by listing its many failures, but also by examining some development successes that occurred without the Bank's help. Hong Kong and Singapore are the most successful of the so-called Asian Tigers, running up phenomenal economic growth rates that are the envy of the developed world. They did this largely without loans from the World Bank. Even though they were as poor 30 years ago as other countries that took World Bank aid, they eschewed World Bank loans and embarked instead on successful programs of economic liberalization. The evidence shows that there is a direct correlation between the economic freedom these countries enjoy and their tremendous economic growth over the past 30 years. Of one thing there can be absolutely no doubt: World Bank assistance was in no way responsible for creating the best development success stories the world has seen during this 30-year period.
<p>
<b>Hong Kong </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the 1960s, the U.S. foreign aid community and international lending institutions like the World Bank decided that the East Asian region was barren of economic promise and that they should focus their aid on Africa instead. Hong Kong received no aid from the World Bank and only a small amount in U.S. foreign aid -- $43 million, most of which was cut off after 1965. The World Bank admitted that many economists misjudged the economic prospect in Asia. In the commemorative volume marking the Bank's 50th anniversary, the authors state: "In the 1960s, many economists were more optimistic about sub-Saharan Africa than East Asia. Yet, East Asia proved to be the 'miracle' of the developing world -- and sub-Saharan Africa its most daunting challenge."<sup>20</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While eschewing foreign aid after 1965, Hong Kong at the same time began a massive economic liberalization program. This included reforms in many sectors, including banking and financial services, government regulation of business, and foreign investment laws. Among the most important of these reforms was lowering barriers to international trade and making Hong Kong's trade laws consistent with international standards. The government eliminated virtually all tariffs, duties, licensing requirements, and other import barriers. It also set up export processing zones, or "free trade areas," that allowed manufacturers to cut through red tape to sell their products overseas.<sup>21</sup>  These reforms enabled Hong Kong to create a large export industry which provided much of the fuel for Hong Kong's economic growth.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another critically important reform took place when Hong Kong established a tax structure that allows individuals and businesses to keep most of the wealth they create. For example, Hong Kong has a flat tax of 20 percent on incomes over $155,000. The worker making the average income of about $22,500 is taxed only 2 percent. Hong Kong's corporate tax rate is a flat 16.5 percent, compared to 35 percent in the U.S.<sup>22</sup>  These and other economic reforms helped turn Hong Kong into the economic powerhouse it is today.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

After these economic reforms were in place, Hong Kong's economy indeed took off. GDP increased 9.2 percent a year from 1970 to 1980. From 1980 to 1993, it increased an additional 6.5 percent.<sup>23</sup>  Overall, over the past 35 years, Hong Kong's per capita GDP has grown an astonishing 530 percent, with most of this growth occurring since the beginning of economic liberalization.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
<b>Singapore </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Singapore also exhibited little economic promise in the early 1960s, according to the economic forecasts of the day. In fact, it was often referred to as "Asia's Cuba."<sup>25</sup>  The World Bank gave most of its loans to Singapore -- some $93 million -- before 1970. Singapore received its last World Bank loan in 1975.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As World Bank loans were drying up, Singapore, like Hong Kong, embarked on a course of economic liberalization -- with the same stunning results. Starting in the late 1960s and continuing into the 1970s, Singapore instituted a series of economic reforms aimed at achieving two major goals. The first was to promote increased foreign investment and higher levels of exports. To this end, Singapore opened its market to foreign investors. By 1970, some 80 to 90 percent of all manufactured exports were derived from foreign investment.<sup>26</sup>  Why did foreign investment pour into Singapore?  There are many reasons. One surely was that Singapore's legal system, based in British common law, provided rule of law, an efficient legal system, and a way for investors to achieve protection of their investments through contracts. Equally important was the fact that Singapore established a foreign investment code, free of local content or production restrictions, that guaranteed equal treatment under the law for both domestic and foreign firms.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The second goal was to reform Singapore's tax system. Singapore adopted a tax system that reduced the burden on most of the people. For example, while the top tax rate is 30 percent, the tax on the average income level of $21,000 is little or none. In fact, the average Singapore worker must make almost $30,000 before paying taxes. For that first tax bracket, the rate is 19 percent.<sup>27</sup>  In addition, Singapore resisted the implementation of onerous business regulations; abolished trade restrictions on imports (the average tariff rate now is about 0.4 percent, compared to 3.3 percent in the U.S.); and has kept inflation below 3 percent a year since the mid-1970s.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These economic reforms helped increase Singapore's gross domestic product. From 1970 to 1980, GDP increased by 8.3 percent a year. From 1980 to 1993, it increased an additional 6.9 percent. Overall, Singapore's gross national product has increased by over 6 percent a year since 1965.<sup>28</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hong Kong and Singapore have achieved the highest levels of economic prosperity to be found anywhere among the world's recently developed countries. In fact, they have achieved phenomenal economic growth rates that are the envy of the developed world. The evidence suggests that their policies of economic freedom are the principal reason for this success. There is a direct correlation between the economic freedom these countries have achieved and their tremendous economic growth over the past 30 years.<sup>29</sup>  There is also a direct correlation between this growth and a lack of aid from the World Bank. World Bank assistance was in no way responsible for creating the best development success stories the world has seen over the past 30 years (see <a href="bg1082c1.gif">Chart 1</a>):
<p>
<b>PHASING OUT SUPPORT FOR THE WORLD BANK</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The facts show that the World Bank's approach to economic development is a failure. The facts also show that countries which adopt free market economic reforms can develop without aid from the World Bank or any other institution. Promises by the World Bank to reform have made little difference. The U.S. therefore should begin withdrawing its financial support. Specifically, Congress should:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Phase out financial support for the World Bank. </b>Ideally, the U.S. Congress would refuse immediately to appropriate any more money to the World Bank. But with current political realities, this approach seems unlikely. Therefore, the most workable approach would be for Congress to phase out U.S. funding over seven years. In the event the Clinton Administration refuses to sign onto a seven-year balanced budget, Congress then should seek to withdraw funding through the appropriations process.
<p>
<li><b>Seek a General Accounting Office audit of World Bank lending practices.</b> The General Accounting Office (GAO) long has performed intensive analyses of such programs as foreign aid. Many of these audits have concluded that much of the U.S. foreign aid program is fraught with waste, fraud, and abuse; in some cases, these audits have discovered that programs simply do not work. The last GAO report dealing specifically with the World Bank, published in 1994, found that most of the Bank's reforms have failed to make it more efficient and effective.<sup>30</sup>  Congress should call on the GAO to launch a new study of the effectiveness of World Bank lending, to focus on:
<p>
<b>1)</b> The economic performance of recipients of World Bank aid;
<p>
<b>2)</b> The effectiveness and efficiency of World Bank programs in meeting their stated goals;
<p>
<b>3)</b> The influence the World Bank has on encouraging recipient countries to adopt specific economic policies; and
<p>
<b>4)</b> Conducting an audit of the World Bank's financial records.
<p>
<li><b>Make remaining funding contingent on public access to World Bank records and information.</b> It is difficult to obtain detailed information on the recipients of World Bank loans, the conditions imposed on loan recipients, and the number and amount of loans in default. While the World Bank is an international organization, it is partly funded by the American taxpayer, who has a right to know how the money is being spent. The American public and Congress should have access to all of the Bank's financial records and information. As long as Congress continues to appropriate money for the World Bank, it should make that funding contingent on free and open access to World Bank information.
<p>
<li><b>Require that the Administration provide Congress with a report on the level of economic freedom in World Bank recipient countries.</b> While the World Bank continues to lend money to countries with little chance of growing economically, there is no accounting of the economic conditions in many of these countries. Congress should require the U.S. Representative to the World Bank, Jan Piercy, to provide Congress with a report detailing the economic conditions that exist in countries that receive World Bank funding. Specifically, the report should include information on the level of economic freedom that exists in the following areas: trade, taxation, government consumption, monetary policy, banking, foreign investment, regulation, wage and price controls, and property rights.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since 1944, the World Bank has spent $346 billion trying to advance economic development around the world, and not all of this money has been repaid. While it played an important role in getting Europe on its feet after World War II, the World Bank has drifted away from its original mission to become little more than a clearinghouse for international welfare. Most recipients of loans and grants are no better off today than when they first received them. In fact, many are worse off.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Clearly, the World Bank's approach to economic development is a failure. But while recipients of World Bank loans continue to wallow in poverty, countries like Hong Kong and Singapore continue to experience unprecedented growth. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While there is overwhelming evidence to show the futility of such aid, the U.S. continues to support this failed institution, providing over $50 billion to the Bank in 1995, including both monetary allocations and commitments. American policymakers should admit this failure and begin phasing out U.S. financial support for the World Bank over seven years. Not only will billions in U.S. taxpayer dollars be saved, but countries in the less developed world may be able finally to break the economic chains that have kept them impoverished.

	For weeks now the Clinton Administration has been trying to change the subject in foreign affairs. After two and a half years of the poorest foreign policy performance since Jimmy Carter's presidency, the Clinton Administration now claims that it is the new majority in Congress that is damaging America's place and image in the world. Congressional efforts to reorganize the State Department, curb wasteful development assistance, and prevent the United States from participating in failure-prone United Nations peacekeeping missions have been portrayed by the President as a "frontal assault" on presidential authority and as the "most isolationist proposals in 50 years."<p>

	The American people should not be fooled by either Bill Clinton's internationalist rhetoric or by his accusations against the congressional majority. His rhetoric masks actions that are potentially far more isolationist in their consequences than anything proposed by Members of Congress. Clinton's foreign, defense, and trade policies reflect both a dangerous inconsistency and the lack of any coherent national strategy. They are dramatically weakening America's capability to project military power overseas, undermining U.S. alliances, inflaming protectionist sentiments at home and abroad, and squandering America's credibility. If present trends continue, America's influence in the world will shrink, and U.S. friends and allies will be faced with the slow-motion disengagement of the United States from its overseas commitments -- isolationism not by design, but by default. In the words of National Security Advisor Anthony Lake, this is a policy of "back-door isolationism."<p>


<h3><center><a name="isolationists">CLINTON VS. CONGRESS:<br> THE PRESIDENT'S "BACK-DOOR ISOLATIONISTS"</a></h3><br></center>

	The Clinton Administration's charges of congressional isolationism began a few weeks ago in response to a bid by House and Senate Republicans to reorganize the State Department and trim foreign aid. A bill proposed by Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) would abolish the Agency for International Development (AID), the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), and other foreign policy agencies. A House bill, the American Overseas Interests Act, which has passed the International Affairs Committee but awaits a floor vote, would eliminate these agencies and cut $2.8 billion from the $21.6 billion foreign affairs budget proposed by the Administration. This amounts to a 13 percent reduction. Another House bill, the National Security Revitalization Act, would restrict U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations. Part of the GOP's Contract with America, this bill has been approved by the House.<p>

	Lake professes alarm. He warned in a speech on April 27 at the National Press Club that "The United States could be on the brink of unilateral disarmament."  America's success in the world, Lake charges, "is under attack by new isolationists from both the left and the right.... Our policy of engagement in world affairs is under siege and American leadership is in peril."  People who hold these views are "back-door isolationists" who refuse to provide the tools for engagement, which to Lake means primarily foreign aid and joining U.N. peacekeeping operations. Apparently persuaded by these views, President Clinton has threatened to veto the House foreign affairs bills. A vote scheduled for May 24 was postponed until after the Memorial Day recess primarily because the House leadership did not have enough time to stage votes on the over 100 amendments that were proposed.<p>

	Congressional Republicans have many motivations, but not "back-door" isolationism. First, they want to adjust America's foreign policy apparatus to a new era. The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency is a creature of U.S.-Soviet arms control agreements and should be abolished. So, too, should the Agency for International Development, which purports to help developing nations but in reality has failed abysmally in promoting economic growth and development. There is no place for these agencies in an era in which the Soviet Union no longer exists and the free market and trade, not foreign aid, are the engines of economic development.<p>

	Second, congressional Republicans are trying to balance the budget. At a time when the American people are being asked to tighten their belts, why should foreign aid programs be spared from cuts?  Why should AID be spending $2 million to study ecotourism in Central America while senior citizens are asked to accept cutbacks in Medicare?  Why should AID be spending $12 million to develop the "sustainable growth" of Oman's fishing industry?  And why should AID have a contract with a group called Development Associates, Inc., to study AID's own project evaluation studies?  Former Secretary of State James Baker is right when he says that "AID's only useful purpose is to serve as a standard for inefficiency for other agencies to avoid."<p>

	By themselves, Congress's proposed reductions in foreign aid should have no affect on U.S. credibility or commitments abroad. Most foreign aid, in fact, is spared from the budget ax. The most valuable part of the U.S. foreign aid program -- the part that demonstrates America's commitment to its most important interests -- will not be touched. This includes aid to Egypt and Israel, plus U.S. security assistance. Only demonstrated failures -- such as bilateral development assistance and contributions to the wasteful and inefficient World Bank and International Monetary Fund -- will be affected. These congressional proposals can damage U.S. credibility only if the President presents an alarmist and misleading interpretation of them to the world. <p>

	Thirdly, House and Senate Republicans are trying to prevent some of the worst foreign policy mistakes of the Clinton Administration from repeating themselves. This, too, has nothing to do with promoting isolationism but everything to do with trying to preserve U.S. credibility abroad. The desire to curb U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations flows directly from congressional dissatisfaction with the Clinton Administration's inept handling of the operation in Somalia. This failure and the flip-flops in Bosnia, Haiti, and elsewhere, have embarrassed the U.S. and cast doubt on America's credibility as a world leader. Preventing a recurrence of such mistakes would go a long way toward restoring some of the credibility lost during the Clinton presidency.<p>


<h3><center><a name="retreat">CLINTON'S STRATEGIC RETREAT: <br>THE DECLINE OF AMERICAN MILITARY POWER</a>
</h3></center><br>
	Lake is alarmed that America may be on the "brink of unilateral disarmament."  This alarm is fully justified, but the reason is the Clinton Administration's military policies, not plans by Congress to cut foreign aid or restrict U.N. peacekeeping operations.<p>

	On the heels of cuts that have reduced defense budget authority by about 40 percent in real terms since 1985, Clinton's fiscal 1996 defense request would impose an additional 9 percent through Fiscal Year 1999. The results will be lower troop morale, weaker combat readiness, inadequate weapons modernization, and less research on high-tech weaponry. However, the most serious problem with Clinton's defense policy is that his proposed budget will not fund the force he says the country needs to defend itself. The planned Clinton force will be underfunded over five years by around $110 billion. Therefore, without additional funding, the U.S. will not possess a force capable of meeting even the Administration's own relatively low requirements. <p>

	If these defense budget trends continue, the U.S. eventually will be forced to write off either Europe or Asia as a region it is able to defend. Under the Clinton budget, the U.S. would be hard pressed to win even one major regional conflict. Under no circumstances could it win two regional conflicts "nearly simultaneously," as promised in the Administration's Bottom-Up Review of defense requirements.<p>

	In short, Clinton's defense budget will lead not only to "unilateral disarmament," to use Lake's phrase, but to a strategic retreat from military commitments overseas as well. Unable to make good on these commitments, the U.S. will be forced to withdraw many of its forces from overseas. Unable to rely on the U.S., America's allies in turn will have to establish new security arrangements, in some cases accommodating themselves to enemies of the United States. Allies also may have to rearm, possibly with nuclear weapons. Vast regions of the world will be abandoned to the spheres of influence of other powers such as China or Russia. American influence and power in the world will wane. The American Century will be over.<p>

	Nothing -- not foreign aid, not participating in U.N. peacekeeping operations -- demonstrates seriousness about international affairs more clearly and convincingly than commitment to remaining a global military power. As Malcolm Wallop so aptly says, "A foreign policy without a military capability is but a prayer."  Without a global military capability, the U.S. inevitably must fall back to a more isolationist foreign policy. Unable to protect its allies and serve as a force for peace and stability, the U.S. will lose its ability to exert influence. As a result, it will find its allies less cooperative and more untrustworthy, its enemies more assertive, and the world more inhospitable to U.S. interests and values. <p>


<h3><center><a name="protectionism">CLINTON FANS THE FIRES OF PROTECTIONISM</a></h3></center>

	The Clinton Administration also ignores the isolationist implications of its international trade policies. It has threatened to impose unilateral trade sanctions against Japan unless Japan agrees to purchasing quotas for U.S. automobiles and auto parts. The Japanese have vowed to take their case to the World Trade Organization if Washington proceeds with sanctions. The U.S. and Japan, two long-time allies and the keys to peace and security in Asia, are on the verge of a trade war.<p>

	Until now, the Clinton Administration has had a mixed but relatively good record in supporting free trade. Its support for the North American Free Trade Agreement was exemplary. However, the Administration's trade policy has been schizophrenic. Toward Latin America and with respect to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Clinton has been a free trader; toward Japan, he has consistently pursued a managed trade policy. The recent U.S. threats of trade sanctions merely represent an escalation in a policy that has existed from the very beginning.<p>

	However, this is an escalation with a difference. The rhetoric from United States Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has become very heated, causing Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to remark that "Mr. Kantor is even more scary than my wife when I get home under the influence of alcohol."<p>

	A trade war could have devastating consequences. Anti-Japanese feelings already are fairly strong in the United States. A recent poll taken by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations indicates that 62 percent of Americans believe economic competition from Japan represents a "critical threat" to the United States. A trade war would add fuel to the fire, drowning out more sensible voices calling attention to the strategic importance of the U.S.-Japanese alliance to the peace and security of Asia. Moreover, if Japan were to win its case against the U.S. in the WTO, isolationists and protectionists like Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot would be emboldened to broaden their attacks on free trade policies. The expansion of NAFTA could be stopped in its tracks, and the World Trade Organization could go the way of the League of Nations in the 1920s.<p>

	Another tragic consequence of Clinton's trade policy toward Japan could be the destruction of the U.S.-Japanese military alliance. Some Americans would question the value of a military alliance with an ally that sues the U.S. in an international trade court. Some Japanese already are questioning the need to continue the alliance with the U.S. If the U.S.-Japan alliance fell apart, a critically important strategic anchor in Asia would be lost. It would very likely be the first step in the retreat from U.S. commitments in Asia.<p>


<h3><center><a name="waning">THE FRUITS OF CLINTON'S POLICY:<br> THE WANING OF AMERICAN CREDIBILITY ABROAD</a></h3></center>

	The perception is growing abroad that America is retreating from the world stage. But the main cause is to be found not in the halls of Congress, however, but in the White House. America's friends and allies are alarmed by the ineptitude and incoherence of Bill Clinton's foreign and defense policies. <p>

	The list of diplomatic inconsistencies and mistakes is a long one:<p>

BOSNIA. Knowing that the Serbs take U.N. hostages when hit with NATO air strikes, the President pressed NATO to launch air strikes -- and he did so without any backup plan. As expected, the Serbs began taking hostages and escalated the conflict. Compounding the problem, the President pledged to consider using U.S. ground troops in Bosnia, a break with past policy that caused a storm of criticism from Congress. Whatever the outcome, these actions follow repeated instances in which the President has promised greater U.S. action than is prudent or than can be sustained politically. The result: The credibility of NATO and U.S. leadership in Europe has plummeted.<p>

IRAN. The President announced a tightening of the oil embargo against Iran without first trying to line up the support of U.S. allies, a mistake which condemns the move to failure. The result: proof that America cannot lead its allies in an important diplomatic initiative.<p>

NORTH KOREA. Unable to maintain a coherent and fixed negotiating position, the Clinton Administration has been buffeted and manipulated by the North Koreans in their bid to retain their nuclear weapons program. The results: greater credibility for North Korea, more time for Pyongyang to work on its nuclear program, and doubts about U.S. leadership and credibility in Seoul and other capitals of Asia.

CHINA. The Clinton Administration came into office promising to punish Chinese human rights violations with trade sanctions. When Beijing remained intransigent, the Administration backed off by offering to continue China's Most Favored Nation trading status. The results: a growing Asian perception of weak U.S. leadership and a tougher Chinese posture.<p>

RUSSIA. The Administration has vacillated between accommodation and toughness, sending mixed signals in the process. On the one hand, Clinton went to Moscow despite the bloody war in Chechnya (while snubbing London) and he looked the other way as Russia threatens to circumvent the European conventional arms treaty. On the other hand, he has threatened to cut off aid to Russia unless Moscow stops assisting the Iranians with their nuclear program. The result: doubts in Europe and Russia about American consistency and purpose.<p>

JAPAN. The entire U.S.-Japanese relationship has been reduced to the issue of trade. The overriding importance of the U.S.-Japanese military alliance in maintaining peace and stability in Asia has been obscured by the Administration's campaign to force purchasing quotas of automobile parts on Japan.<p>

	Clinton's vacillation, inconstancy, and strategic myopia have drained U.S. foreign policy of much of its credibility. They have done more than anything else to raise doubts about U.S. leadership in the world. Because President Clinton refuses to lead, American influence in the world is now more marginal than at any other time in the last 50 years. This declining influence, if continued, is a recipe for the "back door" isolationism which Clinton's own National Security Advisor seems to fear.<p>


<h3><center><a name="foreign">CLINTON'S IDEA OF U.S. LEADERSHIP:<br> PROMOTING FOREIGN AID AND THE UNITED NATIONS</a></h3></center>

	The Administration's accusations of back-door isolationism rest primarily on two assumptions. The first is that foreign aid, as a major barometer of America's commitment to internationalism and engagement, is critical to U.S. leadership. The second is that criticism of the United Nations either is motivated by isolationist sentiments or could lead to isolationist consequences. According to this viewpoint, it is impossible for the U.S. to "go it alone," as some U.N. critics supposedly want, and America should work more closely with the United Nations to prevent crises from occurring. <p>

	Both of these assumptions are mistaken. Consider foreign aid. America spends about $14 billion a year on foreign aid. In a trillion dollar economy, this is not very much. Critics cannot have it both ways, arguing on the one hand that it is "only one percent" of the federal budget, and thus should be spared from cuts, while asserting on the other that even the slightest reduction in so relatively small an amount will cast doubt on American credibility.<p>

	American credibility depends on many things: on America's military capability, its military commitments to allies, and the health of its economy. Far down the list is foreign aid. To be sure, foreign aid can be a useful tool in exercising influence abroad, but it is a very thin reed upon which to base U.S. credibility. Few countries in the world continue to demand or want foreign aid from the U.S. <p>

	Instead, most countries want more trade from the U.S. American trade and investments are far more important than foreign aid in spreading American influence. In 1992, U.S. trade with the developing world amounted to $233 billion in imports and $171 billion in exports. In 1993 U.S. direct investment in the developing world reached a record $45.5 billion. These figures pale when compared with the annual foreign aid budget of $14 billion. U.S. trade and investments do far more than AID to promote economic development and growth in the Third World. They also do far more to spread American values and promote U.S. interests.<p>

	The most important barometer in measuring the seriousness of U.S. engagement abroad is U.S. defense capabilities. The U.S. spends around $50 billion a year on NATO alone. No other country in the world spends more to defend its allies and maintain international peace than does the U.S. These amounts are tangible investments in peace and stability, as well as unequivocal demonstrations of the American commitment to remain involved in international affairs. U.S. defense capabilities are far more important than anything AID or the World Bank do. In fact, U.S. military power and commitments are the best foreign aid programs in the world. 

	Far from slashing and burning the foreign aid budget, as some aid proponents have argued, the proposals by Senator Jesse Helms and other Members of Congress are designed to make foreign aid more effective by eliminating that which has failed and keeping that which has worked. The Helms proposal would ensure that foreign aid serves the national interest, promotes economic growth, and ensures that countries "graduate" from dependency on aid. Much of the aid to be cut by Congress is development assistance that has failed to promote economic growth as promised. Since security-related aid to such countries as Israel, Egypt, and Turkey is retained, it is spurious to charge that proposed aid cutoffs will damage U.S. security or America's relations with its most important friends and allies.<p>

	The second assumption -- that U.N. critics are isolationists -- is equally spurious. Most conservative critics of the Clinton Administration's U.N. policies are motivated not by some dream of returning to a fortress America, but rather by a desire to return America's U.N. policy to what it was during the Administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Reagan and Bush viewed the U.N. as a useful tool of U.S. foreign policy and supported traditional U.N. peacekeeping efforts in such places as the Middle East, Cambodia, and El Salvador. However, by expanding the U.N. mission in Somalia, the Clinton Administration drifted away from these traditional approaches. The Clinton team wanted to get the U.S. involved in U.N. "nation-building."  This entirely new approach was very different from that pursued by the Bush Administration, which had shown how useful the U.N. could be in establishing military coalitions.<p>

	When not used properly, however, the United Nations inevitably fails. It is this failure -- a failure caused mainly by the Clinton Administration's efforts to expand the missions and activities of the U.N. in places like Somalia and Bosnia -- that is undermining the U.N.'s credibility at home and abroad. In Somalia, for example, the Clinton Administration changed the Bush Administration's limited mission of feeding starving people to "nation-building" in the middle of a bloody civil war. These efforts have done more to discredit the U.N. in the eyes of the American public than anything the congressional majority has done.<p>

	Surely there is something strange about the idea that a healthy skepticism toward a flawed institution is tantamount to isolationism. In fact, the opposite is true: Skepticism is necessary to demonstrate U.S. leadership. The U.S. should not retreat from the U.N., but lead it. Washington should look upon the U.N. as one of many tools in foreign policy, working with and through the U.N. to the extent that it serves the national interest. This is how internationalists such as Ronald Reagan and George Bush thought of the U.N. It is how the way the Clinton Administration should think of it as well.<p>
<h3><center>

<a name="presidential">WHO IS ASSAULTING PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY?</a></h3></center>

	In his response to the House foreign policy bill, the President accused Members of the House and Senate of launching a "frontal assault on presidential authority" by trying to limit U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations. Their bills would require that the Administration explain not only how U.S. participation would serve the national interest, but how the U.S. would pay for it. <p>

	At the same time, however, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas has introduced the Peace Powers Act, which would repeal the War Powers Resolution. Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois has proposed an amendment that would do essentially the same. Both efforts are intended to reverse congressional encroachment on the authority of the President to conduct foreign policy and to perform his duties as Commander in Chief.<p>

	These plans to restore presidential authority in foreign policy at the expense of Congress fly in the face of President Clinton's charge of "assaults" on his authority. Why would Congress try to repeal the War Powers Resolution if it is so intent on denying the President his authority to conduct foreign policy?  And why is the Clinton Administration silent on repealing the War Powers Resolution if it is so concerned about presidential prerogatives?  Could it be that the Administration is far more concerned about the impact of congressional actions on the United Nations than it is about presidential prerogatives in foreign policy?<p>

	There is a huge difference between the restrictions imposed by the War Powers Resolution and those found in proposed legislation on the U.N. The War Powers Resolution requires, among other things, that the President withdraw U.S. military forces with sixty days of their deployment if Congress has not voted its approval. This amounts to a congressional fiat and an improper infringement on the prerogatives of the President as Commander in Chief. The President should consult with Congress on force deployments and ask for a declaration of war to fight a major conflict, but he should also have the right to deploy forces in a national emergency to protect American lives and interests. He should not have Congress second-guessing his decision in the middle of a national crisis.<p>

	The situation is -- and should be -- different with respect to the "peace powers" proposed in the House and Senate bills on the United Nations. The House bill would deny funds for U.S. forces placed under U.N. command unless the President can certify that it serves the national interest. Once the President has issued an executive order certifying that it is, he can send the troops on a U.N. mission. If he cannot prove a national interest, he has no business sending U.S. troops. In addition, the President must report on the purpose of the mission, the expected size and composition of the force, the costs of the operation, and the timetable for complete withdrawal of U.S. forces involved. <p>

	Congressional measures with respect to the War Powers Resolution and the United Nations distinguish properly between the commitment of American troops in defense of vital national interests -- which Congress tried to address in the War Powers Resolution -- and their participation in vaguely defined operations at the behest of a global body not subject to the U.S. Constitution. Since peacekeeping deployments are rarely urgent, it is appropriate that the decision to send U.S. troops be made only after the President consults officially with Congress. In more serious national emergencies which risk American lives and vital interests -- i.e., non-peacekeeping contingencies -- the President should have more leeway. Under all circumstances, the President should consult with Congress when deploying troops, and for major conflicts he should ask for a declaration of war, but his hands should not be tied by the War Powers Resolution when deploying troops in non-peacekeeping operations.<p>


<h3><center><a name="conclusion">CONCLUSION</a></h3></center>

	The Clinton Administration's rhetoric about the "isolationist proposals" from Congress is a red herring. The real danger of America's withdrawal from the world comes not from congressional cutbacks in foreign aid or restrictions on U.S. participation in the United Nations, but from the drift and weakness of Clinton's foreign and defense policies. America's credibility has plummeted over the past two years because this Administration lacks a coherent national strategy to deal with the many problems facing the U.S. abroad.  <p>
	The very people the President is tarring with the brush of isolationism are the ones who kept liberal neo-isolationists at bay in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and during the Persian Gulf War. These conservatives were internationalists then, and they remain internationalists to this day. They are ardent supporters of NATO expansion and a strong national defense. Many of them are strong advocates of an open and free international trade system. It is not they, but their critics from the left who will lead America to the back door of isolationism.<p><br>

Executive Memorandum No. 360<br>
July 8, 1993<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>


     The National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which spearheads
American efforts to foster democracy throughout the world, is in
danger of being dismantled. The House of Representatives on June 22
voted 243 to 181 to approve an amendment to the State Department
authorization bill that would eliminate the Clinton Administration's
$50 million fiscal 1994 budget request for the NED. The NED's future
now is in the hands of the Senate. 
<P>
     The Senate should reverse the House's shortsighted action and
restore NED funding. The NED is a dynamic, flexible, and cost-
effective means of furthering U.S. interests by promoting the
development of stable democracies in strategically important parts of
the world. The U.S. cannot afford to disarm unilaterally in the
international war of ideas.
<P>
     The NED's Role. The National Endowment for Democracy is a
private, non-profit organization established by Congress in 1983 to
strengthen democratic institutions and foster democratic values
throughout the world. Through its grant program, NED enlists the help
of private American groups to assist democratic reformers abroad. It
is active in almost 100 countries, working through some 75 American
grant recipients, including NED's four "core" institutions, the Center
for International Private Enterprise, the Free Trade Union Institute,
the International Republican Institute, and the National Democratic
Institute for International Affairs.

     The NED has played a vital role in providing aid to democratic
movements in the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, Cuba,
Iran, Iraq, Nicaragua, Vietnam, and elsewhere. It has dispatched
experts to help emerging democracies assemble the building blocks
necessary to sustain a stable democratic system: representative
political parties, a free market economy, independent trade unions,
and a free press. NED-affiliated advisers help formulate election
laws, train poll workers, monitor elections, and teach activists how
to build political parties.
<P>
     Critics of the NED claim that the NED is no longer needed because
of the collapse of Soviet communism. They neglect the fact that
communist dictatorships still control China, Cuba, North Korea, and
Vietnam. Moreover, ex-communists masquerading as nationalists continue
to dominate several of the Soviet successor states. The NED can play
an important role in assisting those countries in making the turbulent
transition to democracy. 
<P>
     The NED's job is far from over. More than half the world's people
live under authoritarian rule today. While communism has collapsed in
many countries, democracy will take many years to become firmly
rooted. Moreover, democracy is not the inevitable outcome of political
evolution in post-communist societies. Economic difficulties,
international conflicts, and the emergence of long-repressed ethnic,
national, political, and social tensions could trigger backlashes
against democratic reforms and generate significant setbacks for
democracy. After all, the Russian Bolsheviks and German Nazis both
seized power after their countries undertook abortive democratic
experiments. 
<P>
     The NED's role in consolidating the potentially fragile gains of
democratic reformers remains especially important. The reason:
Backsliding in one or more of the post-communist societies moving
toward democracy could encourage authoritarian movements in other
societies to escalate their opposition to democracy.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration: Asleep at the Switch. Ironically, the
NED's existence is threatened by Congress at the same time that the
Clinton Administration is trumpeting the importance of democracy in
American foreign policy. The Administration requested a $20 million
increase in the NED budget for fiscal 1994. Yet when the NED's very
existence was jeopardized in the June 22 vote in the House, Roll Call
reported that the Administration deployed only one lobbyist to defend
it. If the Administration expects its rhetorical commitment to foster
democracy to be taken seriously, it now must back it up with a strong
and concerted effort to convince Congress that:
<P>
Promoting democracy furthers U.S. national interests. <P>
     The historical record shows that democracies rarely go to war
against each other. While the U.S. need not embark on an open-ended
crusade for democracy, it should promote democratic institutions in
the former Soviet Union, Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America,
and other places where it is in the U.S. interest to do so.
Consolidating democracy in formerly hostile states enhances America's
long-term security. Democratic reforms also facilitate free market
economic reforms that often offer international trade and investment
opportunities.
<P>
The NED is a cost-effective vehicle for promoting democracy.<P>
     Funding the NED is a prudent investment because it is far less
expensive to aid friendly democrats than it is to defend against
hostile dictatorships. Giving the NED $50 million of democratic
"venture capital" could obviate the need to spend billions of dollars
on defense in the future, if Russia should revert to a hostile
dictatorship, for example. The NED's aid to grass roots organizations
also is cost-effective in comparison to government-to-government aid,
which often is siphoned off by foreign or American bureaucrats. The
NED's low overhead, in fact, got the agency in trouble with the
General Accounting Office (GAO), which issued a 1991 report
criticizing NED's grant monitoring, oversight procedures, and
financial controls. Subsequent NED procedural reforms led the GAO in
1992 to give a positive assessment of NED planning and evaluation
reforms.

<P>
The NED has capabilities unmatched by other aid programs. <P>
     The NED has the flexibility to adjust its programs to a rapidly
changing political situation in a particular country and create new
programs to address new political developments. It is adept at working
effectively with grass roots organizations in a manner that cumbersome
government agencies cannot match. Moreover, as a non-governmental
organization, the NED can assist democratic reformers in repressive
countries where official U.S. government support could provoke
diplomatic complications. Local political activists often prefer
receiving assistance from a non-governmental source, since aid from a
U.S. government agency may undermine their credibility in the eyes of
their countrymen.  
<P>
     Some NED critics argue that other private groups can perform some
of the same functions as the NED. They also maintain that the NED
could continue its programs with private funding. While it is true
that private democracy-building institutions, such as the Washington,
D.C.-based Krieble Institute, deliver effective assistance to
democratic reformers, there are few such organizations with the vision
and resources to exert a significant influence. Deprived of federal
funds, the NED would be forced to gut many of its programs for lack of
alternative funding sources.
<P>
Shrinking or abolishing the NED would be a dangerous signal. <P>
     Cutting back NED programs at a time when crucial democratic gains
have yet to be consolidated would signal that the U.S. is succumbing
to isolationism. This not only could demoralize reformers who have
taken risks to further democracy but could embolden opponents of
democracy to step up their own activities.
<P>
     Although the Cold War has ended, the global war of ideas
continues. Democratic institutions and ideals are and will remain
under attack from non-communist sources. Fundamentalist politico-
religious movements, authoritarian political forces, military coups,
and agressive dictators will continue to attack democracies and
undermine American interests. Given these realities, funding the
National Endowment for Democracy is a prudent investment for
safeguarding the future. The U.S. cannot afford to discard such an
important weapon in the international war of ideas.

<title>The Senate Faces Term Limits - Heritage</title>

<h3>THE SENATE FACES TERM LIMITS</h3>

By Kenneth R. Weinstein<br>
Director, Government Reform Project<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
<p>
Backgrounder Update No. 274<br>
April 19, 1996<br>
<p>
(Updating David M. Mason, "House Term Limit Options: Good, Better, Best," Heritage Foundation <I>Executive Memorandum</I> No. 406, March 22, 1995.)
<p><hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Next week, the U.S. Senate will make history as it begins consideration of  <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:s.j.res.00021:">S.J. Res. 21</a>, a constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms members of the House and Senate may serve. The amendment provides a uniform term limit of 12 years for House members and Senators.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Term limits are needed because long-term congressional incumbency tends to distort the character of representation. By becoming overly oriented toward the federal government and insulated from the public, Members of Congress can develop a set of interests and sympathies at odds with those held by their constituents. Term limits therefore would work to keep elected officials more in touch with voters. In addition, frequent rotation in office would help assure a continuous flow of new energy and innovative thinking in Congress.
<p>
<b>THE PUBLIC JUDGMENT </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Among major public policy issues, term limits enjoys virtually unrivaled public support. As far back as 1964, a Gallup poll recorded a 49 percent plurality of Americans favoring term limits; since then, support has swelled to 64 percent in 1990 and 73 percent in 1995. Moreover, even though a reform-minded Congress was elected in 1994, support for term limits continued to grow to 77 percent in 1996.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, unlike other "hot-button" issues whose support withers in the heat of public debate, support for term limits remains firm. Between 1990 and 1995, initiatives were approved in 23 states, with support averaging 66 percent.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yet, despite this overwhelming public support, in May 1995, the Supreme Court declared in <I>U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton</I> that state-imposed term limits on federal lawmakers are unconstitutional. Thus, if federal term limits are to be enacted, the only remaining course appears to be adoption of a constitutional amendment such as S.J. Res. 21.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The electoral tsunami of 1994 was due in no small part to public support for term limits, so the new majority in Congress has a special obligation to deliver on this issue. Indeed, ten of the 12 freshman senators already have announced their support for term limits. As public support continues to grow, long-term incumbents opposed to term limitsespecially those from states that already place term limits on their state and local officialsmust explain why they continue to ignore the public will.
<p>
<b>TEN LEADING MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT TERM LIMITS</b>
<p><ol>
<b><li>Claim: Term limits are an untested innovation. 
<p>
Fact: Along with the President, 37 governors are subject to term limits.</b> Term limits were contained in America's first governing document, the Articles of Confederation of 1781, but were not written into the Constitution, primarily because its authors saw them as "entering into too much detail" for a short document.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Claim: The election of scores of new Senators and Representatives in 1994 disproves the need for term limits.
<p>
Fact: 314 of the 348 incumbent House members who sought re-election won -- a re-election rate of 90 percent.</b> Fully 92 percent of incumbent Senators -- 24 of 26 candidates -- won re-election.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Claim: Campaign finance reform will render term limits obsolete. 
<p>
Fact: Senator Fred Thompson (R-TN) has called term limits "the ultimate campaign finance reform vehicle."</b>  Term limits create open seats, which lead to contested races. These races are more competitive because they are less costly: Challengers do not have to compensate for the fundraising advantage held by incumbents, who nearly always win.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Term limits will deprive the nation of talented legislators. 
<p>
Fact: Self-governance is the basic supposition of democracy. </b>It is sheer arrogance to maintain that only one person in a half-million is qualified to be in Congress. Furthermore, while term-limited Senators and Representatives could serve in different capacities, other talented individuals would be given opportunity for advancement.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Term limits are undemocratic because they restrict voter choice. 
<p>
Fact: Incumbents enjoy electoral advantages franking, staff, and travel allowances that present huge barriers to entry by challengers.</b> Moreover, experience at the state level suggests that term limits actually increase voter choice. In California, for instance, the imposition of state-level term limits in 1990 led to an increase of over 25 percent in campaign filings for the Senate and a similar increase of over 50 percent in filings for the Assembly by 1992.<sup>5</sup>  During the past half-century, gubernatorial races have been more competitive in term-limited states -- even in years when governors can run for re-election.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: The limited-government agenda of the 104th Congress means that term limits are no longer needed to fight pork-barrel politics. 
<p>
Fact: The longer individuals serve in Congress, the greater their propensity to support new spending initiatives.</b><sup>7</sup>  The frequent rotation imposed by term limits, on the other hand, would help to institutionalize the 104th Congress's bias against big spending.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Conservatives should avoid amending the Constitution at all costs. 
<p>
Fact: As George Will, a former opponent of term limits, argues, term limits offer a necessary constitutional corrective to the profound extraconstitutional metamorphosis of the federal government.</b> The Founders envisioned a citizen legislature as the backbone of limited government; as the interventionist state arose, however, politicians began to view public office as a career.<sup>8</sup>  Term limits would work to restore the Founders' intent by diminishing the tendency of Members of Congress to exploit their legally acquired powers to remain in office.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: As Senators find their terms limited, the Senate's capacity for deliberation and independent judgment likewise will be restricted. 
<p>
Fact: Term limits enhance the capacity for independence</b> by discouraging excessive concentration on fund-raising, re-election, and catering to special interests.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: If term limits are such a good idea, they should be imposed retroactively. 
<p>
Fact: Rather than openly oppose term limits, opponents have pursued a shrewd strategy of calling for retroactive application.</b> This argument is a red herring. Term limits represent principle, not retribution, and the public has rejected retribution. Only one retroactive congressional term limits measure has been offered to the voters (in Washington State in 1991), and it was rejected. It is not surprising that opponents of term limits are the only ones pushing for retroactive application.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Under term limits, unelected individuals will run Congress. 
<p>
Fact: This argument assumes that the departure of senior incumbents will create a vacuum in which more and more decisions are made by lobbyists and staff.</b> Lobbyists thrive because they cultivate relationships with long-term incumbents; rapid turnover would greatly diminish the value of such contacts. As for staff, anyone who has seen a congressional office knows that Congressmen give assignments rather than take them. The specter of career staff manipulating freshman Members has little support in reality. In a non-term-limited Congress, staff employees work on average between five and six years.<sup>9</sup>  Under term limits, new Members would likely replace aides to former Congressmen with employees of their own choosing.
</ol><p>
<b>THE SENATE VOTE AND THE THREAT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

One of the few reforms devised and implemented by people who live beyond the Beltway, term limits are a tribute to public involvement in politics. Yet, despite powerful grassroots support, term-limit laws in 23 states were overturned in May 1995 by the U.S. Supreme Court -- after the U.S. House of Representatives had failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed to ratify a federal constitutional amendment.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Frustrated by the Court's ruling and skeptical of Congress's desire to pass a constitutional amendment, some activists are pursuing a radical approach: calling for two-thirds of America's 50 state legislatures to approve an unprecedented constitutional convention to impose term limits. State legislatures in North Dakota and Utah already have called for such a convention. This year, 11 states will offer ballot measures to instruct state legislators to vote for a constitutional convention on term limits. Activists hope to garner the support of 34 state legislatures by the year 1999.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Term limits will remain a potent issue in 1996. President Clinton has decided to ignore the continued groundswell by opposing term limits. By contrast, Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) deserves credit for assuring that they will be considered by the U.S. Senate. Whether members of the Senate will continue to ignore public opinion -- thereby fueling the drive for a term limits constitutional convention -- remains to be seen.

     Term limit advocates have had difficulty translating their
overwhelming successes in state referenda into support in Congress. 
Freshman Rep.  Peter Hoekstra (R-MI) has an idea that may force
Congress to pay attention:  the Voter Opportunity to Inform Congress
Effectively (VOICE) on Term Limits Act, H.R.  3835.  This legislation
would create a national advisory referendum this fall on limiting the
terms of Members of Congress.  The question to voters would read: 
"Should Congress approve a constitutional amendment to limit the
number of terms that a Member of the United States House of
Representatives and United States Senator can serve in office?"  The
referendum would be placed on the November 8 general election ballot
in every congressional district and would be nonbinding, meaning that
ballot results on the question would be tabulated, certified, and sent
to Congress, but would not have a direct legal or constitutional
effect.  Though never before exercised, Congress has the authority to
order such a ballot question pursuant to its power to regulate
elections.
<P>
     The VOICE legislation requires that Congress's Judiciary
Committees consider the results of the term limit vote and report on
it to the House and Senate.  Though Congress would not be bound by the
national referendum, Members will ignore what is likely to be an
overwhelming pro-term limits vote at their own political peril.  Thus,
a national advisory vote may do more to induce congressional action on
term limits than have binding initiatives in individual states.
<P>
     VOICE supporters also favor a national approach because most
states do not allow citizen initiatives.  Voters in fifteen states
have approved term limits for their own congressional delegations, but
only eight additional states allow citizen initiatives.  A primary
argument against the state efforts has been that referendum states may
suffer under term limits relative to the remaining 27 states whose
Congressmen would be allowed to continue to amass experience and
seniority.  The nationwide vote under the VOICE initiative would avoid
that issue, give the public its first opportunity to vote on term
limits for federal officeholders, and present perhaps the only
opportunity for voters in non-initiative states to be heard on the
issue.  Activists in the 27 states that do not have the initiative
process are finding it difficult to push state legislators (many with
future congressional ambitions) into voting for term limits on
Congressmen.
<P>
     A legally binding national referendum would require a
constitutional amendment.  The VOICE Act, however, avoids that need
and skirts some problems that could be encountered in a binding
ballot.  The VOICE question does not include a specific number of
years or terms, for instance, postponing at least temporarily a
divisive fight between congressional backers and grass-roots activists
over the appropriate length for term limits.
<P>
     Although never implemented, a national referendum is not a new
idea.  In 1924, the Democratic party asked for a referendum on the
consideration of United States membership in the League of Nations. 
In 1964, Rep.  Charles Gubser sponsored a resolution to create a
yearly nationwide advisory opinion poll.  In 1980, current House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt introduced a bill to poll citizens on
three designated issues every two years during the federal election
cycle.
<P>
     Court Considerations.  Without a national referendum effort, a
Supreme Court decision adverse to the constitutionality of state-
imposed service limits on federal legislators could fatally wound the
term limits movement.  On February 10, Federal District Court Judge
William Dwyer declared Washington state's term limits law, challenged
by Speaker of the House Tom Foley, among others, unconstitutional as
it applied to federal officeholders.  On March 7, the Arkansas Supreme
Court issued a similar ruling on that state's law.  Both decisions are
being appealed and term limits backers are hopeful that higher courts
will reverse the rulings.  The cases emphasize, however, the
vulnerability of the state-by-state approach to term limits and the
need for a national effort.
<P>
     Opponents' Arguments.  Opponents of a national referendum on term
limits argue that the question should be left up to the states and the
court system.  But with fifteen states having already acted, and court
cases moving forward, there is no reason to wait for further judicial
setbacks before launching a national term limits effort.  Others
oppose referenda generally or assert that petitions and referenda work
fine in a town hall atmosphere, but are inappropriate on a nationwide
basis.  An advisory question, however, such as that proposed on term
limits, would represent a useful trial effort for a national
referendum process.  Foes also claim that the VOICE Act would be
confusing to the public, but suggest in a contradictory manner that
the question should be more specific about, for instance, the number
of terms.  However, a national referendum on term limits surely would
be the topic of widespread discussion, and any initial voter questions
would be clarified through campaign efforts or by the media. 
Fundamentally, opposition to the VOICE Act is led by anti-term limits
insiders who fear the outcome of a national referendum.  What they
really mean is that voters in the 27 states without the initiative
process should not have a voice on term limits.
<P>
     Freshman Support.  In an unusual display of election-year
bipartisanship, Republican freshman reform leaders Tillie Fowler (R-
FL) and Peter Torkildsen (R-MA) were joined by Democratic Freshman
Reform Task Force chairs Karen Shepherd (D-UT) and Eric Fingerhut (D-
OH) in supporting Hoekstra's bill, declaring, "It is time for Congress
to address an issue that is clearly important to the overwhelming
majority of the American people....   The American people deserve a
voice on the matter of Congressional term limits."  They further
called for prompt hearings on the reform proposal by the House
Administration Committee.  To date, 42 cosponsors have signed on to
the VOICE Act, and if blocked in committee, Hoekstra has high hopes
for House consideration of the legislation through a discharge
petition.  In addition, numerous grass-roots groups have agreed to
support H.R.  3835. 
<P>
     Term limit advocates believe that government truly derives its
power from the consent of the governed, and that all Americans should
have a voice in the issue.  With most polls showing 75 percent to 80
percent support for term limits, it is time for Congress to act on a
term limits constitutional amendment.  Petitions and referenda are
democratically appropriate and historically tested means for citizens
to bring the ruling classes into line.  Political royalty in
Washington should listen to their voters and learn from the past.  By
giving every voter a voice, H.R.  3835 could break the term limits
logjam and force Congress to bend to the will of the American people.

<p>
<dd>The House of Representatives is considering a new "Truth in Testimony" rule requiring witnesses that receive federal funds through government contracts to disclose the amount and source of the funds when they testify before congressional committees.<sup>1</sup>  Many of the objections to this rule concern its implementation rather than the principle of disclosure. This paper answers some of the most frequently asked questions about the Truth in Testimony rule and how it would work in practice. 
<p>
<b>Q: What is Truth in Testimony?</b>
<p>
A: Truth in Testimony is an amendment to the Rules of the House of Representatives, introduced by Representative John Doolittle (R-CA), that would require witnesses before congressional committees to disclose the amount of funding they receive from the federal government through grants or contracts.
<p>
<b>
Q: What is the goal of Truth in Testimony? </b>
<p>
A: It aims to give Congress more information about the background of congressional witnesses. By requiring witnesses to disclose their federal grants and contracts, Congress can learn whether a witness may have a vested interest in the subject under a committee's examination. Further, since congressional hearings often are the focus of media reports, this rule would alert the media and the public to any testimony that may be financially self-serving.
<p>
<b>
Q: Is Truth in Testimony a "gag rule"?</b>
<p>
A: No. Truth in Testimony is a sunshine law designed to elicit more information about witnesses appearing before congressional committees. It would not impose restrictions on the testimony of any witness, nor would it restrict the activities pursued by federal grantees.
<p>
<b>
Q: Who supports Truth in Testimony? </b>
<p>
A: The proposal was part of the 1996 Republican platform and is now under consideration in the House of Representatives. In addition to Congressman Doolittle, the idea also has the support of Representative Bob Livingston (Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee), Representative Gerald Solomon (Chairman of the House Rules Committee), Representative Tom DeLay (House Republican Whip), Representative George Radanovich (president of the freshman class during the 104th Congress), and other committee chairmen. The proposed rules change has been endorsed by several outside organizations, such as Americans for Tax Reform, the Christian Coalition, 60 Plus, National Right to Work, and Eagle Forum, among others.
<p>
<b>
Q: How would it work? </b>
<p>
A: Truth in Testimony would amend the House Rules and affect all committees and subcommittees, including authorizing and appropriations committees. The chairman of the committee or subcommittee would notify witnesses in advance of hearings that their written statements must disclose the amount of federal grants or contracts that they receive. If the witness does not make a good faith disclosure, then his or her testimony will not be included in the hearing record.
<p>
<b>
Q: How many witnesses would be affected? </b>
<p>
A: A survey of witnesses testifying in 1995 reveals that at least one of every three "public" (non-federal government) witnesses was a grant recipient. This amounts to roughly 3,000 witnesses each year, only a tiny percentage of whom currently disclose their subsidized status.
<p>
<b>
Q: What exactly would have witnesses have to list? </b>
<p>
A: The proposal would require witnesses, in their written statements, to include the following information about the organizations they represent: "the amount and source (by agency and program) of any federal grants (including subgrants from other organizations or from a state pursuant to a federal block grant) received, and contracts entered into, during the current and previous two fiscal years."
<p>
<b>
Q: Who would be responsible for making sure witnesses comply with Truth in Testimony? </b>
<p>
A: It would be the responsibility of the committee or subcommittee chairman, presumably through the staff, to check for disclosure in written testimony. Any needed clarification could be requested at the hearing or during the process of preparing hearing transcripts for printing. In most cases, witnesses are called to testify either because of their experience with a program, agency, and issue or because Members and staff are familiar with their organizations. Accordingly, the rule would not substantially increase burdens on committee staff.
<p>
<b>
Q: What if a witness fails to disclose the information and no one says anything? </b>
<p>
A: If a witness's statement lacks a grant and contract disclosure, it would be the responsibility of the committee staff to inquire about it. If staff members notice during or after the hearing that a written statement of a grantee or contractor failed to include the required information, then the witness could be contacted for a revision during the time typically allowed for corrections. To avoid any difficulties, witnesses should consult their organization's IRS Form 990, which lists its sources of revenue. Form 990 is a public document that each non-profit organization must file annually; by law, it must be made available for public inspection during regular business hours.
<p>
<b>
Q: What if a witness gives incorrect figures? </b>
<p>
A: The rule requires that witnesses make a "good faith disclosure" of information. If witnesses err inadvertently or through lack of knowledge, they would not be penalized. But if a witness refuses to make disclosure or intentionally provides incorrect information, his statement would be stricken from the record. No other penalties would normally apply since Truth in Testimony is a congressional rule rather than a civil or criminal statute.
<p>
<b>
Q: Does the Truth in Testimony rule include farm subsidies, entitlements, pensions, or benefits? </b>
<p>
A: No. The rule would only deal with federal grants and contracts that produce goods or services for the public at large or specific federal agencies. Such grants and contracts are awarded on a competitive basis by federal agencies. Grant applicants and contract competitors normally file a complicated grant request, and later must complete progress and final reports and financial evaluations of their project. Benefits to individuals, including Social Security, agricultural subsidies, federal pensions, and other entitlement programs would not be covered by Truth in Testimony. Categorical loan programs, such as those for students, small businesses, and disaster victims likewise would not be covered. Individuals automatically receive these entitlements or benefits because they meet certain eligibility requirements as specified by law.
<p>
<b>
Q: Shouldn't Congress already know who receives federal funds? </b>
<p>
A: Grants and contracts typically are issued by executive and independent agencies; Congress appropriates the funds and plays an oversight role. Individual congressional committees, however, do not have the resources to monitor the each of the grants or contracts given out by federal agencies. In a typical year, more than 80 agencies make federal grants totaling $40 billion to over 39,000 different groups.
<p>
<b>Q: Instead of burdening congressional witnesses with a new regulation, why can't this be done on an ad hoc basis? </b>
<p>
A: Without a rule establishing a policy of disclosure, witnesses would not be prepared to answer a question on grants or contracts their organizations receive. By requiring disclosure for all witnesses who receive federal funds, this rule eliminates the perception that a particular witness is under increased scrutiny because of the content of his or her testimony. Because each committee deals with the same set of interest groups and federal administrators repeatedly, committee or subcommittee chairmen naturally would be hesitant to invoke this rule on a case-by-case basis in order to avoid making beneficiaries of the programs they supervise feel uncomfortable.
<p>
<b>
Q: Why can't committees impose this rule on their own? </b>
<p>
A: Committees could impose a Truth in Testimony rule on their own. However, the "iron triangle" phenomenon, the natural sympathy of committees for the interests they oversee, makes committees reluctant to do so on their own. Truth in Testimony is needed to prevent committees from overlooking, or failing to disclose to Congress and the public, the degree to which hearings are dominated by program beneficiaries.
<p>
<b>
Q: What good will this do if both conservative and liberal advocacy groups are affected? </b>
<p>
A: The goal of the rule is not to penalize or intimidate government grantees or contractors, liberals or conservatives. Truth in Testimony simply aims to give Congress more information about the organization that a witness represents, and to alert Members to potentially self-serving testimony.
<p>
<b>
Q: Could witnesses skirt the rule by claiming that they are not testifying on behalf of the organizations for which they work? </b>
<p>
A: Possibly, but if they later claim to have testified on behalf of the organization they work for, in its official publications or elsewhere, they risk having their testimony stricken from the record. Moreover, if a witness is invited to testify on behalf of an organization, he would be expected to provide disclosure for that organization.
<p>
<b>
Q: How would academic experts be affected? </b>
<p>
A: Academic experts (for example, university professors) would be required to disclose any grants they personally received: for instance, research grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities or the National Institutes of Health. Such experts would not have to disclose grants to their university unless they were representing that university in an official capacity, as opposed to presenting their own expert views. In contrast, an assistant dean testifying on federal financial aid programs obviously should disclose his institution's grant receipts. The final authority to decide if a witness has been called as a representative of a particular organization rests with the committee chairmen who administer the rule.
<p>
<b>
Q: Does this disclosure requirement include companies or individuals who receive tax incentives or tax credits? </b>
<p>
A: No. Only direct federal funding -- contracts and grants -- is included in the rule, because this information is readily available for witnesses and can be checked by staff members. Tax incentives normally benefit an entire class of groups or individuals, while a grant is given directly to a particular organization. In addition, organizations testifying regarding tax provisions or exemptions normally are very direct in addressing the status of organizations or individuals they represent.
<p>
<b>
Q: How would this proposal affect defense contractors? </b>
<p>
A: Witnesses from defense contractors would be required to disclose the amount and source of their contracts, in the same manner as contractors for the Department of Energy, or independent agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency or NASA. Such information is already regularly disclosed by federal defense contractors, often in their annual reports. 
<p>
<b>
Q: Would this include testimony by personnel from federal agencies or the White House?</b>
<p>A: No. In contrast to public witnesses, Congress already knows that witnesses from federal agencies are funded by tax dollars. Further, federal agencies themselves are not normally the beneficiaries of grant programs. 
<p>
<b>
Q: Would Truth in Testimony affect oral testimony? </b>
<p>
A: The Rules of the House currently require witnesses to submit written testimony when practicable. This rule change requires disclosure of federal funding in the written statement, and not in the witness's oral summation.
<p>
<b>
Q: Does it include letters to the committee or the chairman? </b>
<p>
A: This type of unsolicited lobbying would be affected only if a committee decided to print it in the hearing volume. In that event, staff members could contact an organization for information on grants or contracts.
<p>
<b>
Q: Would Truth in Testimony affect lobbying outside of a committee hearing? </b>
<p>
A: No. The rule would apply only to committee hearings and not to informal contacts at committee, Member, or other offices.
<p>
<b>
Q: What is the official form and language of the Truth in Testimony proposal? </b>
<p>

A: As introduced by Representative Doolittle, the proposal reads:

<p>
<blockquote>
	Clause 2(j) of the Rules of the House of Representatives is amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:

	"(3)(A) Whenever any hearing is to be conducted by any committee upon any measure or matter, the chairman shall notify all prospective witnesses that written statements submitted to the committee shall include the following information: the amount and source (by agency and program) of any Federal grant (including subgrants from other organizations or from a State pursuant to a Federal block grant) received, and contracts entered into, during the current and previous two fiscal years, by witnesses and any organizations they represent.

	(B) If any witness at a committee hearing fails to make a good faith disclosure of the information required by subdivision (A), then all testimony of that witness at that hearing shall be expunged from the hearing record."
</blockquote>

An agreement between the U.S. Department of Justice and an allegedly crime-ridden labor union is being scrutinized in Congress because of allegations that political considerations may have led the government to adopt a lenient stance toward the union. One aspect of the relations between the Clinton Administration and the Laborers' International Union of North America which merits particular examination is the string of federal grants that have continued to subsidize LIUNA even as government investigators were uncovering evidence of organized criminal influence in the union. Restriction or elimination of grants to politically active groups like unions ought to be high on the list of remedies Congress considers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In addition to examining the Clinton Administration's handling of criminal investigations, Congress should seek to ascertain why purely discretionary funds continued to flow to a group subject to such serious allegations. Were federal grantmakers aware of long-pending allegations that LIUNA was tied to organized crime? And in reviewing evidence that union leaders misused union funds, Congress should ask the General Accounting Office and other agencies to investigate how those same officials used taxpayer funds entrusted to them.
<p>
<b>Welfare for Unions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The vast patronage network created by Congress and the federal bureaucracy during the past 40 years is out of control. Each year, American taxpayers fund nearly $39 billion in grants to over 40,000 private organizations,<sup>1</sup> many of which taxpayers might find objectionable or offensive. Even when the advertised purpose of a federal grant seems inoffensive, every federal dollar that an organization receives frees private resources for other uses, including political and lobbying activities in pursuit of ever more government subsidies. Furthermore, most federal grants include an "overhead" allowance that directly subsidizes all of a recipient's activities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Over the past few decades, labor unions have been among the major beneficiaries of federal largesse, receiving literally billions of dollars for educational, training, and construction programs.<sup>2</sup> The maze of federal grants to unions in areas ranging from job-training to AIDS education is so vast, and public disclosure so limited, that a precise figure is unavailable. One admittedly preliminary investigation uncovered $110 million in "direct subsidies" to unions between January 1993 to March 1994 from the Departments of Labor, Justice, Housing and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services alone.<sup>3</sup> And this is dwarfed by the indirect subsidies unions receive through worker training grants distributed by the states under the $3.4 billion federal Job Training Partnership Act.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	This year, the AFL-CIO has earmarked $35 million to defeat conservative members of the 104th Congress. Yet federal grants to the AFL-CIO continue. In the midst of this campaign, for example, the AFL-CIO was awarded a "financial management training" grant of $400,000 by President Clinton's supposedly nonpartisan "national service" program, AmeriCorps.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	While any group should be free to pursue legitimate political aims, labor unions enjoy two unusual privileges: federal grant subsidies and the ability to force workers to subsidize political efforts with which many union members disagree. Both of these privileges allow organized labor to use dollars earned coercively-either from taxpayers through federal grants or from union members through mandatory dues payments-to support a narrow ideological agenda.
<p>


<b>Money, Crime, and Politics</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In addition to the question of whether politically active groups should receive federal funding, the lack of accountability in the federal grants process is disturbing. The Laborers' International Union of North America received more than $11 million in federal grant money in FY 1994. In the 1994 election cycle, LIUNA's political action committee, the Laborers' Political League, donated over $1 million to Democratic Party congressional candidates. Whether federal grant dollars effectively subsidized political activity is a legitimate subject of inquiry, but the grants to LIUNA raise an even more significant question: Why did LIUNA continue to receive millions in federal grant dollars when it had been singled out for a decade as probably infiltrated by organized crime?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In 1986, President Reagan's Commission on Organized Crime issued a landmark report detailing the influence of organized crime on labor unions. The report singled out several unions, suggesting in a chapter entitled "A Case Waiting to be Made" that the Justice Department file racketeering charges against the Laborers' International Union of North America to return control of the union to its members.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Eight years later, in November 1994, DOJ's organized crime and racketeering section delivered a 212-page draft complaint to LIUNA's general president, Arthur Coia. The charge: that Coia, along with several co-conspirators, had "employed actual and threatened force, violence and economic injury to create a climate of intimidation and fear" at the Rhode Island-based union, which represents 700,000 workers, primarily in the hazardous waste cleanup and construction trades. The complaint recommended that Coia be "immediately removed" from his post as general president and that control of the union be assumed by an independent administrator.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Over the past two decades, LIUNA officials have recorded over 80 convictions for crimes ranging from racketeering to bribery, extortion, tax evasion, and attempted murder. Despite this record and the lengthy Justice Department report detailing Coia's use of "fear and intimidation" in running the union, Coia was not removed as head of LIUNA. In February 1995, the Justice Department reached an agreement with the union by which Coia kept his job in exchange for a promise that he would weed out corruption.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	DOJ's voluntary agreement with LIUNA, proposed by the union in response to the 212-page draft complaint, was the first of its kind in a racketeering case involving a labor union. It relies on LIUNA itself-not a court-appointed officer granted wide powers and broad access to federal investigative resources-to institute needed reforms.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In the consent decree filed by LIUNA and DOJ, the union acknowledged that "the organized crime syndicate known as La Cosa Nostra has at various times had a corrupting influence on the affairs of various locals and other entities within LIUNA." The union also openly admitted that it "ha[d] not eliminated all of such corrupting influence" in its ranks.<sup>5</sup> In effect, the "Department of Justice farm[ed] out the task of mob-busting to a union boss they once charged as a racketeer."<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime recently held hearings in conjunction with the tenth anniversary of the Reagan Commission to examine how LIUNA remained under Coia's thumb. One theory is that politics may have played a role.<sup>7</sup> Coia lent $100,000 of LIUNA money to the Clinton Inaugural Committee; and in 1993 and 1994, the Laborers' Political League donated over $1 million to Democratic Party congressional candidates. During 1995 and the first quarter of 1996, the LPL has contributed $747,000 to over 200 liberal congressional candidates. Coia personally served as vice chairman of a May 1996 fund-raiser that raised $12 million for the Democratic Party.
<p>
<b>LIUNA and Federal Grants</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In addition to reviewing the Justice Department's decision to allow Coia to remain as LIUNA's general president, the Judiciary Committee might wish to investigate federal funding of the union's training programs. Since 1986, millions of tax dollars have flowed to this union, described by the Commission on Organized Crime as a "corrupt" organization whose "leaders steal or misuse workers' funds." Moreover, the November 1994 Justice Department complaint noted that "in or about 1986 to on or about July 31, 1994," LIUNA leaders intended to devise a scheme to "defraud training and education funds of various upstate locals" in New York by using "actual and threatened force" to "induce the locals to surrender control of these funds."<sup>8</sup> In FY 1994, while the Justice Department was investigating graft and intimidation at LIUNA, the union and its affiliates received 38 grants totaling $11,376,000 from four federal agencies and departments: the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Department of Labor.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In April 1995, less than three months after the Justice Department signed its agreement with LIUNA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development signed its own agreement with the union. HUD awarded the Laborers' Institute for Training and Education, a LIUNA affiliate, a $3.5 million grant to "provide construction and environmental training and career opportunities and advancement for public housing residents."<sup>10</sup> Under this grant, according to LIUNA, public housing residents will be trained in "basic construction and environmental remediation skills," after which they will "become members of LIUNA" and "enjoy long-term access to future employment opportunities through union hiring halls." It is little wonder that, upon receiving this grant, Coia declared that "this is just one more shining example of how the Clinton administration and the LIUNA is [sic] putting people first."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Congress should call additional hearings to require the relevant grantmaking officials at HUD to testify about their decision to award such a major grant to LIUNA just three months after the consent decree was signed. In particular, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Joseph Shuldiner, who signed the April 26, 1995, grant, should be asked about his knowledge of wrongdoing at LIUNA as well as what efforts his bureau is taking to prevent such wrongdoing in the future.
<p>
<b>Lessons for the Federal Grants Process</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	LIUNA is just one of the nearly 40,000 private organizations that receive more than $39 billion annually in federal grant funds. Like LIUNA, many of these groups also take an active part in the political process by promoting a particular ideological agenda or by lobbying for increased federal spending. When the taxpayers fund special interests, they make it possible for these organizations to use private resources for such purposes. The federal grants process employs the coercive power of government to force taxpayers to finance organizations whose political agenda they oppose. With regard to LIUNA specifically, tax dollars have gone repeatedly to an organization whose leadership has played a significant role in supporting the Democratic Party.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Wholly aside from LIUNA's links to the Clinton Administration, organizations alleged to be rife with criminal wrongdoing should be ineligible for federal funding. Clearly, federal grant dollars should not be given to any organization with admitted ties to organized crime for the purpose of recruiting more members. Whatever other else might be done to prevent the abuse of federal grants for political purposes, this is a first step upon which liberals and conservatives alike should be able to agree.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As Congress reviews charges that LIUNA officials misused union funds, government investigators should be asked whether they reviewed the receipt and use of taxpayer funds by those same officials. Given the union's admission of wrongdoing, an investigation and accounting of the use of recent federal grants clearly is in order. Because of questions about the relationship between the Clinton Administration and LIUNA, the General Accounting Office, an independent congressional agency, should conduct that review.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The LIUNA case is an example of the inherent conflict of interest in permitting executive branch agencies to give grants to politically active groups. In 1995, Congress attempted to address the problem of taxpayer-subsidized political activities by ending grants to groups that engage in lobbying. Unfortunately, the restriction Congress approved applies only to one category of lobbying organization, and efforts to erect broader restrictions on federally funded lobbying, principally the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment, were stymied by congressional liberals. Along with general efforts to eliminate welfare for lobbyists, Congress should identify and eliminate all programs that serve most often to channel funding to special-interest groups.<sup>11</sup> This case should serve to stimulate such efforts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	As Congress questions the standard for criminal prosecution in cases such as LIUNA's, it also should consider an intermediate step: barring federal grants to suspect organizations. During the ten years that allegations against LIUNA have been pending, government grantmakers appear to have been uninformed of or unconcerned about substantial evidence of criminal activity within the union. Because federal grants to organizations like LIUNA are discretionary, it would be entirely reasonable to withhold money from suspect groups and award it to others. Government should take all reasonable steps to protect taxpayer funds even before seeking criminal sanctions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Congress should consider steps to stop-or at least require a review of-federal grants to any group for which there is substantial evidence of corruption. Among the actions which might trigger such a review:
<ul>
 <p><li>Conviction of a group's officers or employees on charges indicating abuse of monies or organizational powers;
 
 <p><li>Delivery or filing of charges against an organization by federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies; or
 
<p><li>Any public disclosure of criminal activity by an organization.
</ul><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Having raised serious legal concerns about the propriety of the Clinton Administration's decision to allow the crime-infested Laborer's International Union to remain out of federal receivership, Congress also should ask why such an organization has continued to receive federal grant subsidies. LIUNA presents a case study of serious problems in the federal grants process. Since 1993, the Laborers' Political League has donated nearly $1.75 million to Democratic Party congressional candidates. At the same time, LIUNA affiliates have received over $15 million in federal grants. Indeed, just three months after it admitted to organized crime infiltration in federal court, LIUNA received a $3.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;



	It is time for Congress to end the corruption of the federal grants process by acting immediately to:<ul>

 <p><li><b>Require</b> that relevant grantmakers at HUD, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Labor testify about their knowledge of allegations of criminal infiltration of LIUNA;
 
 <p><li><b>Prohibit</b> organizations whose officers have records of criminal wrongdoing from receiving federal grants;
 
 <p><li><b>Renew</b> efforts to restrict lobbying by federal grantees; and
 
<p><li><b>Order</b> a General Accounting Office investigation into LIUNA's handling of federal grants.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	It is bad enough that mandatory dues from union members are used to pay for corruption and political activities. Taxpayers should not be forced to pay as well.

<title>Truth in Testimony: Penetrating the Special-Interest Facade -- Heritage</title>

<h3> TRUTH IN TESTIMONY: PENETRATING THE SPECIAL-INTEREST FACADE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/weinstein.html">Kenneth R. Weinstein</a><br> 
Director, Government Reform Project<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 456<br>
June 28, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Conservatives in Congress have not fared as well as many expected, partly because they have failed to make institutional reforms that would make it easier to promote conservative policies. A "Truth in Testimony" rule requiring witnesses appearing before congressional committees to disclose the amount of federal money their organizations receive would shed a bright light on the often self-serving character of testimony before Congress. Liberal advocacy groups would lose their claim to moral superiority when required to admit that they often benefit directly from the government programs they promote. Either house of Congress could adopt such a rule independently of the other, with no need for joint congressional or presidential approval.
<p>

<b>Stand for Children: A Case Study</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Those who doubt that Truth in Testimony would be an effective tool in responding to criticism of efforts to secure a balanced budget should consider the recent Stand for Children march in Washington, D.C. The Children's Defense Fund, a leading opponent of efforts to reform welfare, began a major public relations blitz months in advance of its June 1, 1996, Stand for Children rally on the Mall. Early stories invariably were favorable, largely verbatim recitations of organizers' claims that the event was "a non-partisan call to action" aimed at celebrating the nation's youth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beginning a few weeks before the march, The Heritage Foundation and other groups <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/gip9.html">revealed</a> that 25 percent of the national endorsing organizations were direct federal grant recipients, receiving a total of nearly $400 million per year. Other sponsoring organizations included the lobbying arms of federal programs costing nearly $7 billion per year and 20 groups representing social service administrators.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once the fact emerged that organizers had a vested interest in maintaining their own direct federal subsidies, even the mainstream press felt obliged to look beyond their claim to be defending children. Major print and broadcast media prominently reported information on sponsors' government funding in their coverage of the march. What could have been a public relations nightmare for conservatives in Congress turned into a wash. Indeed, Marian Wright Edelman, the Stand for Children's chief organizer, found herself spending much of her time deflecting questions about government subsidies. 
<p>
<b>The Congressional Analogy</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, in some ways, Stand for Children became an important conservative victory. Conservatives were able to change the terms of debate by revealing that at one-fourth of the national sponsors of the rally receive federal funds. According to a reliable estimate, a far higher proportion of witnesses before congressional committees are federally funded advocates.<sup>2</sup>  Just as the Stand for Children's claim of altruism was unmasked, so can the claims of other federally funded advocacy groups which purport to speak on behalf of the disadvantaged while feathering their own nests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Requiring organizations or individuals who testify before Congress to reveal the amount they receive in federal grants would radically change the dynamics and coverage of many congressional hearings. Almost daily, it seems, witnesses from various organizations express their outrage over proposed reductions in federal spending. Whereas the media often repeat hostile allegations made in testimony, what remains largely unknown to taxpayers is the extent to which advocacy groups enrich themselves at taxpayers' expense. That story goes unreported because Congress itself participates in the cover-up by refusing to disclose the links between witnesses and the programs about which they testify.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Truth in Testimony, representatives of, say, the American Association of Retired Persons appearing before House or Senate committees would be required to disclose that their organization receives $86 million each year in federal grants. Labor leaders testifying on behalf of federal job training programs would have to disclose that their unions receive millions of dollars each year to administer these very programs. Inevitably, such information would become part of the media coverage of the hearing. 
<p>
<b>Truth in Testimony: A House Rule</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Either the House of Representatives or the Senate could act on its own to initiate Truth in Testimony. This reform does not require either the agreement of both houses of Congress or the signature of the President.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Language for a Truth in Testimony rule might read as follows:<blockquote>
	Witness statements shall include the amount and source (by agency and program) of any federal grants (including subgrants from other organizations or from a state pursuant to federal block grant) or any contract received during the current fiscal year and previous two fiscal years by a witness or an organization a witness represents. No testimony shall be included in a hearing record without such disclosure.</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because this would be an internal House or Senate rule rather than a federal statute, there would be neither civil nor criminal penalties attached to Truth in Testimony. Therefore, witnesses coming before Congress could not claim to be intimidated by the rule. The measure would provide a clear sanction: If witnesses failed to provide such information, they would be penalized by their testimony's being excluded from the official hearing record.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Truth in Testimony is a needed reform, one that would open up the congressional process by informing taxpayers when federally funded groups lobby Congress for more funds under the guise of impartial testimony. Coverage of the Stand for Children indicates that the media are quite willing to disseminate information about the size and scope of federal grants to organizations seeking to lobby Congress. Truth in Testimony, likewise, would help to turn criticism of efforts to balance the federal budget into scrutiny of those who profit from tax dollars.

<title> Off With the Limits: What I Learned About Money and Politics When I Ran for President

<h3>OFF WITH THE LIMITS: WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT MONEY AND POLITICS WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT</h3>
<p>
<b>By Lamar Alexander</b>
<br>May 23, 1996.

<P>

On March 3, one day after the disastrous -- for me -- South Carolina primary and three days before I withdrew from the presidential race, I attended Sunday services at the Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta. The Rev. Frank Harrington preached about how Joshua, after a great victory at the Battle of Jericho, had been surprised and humiliated in the battle of A'i -- so humiliated that Joshua renamed A'i the "Valley of Calamity." He wanted his warriors always to remember the lessons of what had happened there.
<p>
Walking out after the service, I asked Rev. Harrington, "Was the point that I should rename South Carolina the `Valley of Calamity?'" 
<p>
"No," he said, "the point is, you must learn lessons from your defeat -- and then pick yourself up and go on." 
<p>
The voters, in their wisdom, have given me a defeat, and now several weeks to reflect upon its lessons. The Heritage Foundation has invited me today to talk about one of those lessons: the influence of money on the race for the presidency. While my wounds are fresh, here is my view: The so-called campaign reformers are selling the American people a real bill of goods on this one. They are saying that limits on what individuals can give to presidential campaigns and on what candidates can spend will reduce the influence of money and create a better democracy.
<p>
In fact, such limits do precisely the reverse. We now have 22 years of experience with them. Limits have increased the influence of money and are dangerous to democracy. It is the law of unintended consequences operating in all of its glory. Instead of adding more limits, we should take the limits off and rely on full disclosure to discourage corruption.
<p>
The limits on giving and spending for a presidential campaign were well-intentioned, placed into federal law after Watergate. Corporations can't give at all; political action committees may give up to $5,000; and individuals may give up to $1,000 during the primaries (the government pays for the general election). In addition, there are limits on what a candidate may spend in each state primary and a ceiling on spending for the entire primary. The Federal Election Commission enforces all of this.
<p>
The limits were designed to make things better for you, the average voter, so let's look at what they have done. As a result of these limits: 
<ul>
<p><li>You are more likely to see a comet than meet a presidential candidate, unless you have $1,000 -- or live in Iowa or New Hampshire; 

<p><li>You have fewer choices of candidates;

<p><li>The primary campaigns start before you care and end before you have a chance to vote;

<p><li>You are less likely to hear the candidates' messages; 

<p><li>Your nominee is more likely to be someone already holding office, rather than an insurgent;

<p><li>More of your choices are among candidates who are rich enough to spend their own money; and 

<p><li>Washington, D.C., has more to say about who the nominee is and you have less.
</ul><p>
In short, the federal limits on giving and spending during elections are turning presidential races into playgrounds for the rich, the already famous, and the Washington-based, and are helping to deprive most Americans of the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote.
<p>
When we create a system for picking Presidents, I believe our objectives should be these:
<ul>
<p><li>We should want the largest number of good candidates.

<p><li>We should want a good opportunity to hear what they have to say.

<p><li>All of us, if possible, want the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote.
</ul><p>
If this is also your set of objectives, then here is my remedy: Off with the limits. Off with the limits on individual contributions. Off with the spending limits. Require maximum disclosure. Open up the system. Let the candidates speak. Let us vote.
<p>


<b>Three Disclaimers</b>
<p>
Before you think it, let me say it:
<p>
First, I am not here to wallow in gloom. In fact, I come away from the campaign more optimistic, not less. I would do it again in a minute. I believe even more that there is very little wrong with our country that more jobs, better schools, and stronger families won't fix. 
<p>
Second, I believe I can make these remarks in the spirit of a gracious loser. That is made easier because our process produced a nominee whom I respect, who is my friend, and who I will be proud to call my President. Under any process, Bob Dole was our party's most likely nominee this year. (I will confess that my determination to be a gracious loser is tested about once a week when I remember what another defeated Tennessean, Davy Crockett, once said. Congressman Crockett strode to the courthouse steps, faced the voters who had just turned him out of office, and said what every defeated candidate has always wanted to say to such voters: "I'm going to Texas and you can go to hell!")
<p>
Finally, I am not here to complain because Steve Forbes spent $33 million of his own wealth on his presidential campaign. I believe the First Amendment to our Constitution gives Mr. Forbes the right to spend his money to advance his views. The Rockefellers and Perots and Forbeses and du Ponts all have made valuable contributions to our public life. I hope they continue to do so. What I object to, as I will discuss, is letting them spend all they want and then putting limits on the rest of us.
What I am arguing -- that it is wrong to put limits on giving and spending -- runs smack in the face of what we have been hearing ever since Watergate. So let me take my points one by one. What I have to contribute is a view from the inside. I will stick to my impressions and stories from the road and let scholars here at Heritage and elsewhere compile the statistics and perform the analysis.
<p>
<b>Because of the limits, you're more likely to see a comet than meet a presidential candidate, unless you have $1,000 -- or live in Iowa and New Hampshire.</b> 
<p>Of course, not everybody wants to meet a presidential candidate. Walking across New Hampshire, I met a woman taking a work break outside a shoe factory in Manchester. I stuck out my hand and said, "I'm Lamar Alexander. I'd like to be your next President." She looked at me, and at my red and black shirt, and said with disgust, "That's all we need. Another President!" Congressman Mo Udall used to tell about walking into a barber shop. "I'm Mo Udall, running for President," he said. "Yeah, I know," the barber replied. "We were just laughing about that yesterday."
<p>

But if you are one of those persons who would actually like to meet and size up someone who might be your President, get your wallet ready because the $1,000 limit on giving forces candidates to spend most of their time with people who can give $1,000. As with many federal laws, these limits have done just exactly the opposite of what they were intended to do. Limits have increased the influence of money on the candidates.
<p>

For example, to raise $10 million in 1995 for the Alexander for President campaign, I traveled to 250 fund-raising events. Now, think about this. This is about one event per campaign day. This took 70 percent of all my time. As a result, I became unusually well acquainted with a great many good Americans capable of giving $1,000 (who probably represent a cross section of about one percent of all the people in the country). Wouldn't I have been a better candidate, and the country better off had I been elected, if I had spent more time traveling around America and visiting allies abroad? (I actually did this during 1994, driving 8,800 miles across America and spending two months overseas. This was when I was not spending most of my time meeting nice people who could give me $1,000.)
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, you have fewer choices for President.</b><p>
This is because, in the real world, a $1,000 limit on gifts makes fund-raising so difficult that it discourages most candidates. I will now wave my own red flag: It is important not to get carried away with this argument. The difficulty of raising money is sometimes just an excuse. There are other more compelling reasons not to run for President. 
<p>
For example, I recall in November of 1995, when Colin Powell was on the cover of the news magazines and his approval rating in the polls was, literally, higher than the Pope's -- and I was struggling to secure a paragraph in the Keokuk, Iowa, daily -- I was driving to the airport after a New York fund-raiser with a former associate of General Powell's. The unavoidable question arose, "Will Colin run?" The former associate answered, "I don't know. But I can tell you two things about General Powell. One is, he makes rational decisions. Two is, he doesn't like uncertainty." I knew from that moment that, if that were true, there was no chance whatsoever Colin would be a candidate. Running for President is not a rational decision. It is instinctive. It is a passion with a purpose. And it is most surely a symphony in uncertainty. That is why I am so surprised that so many have such a hard time taking Colin Powell at his word, that he simply doesn't want to do it. Most people don't. They don't want the job, or they are afraid they can't win, or more and more they are unwilling to expose themselves and their families to the scrutiny that comes with the candidacy. 
<p>
Having said all of that, it is still true that the prospect of trying to raise $20 million from contributions of $1,000 or less makes the race much less attractive and often impossible for many good candidates. In 1995, Bill Bennett told me he didn't know how to raise that kind of money. Jack Kemp said he knew how but didn't want to. Dan Quayle and Dick Cheney discovered it would have been very hard even for a former Vice President and a former Defense Secretary; they both decided not to become candidates. 
<p>
You might have wondered this year, where have all the governors gone? I don't think I have ever met a governor who didn't think he or she would make an excellent President. Seventeen of our Presidents have been governors. There are today 32 Republican governors. One might argue (and I will confess that I tried out this argument a few hundred times during 1995) that the natural presidential partner for our strong Republican congressional leaders would have been the best of our Republican governors. 
<p>
But at the end of 1995, not one sitting Republican governor was in the race. Carroll Campbell, Tommy Thompson, and Bill Weld, perhaps others, had considered it and drawn back, privately saying, "I can't raise the money." Even the governor of California, Pete Wilson -- who by my calculation is governor of five percent of all the money in the world -- could not raise enough money. So, for Republicans, 1995 turned out to be the year of the "money primary." 
<p>
This is how it worked. There were, in the end, only four of us who could find a way to raise enough money to run for President. We all had certain advantages. For example, a contribution to Bob Dole was also a contribution to the respected Senate majority leader. Phil Gramm had worked relentlessly for six years as chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee to build a list of 83,000 names and a $5 million campaign kitty, which he then transferred to his presidential account -- a perfectly legal loophole, but one which was unavailable to the governors or others not holding office. Pat Buchanan was able to depend on direct mail for smaller contributions because it was his second race, he had been on network television for 15 years, and he took, shall we say, especially noisy positions. 
<p>
The Alexander campaign had some advantages, too: exceptional national leadership and strong support at home. Six of the last seven Republican national finance chairs chaired our fund-raising. We began with a $2 million dinner in Nashville on March 6, 1995, and raised $5.2 million in 21 events during the next six weeks. At the end of 1995, the three zip codes in America which had contributed the most to presidential campaigns were all in Nashville. By the time I withdrew, we had raised nearly $13 million from 26,000 contributors, 8,800 of whom had given $1,000. (We received another $4 million from federal matching funds.) 
<p>

But after the initial $5.2 million spurt, it became much harder for us. I was traveling to 20 events per month to raise $500,000. This created logistical adventures of Desert Storm proportions. On one day, I flew from Nashville to Colorado Springs to Denver for fund-raisers and then on to Phoenix to be ready for an early morning breakfast. To collect $20,000 during the crucial week before the Iowa caucus, I "dropped by" Knoxville, Tennessee, on the way from New Hampshire to Iowa. To raise another $30,000, I flew from Sioux City, Iowa, to San Juan, Puerto Rico, one Sunday in December. By the last four days of the New Hampshire primary, we were running on empty except for the money set aside for debts, audit, and winding down.
<p>

Then, when I placed a strong third in the Iowa caucus on February 12, the money dam broke. Beginning three days after Iowa, five days before the New Hampshire primary, contributions started rolling in to our Nashville headquarters at the rate of $100,000 a day without events. This continued for every day except Sunday, until I withdrew on March 6. Our once-a-week telephone conference calls sometimes included more than 200 volunteer fund-raisers. But it came too late, for New Hampshire ads had to be purchased the Friday before the primary on Tuesday. I failed (by 7,000 votes) to overtake Senator Dole. The Republican nomination was decided in the first primary. 
<p>

<b>Partly because of the limits, the campaign starts before you care and ends before you have a chance to vote.</b> 
<p>
Not only did the campaign end early; it started ridiculously early because, it seemed at the time, starting early was the only way to raise the necessary amount of money. In early 1995, Senator Gramm of Texas, flush with his 83,000 names and $5 million kitty, declared that it would take $20 million to run for President, that he could raise it and that he doubted many others could, and then sponsored a $4 million kick-off dinner in Dallas and announced, "Ready cash is a candidate's best friend." 
<p>

 None of the rest of us were about to be left behind. I held my $2 million dinner in Nashville. Senator Dole jumped in, as did others. Off we went, pounding the streets in 1995 trying to raise money for a race in 1996. It was like trying to stir up a conversation about football in the middle of the NBA playoffs. For me, by mid-summer 1995, it was going something like this interview: 
<blockquote><p>
	From Washington, D.C., "Inside Politics," Wolf Blitzer (already bored with the long "money primary"): "Governor Alexander, why do the polls show Senator Dole ahead of you 54 to 4 in Iowa?" 
<p>
	From Vermont, in my red and black shirt, Me (already tired of being asked the same question for the 50th time): "Wolf, that's the dumbest question I've ever heard. The reason Senator Dole is ahead of me is that everyone knows him and nobody knows me." 
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, add to the cost of creating such a long campaign the usual costs of fund-raising. A rule of thumb is that it costs 30 cents to raise a dollar. That meant that of the $10 million we raised in 1995, about $3.5 million went for fund-raising. Then there is the cost of complying with federal regulations. Another $1 million of the $10 million we raised during 1995 went for that. We set aside still another $500,000 for the campaign audit, which usually takes years. I think you can see where I am heading. 
<p>
 Add the costs of the long campaign to the usual costs of fund-raising and complying with federal rules and, by the time the 1995 money primary was over and the real primary in 1996 was here, the handful of us still standing (except for Mr. Forbes) were running out of money. The Alexander campaign spent $10 million during 1995, everything we raised, which left us about $3 million in the bank (counting federal matching funds) at the beginning of 1996. And, by comparison, we were running a bare-bones effort. Senator Gramm had spent $28 million when he dropped out just before the first primary in mid-February. Senator Dole had spent more than $30 million by March 1 and, with 39 primaries yet to go, was coming uncomfortably close to the federally imposed primary spending ceiling. Steve Forbes spent $33 million before he dropped out. I'm not sure whether my friend Pat has dropped out yet or not! 
<p>
 The reason why the Republican nomination was decided in the first primary is not only because limits on giving and spending forced the campaigns to start early. It is also because so many states moved their primaries to an earlier date in an attempt to give their citizens the same privilege Iowa and New Hampshire citizens have: the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote to pick the first President of the new century. This bunching of primaries created a wild roller coaster ride through 38 states in the 25 days after New Hampshire. Ironically, this made New Hampshire even more important. Here was the law of unintended consequences mischievously at work once again. The money primary became so long and expensive that we all arrived financially exhausted at the real starting line: New Hampshire, which turned out to be the finish line as well. About the time the voters had returned from the refrigerator to settle in and watch the presidential campaign unfold and perhaps even to vote in it the campaign had ended. 
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, you are less likely to hear the candidates' message.</b>
<p>

This is because limits on giving and spending prevent most candidates from raising enough money to get across their messages, especially if the candidate is relatively unknown at the beginning. Let me offer an example. Yesterday's <I>Newsweek</I> contains a column by Meg Greenfield which says this: "The doomed Presidential campaign of Lamar Alexander should tell the Republicans something. It was the quintessential anti-government pitch -- complete with an implicit -- and often explicit -- denial and disavowal of Alexander's career as a government guy. He bombed." 
<p>

 Well, now, this is the stuff of a pretty good debate. Of course, I disagree with Ms. Greenfield. I think my campaign nearly succeeded because I understand that the next President must lead us to expect less from Washington and ask more of ourselves, including our local governmental institutions. Ms. Greenfield's and President Clinton's solution is more from Washington. So let the debate begin. 
<p>

 Ms. Greenfield has her page in <I>Newsweek</I>. She is also editorial director for the <I>Washington Post.</I> President Clinton has the best forum of all. Their "more from Washington" side of the argument will get plenty of exposure. But what about my "more from us" argument? I made my case in Iowa during 80 visits and walked 100 miles across New Hampshire. I found that in those small meetings I could be persuasive. I also found that nothing much happened in the public opinion polls until I was on television. "Free TV" -- the network news -- was not of much help (although some local stations were very aggressive). To begin with, the national networks didn't arrive until mid-January when the campaign was nearly over. 
<p>

 The Center for Media and Public Affairs watched all the network newscasts in January and February, ten-and-one-half hours of campaign coverage. The Center found that we nine Republican candidates were allotted 79 minutes total. We were allowed to present our views in seven-second sound bites. The journalists covering us received five times as many minutes of coverage on those same newscasts. What the journalists said about us and our campaigns was more negative than what we candidates said about each other. And more than half the journalists' comments were about the horse race, not the issues. The Freedom Forum, in a remarkable survey of the journalists covering the presidential campaign, found that in 1992, 89 percent had voted for Bill Clinton. A candidate cannot rely on "Free TV" to get his message across. That is why, in our media-drenched society, where things are not important unless they are on TV, a candidate must have money for television to get a message across, and the limits on giving and spending make it difficult for candidates to do that.
<p>

This is not just one candidate's lament. Limits on giving and spending are an affront to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The whole idea of the framers of the Bill of Rights was to keep the government from attempting to limit political debate and criticism: "Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech." In <I>Buckley v. Valeo</I>, the Supreme Court acknowledged this and struck down most congressional limits of this sort, but left standing the current provisions because of its worry about "corruption." I believe the better antidote to corruption is disclosure. To correct something bad, we have created something worse. 
<p>
<b>
Because of limits, your nominee is more likely to be an incumbent than an insurgent.
</b><p>
In the real world, insurgents not only need more money than incumbents; they need it early. The <I>New York Times</I> reported that two-thirds of voters in New Hampshire made their minds up during the last week before the primary, after the Iowa caucuses. Among those voters, I won with 31 percent. Among the one-third who voted before Iowa, I received six percent. More money, earlier, might have helped get my message across to those early deciders. 
<p>

Candidates for President who already hold public office have government-paid staffs of policy advisers, PR people, and political administrators. They have name recognition and franking privileges. They have a fund-raising advantage because of their positions of power. If they are in Washington, they have a huge media advantage because that is where the media are. So putting a limit on what all candidates can raise and spend turns out to be a protection policy for some candidates: the ones who already enjoy the perquisites of public office. 
<p>

This is not just true in federal races. My home state, Tennessee, has just limited contributions to governors' races to $500. This is an enormous advantage for our incumbent Republican governor, Don Sundquist. And it virtually guarantees that the only effective candidate against Governor Sundquist when he runs for re-election will be someone who is so rich that he can spend his or her own money -- which brings us to the most important point. 
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, more of your choices are likely to be rich candidates willing to spend their own money.</b><p>

This brings us to the major problem with limits on campaign giving and spending: The limits apply to some candidates but not to others. This is because the U.S. Supreme Court has said that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits Congress from preventing anyone from spending his or her own money on our own campaigns. So the limits apply only to people who aren't rich enough to spend money on their own campaign. 
<p>

This creates an absurd advantage for wealthy candidates and a distorted contest for the voter. The first advantage is the obvious: The wealthy candidate has more money to spend. For example, Mr. Forbes spent $33 million of (mostly) his own money; I spent, with matching funds, about $16 million of other peoples' money. 
<p>

There are two other less obvious advantages. The candidate with his own money spends no time raising it. On the other hand, the candidate raising it is careening from event to event, repeating speeches, meeting nice people who can give $1,000, wearing himself ragged, and using up 70 percent of his time. By the time you reach the finals the week between Iowa and New Hampshire, you are a candidate for a fitness center, not the presidency. 
<p>

Finally, there are the state-by-state spending limits, which also help the rich. The federal government has decreed, for example, that a campaign may not spend more than $1 million in Iowa and $618,000 in New Hampshire during the presidential primaries. Mr. Forbes, unaffected by these limits, spent $5 million in Iowa on television. The Alexander campaign spent $930,000. The AP reported that on the third week before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Forbes bought 700 ads on one Boston television station (which covers southern New Hampshire). That week, Senator Dole bought 200 ads on that station. The Alexander campaign: none. Mr. Forbes must have spent $5 million in Arizona, by my estimates. Local newspapers said it was more than any advertiser had ever spent on local television to introduce a new product. (It must be pointed out that having your own money doesn't automatically mean you win. Mr. Perot is not President. Mr. Forbes came in fourth in both Iowa and New Hampshire. I recall my race for governor in 1978 against a candidate who must have spent $8 million. I spent $2 million, enough to win, although I could never have raised $2 million if there had been limits of $500 or $1,000 per contribution.)
<p>

What kind of contest is this, having different rules for different contestants? This is like watching the Magic play the Bulls with one team wearing handcuffs. It is certainly not the game the voters paid to see. Think of it this way: Say the fifth grade teacher organizes a contest for class president with water pistols as the weapon of choice; then some kid arrives with a garden hose. Either take away the new kid's garden hose (Bill Bradley suggests a constitutional amendment to limit what individuals can spend on their own campaigns) or give the rest of the fifth graders the freedom to raise and spend enough money to buy their own garden hoses. And if the New Hampshire primary is most of the ball game in presidential primaries, why should state-by-state spending limits keep candidates from defending themselves, even if they use up all their money?
<p>

<b>Because of the limits, Washington has more to say about who the nominee is and you have less.</b> 
<p>
Talking about Washington these days has gotten to be a sticky business. The rest of the country is tired of Washington, and Washington is tired of hearing about Washington. The rest of the country is becoming more offensive about its feelings, and Washington is becoming more defensive. "Cut their pay and send them home" still makes sense in Sioux City, but they call it nonsense here. One of Washington's most senior journalists told me sadly last year that "This town has grown too big for its britches." I have been coming and going from Washington off and on for 30 years and I believe that is true as well; but to come from outside Washington and say it, and to really believe it, is asking for trouble.
<p>

I believe our President must lead us to expect less from Washington and to ask more of ourselves. That is a message less frequently heard in Washington and more difficult to launch from outside Washington. For one thing, this is a media-drenched society, and the message-launchers -- the media -- are increasingly concentrated here. That will be more true in 2000 and 2004 than it was in 1996. The party fund-raising apparatus is here. The party leadership is here. The think tanks, if you will excuse me, are here. To receive maximum attention to my speech today, I am here. There are all sorts of good people here in Washington, but we of necessity, when we are here, talk mostly with each other.
<p>

<b>Reforming the Process</b><p>

Limits on giving and spending make it less likely that a candidate based outside Washington can succeed. Such candidates, by their experience and skills, may be able to help make Washington more like the rest of America, rather than the rest of America more like Washington. I believe Washington will always be a better place if it is constantly refreshed by the strength of the country outside Washington. The way we pick Presidents today makes that more difficult. Limits are not all that is wrong.

<p><b>The process should be deregulated.</b> We should sunset the existing regulations and start over. Fewer rules and full disclosure should be the byword.

<p><b>Spread out the primaries.</b> Let Iowa and New Hampshire go first, in February or March, and then arrange all the other primaries on the second Tuesday of the next three months. This would give winners a chance to capitalize on success, voters a chance to digest new faces, and candidates a chance to actually meet voters. 

<p><b>The candidates should be given the opportunity to speak on television more often for themselves.</b> My even mentioning this runs the same risks Dennis Rodman would take if he suggested some rule changes to a convention of NBA officials. So let me begin with some praise. Some print reporters sat through New Hampshire Lincoln Day dinners in the early stages of the money primary, in 1994 and 1995. C-SPAN and CNN labored valiantly and early. In January and February of 1996, the <I>New York Times</I> began printing some long excerpts of the candidates' speeches, and the networks began showing unedited stump speeches. But most of the coverage came late, or was about the horse race, or about candidates who were never going to run. Seventy-nine minutes of network exposure in seven-second sound bites for nine Republican candidates is pathetically little. 
<p><b>
There are dangers to early voting.</b> In a growing number of states, voters may vote a month or two before the election day. According to the Edison exit poll of 1996 New Hampshire primary voters, 40 percent of the voters made their minds up during the last three days before the primary. Those who cast their votes a month earlier were voting in quite a different race. 

<p>
 <b>Other Options For Reform</b>
<p>
The first option is suggested by Senator Bill Bradley, whose sporting background must make him especially allergic to contests with one rule for some participants and another rule for others. Senator Bradley would try to create a level playing field by putting limits on everyone, in effect making Mr. Forbes live by the same rules I do. 
<p>
This takes care of Mr. Forbes and me. But the AFL-CIO will still be able to run $35 million worth of TV ads attacking particular Republican candidates. The National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors will still be able to run ads slamming President Clinton's product liability veto. The National Restaurant Association will advertise that President Clinton is wrong about the minimum wage. The National Education Association will say I am wrong about school choice.The national political parties will raise tens of millions in "soft money." The President is the one person in America who is able to advocate the best interests of the country as a whole. Why should we limit the speech only of those who seek to speak for the country as a whole?
<p>
Senator Bradley should leave the First Amendment alone. The First Amendment is correct. It stands in the way of preventing ill-advised efforts by the government to limit a candidate's right to speak. And if there cannot be limits on most of us, why should there be limits on any of us? 
<p>
A second option is public financing which we now have with the presidential general elections. But such taxpayer-funded campaigns still leave Mr. Perot and the AFL-CIO and other committees free to spend millions creating an unlevel playing field. Also, public financing leaves the media with more horsepower than the candidates themselves have. And I cannot fathom how public financing would work in a primary situation. Would the government have funded everyone who showed up at the Republican debates this season? If so, such funding would have produced countless more candidates. I am opposed to public financing. It is incestuous. It is an unnecessary use of taxpayers' money. It invites government regulations. It creates an unlevel playing field by favoring incumbents. 
<p>
Finally, there are various proposals to require the media to give away TV time. (Such proposals would never work in a primary for the same reasons public financing could not work: How would you choose to whom to give it?) The lack of an opportunity for voters to consider the messages of candidates -- especially insurgent candidates -- is at the heart of the problem with our presidential process. But I am afraid these well-meaning proposals will drown in their own complexity and the law of unintended consequences will somehow rear its head again. Isn't the best solution for the media simply to cover the races and present the serious candidates on network news and in the newspapers more often on appropriate occasions, speaking for themselves?
<p>

<b>Find the Good and Praise It</b><p> 
I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that I came away from the campaign with a good feeling, not a bad feeling. My friend Alex Haley used to say, "Find the good and praise it," and I can easily do that about this process, even with its flaws. During the last year, I walked across New Hampshire, meeting several hundred people a day, spent 80 days in Iowa in maybe 200 meetings that ranged from 20 to 300 people, and had at least 50 meetings in Florida with the delegates to the Presidency III straw poll. During most of these meetings I was little known and unencumbered by the news media, so there was no disruption to the flow of the session. 
<p>
I remember wishing time after time that anybody who had any sense of cynicism about our presidential selection process could be with me, like a fly on the wall, because they could not be cynical after hearing and seeing and feeling what I saw. The groups with whom I met always listened carefully. Most often, they wanted to talk about our jobs, our schools and our neighborhoods, and our families. In meeting after meeting, I came away certain that this is a nation hungry for a vision contest, not one willing to tolerate a trivial presidential election. I believe there is a great market in the American electorate for a full-fledged discussion about what kind of country we can have in the year 2000 and beyond. 
<p>
As the song says, it is a long, long time from May 'til September when the presidential race really begins. One way to help fill this time usefully would be to review the way we pick Presidents and make certain that next time, in the new century, we have a process that attracts the largest number of good candidates, that gives them an opportunity to say and us to hear their messages, and gives as many of us as possible a chance to cast a meaningful vote. 
<p>
One lesson I learned when I ran for President is that step one toward those objectives would be these four words: Off with the limits.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On June 1, 1996, national attention will be focused on the "Stand for Children" march on the Mall in Washington, D.C. The ostensible purpose of this march is one that all Americans would support: "to celebrate children and those who struggle every day to raise them. Organizers claim that between 200,000 and one million people will gather at the Lincoln Memorial in a non-partisan call to action. Unfortunately, however, the principal action likely to be called for is an increase in federal spending. One reason is that at least 102 of the sponsoring organizations are federal grant recipients, receiving an aggregate of over $392 million annually. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A slick public relations campaign has generated dozens of news stories hailing the Stand for Children's call to affirm our responsibility as families, individuals, communities, and as a national community for improving the quality of life of children. But the camera-ready banners and young families with children expected on the Mall are not the entire story. An examination of organizations endorsing the event makes it clear that the Stand for Children rally is not a nonpartisan, pro-children march; it might better be dubbed the "Last Stand for Big Government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The event is being convened by the Children's Defense Fund (CDF), once chaired by no less a proponent of big government than Hillary Rodham Clinton. The president of the CDF is Marian Wright Edelman, a long-time friend of Mrs. Clinton, and chief opponent of efforts in the 104th Congress to reform welfare. In 1973, Edelman frankly admitted that because she could no longer stir up interest in government programs by speaking of poor people, she had decided to emphasize children in her rhetoric. Children, after all, might be a very effective way to broaden the base of change.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many other groups apparently have decided that Edelman was talking about more than just pocket change. The list of 426 organizations endorsing the Stand for Children looks like a Who's Who of federally funded organizations. Over one hundred of the endorsing groups received a total of at least $392 million in FY 1993-1994 alone. The total government subsidy to these organizations is actually higher, since this $392 million excludes grants to some affiliates as well as all funds received from state or local governments. Each of these organizations has a clear interest in assuring that it can continue to rely on money from the American taxpayer. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One government agency, the Agriculture Department's Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service (CSREES), a $931,784,000 federal program in FY 1995, has signed on as a national endorser of the program under the guise of its outreach program, Families 4H and Nutrition. The Freddie Mac Foundation, an arm of the federally chartered Freddie Mac Corporation, also is sponsoring the march.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lobbyists appear to be another big constituency of the Stand for Children. Lobbying arms for federal programs costing over $7 billion annually have endorsed the march. Among these are the National and Community Service Coalition (chief lobbyist for President Clinton's $400 million national service program, AmeriCorps), the National Head Start Center (lobbyist for the $2.2 billion Head Start program), and the National Association of WIC Directors (the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, a $3.6 billion federal program in FY 1995). Families U.S.A., the key lobbyist in the effort to support Bill Clinton's government-run health care plan, is also a march endorser. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to grant recipients, lobbyists, and government agencies, at least 20 national organizations comprised of government employees, such as the U.S. Conference of City Human Services Officials and the National Association of School Psychologists, will be participating in the march. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Further proof of the partisan character of the march is the fact that the AFL-CIO, which is spending $35 million in mandatory union dues to defeat conservative Members of Congress in the 1996 elections, is actively promoting it. The AFL-CIO and 33 of its affiliated unions serve as national endorsing organizations for the Stand for Children. At this past February's meeting of the AFL-CIO Executive Committee, when union leaders decided to launch their efforts to take back the Congress, two special guests were invited to speak: Steve Protulis of the National Council of Senior Citizens, fresh from the MediScare campaign on Capitol Hill, and Marian Wright Edelman, who spoke about the Stand for Children rally. The June 1 March obviously embodies the AFL-CIO's determination to defend the welfare state.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More evidence that the Stand is another attempt to broaden the base of support for big government is the fact that at least 50 liberal and activist left organizations with no special focus on children, including Americans for Democratic Action, Women Strike for Peace, the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, Greenpeace, the National Rainbow Coalition, and Zero Population Growth, serve as co-sponsors.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The groups behind the Stand for Children march seek to present their rally as a spontaneous, nonpartisan, grassroots expression of altruism towards America's youth. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Stand for Children rally offers a continuation of a calculated strategy launched in the early 1970s to expand the welfare state, a strategy used effectively to oppose efforts by the 104th Congress to balance the federal budget.  While many participating in the march no doubt have the best interests of children at heart, many of the sponsoring organizations have a clear self-interest in promoting government spending as the best way to Stand for Children.

<title>AFL-CIO To Impose New "Taxes" On Its Members - Heritage</title>

<h3>AFL-CIO TO IMPOSE NEW "TAXES" ON ITS MEMBERS</h3>

By Charles P. Griffin<br>

<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
(Updating <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1068.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1068</a>, "Oregon Election Previews AFL-CIO's Political Plans," February 7, 1996)<br>
Backgrounder Update No. 270<br>
March 14, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><P>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bgup270.gif">Chart 1</a>: Average Spending Against House Incumbents
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To increase its political muscle, the AFL-CIO has announced plans for two new union "taxes," including a more than one-third increase in per-member levies on constituent unions, to fund organized labor's 1996 partisan election activity. The new fees -- levied by the AFL-CIO on its members --  will finance the federation's previously announced $35 million campaign against the current Congress. This year alone, the additional income from these new charges will exceed $75 million for an organization whose annual budget was only $65 million last year. And despite the fact that 40 percent of union members voted Republican in the 1994 elections, the federation apparently intends to spend 100 percent of the new funds opposing GOP candidates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To put its 1996 political expenditures in perspective, the AFL-CIO expects to spend seven times its usual campaign budget and three times more than it has ever spent in any previous election year.<sup>1</sup>  Moreover, when the $35 million budget is allocated among the 75 targeted districts -- predominantly Republican freshmen, according to AFL-CIO President John Sweeney -- the average per-district expenditure is $467,000. In the 1994 election cycle, by contrast, the average challenger spent $239,000. Moreover, the $35 million figure represents only the AFL-CIO's planned political activities. Individual unions within the federation, as well as unaffiliated unions, will likely conduct additional election efforts.
<p>

<b>36 Percent Increase to be Ratified at March 25 Convention</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While meeting during the last week of February at a posh resort in Bal Harbour, Florida, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and his Executive Council decided to increase by more than one-third the fees it imposes on union members. Member unions currently are assessed 42 cents per member per month. The new assessment will increase this by 15 cents to 57 cents per member per month. It is expected that this will raise $25 million of the $35 million needed for the federation's 1996 political efforts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On March 25, 1996, the AFL-CIO will hold a special convention in Washington to ratify this extraordinary increase. (The Executive Council decided this new fee exceeded the amount they could approve on their own.) The intent of the new fundraising effort is clear:  AFL-CIO leaders plan to endorse President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore at the same meeting.

<p>
<b>AFL-CIO Cuts $375 Million Credit Card Deal</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As if a 36 percent increase in members' fees was not enough to finance the AFL-CIO's expensive 1996 political agenda, it also was announced in Bal Harbour that the federation had cut a new credit card deal. The AFL-CIO has an "affinity card" with the federation's logo that is marketed to union members by a bank. In return, a portion of the fees paid by union members for credit card use is paid to the federation. Under the terms of the new agreement with Household International, the AFL-CIO will receive at least $375 million in profits over the first five years, with a special $50 million signing bonus payable in the next few months.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the AFL-CIO has attempted to portray this new agreement as good for workers, the bank presumably could offer better terms to union members if the federation were not receiving such large payments. If a bank acting alone diverted credit card profits to other ventures, Sweeney and his allies no doubt would complain of "corporate greed."  When the AFL-CIO does the same thing to advance its own political ambitions, it apparently is virtuous.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the leadership of the AFL-CIO basked in the sun in Bal Harbour, Florida, they decided to impose two costly fee increases on its hardworking rank-and-file members. It is unfortunate that the federation's new leadership has placed such a strong and costly emphasis on partisan political gamesmanship. Just this year, over $75 million will be taken from rank-and-file union workers -- of varying political views -- to support the federation's endorsement of Bill Clinton and its campaign against congressional Republicans. These new union "taxes" will be used, in effect, to oppose real tax relief for all American workers.

<h3>OREGON ELECTION PREVIEWS AFL-CIO'S 1996 POLITICAL PLANS</h3>

"Union leaders this week said  the election push was a way the new leadership could quickly 
demonstrate results for both the public and the AFL-CIO's member unions."
<P>
-- <i>The Washington Post</i>, January 25, 1996<sup> 1</sup>
<p>
"The Oregon race provides a vital first chapter in a new textbook on politics we're going to write 
this year, as we  build the core of a powerful new grassroots movement."
<P>
  -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, January 31, 1996<sup>2 </sup>
<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; After decades of declining political influence, labor 
unions have pledged to multiply their election efforts this year with a $35 million war chest. The 
first real test of organized labor's new activism -- Oregon's special election for a United States 
Senate seat -- resulted in a narrow victory for the candidate heavily backed by big labor. Similar 
efforts can be expected in numerous House and Senate races this fall.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; When AFL-CIO President John Sweeney swept into 
leadership of the nation's largest labor federation last fall, he did so on an agenda of action, 
pledging more active organization drives to help increase the union rolls in America and promising 
vocal political campaigns to promote the union's movement's liberal agenda. Every indication was 
that the AFL-CIO would be a major force in 1996.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Shortly after Sweeney's election, voters went to the polls 
in a few political contests around the country. These November 1995 contests did yet not have the 
full Sweeney imprint (he had been in office only for a few weeks), but organized labor nonetheless 
managed to demonstrate a significant presence in several states. In fact, after the elections, Sweeney 
attempted to take credit for the supposed public turn to the left he claimed had occurred.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earlier this year, the AFL-CIO had its first test for 1996. 
In the special election to fill the seat of former Oregon Republican Senator Bob Packwood, big 
labor lined its horses up behind Democratic Congressman Ron Wyden. With substantial backing 
from organized labor, Wyden managed to beat Republican Gordon Smith narrowly in a mail-in 
election.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As this pivotal election year proceeds, the AFL-CIO and 
other labor organizations will continue to invest heavily in campaign activity. Unfortunately, much 
of this politicking will be funded through mandatory worker dues, and much is unreported and 
unregulated by federal election laws. Direct PAC donations and independent expenditure 
campaigns on behalf of specific candidates represent only a portion of organized labor's political 
activities. It behooves Members of Congress to pay careful attention to these activities. Hard-
working union members should not be compelled to surrender their own pay, earned by their own 
sweat and toil, to finance political activity to which they may well object.
<p>
<b>THE PRELUDE:  KENTUCKY AND MISSISSIPPI '95</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO's claim to victory in 1995 lies in the 
Kentucky governor's race between Paul Patton (D) and Larry Forgy (R). The national federation's 
propaganda organ, the <i>AFL-CIO News</i>, bragged that "even Forgy, in a call to the Louisville 
Courier-Journal, conceded that labor had made the difference, not only in heavily unionized 
counties but in helping turn out the African-American vote through the A. Phillip Randolph 
Institute."<sup>3 </sup>  (The A. Phillip Randolph Institute is an arm of the AFL-CIO dedicated to 
reaching out to African-American unionists.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; According to the <i>News</i>, 83,000 phone calls and 
158,000 pieces of mail led labor's efforts. The same report went on to disclose that 7 federation 
employees joined 9 activists from other labor unions to put a significant political operation in place 
on the ground in Kentucky, and that "two members of the Electrical Workers and CWA 
[Communication Workers of America] also were working with the [A. Phillip Randolph Institute]."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In the end, Patton defeated Forgy by a slim 51-49 margin.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The story in Mississippi was similar, except for the 
outcome. Incumbent Republican Governor Kirk Fordice was pitted against Democrat Dick Molpus. 
The AFL-CIO and other labor groups committed 3 full-time staff and 10 part-time workers to the 
race. The <i>AFL-CIO News</i> reports that the unions dropped 44,000 pieces of mail and placed 
20,000 phone calls in an effort to promote Molpus. While organized labor's contribution may have 
helped narrow what appeared to be a blowout, the end result was that Fordice won with 55 percent 
of the vote.
<p>
<b>THE OPENING SALVO:  OREGON '96</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The first meaningful test of organized labor's muscle in 
the new year has occurred over the past few weeks in Oregon, where voters were inundated with 
aggressive tactics by big labor to help influence the outcome of the special election. According to 
AFL-CIO documents and press reports, 37 union activists (12 from the AFL-CIO alone) worked 
full-time to elect a Democratic Senator<sup>4 </sup>  --"an unusually large number of political 
operatives" from unions, according to <i>The Washington Post</i>.<sup> 5</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Steve Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's political director, 
bragged that "We're mailing endorsement pieces to 75,000 union members and persuasion pieces to 
an estimated 40,000."  The AFL-CIO newsletter noted that "another 100,000 fliers comparing the 
candidates' records are being produced, and phone banks have been set up across the state."   
Shortly after the election was complete, AFL-CIO President Sweeney announced that the union had 
made more than 230,000 phone calls and sent over 350,000 pieces of mail.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO did not act alone, however. By joining 
forces with at least 11 individual unions, it was able to mount a considerable presence in this one 
targeted race. Among the other participants were the American Federation of Teachers, American 
Federation of Government Employees, National Association of Letter Carriers, and International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters. The considerable firepower mustered by these organizations resulted in 
more than $183,000 in political action committee donations to the Democratic candidate. Not one 
penny of union money went to Republican Gordon Smith.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Of course, impact is not measured in direct PAC spending 
alone. Phone banks, direct mail, paid advertising, and grassroots organizing are all significant 
activities that labor used in Oregon and can be expected to use throughout this year to promote 
favored political candidates. Many of these activities can be funded out of forced dues. In Oregon, 
these efforts were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more than direct, reported expenditures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union tactics played a significant role in the Oregon 
election. In fact, organized labor's activities themselves came under scrutiny by the media and the 
voters. The Teamsters were heavily criticized for an ad blaming the death of a teenage worker on 
the Republican candidate's business. Even the beneficiary of the Teamsters efforts, Ron Wyden, 
was forced to issue a public statement disavowing the ad and encouraging the union to pull it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union politics are nothing new. There is no question that 
organized labor has a right to participate in the electoral process. Unfortunately, in many states like 
Oregon, unions rely on coerced funding -- in the form of mandatory union dues -- to finance many 
of their political activities. Therefore, every hard-working union member in Oregon supported the 
candidacy of Ron Wyden with his sweat and toil -- even if he cast his vote against Wyden.
<p>
<b>THE ROAD AHEAD:  ELECTION '96</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; AFL-CIO President John Sweeney decided that his new 
leadership team must make its mark quickly. They have decided that their goal of organizing more 
than a million workers is too ambitious to be completed in the near term, and that they therefore 
should devote much of their resources to political action for a quick score.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Plan. In keeping with that decision, the labor 
federation recently announced its intent to spend $35 million on election activities this year --as 
much as 7 times the normal budget and nearly two-thirds of the cost of a presidential general 
election campaign. This allocation will support:
<p><ul>
<li>Targeting 75 House districts, with 1-4 full-time staff in each;
<p>
<li>Creating a base of at least 100 activists (volunteers and paid) in every congressional district;
<p>
<li>Hiring state field directors in 36-40 states;
<p>
<li>Placing 2,500 workers in the field for the final October/November get-out-the-vote efforts;
<p>
<li>Reassigning 12-15 organizers and adding them to the 16-member political field staff, for a total 
of 31 traveling political operatives; and
<p>
<li>Financing a "massive media fund" to deliver the union's political messages.<sup> 6</sup>
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Rosenthal, even before the election results were known, 
indicated what labor's post-election response would be. He told the <i>Washington Post</i> that 
"The election in Oregon stands by itself" but that "At the same time, it's a national election, and we 
hope it will be similar to Harris Wofford's victory in 1991, and could well set the tone for 
1996."<sup>7 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Warming up for November. The 1996 campaign is 
already underway in places other than Oregon. Some 400 unionists, under the banner of the AFL-
CIO's Stand Up campaign, protested outside a recent gathering of freshman Republicans in 
Baltimore, Maryland. While the protesters condemned all of the freshmen, a special target was 
Representative Bob Ehrlich (R-MD), who represents a nearby congressional district. Their signs 
carried messages urging voters to make Ehrlich a one-term Congressman. Similar treatment can be 
expected by 74 other House members who have been placed on the AFL-CIO's national hit list.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO's renewed focus on politics is clearly 
demonstrated by the fact that the organization's "Union Summer" campaign, which will use 1,000 
or more college students and entry-level workers to help organize unions in non-union workplaces, 
will be diverted to politics in the fall. Originally, it appeared that this organizing campaign would 
be the crown jewel for the new leadership, but they have been forced to shift their attention to a 
playing field on which they believe they can win:  the 1996 elections.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; AFL-CIO Leadership "Impressed" with Union-Led 
Turmoil in France. Unfortunately, it appears that Sweeney and his new team at the AFL-CIO 
envision a much more aggressive and confrontational plan than previous union leaders have 
pursued. In a speech late last year before the Association for a Better New York, Sweeney provided 
the following insight into his thinking:
<p><blockquote>
	I was in Europe last week, traveling with President Clinton, and I couldn't help but 
be impressed with what is going on in France. In this country, when we're faced 
with cuts in vital services that benefit workers and the poor, we shut down a few 
parts of the government. In France, the workers shut down the country -- even 
though only 8 percent of the work force is organized!<sup> 8</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; While Sweeney expressed his hope that such a situation 
would not be necessary in the United States, even suggesting the idea is shameful. The chaos and 
violence of the national shutdown caused by French unions would not likely be admired by many 
Americans but appears to be a possible harbinger of the AFL-CIO's intentions.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Compelling Union Workers to Pay for Politics. The new 
AFL-CIO leadership has implicitly acknowledged their reliance on forced union membership and 
compulsory dues to promote their agenda. One of the resolutions proposed by the Sweeney slate at 
last year's convention lamented:
<p><blockquote>
	The November 1994 elections capped a decades-long decline in labor's political 
influence, a trend closely connected to the decline in union density. This erosion 
also reflects labor's regional weaknesses, the seeds of which were planted decades 
ago by our failure to make adequate in-roads in right-to-work states.<sup>9 </sup>
<p></blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; By admitting a link between political weakness and 
voluntary fundraising, Sweeney's leadership is conceding that organized labor's strength lies where 
workers are compelled to pay union dues as a condition of employment.
<p>
<b>COERCED AND HIDDEN FUNDING</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Many of the AFL-CIO's political activities, like those of 
the federation's member unions, are financed not through voluntary PAC contributions by 
members, but by forced dues. Those activities that are issue-oriented (like television ads against 
Medicare reform, for example) often are paid for with these coerced dollars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As Members of Congress consider campaign finance 
reform legislation, they should ask whether it is fair to force every union member to pay for the 
ideological warfare of union officials. Corporations may not provide this sort of direct candidate 
support, and neither should their labor counterparts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Campaign finance reform should not be entered into 
lightly. Meaningful reform must level the playing field and ensure that only voluntary contributions 
are used for politics. As the election season heats up, Members of Congress should note the 
activities of labor unions and remember where the money comes from.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO has indicated clearly that aggressive 
political activities by labor unions --paid for on the backs of the union rank and file -- will continue 
throughout this high-stakes election year. Organized labor's renewed political activism promises to 
be a major factor in the 1996 elections. While unions should be as free as other organizations to 
pursue their political goals, the coercive nature of union funding, and the regulatory advantages 
unions enjoy, are unjust and unfair.

<h3>APPROPRIATIONS CLUB OPTS FOR BUSINESS AS USUAL ON LOBBYING SUBSIDIES</h3>

<P>
In a startling decision that calls into question whether some
congressional appropriators heard the message of the 1994 elections,
House and Senate negotiators have scuttled an apparent agreement
to curb welfare for lobbyists. The decision to sidetrack action
on proposals to limit politicking by federal grant recipients
was intended to free the appropriations legislation providing
funds for the White House, IRS, and numerous other federal agencies.
Instead, it may impede further progress on that bill.
<P>
When the conferees on the FY 1996 Treasury-Postal appropriations
bill met on October 25, it was widely expected they would adopt
compromise grant reform language crafted by Senator Alan Simpson
(R-WY) and Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK) with the guidance
of House and Senate leadership. The compromise would have liberalized
the provisions of an amendment adopted by the House by allowing
&quot;true charities&quot; (direct service providers) to spend
considerably more money on political advocacy than the original
proposal would have permitted.
<P>
However, the conferees agreed to issue a conference report that
left the issue of welfare for lobbyists unresolved. As a result,
the House and Senate must vote separately on the appropriations
and grant reform language. Failure to agree on both items would
stop final action on the conference report.
<P>
<B>The Message.</B> With the decision to scuttle the House-Senate
agreement on curbing welfare for lobbyists, the appropriations
committees decided that funding the White House, IRS, Post Office,
and lobbyists was more important than fiscal responsibility. The
effect of the conference committee's action was to say to the
voters that, simply to appease the White House, Congress will
continue to require American taxpayers to subsidize advocacy by
special-interest lobbyists.
<P>
<B>The Simpson-Istook Compromise.</B> The compromise reached by
House and Senate negotiators permits &quot;true charities&quot;direct
service providers, particularly those with small budgets that
serve people at the local level  to comply with its provisions
easily.
<P>
For example, a small local charity that raises $500,000 a year
from private sources could spend $25,000 on political advocacy
under the original House proposal offered by Representatives Istook,
David McIntosh (R-IN), and Bob Ehrlich (R-MD). The compromise
language now permits that same charity to quadruple its advocacy
to $100,000or one out of every five private dollars  while still
remaining eligible for federal grants.
<P>
This dramatic change is accomplished by liberalizing the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich
formula to one that mirrors the restrictions placed on 501(c)(3)
charitable organizations that elect to engage in lobbying (the
&quot;501(h) election&quot;). Independent Sector, a leading opponent
of the reform efforts, advises its members to use this provision.
<P>
The compromise formula is a sliding scale that permits the following
to be spent on political advocacy:
<P>
<b><UL>
<LI> 20 percent of the first $500,000 in private funds, plus
<P>
<LI> 15 percent of the next $500,000, plus
<P>
<LI> 10 percent of the next $500,000, plus
<P>
<LI> 5 percent of the remainder, up to an overall cap of $1,000,000
for advocacy.
</UL></b>
<P>
The Simpson-Istook compromise also protects small charities by
exempting organizations that spend less than $25,000 a year on
political advocacy from its prohibitions. This permits even the
smallest organizations to spend a significant amount of money
on advocacy without being ensnared by these needed reforms. Small
and large organizations alike would be required to disclose basic
information about how they spend taxpayer funds and the extent
to which they engage in political advocacy.
<P>
While loosening restrictions on smaller charities, the compromise
recognizes the significant abuse of the current system by larger
taxpayer-subsidized lobbying organizations. To address the issue
of fungibility of taxpayers' funds and curb present abuses, the
compromise would:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <b>Place</b> a firm $1,000,000 cap on political advocacy to compensate
for the more liberal formula at lower levels;
<P>
<LI> <b>Limit</b> heavily subsidized grantees (those that depend on the
taxpayers for more than one-third of their budgets) to no more
than $100,000 in political advocacy; and
<P>
<LI><b> Prohibit</b> 501(c)(4) nonprofits that can engage in unlimited lobbying
from receiving federal grants if their annual budget exceeds $3
million. The Senate originally voted to ban all grants to any 501(c)(4)
group, regardless of size.
</UL>
<P>

<P>
<B>A Test of Leadership. </B>The decision by the congressional
appropriations club to sidetrack needed reforms in a rush to keep
federal grants flowing to lobbyists represents business as usual
in Washington. To allow the insidious practice of taxpayer-subsidized
political advocacy to continue would be a victory for special
interests over fiscal responsibility and accountability to the
taxpayer.
<P>
The House and Senate leadership now must decide how to proceed
with this vitally important issue. The activities of reformers
and the leadership over the next several weeks will determine
the outcome of this commonsense reform.

<title>Federal Budget Targets Nine Seniors' Groups for Subsidies -- Heritage</title>

<b>Government Integrity Project Report #6<br>
September 29, 1995</b><p>
<center><H2><I>FEDERAL BUDGET TARGETS 
NINE SENIORS' GROUPS FOR SUBSIDIES</I></H2>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a><br>

<P>

Deputy House Liaison<p>
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a></center><p>
The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSCEP) is operated by the U.S. Department of Labor and provides more than $400 million annually for senior citizen employment.  The stated purpose of this program, authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965, is
<p><blockquote>
To provide, foster, and promote part-time work opportunities (usually 20 hours per week) in community service activities for low income persons who are 55 years of age and older.  To the extent feasible, the program assists and promotes the transition of program enrollees into unsubsidized employment.1</blockquote><p>	States, national nonprofits, and territories are eligible to receive grants.  In reality, however, 78 percent of this money (more than $320 million) is segregated from state funding to subsidize "nine national nonprofit organizations."  In fact, the <i>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</i> explicitly states <p>
"The Department [of Labor] annually renews grant agreements.  There are no plans to add additional organizations."  Moreover, "Awards are not on a competitive basis."
<p>
	Between July 1993 and June 1994, the following nine national organizations received the designated funding:
<p><ul>
<li>American Association of Retired Persons...................$48,000,000<br>
<li>Asociation Nacional Pro Personas Mayores................$12,000,000<br>
<li>Green Thumb, Inc.2.....................................................$102,000,000<br>
<li>National Caucus and Center on Black Aged, Inc.........$12,000,000<br>
<li>National Council of Senior Citizens.............................$61,000,000<br>
<li>National Council on Aging...........................................$38,000,000<br>
<li>National Indian Council on Aging................................$2,000,000<br>
<li>National Pacific/Asian Resource Center.......................$2,000,000<br>
<li>National Urban League.................................................$4,000,000<br>
</ul><p>
	The President's original FY 1996 budget request separates the two parts of this account to differentiate between the states and the "Gang of Nine."  These national nonprofits are able to act as government contractors and subgrant the money they receive to other organizations.
<p>
	The FY 1995 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Act included House committee report language that stated, "It is the intent of the Committee that the current sponsors continue to build upon their past accomplishments."  This language clearly indicates that the committee was aware of the grantees under this program and had absolutely no problem with the fact that most of them engage in political advocacy.
<p>
	Fortunately, the FY 1996 committee report begins to address this problem.  Although the program's funding has been reduced by only $50 million, the report states that "The Committee has funded the program under the basic law rather than continuing the past practice of earmarking 78% of the funds for national contractors and 22% for the states."
<p>
	However, even with this reform, the nine seniors' organizations are simply thrown into the same pot as the states.  They are not prohibited from receiving funds, and it is not clear that federal bureaucrats could not simply award the grants in the same manner.  Moreover, the SCSEP joins the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) as a privileged federal program that is forward-funded.  None of these reforms will take effect until next July (as opposed to this October, as is the case with "normal" programs).
<p>
	Real reform of this program -- short of outright elimination -- would require both that earmarks be ended and that advocacy organizations be prohibited explicitly from becoming grantees.
<p>
	Congress has an obligation to end these noncompetitive subsidies to nonprofit advocacy organizations.  At the very least, if the House and Senate cannot resolve to eliminate this program, they should agree to redirect the funds to the states so that they directly benefit needy seniors and no longer subsidize legislative or political advocacy.
<p>
<b>Siphoning Grant Funds to Pay for Advocacy</b>
<p>
The Senior Community Service Employment Program permits grantees to allocate up to 13.5 percent of their award to "administration," or overhead, expenses. These funds directly subsidize the organization's non-grant-related activities, including lobbying, by paying utilities, building maintenance, and other common expenses.
<p>
For the period between July 1993 and June 1994, the grantees were permitted to "skim" the following amounts off their check from the taxpayers to subsidize other activities.
<p><ul>
<li>American Assn. of Retired Persons....................................$6,480,000<br>
<li>As'n of Nacional Pro Personas Mayores............................$1,620,000<br>
<li>Green Thumb, Inc...............................................................$13,770,000<br>
<li>Nat'l Caucus & Ctr. on Black Aged....................................$1,620,000<br>
<li>Nat'l Council of Senior Citizens.........................................$8,235,000<br>
<li>Nat'l Council on Aging.......................................................$5,130,000<br>
<li>Nat'l Indian Council on Aging............................................$270,000<br>
<li>Nat'l Pacific/Asian Resource Center...................................$270,000<br>
<li>Nat'l Urban League.............................................................$540,000<br>

<title>National Council of Senior Citizens Feeds Mostly at Public Trough -- Heritage </title>

<CENTER><H2>NATIONAL COUNCIL OF 
SENIOR CITIZENS FEEDS 
MOSTLY AT PUBLIC TROUGH</H2>

<p>
The National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC) is an exclusive organization; that is to say, it feeds almost exclusively at the public trough.  According to its 1993 filing with the Internal Revenue Service, $72,910,930 of $75,956,825 in revenue (96 percent) for the year came from "government contributions."1<P>	The American taxpayers provide funds to the NCSC through a variety of federal programs.  Foremost among these is the Senior Community Service Employment Program operated by the Employment and Training Administration in the U.S. Department of Labor.  Between June 1993 and July 1994, NCSC received $61 million from that grant program.  Another $10 million came from the Senior Environmental Employment Program in the Environmental Protection Agency.  The SEE program provides NCSC with cash and the EPA with unofficial workers (over 55) to carry out the agency's environmental aims. These grants thus help subsidize the political advocacy activities of the National Council of Senior Citizens and prevent Congress from obtaining an accurate picture of the size of the EPA workforce and the amount of federal dollars spent on the agency's agenda.
<P>
	From July 1993 to June 1994, smaller amounts of taxpayer funds flowed to the Council from the Dislocated Worker Assistance program ($6,000) and the Section 8 Housing Rehabilitation Program that assists NCSC in operating senior citizen housing complexes.
<P>
	During the 1994 election cycle, the National Council of Senior Citizens actively endorsed candidates and contributed funds for the election of Democratic candidates for Congress.  In fact, the NCSC PAC provided at least $81,5002 to Democratic congressional candidates and $0 to Republican candidates.  Therefore, in addition to being deeply involved in campaign activity, the Council is overtly partisan.<P>	This summer, the NCSC has participated actively in the public campaign to oppose Medicare reform.  From the national 30th anniversary ceremony for Medicare in the Capitol to local congressional town meetings, the Council has been a major part of the effort to scare senior citizens into believing that their health care safety net is about to be yanked from underneath them.

<P>
	An account of a recent Rhode Island town meeting attended by Senator Claiborne Pell (D) and Representatives Jack Reed (D) and Patrick Kennedy (D) reported that many seniors in the audience "wore the blue-and-white 'Senior Power' buttons distributed by the meeting's sponsor, the National Council of Senior Citizens."  The same news article went on to state that "the council contends that the GOP proposal would cost the typical Rhode Island beneficiary about $3650 a year in additional premiums, deductibles and co-payments"3all this despite the fact that no "GOP proposal" has been introduced.<P>	Across the country, on the same day, NCSC regional director Howard Owens stated, "Can anyone believe we can take a ($270 billion) hit and maintain the quality and quantity of health care?  If so, I have a bridge I want to sell you."4  The Council also hosted events for Democratic members of Congress in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (August 18), and Waterloo, Iowa (August 24), to promote the anti-reform message.<P>	Other political activities undertaken by the NCSC include an annual congressional voting scorecard.  In 1993, one issue in this analysis was the tax increase on Social Security benefits, which was scored as a "pro-senior" vote.5  The Council also was a proponent of the Clinton Administration's big government health care plan, which failed in 1994.<P>	  It is clear that the National Council of Senior Citizens engages in substantial advocacy activitiesdespite the fact that it is 96 percent taxpayer-funded.  In essence, the NCSC functions almost as a <i>de facto</i> federal agency, but without the normal restrictions on political activity.<P><i>The Government Integrity Project examines the practice of permitting tax-exempt organizations that engage in political or legislative advocacy to receive funds from the federal government.</i>

<title>The Summer MediScare Campaign: Subsidized By The American Taxpayers -- Heritage </title>

<p>

As the Senate prepares to join the House in Congress's August recess, it has become clear that myriad interest groups have united to frighten senior citizens into believing that attempts to reform the Medicare system are really an attempt to "steal" their health care.  The fact that the Trustees of the Medicare Trust Funds -- among them three members of President Clinton's Cabinet -- have predicted the imminent bankruptcy of this health care safety net for the elderly has done nothing to dissuade the opponents of reform.
<p>
The catch is that many of the special interests now attempting to instill fear in the nation's senior citizens are subsidized by the American taxpayer.  In effect, elderly Americans are helping to fund  a campaign of lobbying and propaganda that runs directly counter to their own long-term best interests.
<p>
A June 27, 1995, "Medicare Message" distributed by the House Democratic Leadership refers to six taxpayer-subsidized organizations actively involved in the effort to "talk about the devastating effects of the Republican Medicare cuts."  These organizations received nearly $80 million in federal funding between July 1993 and June 1994:
<ul>
<p>
<li>AFL-CIO<br> 
$2,038,000
<p>
<li>Families USA 
<br>$250,000
<p>
<li>Service Employees International Union (SEIU)<br>
$137,000
<p>
<li>Save Our Security<br>
$100,000
<p>
<li>American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)<br>
$76,000,000
<p>
<li>American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME)<br>
$148,000
</ul>
<p>
One day later, on June 28, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare ($75,000) wrote a letter to Members of Congress opposing the conference report on the budget resolution.  The organization's president, Martha McSteen, wrote that the Medicare reforms in that bill would "seriously harm" the program and that "reductions of this magnitude are only necessary to ... balance the budget by 2002."  She went on to say that "these reductions do not reflect the budget priorities of Americans."
<p>
In an attempt to influence the outcome of the debate in Congress over Medicare, some taxpayer-funded organizations have resorted to aggressive grassroots activity.  For example, four busloads of SEIU members joined Representative John Lewis (D-GA) in disrupting an August 7 Medicare meeting attended by members of the Georgia congressional delegation.  In addition, the SEIU, Urban League ($6,447,000), and Teamsters ($3,542,000) were among the organizations that led a large protest in front of House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich's office in Ohio on July 21.  Speaking at the event, where 20 demonstrators were arrested, John Sweeney (candidate for the presidency of the federally subsidized AFL-CIO) stated, "We are here today to deliver a message to John Kasich, Newt Gingrich and every right-wing Republican and turncoat Democrat" in Congress that "we will not allow you to destroy job training and education and Medicare and Medicaid."<i>1</i>
<p>
Other organizations have targeted other Members of Congress.  In New York, taxpayer-subsidized AFSCME launched a "four day TV blitz" in mid-July targetted at Representative Jack Quinn (R-NY) to show that the results of proposed Medicare reforms will be "catastrophic."  According to press reports, "the 30-second spot, which will air 37 times ... features a couple distraught over 'Republican efforts' to cut health benefits for the elderly." A spokesman for the Civil Service Employees Association who joined AFSCME in the ad campaign said, "we hope to focus public attention on the impact these cuts will have so [Quinn] can influence his Republican leaders in Congress to do the right thing."<i>2</i>
<p>
When President Clinton came to Capitol Hill to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the passage of Medicare, the National Council of Senior Citizens ($71,516,000) played host and "provided goodie bags containing fans and hats with its logo."<i>3</i> <i> Newsday </i>said the event "amounted to a campaign rally" that was part of an effort to "argue that [Republicans] can't be trusted to preserve [Medicare]."<i>4</i>
<p>
The NCSC and other federal grantees have also resorted to exaggerated direct-mail pieces to spur grassroots activity. The Council recently mailed 500,000 business cards that declared, "The Threat: Gingrich Urges Replacing Medicare."  It went on to say, "Save Medicare! Call Congress." Says spokes-man Patrick Burns, "This is less of a moneymaker.  We're doing this to get people to take action."<i>5</i>
<p>
These organizations have every right to articulate their views, but the American taxpayer should not be compelled to subsidize the efforts of these special-interest groups.

Executive Memorandum #422<br>

<P>
<blockquote>	My name is John Q. Specialinterest. I am testifying today on behalf of Americans for a Happy Tomorrow (AHT), which represents senior citizens, environmentalists, school lunch servers, and the dispossessed. In the last fiscal year, AHT received $73 million from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). I am here to protest the cruel and heartless proposed budget cuts in the DOL, HHS, and EPA.</blockquote>

<p>
	As Congress begins budget reconciliation hearings, it would be enlightening if every witness's testimony included a "truth in testimony" statement. This small but significant change in the way Congress does business could shed a powerful light on the true motivations and self-interest of organizations that claim to represent the "public interest."
<p>
	Each day, another organization expresses its outrage on Capitol Hill over proposed reductions in government spending. But what remains largely unknown to the taxpayer is that many of these groups themselves benefit from federal largesse. Over the past forty years, Congress has created a vast patronage network of organizations which enjoy tax-preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political activity. The days of big-city political machines disbursing patronage may be coming to an end, but the disbursement of financial dividends to political friends is a prominent feature of the federal budget. While claiming they are only "doing good," they are in fact "doing well" at the taxpayer's expense. The taxpayers have a right to know.
<p>
	On February 2, 1995, the Child Welfare League of America testified before a House Ways and Means subcommittee about welfare reform. This organization benefited from approximately $250,000 in FY 1994 and ran an advertisement opposing the Contract with America's welfare reform bill which claimed:  "More children will be killed. More children will be raped."
<p>
	One month later, a subcommittee of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on "forest health and restoration."  One of the panels was 50 percent federally subsidized and included representatives of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners ($257,000 in federal funding in FY 1994) and the National Audubon Society ($135,000, excluding state-based affiliates). 
<p>
	 Clearly, the right to petition government to redress grievances is precious and should not be infringed. Individuals and organizations using funds from the private sector should be encouraged to engage in the legislative and political process without fear of regulation. It is an entirely different matter to employ the coercive power of the federal government to force taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or government agencies. 
<p>
	Truth in Testimony is Needed. Congress needs to know which advocacy organizations are federally funded, particularly when they are lobbying Congress. Witnesses who testify before a congressional committee should be required to state in their written and oral testimony how much federal funding they receive and how they use it. In addition, the committee should request that each organization provide an IRS Form 990 for the committee to keep on file. The 990 is a public document each organization must file that lists its sources of revenue, along with pertinent information on the group's affiliations with other organizations.
<p>
	The people's representatives have a right to know if the testimony they are hearing is coming from someone who is feeding at the public trough.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Members of Congress submit annual financial disclosure statements.

<li>Senior officers in the executive branch file regular reports on outside income.

<li>Lobbyists must register with the government and identify themselves as such.

<li>Witnesses from federally funded groups are not required to disclose this fact to Congress.
</ul>
<p>
	Many laws have been passed to combat possible financial conflicts of interest by the political class. But until now the focus has been in one direction:  money going into the coffers of politicians. What about private lobbying groups that receive taxpayer dollars from the politicians?  Admittedly, this represents a very touchy subject for many special interests. Hundreds of activist organizations receive millions upon millions of taxpayer dollars each year -- and then turn around and use that money to lobby Congress to send even more of this money their way.
<p>
	For example, the AFL-CIO receives more than $10 million each year and then promotes a television ad campaign to oppose everything the new Congress is undertaking. The clear goal is to stir up grassroots opposition from union members and others to attack the reforms the new leaders of Capitol Hill are attempting to make.

<p>	The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the largest lobbying organization in America, receives $86 million in taxpayer funds each year. At the same time, the AARP lobbied Congress to pass a big-government health care bill that the American people -- and many AARP members themselves -- firmly opposed.
<p>
	Most federal programs, like student loans and funds for new prisons, are specified in the federal budget. Each receives its own "line item" that tells how much money it will be able to spend in the coming year. The trouble is that a line item labeled "AFL-CIO" or "AARP" does not exist. If it did, it would be a lightning rod for criticism and would top most people's list of spending cuts. It is time to acknowledge that the American people are fed up with special interest lobbying and certainly would not stand for the government's helping these groups to advance their particular agendas.
<p>
	There is no justification for special interest lobbying groups' receiving money from the American taxpayers, only to turn around and spend it to lobby Congress for even more. Congress should recognize the danger of this corrupt practice and expose federally funded hypocrisy. Each committee should demand full disclosure of its witnesses so the American public can see whether their tax dollars are subsidizing calls for more of their money.

<a name="intro"><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The federal government subsidizes lobbying by tax-exempt and other 
organizations through grants and contracts to advocacy groups.  Each year, the 
American taxpayers provide more than $39 billion in grants to organizations 
which may use the money to advance their political agendas.
<p>
Federal funding of private advocacy is not limited by ideological scope.  
Organizations to the left and right of the political center use taxpayers funds to 
promote their ideas and positions.  Almost every interest in America - from 
agriculture to zoology - has one or more organizations receiving government 
funding.  Recipients range from the American Association of Retired Persons, 
which received over $73 million in a one-year period, to the American Bar 
Association, which received $2.2 million.   Over the past forty years, Congress 
has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-
preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political 
advocacy.  The days of big city political machines disbursing patronage may be 
coming to an end, but the disbursement of financial dividends to political friends 
is a prominent feature of the federal budget.  As Heritage Foundation Senior 
Fellow <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/breger.htm">Marshall Breger</a> has written:
<p>
<blockquote><Font Size="-1">Lacking the imprimatur of democratic consent, government subsidy of private advocacy can be seen for what it is - the public patronage of selected political beliefs.  That these advocacy subsidies are rarely made openly but are often disguised through grants and contracts for legitimate public functions merely underscores the dangers inherent in a system of expansive government subsidy.(1) </font></blockquote>
<p>
Clearly, the right to petition government to redress grievances should not 
be infringed.  Individuals and organizations using funds from the private sector 
should be encouraged to engage in the legislative and political process. It is an 
entirely different matter, however, to employ the coercive power of the federal 
government to force taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or 
other government entities.  It is every bit as unjust to force liberal taxpayers to 
fund organizations on the right as it is to force conservative taxpayers to finance 
organizations on the left.  The fundamental principle is that it should be 
anathema to force taxpayers to underwrite advocacy with which they disagree.           
<p>	
Taxpayer funding of advocacy organizations is wrong - fiscally, morally, 
and logically.  It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities 
that provide no meaningful return to the American people.  It is morally wrong 
for the government to take sides in any public policy debate by assisting the 
advocacy activities of an elite few.  And it is logically wrong for the government 
to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures. 
The reasons are summarized aptly by George Mason University professor James 
T. Bennett and Loyola College professor Thomas J. DiLorenzo in their 
comprehensive study, <i>Destroying Democracy</i>:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>A large number of  individuals with strong views can express their preferences by contributing funds to a group that promotes that issue.  With tax-funded politics, however, a small number of zealots with access to the public purse can obtain resources from government to advance its views even though few 
individuals in society share the groups philosophy.  Whenever government funds any political advocacy group, it effectively penalizes those groups that advocate opposing public policies and provides a distinct advantage to the group or groups that it favors in the clash of ideas.(2) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<a name="fund"><h4>THE FUNDING OF FACTION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The Founding Fathers recognized the dangers of factions in a republic.  
James Madison wrote in <i>Federalist</i> Number 10 that "Among the numerous 
advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none deserves to be more 
accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of 
faction."  Madison defined faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting 
to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some 
common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, 
or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community."
<p>
What the Founding Fathers referred to as factions we now call special 
interests.   Instead of restraining factions, however, the federal government today 
subsidizes them.  This distorts the political process by favoring one faction over 
another and by nourishing a network of special interests - a welfare-industrial 
complex - with a direct self-interest in the growth of the welfare state.  The 
financial cost to the taxpayer is far higher than the amount funneled to these 
organizations.  Each one not only lobbies for its contract or grant, but also 
advocates for bigger, more expensive social welfare programs, further 
complicating efforts to put the nations fiscal house in order.  Moreover, while 
these organizations often claim that the money they receive helps the less 
fortunate, the reality is that it bolsters their own political power, perks, and 
prestige. 
<p>
The advocacy network and its leaders contribute to what author James Payne 
has referred to as a "culture of spending" in Washington which makes it 
extremely difficult to trim government programs: "Leaders of such federally 
dependent interest groups  should not be seen as representing independent 
citizen opinion.  They are quasi-governmental officials with a vested interest in 
the spending programs that benefit their organizations."(3)
<p>
Not every dollar given to an advocacy group goes directly to political 
advocacy activities.  However, federal dollars are fungible.  Every federal dollar 
frees private resources to be spent on political, lobbying, and other advocacy 
activities.  Moreover, federal funds make the organization appear to be a larger 
force in the political arena than it would if it were totally reliant upon private 
contributions.  For example, the National Council of Senior Citizens receives 96 
percent of its funding from the federal government.    
<p>
<center>
<img alt="NCSC Annual Revenue Graph" src="1040img.gif">
</center>
<p>
The NCSC is but one of many advocacy organizations receiving federal funds.  
Here are just a few other examples:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The AFL-CIO benefited from more than $2,000,000 between July 1993 and 
June 1994.  According to the <i>AFL-CIO News Online</i>, the AFL-CIO used the 
Memorial Day recess to increase pressure on Members of Congress with its 
"Stand UP" campaign: 
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>In those [5 targeted] districts, the AFL-CIO provided radio ads and coordinators to work with local union officials and legislative action committees.  Other activity included direct mail, jobsite leafleting, phone call drives using the AFL-CIOs toll-free hotline, petition drives, town meeting attendance, and letters and columns submitted to local newspapers.(4) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<li>Recently, the Service Employees International Union produced a newspaper 
advertisement opposing tax cuts and efforts in Congress to slow the growth 
of welfare and Medicare.  SEIU claims Congress is attempting to "loot" 
welfare programs and "steal" from low-income home-energy assistance to 
help finance "corporate special interests." The ad lamented the impact on 
Fannie Johnson and her family in Ohio.(5)  This labor special interest benefited 
from $137,000 in taxpayer funding in 1993 (for an "anti-discrimination public 
education campaign").  Terminating it would eliminate the tax burden of 
nearly 30 families just like Ms. Johnsons in Ohio.
<p>
<li>Families USA - a driving force behind the Clinton big-government health 
care plan, including the failed last-ditch attempt to revive it last summer 
through a nationwide bus tour(6) - received $250,000 from the taxpayers 
between July 1993 and June 1994.
<p>
<li>The Child Welfare League of America received more than $250,000 in federal 
funding, then turned around and launched an ad campaign to increase 
welfare spending.  The League ran an advertisement opposing the Contract 
With Americas welfare reform bill which charged that "More children will be 
killed.  More children will be raped."(7)
<p>
<li>The National Trust for Historic Preservation received approximately $7 
million from the federal government in FY 1994 - 22 percent of its budget.  
In the same year, the Trust "launched a lobbying campaign against the 
Disney project" in Northern Virginia.(8)   In 1993, it "lobbi[ed] Congress to 
expand the historic rehabilitation tax credit."(9)  The groups president, Walter 
Mondale's former chief of staff Richard Moe, said the full credit would cost 
"$1.4 billion over five years."(10)
<p>
<li>The American Nurses Association received nearly $1 million between July 
1993 and June 1994 from the U.S. taxpayers.  In 1994, the ANA endorsed the 
Gephardt health care plan and actively lobbied for it.  According to the 
unions own press release announcing this endorsement, "The American 
Nurses Association is the only full-service professional organization 
representing the nations 2.2 million Registered Nurses through its 53 
constituent associations.  ANA advances the nursing profession by ... 
lobbying Congress and regulatory agencies on health care issues affecting 
nurses and the public."(11)  The <i>Political Finance and Lobby Reporter</i> revealed on 
May 12, 1995, that two new ANA lobbyists had registered.
<p>
<li>The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which 
received nearly $150,000 in the most recent grant reporting period, 
denounced the House welfare plan, saying it "will drive more families into 
poverty and turns its back on hardworking Americans who fall on bad times.  
This is the small print in their evil Contract on America."  AFSCME President 
Gerald McEntee went on to say that "AFSCME will continue to fight for real 
welfare reform that includes jobs at decent wages, child care, health care and 
education and training."(12)
</ul>
<p>
Actually, however, government funding of advocacy organizations can hurt 
their cause.  Well-grounded public policy institutions prosper from strong 
grassroots support backed by individual financial contributions.  Much like a 
profitable company, they can measure support by looking at how many people 
were willing to open their checkbooks for the cause:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>The plain fact is that political advocacy groups will not flourish on the basis of government subsidy.  Rather they will prosper only insofar as they develop financial roots in the polity.  Reliance on the government trough is no sign of the commitment of your adherents to your cause.(13) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<a name="prob"><h4>NOT A NEW PROBLEM</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Federally funded advocacy is not a new problem.  Congress recognized 
the potential for abuse more than 75 years ago when it passed a law prohibiting 
the use of federal funds for political advocacy.  Unfortunately, the prohibition 
was too vague, too lenient, and too weakly enforced.  Put simply, auditing of 
federal grants by the government does not provide the level of scrutiny needed 
to root out abuse.
<p>
The scope of the problem can be seen by examining the <i>Catalog of Federal 
Domestic Assistance</i>, published every six months by the federal government.  It 
details nearly every federal program from which eligible individuals, 
organizations, and governments can receive tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer 
funding.
<p>
For years, congressional offices have worked with constituents to help 
them find federal grants, in the process becoming very familiar with the <i>Catalog </i>
as a guide to sources.  But very few congressional staff employees have been 
aware of abuses in the grants process.  These abuses are long-standing. In 
testimony before the House Committee on Government Operations in 1983, 
Joseph Wright of the Office of Management and Budget noted that the General 
Accounting Office had found problems as far back as 1948.(14)
<p>
In the early years of the Reagan Administration, the OMB attempted to 
revise OMB Circular A-122 (originally issued in the final year of the Carter 
Administration) to redefine limits on "allowable costs" by federal grantees.  The 
revision, first released in January 1983, was widely criticized as overly broad, 
excessively burdensome, and unenforceable.
<p>
One of the focal points of the initial debates was the fact that the original 
OMB proposal apparently would have disallowed the use of any equipment, 
personnel, or office space for both federal grant and political advocacy purposes 
if at least 5 percent of the organizations resources was used for lobbying.  For 
example, a copy machine could not be used to produce flyers for a rally on 
Capitol Hill if it was paid for - in whole or in part - by taxpayer funds.  Many 
nonprofits objected to such clear separation between federal funding and 
political advocacy.
<p>
Months later, OMB Director David Stockman and General Counsel 
Michael Horowitz withdrew the original proposal and released a new draft with 
a more narrow definition of prohibited activities.  This watered-down version no 
longer drew a clear line between allowable and unallowable costs.  Instead, it 
specified a few examples of prohibited behavior, including a prohibition on 
reimbursement for conferences used in "substantial" part to promote lobbying 
activities.
<p>
Unfortunately, this effort to appease federally funded nonprofits and quell 
opposition in Congress was futile.  Because Congress signaled its clear 
opposition to working with the Reagan Administration to curb federally funded 
lobbying activities, despite the fact that all parties acknowledged such behavior 
was inappropriate, A-122 failed to improve substantially the restrictions on 
lobbyists billing Uncle Sam for their activities.
<p>
<a name="proh"><h4>EXISTING PROHIBITIONS ARENT WORKING</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Federal law prohibits the use of federal funds for lobbying (18 U.S.C. 
Section 1913).  However, there is no clear set of guidelines as to specific 
prohibited practices.  In addition, numerous appropriations riders have been 
offered and approved in the past in an effort to curb federally subsidized 
lobbying.  The purpose of the Reagan Administrations attempt to create a more 
stringent version of OMB Circular A-122 was to tighten the gaping loopholes in 
existing law and to implement Congresss intent in passing lobbying prohibitions.
<p>
Circular A-122 drew on several distinct concepts to frame the new guidelines.  
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Taxpayers are not obliged to fund advocacy they oppose.</b>  The 
Supreme Court in 1977 ruled that taxpayers are not required, directly 
or indirectly, "to contribute to the support of an ideological cause 
[they] may oppose."  (<i>Abood v. Detroit Board of Education</i>)
<p>
<li><b>Freedom of speech does not depend on federal funding.</b>  In 1983, the 
Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the federal government "is not 
required by the First Amendment to subsidize lobbying .... We again 
reject the notion that First Amendment rights are somehow not fully 
realized unless they are subsidized by the State."  (<i>Regan v. Taxation 
with Representation</i>)
<p>
<li><b>The Internal Revenue Code does not alleviate the problem.</b>  The 
notice of the request for public comment on the second revision of A-
122 notes that current IRS rules threaten tax-preferred organizations 
only if they exceed defined limits on lobbying.  However, the limits are 
not tied in any way to the receipt of federal funds, leading to many of 
the same problems from which the 1919 law prohibiting federally 
funded lobbying suffers.
</ul>
<p>
Unfortunately, the firestorm created by the first proposed revision of A-
122 led to a second draft that watered down the tough initial provisions and 
failed to solve the problems outlined by the Administration in presenting its 
proposals.  The notice for public comment on the second proposal stated that its 
"purpose [was] assuring compliance with a myriad of statuory provisions 
mandating that no federal funds be used for lobbying purposes, and to comply, 
in balanced fashion, with fundamental First Amendment imperatives."  Despite 
the best of intentions, the revised A-122 did not meet these goals.
<p>
A particularly serious provision of the second revision was its 
enforcement mechanism.  A popular maxim in the 1980s was "trust but verify."  
OMB Circular A-122 relied on trust alone:  
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>[T]he federal government will rely upon [the nonprofit employees] good faith certification of lobbying time below 25% .... Under the proposal, the absence of time logs or similar records not kept pursuant to grantee or contractor discretion will no longer serve as a basis of contesting or disallowing claims for indirect cost employees.</Font></blockquote>
<p>
In essence, this lack of verification of time spent on lobbying activities 
permits the individual to state that he is complying with the law even if that is 
not the case.  This is worse than the fox guarding the henhouse.  If a nonprofit is 
willing to violate the restrictions on advocacy, surely it will have no qualms 
about certifying it is in compliance with the law.
<p>
<a name="rest"><h4>TOUGHER RESTRICTIONS NEEDED</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Tougher laws are needed to prevent the abuse of taxpayers funds by 
federal grantees.  There is no excuse for compelling John Q. Public to support 
political advocacy that he opposes.  It is fiscally irresponsible and morally 
indefensible. 
<p>
The following should be essential parts of any congressional efforts to 
curb current abuses:
<ul>
<li><b>Truth in Testimony.</b>  Witnesses testifying before Congress should be 
required to divulge in their oral and written testimonies whether they 
receive federal funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount.  
This will permit committees to view the testimony in an appropriate 
light.
<p>
<li><b>No Federal Funding for Advocacy.</b>  No organization that receives 
federal funds should be permitted to engage in anything but incidental 
lobbying activities, except on issues directly related to its tax status.
<p>
<li><b>No Bureaucratic Shell Games.</b>  No recipient of federal funds should be 
permitted to maintain organizational ties to any entity that engages in 
lobbying activity.  All sub-grantees should be treated as if they 
received the funds directly from the federal government.  Independent 
Sector, an organization representing hundreds of nonprofit advocacy 
groups, unwittingly indicated the need for this in a recent report: 
"Although the non-profit organization received a check from the local 
government, the local government may have received some or all of its 
funding for this project from a Federal Community Development 
Block Grant (CDBG)."(15)
<p>
<li><b>Meaningful Auditing.</b>  The Inspectors General of the various federal 
departments and agencies must investigate more thoroughly any 
abuses of current law, as well as new laws passed by the Congress.  
<p>
<li><b>Tough Penalties.</b>  The consequences for violating the prohibition on 
federally subsidized lobbying must be sufficient to discourage 
organizations from violating the standards.  Under no circumstances 
should any organization that willingly and knowingly violates the 
prohibitions receive further federal funding.
</ul>
<p>
Representative Robert K. Dornan (R-CA) has introduced H. R. 1130, the 
Integrity in Government Act, which would prohibit a recipient or paid 
representative of any federal award, grant, or contract from lobbying in the 
following circumstances:
</wl>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In favor of continuing the award, grant, or contract;
<li>In favor of the actual program under which the funds were disbursed;
<li>In favor of any other program within the broad department or agency; 
and
<li>In favor of continued department or agency funding.
</ul>
<p>
The Dornan legislation also prohibits tax-exempt lobbying organizations from 
receiving federal funds.  Representatives Bob Ehrlich (R-MD), Ernest Istook (R-
OK), and David McIntosh (R-IN) also are working on legislation to remedy this 
problem.
<p>
It is difficult to craft legislation that satisfactorily defines prohibited 
activities.  Moreover, any bill designed to redress these abuses must prevent 
organizations from simply establishing separate bank accounts and separate 
names.  To be effective, there must be a definite and complete physical 
separation between all federally and privately funded resources.
<p>
<a name="concl"><h4>CONCLUSION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Taxpayer-subsidized political advocacy represents pure fiscal folly and 
moral injustice.  No hard-working American should be compelled to finance 
lobbying activities with which he disagrees.  The Founding Fathers would be 
appalled at current federal grantmaking.  Thirteen years ago, <i>The Washington Post</i> 
editorialized:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>[W]e agree that there is something disturbing about organizations that strongly advocate positions many sensible people find politically or morally repugnant, acting at the same time as administrators of government programs.  It is easy to believe that the advocacy groups employees will sometimes proselytize the 
programs beneficiaries in ways we would consider inappropriate (though not unheard of) for a civil servant.  Advocacy organizations might also want to ask themselves whether they risk compromising their own purposes by accepting government money, and whether they want to assume the inevitable risk that it might be withdrawn suddenly for legitimate political reasons.(16)</Font></blockquote>
<p>
Abuse of federal grant funds must be stopped.  Tougher restrictions are 
needed to prevent lobbying organizations from obtaining some or most of their 
revenue from the American taxpayers.  Auditing and investigation of federal 
grantees by the Executive Branch must be strengthened.  However, a danger 
always exists that as long as government funds go to advocacy organizations, the 
"wall of separation" will be porous.  Moreover, the less fortunate would be 
assisted more directly by eliminating the middleman who "does well by doing 
good."
<p>
Without restoring integrity to government by ending federally funded 
lobbying, Congress and the President will continue to squander millions of 
taxpayer dollars each year.  Political patronage should have no place in the 
federal budget.

<h2>FEDERALLY SUBSIDIZED NATIONAL TRUST LOBBIES CONGRESS</H2><br>

<p>
The National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP) receives approximately $7 million each year from the American taxpayers.  As part of its effort to set budget priorities and balance the budget, the House Appropriations Committee has decided to phase out federal funding for this organization over the next two years. An amendment by Representative Tom DeLay (R-TX) that would have eliminated the subsidy in just one year was defeated by voice vote in committee.
<p>
	In recent years, the Trust has lobbied Congress to expand the historic rehabilitation tax credit (at a cost of $1.4 billion over five years, according to the Trust itself1) and has fought economic development nationwide, including a proposed Disney theme park in Virginia.2  It should come as no surprise that the Trust appears to have mobilized its forces to oppose these proposed cuts in its federal support.
<p>
	In a June 28, 1995, letter to members of the House of Representatives, Trust President Richard Moe declares that "Congress has given the National Trust a central role in the federal historic preservation program under our 1949 charter and the National Historic Preservation Act, as passed in 1966 and amended in 1992."  Despite this self-described pseudo-governmental role, the organization has chosen to mount a full-scale lobbying campaign against the funding reduction.

<blockquote><b>"VOTE NO ON AMENDMENT BY REP. DELAY TO ELIMINATE  FUNDING
FOR THE NATIONAL TRUST FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION"</b></blockquote>
<p>
declares the headline on the National Trust's letter. Attached to the two-page text of the letter is a two-page target list of members who voted against cutting the NTHP's funding in 1993. 
<p>
	The National Trust for Historic Preservation's letter clearly shows the trouble with taxpayer-subsidized political advocacy.  In its fight to continue feeding at the public trough, the Trust has given the American people a good look at their tax dollars at work.

<title>Taxpayers Subsidize AARP -- Heritage </title>

<center><h2>TAXPAYERS SUBSIDIZE AARP</h2><br>
<b>Senior Citizens Group Receives $86 Million from Uncle Sam</b><br>

<p>

The $86 million that the American Association of Retired Persons acknowledged receiving in federal funding for 1993 through various grant programs represents approximately one-quarter of its annual expenditures. AARP's sources of funding range from programs for the elderly to millions of dollars annually to provide clerical support to the EPA. Many senior citizens groups receive almost all of their federal funding in one lump sum payment from the Senior Community Service Employment Program, but AARP also benefits from numerous smaller grants.
<p>
Following is a brief breakdown of most of AARP's federal funding from July 1993 to June 1994. Reference numbers are those contained in the <i>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</i>:
<p><ul>
<li>The largest single source of AARP funding is the Department of Labor/Employment Training Administration's Senior Community Service Employment Program. This one account provides about $49 million per year to AARP's bank account. More than $300 million of the $400 million appropriated for Program Year 1994 went to nine seniors organizations and the Forest Service, with the remainder going to the states. [17.235]
<p>
<li>AARP is a major beneficiary of the EPA's Senior Environmental Employment Program. The annual appropriation is $45 million, from which approximately 265 grants are made. AARP appears to receive approximately $20 million from this program. The AARP provides support to almost every regional office of the EPA, as well as to most divisions within the Washington headquarters. [66.508]
<p>
<li>AARP receives approximately $4.6 million per year under the Treasury Department/Internal Revenue Service's Tax Counseling for the Elderly Program. This represents the lion's share of the grant's annual appropriation. [21.006]
<p>
<li>AARP receives $75,000 per year from the Centers for Disease Control to develop "comprehensive breast and cervical cancer early detection programs."  The grant requirements in the <i>Catalog </i>state this money is available only to "official State health agencies of the United States" and its territories. Other groups funded in this manner include the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and the American Nurses Association (ANA). [93.919]

<title>What Medicare's Advisers Are Telling Congress About Medicare Reform - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3>WHAT MEDICARE'S ADVISERS ARE TELLING CONGRESS ABOUT MEDICARE REFORM</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a><br>
Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 99<br>
May 6, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two key advisory boards for the Medicare program, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC) and Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC), have joined in the calls for Congress and the President to slow the explosive growth in Medicare spending.  The annual reports of both official panels also shed light on the deficiencies in Medicare's complex system of price controls.  In the case of PROPAC, there is a clear acknowledgment that the "dynamic process" works by shifting the rising costs of the Medicare program over to workers and their families in the private sector.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Created by Congress in 1983, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC) advises Members of Congress and the Secretary of the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Medicare reimbursement for hospitals and other medical facilities.  Created by Congress in 1985, the Physician Payment Review Commission was charged with advising Congress on physician payment reform, and later with advising Congress on Medicare fee schedules for doctors.  It also examines the related issues of patient access, utilization, and assignment policies.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In practice, PROPAC's main responsibility is to advise Congress on how to regulate hospital rates under the Prospective Payment System (PPS), Medicare's hospital fee schedule; the PPS is essentially a complicated price control system.<sup>1</sup>  PROPAC currently is chaired by Stuart H.  Altman, Ph.D., a professor of health care policy at Brandeis University and formerly a key adviser on health care policy to President Clinton.<sup>2</sup>  The PPRC's main responsibility is giving advice to Congress on regulating the Medicare fees of doctors, in particular the administration of Medicare's Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS),<sup>3</sup> in conjunction with standards governing the volume of medical services and limitations on billing.  The PPRC is chaired by Gail Wilensky, Ph.D., of Project Hope, formerly the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) under President George Bush.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In its most recent report,<sup>4</sup> PROPAC outlines 26 separate recommendations governing various aspects of hospital payment and other features of the Medicare program.  Most of these are technical and include detailed recommendations concerning payment schedules.  The PPRC's 401-page report also makes numerous technical recommendations on various aspects of Medicare reimbursements.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But more significant are the panels' recommendations on general Medicare reform.  These recommendations touch on Medicare's fundamental structure and financing, as well as the growth in overall Medicare spending.  Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Both panels emphasizes the urgent need to control Medicare spending,</b> and PROPAC notes that despite partisan rhetoric, the White House and Congress are quite close in their targets for spending control;
<p>
<li><b>Both call for giving beneficiaries more choices;</b>
<p>
<li><b>Neither panel opposes medical savings accounts (MSAs)</b>, in contrast with the White House; and
<p>
<li><b>Both panels note the limitations and heavy costs</b> associated with today's Medicare price controls.
</ul><p>

<b>WHAT THE PANELS SAY ABOUT REFORM</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress showed great political courage in attempting structural reform of the Medicare program.  While that reform was vetoed by President Clinton, recent reports on the operating deficit of the hospital trust fund underscore the need for urgent action to contain costs and reorganize the 30-year-old program.  Members of Congress should heed the Commissions' contributions to the reform debate, particularly on technical issues.  Many of these are particularly helpful and may suggest ways of resolving some of the disputes between Congress and the White House.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider some key observations:
<p>
<b>Observation #1:  Both panels urge Congress to slow the growth in Medicare spending.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Says PROPAC:  "The rise in Medicare spending threatens the solvency of the program's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, its primary source of income.  Moreover, it has been a major contributor to the federal budget deficit."<sup>5</sup>  The Commission notes that between 1967 and 1993, Medicare spending jumped thirtyfold.  Between 1980 and 1993, Medicare spending was climbing in excess of 11 percent per year.  As the Medicare trustees noted last year, the Medicare hospitalization program, which already has run a deficit for the first time in 1995, is expected to go bankrupt in the year 2002 or possibly even sooner.  The Medicare payment for physicians services, also known as Medicare Part B, while not facing insolvency, is taking an ever-larger share of general revenues to break even, rising from 49 percent of Part B income in 1972 to 72 percent in 1993.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under current law, taxpayers are required to cover Part B expenditures automatically:  "The growth in Part B Medicare spending, therefore, increases the federal budget and contributes to the deficit."<sup>6</sup>  By 1995, Medicare spending reached $177 billion, an amount equal to 12 percent of the federal budget.  By the year 2002, it will reach $332 billion, and Medicare, together with Medicaid, which covers the poor and the indigent, will equal approximately 27 percent of the federal budget:  "[The Congressional Budget Office] points to the rapid growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending as the major factor driving up its deficit projections."<sup>7</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Likewise, the PPRC says, Medicare's "growth has outpaced defense and social security, and today is second only to net interest payments on the national debt.  And while Medicare expenditures are expected to continue accelerating at annual rates of 8.6 percent to 10 percent from now until 2005, rates of growth in federal outlays for other national priorities are expected to decline."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC notes that the private sector has been more successful in recent years in controlling health care costs and recommends a similar slowing of Medicare costs:  "Over time, spending for services furnished to Medicare enrollees should increase at rates comparable to those in a cost- and quality-conscious private sector."<sup>9</sup>  Similarly, PPRC says, "recent data showing that private sector health spending is growing more slowly than Medicare expenditures have reinforced the view that greater discipline in spending is possible without threatening access or quality of care."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #2:  PROPAC notes that the budget debate obscures a significant fact:  Both the White House and Congress are relatively close in their efforts to slow the growth of Medicare spending.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Notes the Commission:  "The annual increase in Medicare spending is similar in all proposals, ranging from 7.2 percent to 7.6 percent.  The variation in total savings, however, is much greater due to differences in the growth of Part B premiums among the proposals."<sup>11</sup>  If nothing is done to curb the growth in Medicare spending, the Congressional Budget Office projects that it will grow between 1995 and 2002 at a rate of 9.4 percent annually.  Neither Congress nor the White House regards this rate of growth as acceptable.  Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, enacted by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton, Medicare spending would rise at an annual rate of 7.2 percent.<sup>12</sup>  President Clinton proposed a Medicare reform package that would have established an annual growth rate of 7.6 percent.  A third proposal, offered by a coalition of members of the House of Representatives, would have set annual spending increases at 7.5 percent.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #3:  Both panels agree that Congress and the President should give Medicare enrollees the personal and financial benefits of consumer choice and competition. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Says PROPAC:  "Medicare beneficiaries should have a wider range of health plan options.  Under the current program beneficiary choice is largely limited to the traditional fee for service program and, where available, an HMO option.  Additional alternatives would let Medicare beneficiaries choose the type of plan that best meets their needs and would permit new beneficiaries enrolled in a particular type of plan before retirement to stay in that arrangement.  In addition, more alternatives could increase plan competition for Medicare beneficiaries on the basis of additional benefits and quality."<sup>14</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress's plan would have given enrollees a broad range of choice.  PROPAC notes that the congressional "MedicarePlus would allow a broad array of managed care plans, including preferred provider organizations (PPOs) to participate.  Fee for service plans also would be permitted.  New options not widely available in the private market, such as medical savings accounts (MSAs) and provider sponsored networks, also could be offered to beneficiaries.  All MedicarePlus plans would receive a capitation payment from Medicare."<sup>15</sup>  PROPAC also acknowledges that the Clinton plan would give less choice to elderly Americans than the congressional plan:  "The President also has proposed expanding the risk program, but the changes would be less comprehensive than those Congress has envisioned under MedicarePlus.  Beneficiaries would be able to enroll in qualified PPO's and provider sponsored organizations as well as HMOs.  Most enrollees would be able to join one of those plans only during annual open enrollment periods.  Private fee for service plans and high deductible plans combined with MSAs would not be among the available options."<sup>16</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC observes that the creation of a market-oriented Medicare system characterized by consumer choice and competition would encourage private organizations to promote and disseminate vital consumer information:  "As the number of choices under Medicare increases either through the current program or expansions, private entities likely will begin distributing information about these choices to beneficiaries.  Although this is appropriate, Medicare should not abandon its responsibility to ensure that beneficiaries receive unbiased, comparable and reliable data."<sup>17</sup>  The Secretary of HHS, much like the Director of the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in administering the consumer-based Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) for federal workers and retirees, could play an important role in providing unbiased plan information to Medicare enrollees, according to PROPAC:  "The Secretary should continue efforts to identify the information beneficiaries need to make informed health plan choices and the most appropriate format for it.  This is even more critical as health plan choices are expanded for Medicare beneficiaries.  The Secretary should explore initiatives that would, for example, measure the satisfaction of beneficiaries who used services, describe total benefits available in an area (including those covered under insurance policies offered as supplements to Medicare) and document performance of individual providers within a plan."<sup>18</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The PPRC similarly favors an aggressive information program for Medicare consumers on plan options in a reformed and modernized Medicare system, showing consumers costs and benefits, including the costs and benefits of enrollment in health maintenance organization (HMO) plans.  Says the PPRC:  "Plans should disclose information about the general nature of the financial incentives faced by providers who contract with a health plan."<sup>19</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC recommends the expansion of Medicare's limited capitation program and patient choice:  "The Commission supports reforming the Medicare captitation program to control spending while expanding beneficiary choice."<sup>20</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #4:  Surprisingly, neither official panel comes out in opposition to medical savings accounts (MSAs).  Both panels acknowledge that MSAs would provide additional choice for the elderly and note that most, though not all, Medicare beneficiaries choosing MSAs would benefit financially from their choices.  The panels do emphasize that MSAs must be carefully designed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
According to PROPAC, "Most beneficiaries who selected the Medicare MSA option probably would benefit financially.  Beneficiaries who did not anticipate using health services would be attracted to this option, because they would expect to keep unspent MSA funds."<sup>21</sup>  The Commission notes that the effectiveness of MSAs in the area of cost control would be determined largely by the way they are designed.  Specifically, senior citizens would likely be prudent purchasers of medical services if they saw the money in their MSAs as their own money and viewed anything unspent as personal savings.  The MSAs must be designed as a savings vehicle.  If they are improperly designed or presented, and if the elderly do not understand the money in the account to be potential savings, and not just an account for health services, the MSA could become a "spending plan" and, PROPAC notes, thus would "tend to reduce beneficiaries' restraint in purchasing health services."<sup>22</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another issue related to MSAs is the problem of adverse selection.  Critics claim that MSAs would be selected mainly by healthy seniors, which could lead to a large increase in Medicare spending rather than a reduction.  PROPAC says that the current risk adjustment mechanism in the Medicare system is inadequate to deal with the problem of adverse selection.  This has consequences for MSAs.  PROPAC suggests that in developing an MSA program, policymakers should scrutinize its design carefully, with special attention to the amount of funds deposited, the length of time before persons may disenroll, and the "features" of the high-deductible plan.<sup>23</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is strong opposition to MSAs among liberals in Congress, particularly in the Senate, and in the Clinton Administration.  Thus, it is significant that PROPAC, which serves as an official advisory board for Medicare, does not oppose MSAs.  Instead, PROPAC favors improved risk adjustment and says that "The likelihood that rates would better reflect risk would be enhanced if Medicare enrollees were required to remain in the MSA option at least for several years."<sup>24</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Likewise, the PPRC recommends that "The enrollment and disenrollment rules of Medicare medical savings account plans should be structured to reduce the potential risk for risk selection.  Examples of restructured rules include a minimum enrollment period of several years in an MSA or requiring beneficiaries to announce their disenrollment from an MSA one or more years in advance."<sup>25</sup>  The PPRC calls for careful monitoring of risk selection and its impact on Medicare costs.  Moreover, says the Commission, Medicare MSA plans should be on a level playing field with other plans.  In this respect, it says, MSA plans should be held to the same standards as other plans in reporting data to Medicare.  Moreover, there should be "no undue legal restriction of managed care plans' ability to offer this product."<sup>26</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, the PPRC notes that the personal choice of an MSA plan is not, of course, a risk free option and estimates that 28 percent of Medicare beneficiaries probably would reach the $3,000 deductible limit that qualifies them for catastrophic coverage under the congressional Medicare reform plan.<sup>27</sup>  Consumers therefore should fully understand the potential costs, including out-of-pocket costs.  Thus, the PPRC recommends:  "Medicare MSA plans should be required to disclose beneficiaries' typical (and potential) out-of pocket spending including exposure to balance billing.  This information should be provided to beneficiaries in a uniform format so that they can easily compare insurers."<sup>28</sup>  It should be noted that in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, health plan cost comparison data, including potential out-of-pocket costs, are made available routinely through private sources to Members of Congress, federal workers, and retirees during the annual "Open Season," the special time of year when these consumers pick and choose among a variety of health plans.
<p>
<b>Observation #5:  Both panels say that Medicare should improve risk adjustment mechanisms to reduce the problems of adverse selection and to control costs in the Medicare program. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1985, Congress established a "risk contracting program" under which health maintenance organizations (HMOs) would receive a per capita payment from Medicare for providing medical services to the elderly.  Through this capitation system, Medicare beneficiaries would be able to enroll in these special HMOs and get extra benefits, while Medicare would be able to realize savings through a fixed payment.  Today, about 8 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in the program.  The government's pricing system is inefficient and does not reflect market conditions.  As PROPAC notes, "The program's capitation rates appear to be too high in some markets and too low in others, discouraging plan participation.  Further, it appears that healthier beneficiaries are likelier than others to enroll, and the payment rates do not adequately reflect this lower risk of illness.  Thus, Medicare may pay more for beneficiaries in its risk program than it would have had they stayed in the fee for service program."<sup>29</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
PROPAC argues that Medicare needs a better risk adjustment method in setting rates to reflect more accurately the differences among individuals in their use of medical services.  Without this effective risk adjustment, especially if capitated plans and traditional fee for service plans are competing in a reformed system, the result could be higher-than-expected costs.  PROPAC suggests that while no ideal risk adjustment mechanism exists, the Secretary of HHS should "implement interim improvements as soon as possible."<sup>30</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In order to meet budgetary targets, Congress included a "fail safe mechanism" in the Medicare reform legislation last year.  This would have meant automatic reductions in payments to doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers if specified budget targets were not met.  The mechanism would rely on the existing apparatus of Medicare price regulations.  With respect to this approach, PROPAC says, "Any fail-safe budget mechanism should include a more effective risk adjustment factor to ensure payment equity between the Medicare capitation and traditional fee for service programs."<sup>31</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Given its limited experience with managed care options, the PPRC agrees substantively with PROPAC on the issue of risk selection:  "Although Medicare's per capita payment should be adjusted to reflect the risk mix of each plan's enrollees, current risk adjustment approaches capture relatively little of any biased selection across plans."<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<b>Observation #6:  Medicare's price controls have their cost.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Physician Payment Review Commission is charged with advising Congress on how to pay doctors the "right price" for their professional services.  Given the complexities of the cumbersome Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS), this is an inherently formidable task.  As the PPRC puts it, with classic understatement:
<blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In hindsight, however, physician payment reform has not been an unqualified success.  In part this reflects inconsistencies within the policy that resulted from compromises made in crafting the reform.  For example, distortions in relative values have been reintroduced owing to the existence of separate volume performance standards (VPSs) for different categories of services:  surgical, primary care and non surgical.  As a result, shifts in relative payments accomplished over the past several years will likely be reversed unless further legislative changes are made.  In addition, some expectations about payment reform's effects may have been unrealistic given the underlying incentives of fee for service medicine.  Despite progress in slowing the rate of growth in physicians services, for instance, overall Medicare expenditures continue to increase at a rate many consider unaffordable.<sup>33</sup></blockquote>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

If Medicare's price control regime governing doctors has not been an "unqualified success," neither has its system governing hospitals.  Since 1983, Congress has imposed a complex system of price controls on hospitals called the Prospective Payment System.  Under this system, hospitals are prospectively reimbursed for medical services; almost 500 of these medical services are grouped according to categories, each called a diagnostic related group (DRG), for which there are fixed payments.  Hospitals may not charge more for the services to Medicare payments, nor may hospitals rebate funds to Medicare enrollees if they can provide a medical service more cheaply.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over the years, the impact of the PPS/DRG system on inpatient care has been to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare's hospital costs.  The economic incentives in the system have reduced the length of inpatient hospital stays, especially for older Medicare patients.  Says PROPAC:  "The rapid fall of Medicare length of stay may partially reflect a trend toward discharging some patients to post-acute settings earlier in the course of their treatment, representing a change in the hospital product.  This has led to concern about how Medicare pays for patients who are discharged from PPS hospitals to inpatient post-acute care providers."<sup>34</sup>  Price controls always encourage a shifting of resources from the controlled to the less controlled or uncontrolled sectors of the economy.  This, of course, invariably generates a demand for an extension of the price controls, an absurd process that distorts economic arrangements even more.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A clear example of hospital gaming has been the broader shifting of Medicare hospital costs since the inception of PPS to the private sector.  Says the Commission:  "During this period, hospitals generally were able to obtain the revenue they needed to cover additional losses from treating Medicare patients by cost shifting to private insurers.  This was accomplished by obtaining payment increases from private payers that exceeded the corresponding cost increases.  As a result, the average payment to cost ratio for private payers went from 116 percent in 1986 to 131 percent in 1992.  Primarily because of cost shifting, hospitals were able to maintain fairly stable total margins, which reflect gains and losses from all payers as well as from non-patient care activities."<sup>35</sup>  In other words, Americans with private insurance pay extra to offset the relatively low reimbursements received by providers from the Medicare program.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Medicare's official advisors have strongly reaffirmed the need to reform the Medicare system.  This is welcome support for necessary changes in the program.  Failure to enact reform means either huge future cuts in Medicare benefits for the elderly or huge tax increases on working families.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Medicare's advisory panels have argued forcefully in their reports that Medicare spending should be slowed, and that the failure to do so threatens Medicare's financial solvency and aggravates the federal budget deficit.  But Medicare's advisers also have endorsed broader consumer choice while declining to oppose medical savings accounts (MSAs).  Moreover, they have made constructive proposals in the technical areas of risk adjustment and information sharing for a modernized Medicare system characterized by consumer choice and competition.  And, finally, they have been forthright in their description of the operations of the system's price regulations.  PROPAC, in particular, has noted that price regulation of hospital services -- long the official recipe for slowing down Medicare's rising costs -- imposes its own costs on workers and their families in the private insurance market.  Obviously, any "reform" of Medicare that relies on clamping down even more tightly on payments to hospitals and physicians will aggravate that cost shifting to the private sector.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reports of these two commissions underscore the need for fundamental reform, and they indicate yet again that there is bipartisan support among experts for that reform.

<title>Bridging the Budget Gap on Medicare -- Heritage</title>

<h3><i>BRIDGING THE BUDGET GAP ON MEDICARE</i></h3>

F.Y.I. No. 73<br>
November 21, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
The Congress-White House budget agreement reached on Sunday would incorporate a slightly modified Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline against which to measure competing ways to balance the budget in seven years. 
<p>
This is important because it means both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue will be using the same "benchmark" to compare proposals with current law. Until now, the White House has insisted on  using baselines developed by its own Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Congress uses the nonpartisan CBO, as required by statute. Since the OMB's forecast for the economy and spending under current law generally is more optimistic than CBO's (that is, assumes faster economic growth and a slower increase in many federal programs), achieving any proposed federal budget requires smaller savings according to the White House than according to CBO.
<p>
Using the same CBO scorecard will make it much easier to reach compromise in a number of policy areas where the White House and Congress hitherto appeared too far apart for an agreement. Perhaps the most important of these areas is Medicare. The White House and congressional Democrats in recent weeks have attempted to draw a stark distinction between the Medicare savings projected in the House-Senate conference budget resolution and President Clinton's budget plan, released in June. Americans have been told that, while the President's plan seeks to achieve only $128 billion in savings over the next seven years, the conference budget resolution seeks to achieve $270 billion in savings. Hence, the impression is created that Congress intends to reduce projected Medicare spending by more than double the amount favored by the White House.
<p>
Using the same CBO baseline for both Medicare proposals sharply reduces the gap. 
<p>
Specifically:
<p>
Comparing the two budget plans with the CBO baseline indicates that the White House wants savings of $192 billion, not the $128 billion it claims when comparing its plan with that of Congress. This makes the difference between the two plans $78 billion over seven years, not the $142 billion claimed by the White House.
<p>
But even this overstates the gap between the two positions in terms of reducing the outlays for Medicare. The reason:  Congress's budget includes new revenue into the program from raising Part B premiums in two ways. In the arcane accounting of Washington, bringing new revenues into the Medicare program is considered identical to cutting the growth of projected spending on health care services. It obviously is not, however, since adding revenues to fund the program does not reduce spending, even though it does reduce the growth in net outlays. 
<p>
Under the congressional plan, the first way Part B premium revenues are increased, compared with current law, is by maintaining premiums at 31.5 percent of costs instead of allowing them to fall to 25 percent of costs, as current law would do (meaning an actual reduction in premiums). This raises $48.7 billion over seven years. Under the second change, an affluence test would be applied to Medicare recipients, and upper-income beneficiaries would face an additional increase in premiums, reducing the subsidy these individuals currently receive from taxpayers. This second change raises $8.6 billion over seven years. Thus, the combined revenue generated by the premium adjustments -- which is classified as a reduction in spending by Washington, but actually funds more Medicare services -- is $57.3 billion over seven years.
<p>
The Clinton budget contains no premium increases, even on the wealthy. So to compare the effect of the two Medicare proposals on actual spending for services, it is necessary to add the misleadingly classified $57.3 billion revenue increase to the congressional budget numbers.
<p>
If Medicare spending under the two budgets is compared with the CBO baseline, after correcting the congressional figure for the additional premium revenue, the difference in spending falls to a gap of just $20.7 billion over seven years in a program which is projected to spend $1,900 billion over that period. Thus, the gap between the White House and Congress on Medicare spending is just one percent of current projected outlays.

<h3>SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON MEDICARE PART B</h3>

"Under the Medicare proposals people could be making $50,000, $100,000 or $200,000 a year and still receive medical assistance provided by the Federal Government from a tax on a poor man who has not enough money to put butter on his bread.... We should help people who cannot pay their own medical bills...."  -- U.S. Senator Russell B. Long (D-LA), August 31, 1964
<p>
"The American public is tired of political promises that go unfulfilled. They realize that tough choices must be made.... The first plan... would take $114 billion over five years from Medicare... increasing co-payments for beneficiaries.... The second and third plans reduce the spending cuts somewhat but replace them with substantial tax increases. The second plan... provides for $45 billion in Medicare cuts... increasing co-payments for beneficiaries.... My own preference would be  ... similar to Plan II." -- Leon E. Panetta, Chairman, Committee on the Budget, Press Release, May 26, 1992
<p>
"The President had less compelling reasons to veto the continuing budget resolution. His chief stated reason -- to protect Medicare patients -- is purely political. The bill would, as it should, prevent Medicare premiums for Part B... from falling $3.60 a month. At a time when Government services across the board will be sliced, there is really no reason to cut Medicare costs for the politically powerful elderly." -- <i>The New York Times</i>, November 14, 1995, p. A24
<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The White House is attempting to draw a "defining difference" between the Medicare Part B premium savings in the respective House-Senate Balanced Budget Reconciliation Acts passed last month and President Clinton's own budget plan, released in June 1995. President Clinton's stated reason for opposing a continuing resolution to keep federal agencies operating until December 1, 1995, is a provision requiring Medicare beneficiaries to continue paying what they pay today:  31.5 percent of the Medicare Part B program's costs.<sup>1</sup>  Medicare is also the most contentious issue in the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995.<p>The Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) program, also known as Part B, pays for physician, auxiliary, and outpatient services, and for dialysis for those with end-stage renal (kidney) disease. Beneficiaries enroll in Part B voluntarily. In addition to the Part B premium, they are responsible for a $100 per year deductible. Once a beneficiary satisfies the deductible, the taxpayer pays 80 percent of all physician and related services for the rest of the calendar year. Utilization is unlimited, which means the program is an open-ended entitlement. Taxpayers today subsidize approximately 68.5 percent of the Part B program, regardless of a beneficiary's income or past level of contribution. Meanwhile, two-thirds of the uninsured population -- working Americans or their dependents, the working poor, and the lower middle class -- are forced to spend hundreds of dollars a year subsidizing Medicare, including high income beneficiaries through a mandatory Medicare payroll tax (HI tax) and general federal income taxes. 
<p>
When Part B was implemented in 1966, the Democratic Congress, under the leadership of the Johnson Administration, set the premium level to require beneficiaries to finance 50 percent of the program's costs. This was Congress's original contract with the American taxpayers. The terms of the contract have been broken. Due to excessively high utilization rates by seniors, Part B costs have grown much faster than the annual Social Security cost of living adjustments (COLAs). Since 1984, Congress has taken the politically safe route of requiring beneficiaries to pay only 25 percent of Part B costs. In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93), President Clinton and Congress again set the Part B premium to cover 25 percent of costs. OBRA 93 applies to Part B premiums from 1996 to 1998. Because of government miscalculations, the current Part B premium of $46.10 per month covers 31.5 percent of the program as opposed to 25 percent.<sup>2</sup><p><b>THE NEED FOR REFORM</b><p>In its 1995 Annual Report, the Board of Trustees for the Federal Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund concluded:  "Growth rates have been so rapid that outlays of the program have increased 53 percent in aggregate and 40 percent per enrollee in the last 5 years. For the same time period, the program grew 19 percent faster than the economy despite recent efforts to control the cost of the program."3  Two of the board's seven members are private citizens and referred to as "public trustees."  In the "Summary of the 1995 Annual Reports," these public trustees state:  "The SMI Trust Fund, while in balance on an annual basis, shows a growth rate of costs which is clearly unsustainable. Moreover, this fund is projected to be 75 percent or more financed by general revenues, so that given the general budget deficit problem, it is a major contributor to the larger fiscal problems of the nation."<sup>4</sup><p>In response to the Trustees' report, Congress proposed a minor yet significant step toward controlling the ever-increasing tax
payer subsidy for Medicare Part B:  requiring both current and future beneficiaries to contribute 31.5 percent of program costs ($53.50 per month) effective January 1, 1996, thereby reducing the substantial taxpayer subsidy while helping to insure that beneficiaries pay a fairer share of the costs. Under this policy, Medicare will save taxpayers $47.1 billion over the next seven years while continuing to maintain a very generous subsidy to enrollees.
<p>
The Clinton Administration and liberals in Congress insist that a 25 percent enrollee contribution ($43.70 per month) must prevail, which would force all working Americans to increase their current 68.5 percent subsidy to 75 percent as of January 1, 1996. Since Part B premiums are currently $46.10 per month, it is disingenuous for liberals in Congress to call a $53.50 per month premium in 1996 an "increase of $11 per month." 
<p>
Coincidentally, President Clinton's Health Security Act of 1993 (H.R. 3500/S. 1757), which modified the Part B benefit package while adding to the federal deficit, would have required an increase of $22 billion in premiums, or about $11 per month per enrollee.<sup>5</sup>  Moreover, Leon Panetta, now President Clinton's Chief of Staff, as Chairman of the House Committee on the Budget recognized that the current $100 per year deductible was not acting to deter unnecessary utilization of medical services. In order to reduce the volume of small claims, an option advanced by Chairman Panetta included increasing the Part B deductible to $150 per year, indexed for future years. The budgetary savings from this change alone would have yielded $11.84 billion between 1993 and 1997.<sup>6</sup>  Similarly, the Senate's version of the seven-year Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995 included exactly the same proposal, to be effective January 1, 1996. It is therefore ironic for the Clinton Administration to condemn congressional efforts to balance the budget as "extreme proposals" that would "violate our values."
<p>
<b>TAXING THE ELDERLY</b>
<p>

Even President Clinton's own proposal to maintain a 25 percent contribution level would require Medicare beneficiaries to pay a larger portion of Part B's estimated costs. Worse, the 1993 Clinton budget raised the taxes of the nation's elderly receiving Social Security benefits. Despite the Clinton Administration's claim that the new 1993 tax increases were levied only on the rich, individual recipients earning $34,000 a year and couples with income over $44,000 a year saw the maximum portion of their Social Security check subject to income taxes jump from 50 percent to 85 percent, effective January 1, 1994. In other words, the Clinton Administration already has reduced the monthly income of senior citizens in its 1993 budget. Because of the revenues already being obtained from this specific tax, opponents of Medicare reform are able to claim that they are not dipping into the pockets of senior citizens. Nevertheless, this claim can only be short lived since the Clinton proposal would increase Part B premiums in 1999.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
Contrary to allegations by the Clinton Administration and congressional liberals that an increase in Part B premiums is designed to finance a tax cut for the rich, Medicare reform legislation requires any savings to be deposited in a newly created "Medicare Preservation Trust Fund."  The legislation explicitly states that the savings accrued from the Medicare Part B program may not be used to offset any change in the Internal Revenue Code. Furthermore, Medicare savings deposited into the new Trust Fund are in the form of public-debt obligations issued exclusively to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and may be used only for Medicare expenditures.
<p>
The record clearly shows that the desire to ease the taxpayers' burden for Part B by raising deductibles, or even by maintaining premiums at 31.5 percent of program costs, is shared by liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans. It is not an "extreme proposal."  Nor does it violate the values of equity and fairness. As Robert Reischauer, former Director of the Congressional Budget Office and currently a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution stated recently:  "`31.5% as part of a fundamental structural change in Medicare is entirely appropriate, especially when combined with a surcharge on upper income beneficiaries,' as called for in the GOP plan."<sup>7</sup><p>

<TITLE>Reforming Medicare: Comparing the House and Senate Legislation</title>

<h3><i>REFORMING MEDICARE:
COMPARING THE HOUSE AND SENATE LEGISLATION</i></h3>
By John C. Liu<br>

Issue Bulletin No. 220<br>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
Congress is on the brink of enacting the most sweeping reform of the Medicare program since the program's inception. If enacted, the reform will take the first giant step toward a system that offers real choices to the elderly and, by slowing the rapid growth in costs, helps ensure that today's working Americans will have a health care program available to them when they retire.
<p>
The next action Congress must take to achieve this goal is to reconcile House and Senate versions of Medicare reform legislation. Certain key provisions in the bills passed by each chamber must be in the final conference package, and Members must focus on these. They must also bear in mind that failure to enact Medicare reforms will cause the whole tax and budget package to unravel. 
<p>
House and Senate Members realize that failure to reform Medicare necessarily means the current program cannot be sustained financially, meaning huge future tax increases on America's working families1 or deep cuts in future Medicare benefits for the elderly. Even the proposed reforms are only a stop-gap measure to ward off fiscal disaster when the "Baby Boom" generation qualifies for Medicare. The Democratic alternative would keep the hospital trust fund solvent until about 2006, just before the Baby Boomers begin to join the program. Even the Republican plan assures solvency of the Medicare hospitalization trust fund only until the year 2010. Failure to enact serious reforms now will just make that future task even more daunting.
<p>
Medicare is plagued by structural problems and exploding costs, according to the program's own Board of Trustees.2  There is a surprising consensus on how to deal with those structural problems.3<p>The legislation being considered by the House and Senate indicates that Congress is prepared to begin making those fundamental changes. The differing House and Senate Medicare proposals have been folded into their respective balanced budget reconciliation bills, H.R. 2491 and S. 1357. The key structural change in the House version is to create a new MedicarePlus Program, patterned after the successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which has served Members of Congress and other federal employees and retirees for over 30 years. Under this arrangement, seniors could opt to use the value of their Medicare benefits as a payment toward a private health plan within a competitive market. Within this framework, seniors could pick plans offered in various ways, including plans offered through elderly organizations and physician- or hospital-organized plans (which would mean real competition to managed care plans). These plans also could include high-deductible insurance combined with Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). The Senate's Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act proposal also offers seniors an alternative to traditional Medicare by creating a Medicare Choice Program that is also patterned after the FEHBP.4  The FEHBP, which provides a wide-ranging list of competing health plans with varying benefit levels and prices, has held down premiums through the free-market forces of consumer choice and competition.5<p>While the legislation in both chambers makes significant improvements in the Medicare program, certain provisions, if not modified, could lead to unintended harmful consequences for the health care market and the elderly. Even more important, certain provisions are entirely counterproductive and contradict the leadership's stated goal of creating a consumer-driven market in Medicare.
<p>
Specifically:<ul>
<p>
<li> The government would standardize benefits packages in private Medicare plans;
<p>
<li> Price controls would be maintained in the traditional Medicare program according to the House bill;
<p>
<li> There would be premium caps on private-sector health plans in the House bill;
<p>
<li> Medical Savings Accounts have been removed as an option in the Senate Medicare Choice plan under the so-called Byrd Rule;
<p>
<li> The bills still do not allow private contracting arrangements between provider and patient;
<p>
<li> The House bill fails to permit union-sponsored plans as an option; and
<p>
<li> The bills do not create a balanced playing field in the clinical laboratory industry; they fail to link direct billing to the fail-safe budget mechanism.
<p></ul>
If lawmakers do not come to terms with these and other issues, the legislation will not fully deal with the structural problems of today's Medicare program.
<p>
<b>WHAT THE HOUSE AND SENATE BILLS DO </b>
<p>
<b>1. Both bills establish consumer choice of health plans.</b>
<p>
Both bills seek to redress the absence of a health care market by expanding the choice of plans and benefits available to the elderly and disabled, using the value of their Medicare benefits as a contribution to the cost of their chosen plan. The elderly would be able to choose the package of benefits, beyond the current Medicare package, that they felt best met their needs. Enrollees would be able to choose traditional Medicare with certain changes (the non-MedicarePlus option) or a private plan as defined in the MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice Programs. The proposals thus expand the opportunities for individual choice of plans. To protect seniors from fraudulent sellers and ensure that confused seniors receive information with which to make a wise choice, the bills require private plans to meet certain minimum consumer protection requirements in order to qualify as MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice organizations.
<p>
The House Bill<br>
A MedicarePlus product could be a physician-sponsored organization, a high-deductible policy combined with a Medical Savings Account, a private fee-for-service plan, a Taft-Hartley plan, or a plan offered through a church or other association. During an annual enrollment period, seniors would be able to enroll in a MedicarePlus health plan in their geographic area by filing a form indicating their preference. To ensure that seniors are making an informed choice, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be required to provide information to future and current Medicare beneficiaries as to the coverage options available. 
<p>
Notably absent from the eligible organizations in MedicarePlus are health plans sponsored by unions. While the original bill included unions as eligible sponsors of MedicarePlus plans, the substitute offered by Representatives William Archer (R-TX) and Thomas Bliley (R-VA) in their respective committees eliminated such opportunities.
<p>
The Senate Bill<br>
In contrast, the Senate provision allows for union sponsorship of Medicare Choice plans and thus would provide even more choices to the elderly. The Senate bill allows unions to sponsor health plans for its members and their spouses. While this is an improvement over the House version, union plans should be allowed to market their health plans to seniors who are not affiliated with the unions, but who register as associate members. This would place unions on a par with other associations under the legislation. In the FEHBP, individuals who are not affiliated with one of the federal employees' unions can join as an associate member for a nominal membership fee and avail themselves and their spouses of the program's health coverage. By not allowing the unions to sell MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plans to the general senior population, the House and Senate plans restrict the market and the range of choices that could be available. One of the unintended effects of the bill as currently written would be to encourage many Americans to become full members of a union to gain access to union health coverage during retirement.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
Congress should expand the options available to senior citizens to include union-sponsored plans. Any restriction on the supply of providers is a restriction on the free market and incompatible with personal consumer choice. 
<p>
<b>2. Both bills provide peace of mind to seniors by eliminating concerns about     pre-existing medical conditions.</b>
<p>
One of the conditions a plan or entity must satisfy to be certified as a MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice organization is to accept any individual electing to enroll regardless of health status.6  This protection is needed for current and future Medicare beneficiaries who suffer from a pre-existing condition. Individuals who incur a serious illness after enrolling in a MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plan could not be excluded from coverage in the future. Both bills guarantee the issuance and renewal of MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice policies to all future and current beneficiaries. Certain exceptions apply for Taft-Hartley organizations in which eligibility to enroll is restricted to members through an employment relationship, or to the spouses of such members.
<p>
<b>3. Both bills impose a government-standardized benefits package. </b>
<p>
MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice must guarantee that any package of health benefits it sells includes, at a minimum, the benefits and services currently available under traditional Medicare Parts A and B. While this is viewed by many in Congress and elsewhere as a guarantee that beneficiaries will not be "shortchanged" should they opt into the MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice programs, it undermines the principle of consumer choice. One of the many problems with a comprehensive minimum package is that the package is a political product, not a response to consumer demand. For example, the current Medicare program does not cover outpatient prescription drugs or long-term care, even though these are crucial to a growing number of elderly people. Yet, on the other hand, it includes:
<p><ul>
<li> Major hospital inpatient services,
<p>
<li> Surgical-medical benefits,
<p>
<li> Mental care,
<p>
<li> Outpatient care, and
<p>
<li> Limited home health and hospice care.
</ul><p>
Needless to say, federal workers and retirees have access to plans including drug benefits, long-term care coverage, and other benefits not available under Medicare. This happens because there is a consumer demand for these benefits, not because politicians support them. In the FEHBP, there is no comprehensive standardization of benefits. 
<p>
A related problem is that specifying a minimum package of benefits undermines the cost control objective of the reform proposal. If a MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plan were to offer such additional benefits, they could not be substituted for other benefits to keep the price down. Thus, beneficiaries normally would face higher premiums to get the benefits they really want. Furthermore, with the adoption of a standardized benefits package, Congress invites provider group pressures in future benefit setting. It can be expected that special interests will lobby Congress continually for additional mandated benefits and services, just as they do at the state level, where mandated benefits laws have driven up health care costs, and as they have throughout the history of Medicare. Members should recall their unpleasant experience with such lobbying practices the last time Congress reformed Medicare, during the adoption and later repeal of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988.7  As additional benefits and services were added to the original catastrophic package, the associated costs increased and required greater payments from beneficiaries. This is an inherently bad idea. <p><b>What Congress Should Do: </b><p>Instead of adopting a rigid framework, Congress should adopt the model of the FEHBP in which federal employees and retirees have access to a wide spectrum of benefits from health plans that are required only to offer catastrophic protection and meet certain solvency requirements and consumer protection standards.8  Seniors would be given real choices in deciding which optional benefits were necessary or desirable. Like federal employees, the plans would have to protect seniors against the cost of catastrophic accidents or illnesses, but otherwise could offer a range of benefits.<p><b>4. Both bills establish a defined contribution for Medicare beneficiaries. </b>
<p>
One of the key elements of reform, widely agreed upon by proponents of change in Medicare, is the defined contribution model. Regardless of the personal choice of a plan or option, Medicare benefits would be defined as a dollar amount, as opposed to today's open-ended entitlement to specified services. Both bills take the appropriate steps in determining how much of the federal budget will be allocated to the Medicare and MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice programs.
<p>
Under both bills the federal government would make monthly premium payments to the MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plan chosen by the beneficiary. The payments reflect a refinement of the current Medicare risk contract, which reimburses HMOs that provide Medicare services for a single monthly capitated rate per beneficiary.9  As opposed to the current government-regulated "fee for service" reimbursement system, which provides an open-ended subsidy, MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice would provide a defined contribution toward the purchase of a private plan in the beneficiary's geographic area. The contributions would vary among beneficiaries, depending on their age, gender, geographic area, welfare status, and other factors, to reflect the relative actuarial value of the benefits. To ensure stability in payments to MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plans, the federal government's contribution levels would be adjusted to recognize legitimate variations in costs of doing business in different geographic locations. In general, contribution levels in rural and low service utilization markets would increase at a faster rate than those in high service utilization areas. The federal government's contribution level would be kept within the budget targets as outlined in the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995.
<p>
To realize budget neutrality, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to compute per capita growth rates for a year so that the weighted average per capita growth rate for all areas in the country is equal to the national average per capita growth rate:
<p>
<b>1996</b><br>
House10 -- 5.3% 
<p>
Senate11 -- 8.7%
<p>
<b>1997</b><br>

House -- 3.8%
<p>
Senate -- 6.8%
<p>
<b>1998</b><br>		

House  -- 4.6%				
<p>
Senate -- 6.3%
<p>
<b>1999</b><br>		

House -- 4.3%				
<p>
Senate -- 6.3%
<p>
<b>2000</b>		
<br>
House -- 3.8%
<p>
Senate --  6.8%
<p>
<b>2001</b><br>	

House -- 5.5%				
<p>
Senate -- 6.9%
<p>
<b>2002</b><br>

House -- 5.6%
<p>
Senate -- 7.0%
<p>
Note:  The Senate bill includes no details on subsequent years. In the House bill, growth in each subsequent year is 5.0%
<p>
In both bills, the amount of assistance and rate of growth assigned to the defined contribution is a matter of explicit decision by political leaders. Beneficiaries who choose to be covered under MedicarePlus will know the amount of their benefit, and the federal government will know the amount of its obligation. Regardless of the type of health plan a beneficiary chooses under MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice, the government's contribution remains fixed.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
The defined contribution as drafted presents a step in the right direction of reducing the exploding rate of growth in Medicare but it does not go far enough and is not balanced. The bills apply the defined contribution requirement only to MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plans, unintentionally placing private-sector plans at a disadvantage when attempting to compete against traditional Medicare.
<p>
Maintaining an open-ended subsidy to all enrollees choosing traditional Medicare (unlimited 80 percent copayments after reaching a $100 per year deductible for Part B) and retaining a heavily subsidized Part B premium (68.5 percent from the government) effectively precludes a level playing field between MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice plans and the existing Medicare program. While private-sector providers are required to design their various health plans in accordance with the size of the defined contribution, traditional Medicare is under no such constraint. Thus, the current draft would lead to a distortion of both choice and market by favoring traditional Medicare over the private sector in this regard. 
<P>
The defined contribution should be applied universally so that a truly level playing field exists between traditional Medicare and MedicarePlus/Medicare Choice. Unfortunately, the fail-safe budget mechanism (price controls) created in the House version will force health care providers to be even more cost-conscious in providing services, which could lead eventually to rationing or a decline in participation by physicians in traditional Medicare. While the Senate attempted to create a similar mechanism -- budget expenditure limit tool (BELT) -- in its reform, it was stricken during floor debate as being extraneous under the Byrd Rule.
<p>
<b>5. Both bills continue to rely on price controls for traditional Medicare. </b>
<p>
Aside from the issue of fair competition between the federal government and the private sector, the lack of substantive changes in traditional Medicare means it is unlikely that the reforms as a whole will reach the targets required to help achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002. In that event, the House legislation would require Congress to trigger a last-resort fail-safe budget mechanism. (Depending on parliamentary procedures in the Senate, the equivalent procedure in the Senate version is called a budget expenditure limitation tool, or BELT.) This would automatically decrease the payments for items and services in the following sectors of traditional Medicare:12
<p><ul>
<li> Inpatient hospital services;
<p>
<li> Home health services;
<p>
<li> Extended care services;
<p>
<li> Hospice care;
<p>
<li> Physicians' services and other services of other health care professionals;
<p>
<li> Outpatient hospital services and ambulatory facility services;
<p>
<li> Durable medical equipment and supplies, including prosthetic devices and orthotics;
<p>
<li> Diagnostic tests; and
<p>
<li> Other items and services.
</ul><P>
Should Congress implement the fail-safe mechanism as a last resort, providers of health care to Medicare beneficiaries would see a reduction in the scheduled reimbursement rate for services -- in reality a tightening of existing price controls. But price controls in the past have failed to hold down Medicare costs, just as they have failed in other countries, leading to distortions, a decline in quality and availability of services, and widespread evasion.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
Rather than require tighter price controls in a futile attempt to hold down costs, Congress should develop a market-based look-back mechanism, perhaps modeled after the reimbursement schedules developed by International Paper Company for its employee health insurance plan. These specify payment rates based on average market prices in different geographic areas, and then readjust the reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers in those areas based on market performance.13  Even more important, International Paper's fixed reimbursement rate does not require the patient to pay a certain percentage of a physician's fee; instead, it allows the physician and patient to agree on a price, with the patient in effect receiving a voucher toward that fee (which may cover the full amount). Using this system, the company cut its costs 14.5 percent between 1991 and 1992. This equated to an average out-of-pocket savings of 5.7 percent per employee. International Paper, using the scheduled benefits plan, did not have increased medical costs in 1994 or 1995.14
<P>
<b>6. Both bills raise Part B premiums in proportion to benefit costs.</b>
<p>
The Medicare supplemental medical insurance (SMI) program, also known as Part B, is voluntary. All persons 65 or over may enroll by paying a monthly premium -- $46.10 per month as of January 1, 1995. This amount is equivalent to just 29 percent of the actual average cost of Part B coverage. The remaining 71 percent is paid for by taxpayers out of the general revenue fund. When Congress created Medicare, the cost of Part B was divided evenly between the beneficiary and taxpayers. The original intent was to create a subsidy for the nation's elderly, but at a significantly lower rate than is being provided today.
<p>
Since the early 1980s, however, Congress has taken the politically safe path of setting premiums at a level which covers only 25 percent of program costs. This modest amount covers 80 percent of allowable charges with a deductible of only $100 per year. 
<p>
Due to government miscalculations with respect to the cost of Part B, the 1995 premium paid by current beneficiaries is approximately 31.5 percent of program costs. Rather than allow it to fall back to 25 percent, which would mean actually cutting premiums, both bills would set the Part B premium permanently at 31.5 percent of costs beginning in 1996. But even this means a huge subsidy to seniors, regardless of income. And since this subsidy would continue in the traditional Part B program, private insurance alternatives in MedicarePlus would not be as attractive, even though their actual costs might be lower.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
Taxpayers should not be subsidizing 68.5 percent of Part B. To reduce that subsidy, Congress should consider one of two options:
<P>
	1) Raise the beneficiary premium to 50 percent of program costs, effective January 1, 1996.
<p><blockquote>
	Such a change could yield net savings of up to $205.3 billion over the next seven years. Raising this premium immediately to its original proportion of 50 percent is not a tax increase, because Part B is entirely voluntary and subsidized by the general taxpayer, not paid for out of payroll taxes. Reducing this taxpayer-provided subsidy to the level specified in the original contract between the federal government and the American taxpayers will effectively reduce future Medicare outlays.
</blockquote><p>
	2) Increase the beneficiary premium in increments of 5 percent each year until it reaches 50 percent of program costs and then freeze it at that level.
<p><blockquote>
	This more politically palatable option will not yield the same savings to taxpayers as the first option would in the first seven years. However, it will reduce outlays by $162.1 billion over this period. Each year thereafter, Medicare will realize significant savings while still providing a generous subsidy to enrollees. 
</blockquote><p>
<b>7. Both bills reduce the subsidy based on income.</b>
<p>
	Under current law, all beneficiaries who choose to enroll in Medicare Part B, regardless of income, pay the same premium and receive the same subsidy from the taxpayers. The House bill reduces the subsidy to individuals with incomes over $75,000 and couples with incomes over $125,000 per year, effective January 1, 1996. The federal subsidy would be eliminated gradually for individuals with incomes of $100,000 and couples with incomes of $175,000 per year, also effective January 1, 1996. While policy analysts disagree on the level of income at which the Part B subsidy should be phased out, most agree that the bill takes a positive step in the right direction in this regard.
<p>
The Senate bill adopts a similar approach by reducing the subsidy for single individuals with incomes over $50,000 and couples with incomes over $75,000. The federal subsidy would be phased down and eventually eliminated for singles whose incomes are $100,000 and couples with incomes above $150,000, effective January 1, 1996. 
<p>
Again, it must be emphasized that reducing taxpayer-subsidized services in a program that is entirely voluntary is not a tax increase. Medicare Part B costs are projected to increase at roughly 12 percent annually.15  Because Part B is subsidized so heavily by the general Treasury, all taxpayers end up paying for the ever-increasing federal share of this program. It is ironic that, in an age when the working poor cannot afford to purchase even a minimum package of health benefits, they are forced to subsidize individuals who enjoy significantly higher savings and assets.
<p>
<b>The Senate's Deductible Option.</b> While the House made improvements in Part B, it did not change the Part B deductible. The Part B deductible was set up to serve two purposes:  (1) to discourage unnecessary utilization of medical services and (2) to reduce the volume of small size claims, thereby producing not only savings in claim dollars, but also substantial savings in claim administration. It has to be set at an appropriate level to achieve these two purposes, but Congress has allowed it to fall sharply in real terms. From 1967 (the first full year of Part B experience) to 1996, typical service charges per enrollee will have increased more than 2,300 percent, while the deductible will have increased only 100 percent. For the deductible to keep up with per enrollee charges, it would have to be $1,203 in 1996.16
<p>
The Senate bill would automatically raise the Part B deductible to $150, effective January 1, 1996, and increase it in increments of $10 each January 1 thereafter, through 2002.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
The conference should adopt the Senate policy on the Part B deductible.
<p>
Of the two options to adjust the premium according to income, the lower Senate threshold is preferable. An alternative would be to combine the lower threshold with a new provision to allow the premiums for lower-income elderly to fall to 25 percent of costs or less. This would mean a larger subsidy for poorer Americans, but no subsidy for more affluent seniors.
<p>
<b>8. Both bills establish a new Medicare trust fund for Medicare savings. </b>
<p>
Liberals in Congress have charged that the Republican Medicare reform proposals are nothing more than devastating cuts to fund tax cuts for the rich. While the fact remains that most of the tax relief provided in the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995 goes to working families with children,17 House and Senate Republicans have included provisions in their respective Medicare reform proposals to ensure that there will be "[a] lock box mechanism that places all savings from Part B into a Medicare Preservation Trust Fund and prohibits any transfers to pay for future tax cuts."18
<p>
Savings from changes in Part B premiums thus will be used only to strengthen Medicare's financial status.19  Under both the House and Senate versions, the Secretary of the Treasury, who serves as managing Trustee of the Medicare Trust Funds, is directed to estimate the savings to the federal government resulting from changes in the Part B premium on a yearly basis. The savings yielded from this reform will then be transferred from the general revenue fund of the U.S. Treasury to the Federal Hospital Insurance (Part A) Trust Fund in the form of public-debt obligations issued exclusively to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Money from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund may be used only for Medicare expenditures.20 
<P>

<b>HOW CONGRESS CAN IMPROVE MEDICARE REFORM</b>
<p>
While the House and Senate bills significantly improve the existing Medicare program, there are several provisions which occur only in one of the bills. Other provisions should be strengthened, and still others should be changed or deleted.
<p>
<b>1. The Senate should consider carefully the House medical liability reform provisions.</b> Under current law, there are no uniform federal standards governing health care liability law. Unfortunately, the states generally have not introduced the reforms needed to curb unnecessary lawsuits and unreasonable damage awards. Thus, physicians often perform medically unnecessary and sometimes costly procedures to shield themselves from potential liability. The added costs of these procedures are paid for by the Medicare program and the private sector, as well as through higher premiums. The House bill would institute a number of crucial reforms in medical malpractice and health care liability law. The bill would apply certain limits on suits involving physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, and other providers. Specifically, the bill would:
<p><ul>
<li> Allow malpractice awards exceeding $50,000 to be paid in periodic increments;
<p>
<li> Limit noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases to $250,000;
<p>
<li> Make each defendant liable only for the amount of noneconomic loss and punitive damages allocated in direct proportion to such defendant's percentage of responsibility; and
<p>
<li> Grant punitive damages only if the plaintiff establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that the harm suffered was the result of conduct manifesting conscious, flagrant indifference to the health of the claimant or to the health of persons who might be harmed by the health care products. Punitive damages awarded would be determined by the court but could not exceed $250,000 or three times the amount of economic damages, whichever was greater.
</ul><P>
The Senate version does not contain malpractice provisions. 
<p>
While there are federalism concerns involved in any national legislation to reform malpractice, there is an urgent need to deal with the liability problem. The federal government funds approximately half the nation's health care expenditures through Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration programs, and medical malpractice and other liability costs, driven by pro-plaintiff state law, have contributed to the federal government's growing expenditures. 
<p>
The case can be made for the federal government, under the Commerce Clause, preempting state liability law in those areas of the health care system where there is substantial interstate business such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Even here, Congress should move cautiously. There is a far weaker case, however, for preempting state liability law affecting economic activity entirely within a state (such as most physical or hospital services). So the conferees should resist incorporating federal preemption in these areas of the health care system, and instead urge the states to reform their own laws.
<p>
<b>2. Both the Senate and the House need to allow direct billing for clinical laboratory services.</b> Medicare Part B covers diagnostic clinical laboratory services performed in independent clinical laboratories, hospital-based laboratories, and physician office laboratories. Under current law, the provider of the clinical laboratory test must bill Medicare, not the beneficiary. In turn, Medicare reimburses the provider for services on the basis of "area wide fee schedules" which are updated periodically to account for inflation.21  The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993) included provisions that would slow the rate of growth in Medicare expenditures by eliminating the inflation update for 1994 and 1995, in addition to a "phased down" reduction in the national ceiling on payment amounts for clinical laboratory services.22  OBRA 1993 set the national ceiling at 80 percent of the median of all fee schedules for the test, and 76 percent of the national median in 1996 and each year thereafter. Despite such measures, Medicare has achieved insignificant savings from the initial fee schedule rates originally established in 1986.
<p>
Medicare payment policy has rewarded inefficiency within the clinical laboratory industry. What is needed is a market-driven solution that will stimulate greater competition and substantially reduce the cost of laboratory services to all payers, public and private. The House and Senate bills both would reduce the Medicare fee schedule to 65 percent of the median, effective January 1, 1997. Reducing the national cap for each laboratory service to 65 percent of the national median fee during the base year for that service, and eliminating the CPI update factor through 2002, would effectively eliminate the cost shift to Medicare and force the clinical laboratory industry to compete on real costs. The savings to Medicare would be immediate, measurable, and significant. 
<p>
The House bill does contain one advantage over the Senate proposal with regard to laboratory fees. This deals with the issue of direct billing. In general, clinical laboratories market their services to physicians, offering the physician a wholesale price for testing. The physician then can pass on the price of the test to the patient. Combining direct billing with the right of a patient to select a laboratory would remove the physician as the determinant of which laboratory to use. The House legislation would require the clinical laboratory to bill the patient or the health plan designated by the patient.23 
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<P>
The conference should include the House policy. Adopting this policy would help reduce Medicare spending by creating greater competition and consumer choice.
<p>
One technical and procedural problem remains, however:  The current legislative language in the House bill contains technical problems that have prevented the Congressional Budget Office from "scoring" savings attributable to direct billing. Direct billing language appears to be used only as part of a separate fail-safe mechanism should Medicare not achieve its budgetary goals. The House bill can be corrected by linking the savings from direct billing to the overall fee schedule and CPI freeze contained in both the House and Senate versions. Applying the direct billing requirement to all services, both Medicare and non-Medicare, will end physicians' markups on tests they do not perform and lead to lower overall utilization and costs.
<p>
<b>3. Clarify the status and payment of skilled nursing facilities.</b> The Medicare SNF benefit covers post-hospital skilled nursing care in facilities certified to participate in the program. Currently, Medicare reimburses skilled nursing facilities on a per day basis for reasonable costs, subject to per diem cost limits. These limits are applied to per day routine service costs, which include nursing, room and board, administrative, and overhead expenses. Separate per diem limits are established for freestanding and hospital-based SNFs by urban or rural area. Freestanding skilled nursing facilities are set at 112 percent of the average per diem labor-related and non-labor-related costs. Hospital-based SNF limits are set at the limit for freestanding SNFs, plus 50 percent of the difference between the freestanding SNF limits and 112 percent of the average per diem routine service costs of hospital-based SNFs. 
<p>
Hospital-based and freestanding SNFs treat patients of similar acuity with almost identical outcomes. There is no difference in care. This finding is reported in a September 26, 1995, study by Abt Associates, Inc., using 1994-1995 data on over 20,000 rehabilitation patients.24  This report concludes that the current reimbursement differential between freestanding and hospital SNFs is a waste of Medicare funds. The current reimbursement system contains an incentive for hospital-based SNFs to admit a patient for full Medicare reimbursement and then transfer that same patient down to the SNF unit and receive full cost reimbursement for SNF care at a higher level than a freestanding SNF. Millions of Medicare patients require hospitalization each year for their particular ailments. However, it has become apparent that certain patients can be transferred to an SNF for subacute care with no detriment to the patient or sacrifice in quality of care.
<p>
Based on analysis of the cost of treating over 22,000 Medicare patients across the country representing across-the-board ailments (for example, stroke, orthopedic, heart failure, cancer, simple pneumonia), the Abt report concludes that the current Medicare program "could have saved an average of $455 for each day that subacute care at freestanding SNFs was substituted for hospital-based care. For Medicare to fully realize these savings, however, Medicare would need to first rebase the current hospital DRG payment system, dividing the DRG payment... between hospitals and SNFs based on the cost of providing care. In addition, Medicare would also need to eliminate the requirement that patients stay three or more days in a hospital before becoming eligible for Medicare coverage in a SNF."25 
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should eliminate the routine cost limits (RCL) differential between freestanding and hospital-based skilled nursing facilities.
<p>
Congress should examine the cost-effectiveness that SNFs are able to provide and bring into play true competition among providers in this field of care by placing all SNFs under the same routine cost limit reimbursement formula. Based upon Congressional Budget Office projections for SNF spending over the next seven years, Medicare would save approximately $4.1 billion during this period if the routine cost limitation for all SNFs was set at 112 percent of the mean.
<p>
<b>4. Eliminate House-passed premium caps.</b> While MedicarePlus permits market forces to compete against one another, thereby promoting greater value and efficiency, the modified Chairman's Mark in both the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Commerce Committee contains a provision that exacerbates the imbalance between MedicarePlus and traditional Medicare.
<p>
A new paragraph entitled "Relation of Premiums and Cost Sharing to Benefits" was added under Sec. 15002, MedicarePlus Program, as Sec. 1852(d)(5). The amendment would provide that in no case may the portion of a MedicarePlus organization's premium rate and the actuarial value of its deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments attributable to the minimum benefits exceed the actuarial value of the coinsurance and deductible applicable in the non-MedicarePlus option. Though price controls have been a failure within the current Medicare program, the House bill now proposes premium price controls for all private-sector plans. This provision would undercut the ability of private plans to compete with traditional Medicare. The danger is that few private plans will opt to participate in the new program if there are premium price controls. This could lead to a possible oligopoly in areas where well-financed insurance companies with high enrollment can take the financial risks inherent in a distorted health market. What is likely if the controls are included in the final legislation, particularly in underserved rural areas, is that virtually no private plans will be offered. Moreover, since MedicarePlus plans are required to offer the current Medicare Parts A and B package as a minimum benefits package, the ability to provide additional benefits within the limits on the rate of increase in capitation payments is hampered. The opportunity to provide greater value, choices, and efficiency would be severely reduced, since MedicarePlus plans opting to participate could be expected to offer limited options and seek out lower-cost providers.
<p>
Even if one accepts the notion that price controls are not harmful, they are not necessary in the bill because seniors are under no obligation to choose private plans. If a plan raises its prices, it must persuade customers that the extra cost is justified by extra value.
<p>
Under the House provision, it is the elderly and disabled who will be adversely affected, since lower-cost providers are not necessarily the more efficient or better quality providers. Plans will be effectively barred from offering superior services at a reasonable additional cost.
<p>
Thus, while the House bill is an attempt to provide the elderly with more choices and options in health plans through the private sector on the one hand, it simultaneously restricts private plans' ability to provide such services by imposing strict pricing caps and regulatory benefits requirements. By not allowing participating MedicarePlus plans to charge market-based premiums, it will severely limit beneficiaries' options in private health plans and prevent them from taking advantage of the wide range of health care delivery services available in a free and open private market.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
The Senate bill wisely refrains from creating further distortions in the health market by allowing Medicare Choice plans to determine their premium prices and letting patients, not government, decide whether the higher-priced plans are good value. For Members of Congress serious about promoting rather than restraining market forces, the Senate policy is superior. 
<p>
<b>5. Both bills should allow patients to contract privately with doctors, hospitals, and other medical providers.</b> Noticeably absent from the House and Senate bills is an explicit provision to guarantee the right of every Medicare beneficiary to purchase health care services on a private basis. Under such an arrangement, also referred to as private contract, a Medicare beneficiary could receive a specified medical service for an agreed upon fee -- or in some cases, for no fee at all, since Medicare regulators at the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) have threatened to impose $2,000 fines on providers who fail to charge any patient the Medicare Part B $100 deductible.26  In private contracting arrangements, no Medicare reimbursement claims would be filed because no Medicare reimbursement claims would be sought by either provider or patient. This would occur at no cost to insurance companies or federal taxpayers.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
Congress should permit direct, private contracting among Medicare patients. While the House bill (like an earlier version of the Senate bill) allows for privately contracted services to enrollees in the Medical Savings Account option, Congress should allow all beneficiaries, regardless of the option they choose (traditional Medicare or MedicarePlus), to contract privately for health services. Many elderly and disabled persons, for varying reasons, have expressed to their physicians a desire to keep Medicare completely out of the picture. Sec. 1848(g)(4)(A)(i) of the Social Security Act requires health care providers to "[c]omplete and submit a claim for such service on a standard claim form specified by the Secretary to the carrier on behalf of a beneficiary."27  However, the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for implementing and enforcing this statute, has been inconsistent in this matter. In <i>Stewart v. Sullivan</i>, 816 F. Supp. 281 (1992), federal judge Nicholas Politan ruled that the Secretary of Health and Human Services had not articulated a clear policy against private contracting. Given the discrepancy between statutory law and existing case law, physicians are still uncertain as to which law prevails and fearful of possible reprisals from HCFA through the threat of sanctions. 
<P>
Congress should end this confusion by supporting the principle of private contract. Any reform legislation should ensure that beneficiaries are not forced or required to receive their health care solely through Medicare and not prohibited from paying a provider on any basis as agreed to between the individual and the provider.
<p>
<b>6. Make sure that the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration remains subject to Senate Confirmation.</b> The House bill contains a surprising provision that would eliminate the requirement that the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, who is responsible for managing the huge Medicare Trust Funds, be subject to confirmation by the United States Senate.28
<p>
The Administrator of HCFA is an extremely important and senior official. The Administrator, among other things, is a member of the Medicare Board of Trustees with responsibility for administering an insurance system that covers close to 38 million Americans, and should be held to a higher level of accountability than a mere political appointee of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The attachment of the Administrator's signature to the Hospital Insurance and Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund Reports signifies an extraordinary degree of public accountability.
<p>
The Administrator of HCFA also is charged with overseeing both the Medicare and Medicaid programs and heads an agency that will have over 4,000 full-time employees and a budget of almost $250 billion this year. An official with these heavy responsibilities should be held accountable to the public through Senate confirmation.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
Congress should retain Senate confirmation of the Administrator of HCFA and not allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to appoint any individual to this powerful and influential position. 
<p>

<b>MAJOR PROBLEMS REMAINING IN MEDICARE REFORM </b>
<p>
<b>The Need for Medical Savings Accounts</b>
<p>
During the floor debate on the Senate bill, the provision that created Medical Savings Accounts within Medicare was eliminated. A point of order against the provision was upheld on the grounds that it was extraneous and a violation of Sec. 313(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the so-called Byrd Rule. The main explanation for the point of order was the alleged potential of MSAs to increase the deficit by $3.5 billion over the next seven years.
<p>
The House bill authorizes a beneficiary who chooses MedicarePlus to purchase a high-deductible insurance plan with an MSA. For individuals who choose the MSA option, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would make a defined contribution to the MedicarePlus MSA chosen by the beneficiary. Only contributions by the Secretary of HHS could be made to a MedicarePlus MSA, and such contributions would not be taxable income. The high-deductible policy would provide reimbursement for Medicare beneficiaries only after annual expenses equal to a deductible not to exceed $10,000. Interest earned on amounts held in the MedicarePlus MSA also would not be subject to income tax.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Conferees should redraft the MSA provision so that it does not conflict with the Byrd Rule. Medicare MSAs give the elderly who choose them complete control over most health care decisions and the flexibility to choose their own providers. Furthermore, they provide the security of catastrophic coverage, an element that is noticeably absent from the current Medicare program. Once an individual has reached his or her deductible level, the private plan, not the federal taxpayer, will cover all additional medical expenses.
<p>
<b>The Need for Baby Boomer Guarantees</b>
<p>
Baby Boomers must be assured that their payroll tax contribution will not be forfeited if Medicare ever defaults. The House and Senate Medicare reform legislation only partly addresses the troubled status of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund. As Chart 1 indicates, the HI Trust Fund begins to pay out more money than it brings in (a negative cash flow) in 1996. Absent corrective legislative action, the Medicare Trustees say that assets will be depleted within the next 6 to 11 years.29 
<p>
In highlighting the critical need for the House and Senate to take corrective action, the Medicare Trustees state:  "The fact that exhaustion would occur under a broad range of future economic conditions, and is expected to occur in the relatively near future, indicates the urgency of addressing the HI trust fund's financial imbalance."30
<p>
The Medicare provisions of the reconciliation bill would address this near-term financial problem, extending the solvency of the HI trust fund through 2010. The White House proposal, like plans advanced by congressional Democrats, would not even keep the hospital program solvent beyond 2006. In other words, neither the reconciliation proposal nor the other proposals would guarantee members of the Baby Boomer generation (Americans born between 1945 and 1957) the current Medicare system when they are eligible to retire, starting in the years 2010 through 2022. 
<p>
The House bill does include a provision which creates a Commission on the Effect of the Baby Boom Generation on the Medicare Program. This commission is charged with reporting to Congress no later than May 1, 1997, its findings and recommendations on how to preserve Medicare in a financially solvent manner until 2030. The report is to include detailed recommendations for appropriate legislative initiatives specifying how this objective is to be accomplished.31
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do: </b>
<p>
Congress should incorporate a provision in Medicare reform legislation to guarantee Americans born after 1945 that their contributions toward the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be paid back to them upon retirement if benefits are no longer available to them under Medicare. 
<p>
As mentioned earlier, both the House and Senate reform proposals create a "lock box" trust fund which requires that Medicare savings be applied to the HI program. Since there is no certainty as to the longevity of this trust fund, Congress should make a commitment to the Baby Boomer generation that their mandatory contributions to the HI program will be paid back in kind. This can be accomplished through a provision that allows for a future tax reduction for individuals born between 1945 and 1962. If future income tax payments are pro-rated to reflect an individual's investment in the HI trust fund over the course of his working years, these working Americans will not be penalized should the commission fail to develop a concrete proposal ensuring the financial integrity of the HI trust fund.
<p>
<b>The Need for Provider-Sponsored Networks</b>
<p>
In trying to transform the current Medicare program into an open competitive system, both the House and Senate reform measures include provisions which create provider service networks/provider-sponsored networks (PSNs) in the MedicarePlus or Medicare Choice plans. In other words, both bills would enable doctors and hospitals in local areas to market health plans, giving the elderly yet another range of options from which to can choose.
<p>
Doctors and hospitals in local areas often may be better able than insurance companies to meet these needs, especially in many rural areas where managed care entities have found it difficult to create a network. By allowing doctors to form their own network, Congress would be giving the elderly a chance to buy health insurance coverage sponsored by a trusted physician in the community.
<p>
As passed by the House, PSNs would be regulated at the federal level. The Senate bill places regulation of PSNs at the state level while at the same time demonstrating an awareness of the current problem of overregulation of insurance at the state level, including mandated benefits and other restrictions incompatible with market-based reform. Under the Senate bill, therefore, a state has 90 days from the date of application from doctors and hospitals to issue a license. In the event the state fails to issue a license, the legislation creates an alternate avenue for certification via the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This provision ensures that states are the regulators of first resort. Absent a fair and impartial judgment by a state regulator, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to grant temporary relief to provider-sponsored networks by issuing a federal license for no longer than 36 months. The PSN is still under an obligation to obtain state certification. 
<p>
Over time, as PSNs become established, price and quality sensitive consumers will be able to make wise and informed decisions, comparing PSNs to all other options in the Medicares new consumer choice program. Moreover, the Senate bill, unlike the House version, recognizes that the federal licensure process should be applied only as a temporary measure to reflect necessary transition to a new competitive system. Thus, this alternative federal licensing program would expire on December 31, 2000.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
As a matter of public policy, the Senate position on allowing PSNs is superior to the policy in the House bill. On the other hand, Congress should adopt the House anti-trust policy that allows for creation of such provider-sponsored networks.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
This Congress deserves enormous credit for its courage in tackling the tough and politically sensitive Medicare program. Typically, as with all those who try to deal with programs serving the elderly, Members seeking to save the Medicare program are being accused of wrecking it.
<p>
Medicare is in financial crisis. While liberals in Congress insist that the program remain unchanged -- with its cumbersome bureaucracy, heavy regulation, price controls, and runaway costs -- others should not hesitate to seize this historic opportunity to reform the program and give America's elderly more control over the ownership and selection of health care benefits. The House and Senate bills have many deficiencies. But by introducing consumer choice and competition, this Congress can take a giant step toward assuring that Medicare will still be available, at reasonable cost, to future generations.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Medicare is going broke. The huge national health insurance program that covers over 38 million elderly and disabled Americans will be insolvent by 2002, according to the 1995 report of the Medicare Board of Trustees, a seven-member federal body that includes three Clinton Administration Cabinet secretaries. Not only does hospitalization insurance (HI, or Part A) face bankruptcy,<sup>1</sup> but the cost of supplemental medical insurance (SMI, or Part B), which covers doctors' fees and other services, is exploding. And while recent surveys show that most elderly Americans believe they already have paid for their health benefits,<sup>2</sup> the truth is that the system is subsidized heavily by the taxpayers. Without significant program changes, the taxes working families will have to pay in coming years -- just to sustain Medicare benefits at current levels -- will be enormous.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Members of Congress realize increasingly that quick fixes, including price controls and cost shifting, no longer work. Serious policymakers also realize that Medicare's mounting problems are fundamental and structural. Even Medicare's trustees recognize that the "program is clearly unsustainable in its present form."<sup>4</sup>  The majority in Congress is searching for ways to preserve health insurance benefits for the elderly by changing Medicare from a highly bureaucratic government program to a dynamic system based on the market principles of consumer choice and competition. One prominent model recommended by Heritage Foundation analysts is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the 35-year-old system that serves 1.6 million retired Members of Congress and federal workers.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>A Single-Payer System.</b> Medicare is America's first major experiment with single-payer, government-run health insurance. Created in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson's so-called Great Society -- in essence, a major expansion of domestic social programs -- Medicare emerged as a compromise among Members of Congress who wanted to establish full-scale national health insurance. Thus, from its inception, the system assumed the need for central planning.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to its authors in Congress, Medicare also was designed to be "fiscally responsible," so Members of Congress and government actuaries attempted to project both costs and revenues well into the future. This was especially true of Part A, the hospitalization program. In 1965, the House Ways and Means Committee reported that "Congress has very carefully considered the cost aspects of the proposed hospital insurance system [and] very strongly believes that the financing basis of the new hospital insurance program should be developed on a conservative basis."  Initial cost projections proved to be wildly wrong. For example, federal actuaries projected that a hospital stay would cost $155 per day in 1985 and that Part A costs would reach $9 billion by 1990. Instead, the costs of a hospital stay reached $600 per day in 1985, and Part A costs reached $63 billion in 1990.<sup>6</sup> Given the heavily subsidized structure of the Medicare system, it is unlikely that any government planner could have projected the explosion in costs that has characterized the part of Medicare that reimburses physicians (supplemental medical insurance, or Part B).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, changing demographics guarantee enormous future tax burdens on working families. In 1965, there were almost six workers for every retiree. Today, there are only four workers for every retiree, and by 2030, when the nation's 77 million "baby boomers" are well into their retirement, there will be only two. The Washington-based Committee for Economic Development warns that payroll taxes just to finance Medicare and Social Security could consume up to 28 percent of a worker's paycheck by that time.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Planning and Price Controls.</b> Federal officials have had even less success in controlling the true costs of the Medicare program. Instead of relying upon competition and consumer choice to control costs, Congress has relied on a complex array of price controls. Since the inception of the program, Congress has adopted 75 options to cut reimbursement to doctors alone. This system of controls has ranged from simple freezes on physician reimbursement to increasingly complex formulas governing hospital reimbursements. In theory, Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) officials are trying to find the right price for thousands of different medical procedures and treatments, or specialists and other providers. In practice, this invariably means that Medicare pays doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers either too much or too little. Such a system encourages doctors, hospitals, and other providers to attempt to "game" the elaborate fee schedule and price control systems by such things as picking a diagnosis that will maximize their payments. This helps explain why it also has proven largely ineffective in controlling overall program costs. At the same time, like all price control systems, it has proven very effective in shifting rising costs to the less-regulated private health insurance system serving workers and their families.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Taxpayers should not be surprised that Medicare cannot control costs, since all of the system's incentives are designed to drive up costs. Congress created Medicare as a generous new entitlement to health care services without sufficient incentives to offset the new demand:
<blockquote>
	The planners seemed to have overlooked the fact that if you shift the demand curve outward without moving the supply curve, prices will go up. The original 1965 cost projections allowed for a 10 percent increase in hospital admission rates among the elderly, but in fact hospital admission rates among the Medicare eligible rose immediately by 25 percent, the rates for surgical procedures by 40 percent, and the number of hospital days by 50 percent.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under current law, expenses for supplemental medical insurance (Part B) are projected to double by the year 2002. Like Part A, this will mean a bigger tax burden for working families. In establishing the financing arrangements for Part B, Congress deliberately undermined its original copayment requirements, making sure that the taxpayers would subsidize 75 percent of the premium rather than the 50 percent agreed to in the original legislation. Moreover, Congress has held deductible and coinsurance requirements at artificially low levels.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today, the deductible for Part B services is only $100. This figure not only has nothing to do with economic reality, but also is an incentive to increase demands on the system. The major reasons for the explosion in Medicare costs -- far beyond the federal government's own cost projections -- are rising demand and the increase in the volume and intensity of medical services.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Bureaucracy and Red Tape.</b> While Medicare relies on central planning and price controls to project and control costs, it also must rely upon a huge and elaborate system of federal regulation. Thousands of pages of federal rules, regulations, and guidelines, as well as a huge and growing body of case law, now govern the behavior of doctors, hospitals, and patients. To administer this complex system of planning, Congress in 1977 created the HCFA, an agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). With over 4,000 employees, HCFA is responsible for managing the giant health care trust funds and the Medicaid program, in addition to:  1) writing rules and regulations for the system; 2) contracting with private insurance companies in the states and regions to serve Medicare beneficiaries; 3) improving the productivity of Medicare contractors; 4) overseeing the surveys and certification of doctors, hospitals, and other medical providers; 5) enforcing standards of eligibility for providers and care for patients; 6) determining what medical services to the elderly will or will not be reimbursed; 7) deciding whether or not Medicare beneficiaries will have access to new treatments or procedures; 8) combating the admittedly rampant waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare system; 9) collecting reams of data on doctors and patients; and (10) conducting research, demonstrations, and evaluations. In other words, virtually no aspect of the financing and delivery of medical services to the elderly is free of HCFA's interference.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Government-Standardized Benefits.</b> Medicare's standardized health care benefits are set by law and government regulation. Either Congress or the Health Care Financing Administration must decide whether a new benefit, treatment, medical procedure, or technology will be included in the Medicare package for reimbursement. Since the program's inception, Congress has taken approximately 70 actions to increase or modify benefits. Unfortunately for the elderly, this is a highly politicized process. The addition or subtraction of a benefit, procedure, or medical device invariably is a political event. Perhaps the most notorious example of this politicization was the celebrated debate over the addition, and then the repeal, of the Medicare Catastrophic Benefit in 1988 and 1989.<sup>10</sup> That disaster proved that both Congress and HCFA are subjected to intense lobbying by doctors, hospital groups, special interests, or medical specialty societies. As Jeremy Rosner, formerly of the Progressive Policy Institute and now an official in the Clinton Administration, has written, "The history of Medicare is replete with cases of organized groups acting through Congress to add coverage for specific illnesses or procedures, or to affect changes in specific prices."<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Cumbersome Process.</b> The congressional process for deciding whether a particular health insurance benefit should be available to the elderly and disabled is inherently cumbersome. First come committee hearings, followed by mark-up and reporting of bills to add or subtract benefits, and then House and Senate floor consideration and amendment of these measures. This process is followed by a House-Senate conference to resolve any differences and then, finally, by another vote by both chambers on a final package. HCFA's decision-making process, with its notice of proposed rule making, internal deliberations, and public comment on items published in the Federal Register, is deeply flawed. With its size and complexity, the federal regulatory regime inherently resists change, flexibility, and innovation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>A New Model.</b> If Members of Congress want to retain the single-payer, government-run structure of the Medicare program, they must resort to much higher taxes or to even more draconian price controls on doctors and hospitals, including a direct limitation of available services that resembles limitations found in the British National Health Service. For example, while coverage for end-stage renal dialysis is an entitlement in Medicare, it is not available to elderly citizens in the British national health system. For the British government, this is a clear public policy choice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The private, employer-based health insurance market is not a model of free-market efficiency. It is plagued by distortions born of the perverse tax treatment of employment-based insurance, which drives up health care costs and contributes directly to rising insurance rates.<sup>12</sup> But even this distorted market, encumbered by a restrictive tax policy, is capable of a level of experimentation and innovation that is virtually unimaginable in the Medicare system. The rapid change and flexibility in the private health insurance market, including the experimentation with managed care plans, is nowhere to be seen in the Medicare system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If private employer-based insurance is not the best model for Medicare reform, Members of Congress should examine their own system, the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Long proposed by Heritage Foundation scholars as a model for reform, the FEHBP is also the model now proposed by the American Medical Association.<sup>13</sup> To an increasingly broad range of policy analysts, including those associated with the Progressive Policy Institute, think tank of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council,<sup>14</sup> the FEHBP has a number of advantages. Congressional and federal retirees and their dependents do not have a government-standardized benefits package imposed on them, but can choose from a wide variety of health care plans and options. Unlike most Medicare enrollees, they do not have to buy supplemental packages like Medi-gap coverage, extra insurance plans that cover services that Medicare cannot or will not provide. More important, they can pocket the savings resulting from their choices, a fact that gives them incentive to choose their medical coverage wisely. In Medicare, there are no meaningful choices. The imposing bureaucratic structure and deep regulatory reach of the Medicare program are nothing like the relative openness and flexibility of the FEHBP system. Unlike Medicare, the FEHBP is administered by 164 staffers at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). It is highly flexible and is governed by less than 100 pages of federal regulations. In terms of economic efficiency, Medicare's bureaucratic and highly centralized system cannot compete with the FEHBP's market-based system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Cost Controls.</b> The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program has a much broader range of choice; better packages of benefits, including catastrophic coverage and prescription drugs; and a superior record in controlling health care costs.<sup>15</sup> While Medicare costs have been rising almost 11 percent per year, overall private-sector costs rose just 4.4 percent this year and FEHBP premium costs actually declined by 3.3 percent. And according to OPM, the average premium cost will rise only four tenths of one percent in 1996.<sup>16</sup> If Members of Congress wish to reform Medicare so that the security of America's elderly can be assured and the taxpayers' money can be used as efficiently and productively as possible, they must act now to harness the market forces of consumer choice and competition.
<p>
<b>HOW MEDICARE IS FINANCED</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Medicare trustees admit that the Hospital Insurance (Part A) Trust Fund will be insolvent by the year 2002. But "The roots of Medicare's crisis... go back to its creation in the 1960s as an open-ended federal entitlement. With Uncle Sam paying all bills, the private market in medical care for the elderly was destroyed. Patients and providers have had no incentive to restrain their use of care, and... costs to the taxpayer have risen relentlessly."<sup>17</sup>  The reasons for this looming fiscal crisis include congressional mandates expanding covered benefits without providing offsetting changes in copayments or coinsurance, medical inflation, longer life expectancies, and the continually increasing use of medical services by a rapidly aging population.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Medicare provides payments for inpatient hospital care, some inpatient care in a skilled nursing facility, home health care, hospice care, physician and supplier services, and outpatient services. The program is divided into two parts. Part A finances the hospital insurance (HI) portion, and Part B finances the supplemental medical insurance (SMI) portion which covers physicians' fees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Part A:</b>  Generally, Part A of Medicare provides premium-free coverage for part of the costs associated with certain hospital stays and limited follow-up services. Part A is financed through mandatory payroll taxes levied on employees and employers and paid into a so-called trust fund. When Medicare was enacted, federal actuaries estimated future expenditures for Part A so that a payroll tax could be established based on potential costs. But the government's estimates fell far short of the actual costs of running this portion of the Medicare program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Before January 1, 1994, the HI tax rates of 1.45 percent on employees, 1.45 percent on employers, and 2.9 percent on the self-employed were applied on earnings of up to $135,000. As part of President Clinton's effort to reduce the deficit, the Administration proposed that all earnings be subject to the HI tax beginning on January 1, 1994. This tax increase was approved by Congress in 1993 and signed into law on August 19, 1993, as part of the Clinton Administration's Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66). Since the HI tax took effect in 1966, the maximum taxable income level has been increased on 23 separate occasions.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Contrary to widespread belief, HI revenues and expenditures do not go into a real trust fund. As a matter of fact, no real trust fund exists.<sup>19</sup> According to the annual reports issued by the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Program, the federal government has never saved the tax revenues needed to cover the future health care needs of employees. The reason:  Medicare began paying out HI benefits at the same time it began collecting taxes.<sup>20</sup> Retirees in 1965 were collecting Medicare benefits without having paid into the system. As a result, younger workers on average are contributing more to the Social Security and HI fund each year as their earnings increase, but these contributions are not being saved. The trust fund is a myth. The funds are being transferred and spent almost immediately on the current Medicare population.<sup>21</sup> Despite the constant transfer of revenues, therefore, the future outlook for the program is grim.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HI taxes go toward the general federal revenue pool. When the government receives new revenues, it posts new interest-bearing federal securities to the HI fund; when it spends monies on HI, it writes off some of these securities. In other words, these securities are not assets, but future obligations the government has issued to itself. As long as the HI trust fund maintains a balance, the U.S. Treasury is authorized to make HI payments for it. The higher limit on earnings subject to the HI tax proposed by the Clinton Administration was designed to reduce the deficit, not the HI trust fund.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>A Graying America.</b> According to the Trustees' Report, long-range HI projections show that Medicare's hospital costs will rise at a much higher rate than inflation.<sup>22</sup> Compounding this troubling statistic is the near-term issue of insolvency confronting the HI trust fund. The trustees examine the solvency of the HI trust fund under three alternative sets of assumptions:  low-cost, intermediate, and high-cost. For purposes of illustration, consider the intermediate set of assumptions as the most reasonable. These assumptions reflect the trustees' best estimate of the expected future economic and demographic trends that will affect the financial status of the program. Under them, the present financing structure for the HI program is sufficient to ensure the payment of benefits only over the next seven years:  "As a result, the HI trust fund does not meet the trustees' short range test of financial adequacy."<sup>23</sup>  Thus, structural reforms will have to be made in the immediate future because the demographics supporting the existing HI program will shift radically downward. Currently, the approximate ratio of workers to people 65 or over is 4:1. This ratio is projected to decrease to 2.4:1 in 2035.<sup>24</sup> In short, the only way to sustain the solvency of the HI trust fund is to increase the HI tax rate (currently set at 2.9 percent) or significantly reduce benefits and payments. Not only are the anticipated reserves and financing of the HI program inadequate to offset this demographic change, report the trustees, but under all the sets of assumptions, the trust fund will become exhausted even before the major demographic shift begins to occur.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
Q:  When will the HI trust fund go bankrupt?
<p>
A:  According to the trustees, it starts going broke in 1996 and is bankrupt by 2002.
<p>
Q:  So the HI trust fund will go broke even before the retirement of the nation's 77 million baby boomers?
<p>
A:  Correct. "Under all the sets of assumptions," say the trustees, "the trust fund is projected to become exhausted even before the major demographic shift begins."<sup>26</sup>  If nothing is done, the situation simply will go from bad to catastrophic.
<p>
Q:  Is the Clinton Administration proposing measures to insure the solvency of the HI trust fund?
<p>
A:  The Clinton Administration recently proposed to reduce Medicare spending by a claimed $128 billion over a period of seven years. According to the Administration, however, Medicare reform must take place within the context of "overall health care reform"<sup>27</sup> broadly similar to the Clinton plan that Congress rejected last year.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
Q:  Isn't Clinton's $128 billion savings plan far less draconian than the $270 billion reduction proposed by the majority in Congress?
<p>
A:  Not really. If you use the same nonpartisan CBO baseline rather than the White House baseline, the Administration actually is calling for $192 billion in savings, not $128 billion; this is a difference of just $78 billion over a period of 7 years.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
Q:  Isn't it true that taxes paid by beneficiaries during their working years cover the cost of the hospital insurance portion of Medicare?
<p>
A:  No. Many elderly Americans think they are only getting back what they paid into the system, but seniors are getting much more than they contributed, if they contributed at all. The Medicare health benefit package offered tomorrow will be more valuable than the one granted today, which is much more valuable than the one offered yesterday.<sup>30</sup> Benefits are generous and have risen consistently over time. The average benefit (Parts A and B) per enrollee is expected to be worth approximately $4,800 in 1995. According to the HCFA, spending is expected to continue rising at such a rapid pace that the total expected value of Medicare benefits for a couple retiring at age 65 in 1995 is over $185,000.<sup>31</sup> As the following table indicates, the benefits received over a beneficiary's lifetime are far greater than his contributions to the system.
<p>
Q:  If HI trust funds are depleted, won't HCFA officials pay Medicare hospital bills anyway?
<p>
A:  No. "Under present law," according to the trustees, "there is no authority to pay hospital insurance benefits if the assets of the HI trust fund are depleted."<sup>32</sup>
<p>
Q:  Can't HCFA just borrow the money?
<p>
A:  Under current law, no.
<p>
Q:  Do the Medicare trust funds operate like a private pension trust fund?
<p>
A:  No. Medicare is a pay-as-you-go system. Coverage and services come from revenues raised through direct payroll taxes or otherwise taken from general revenues. What an individual pays into Medicare bears no relation to what he receives from it.
<p>
Q:  Medicare's trustees say the HI trust fund will go bankrupt in just seven years. Why hasn't Congress heard of this problem before now?
<p>
A:  It has. The trustees have been warning Congress for years that the HI trust fund would be exhausted shortly after the end of the century. During both the Reagan and Bush Administrations, Congress was told that corrective action was vital to avoid the onset of serious and devastating adjustments in the Medicare program, and President Clinton himself published an account of the seriousness of the matter well before he took office.
<p>
Q:  So Congress has failed to heed the trustees' warnings?
<p>
A:  Unfortunately, yes, and these attitudes persist. For example, Representative Sam Gibbons (D-FL), former Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare, says the insolvency issue is exaggerated:  "I've read these trustees' reports for years. They're all pessimistic. I don't panic over the insolvency question."<sup>33</sup>
<p>
Q:  What are the short-term cash flow projections for the HI trust fund?
<p>
A:  According to the Trustees' Report, the positive cash flow is expected to be $3.4 billion in 1995. It becomes a negative flow in 1996. According to Robert Helms, former Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at HHS and currently resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, "The situation is expected to get progressively worse -- annual losses are estimated to be $26 billion in the year 2000 and $65 billion in the year 2004."<sup>34</sup>
<p>
Q:  What burdens will Americans have to assume to keep the HI program afloat?
<p>
A:  Big tax burdens for working Americans or big benefits cuts for the elderly. According to former HCFA Chief Actuary Guy King, "Just to keep the income and outlays in balance over the next twenty-five years (that is, before the baby boomers have all retired) will require either a 30 percent reduction in expenditures or a 44 percent increase in the HI tax."<sup>35</sup>
<p>
Q:  What would this mean for ordinary families?
<p>
A:  It depends. The Medicare trustees have outlined three tax increase scenarios. As a short-term, 25-year solution to the trust fund crisis, Congress could adopt a 1.3 percent tax increase. This would mean an extra $585 per year in taxes for a person making $45,000 per year. To put the trust fund on a permanently sound basis would require an additional 3.52 percent tax increase, or $1,584 for a person making $45,000 per year. If the trust fund went broke, the tax increase required would be an additional 3.9 percent, or $1,760 for anyone making $45,000 per year.<sup>36</sup>
<p>

<b>Part B:</b>  Part B is voluntary. All persons 65 or over may enroll in the supplemental medical insurance (SMI) program by paying a monthly premium -- as of January 1, 1995, $46.10 per month. This contribution level constitutes a mere 29 percent of the actual cost of the Part B premium; the remaining 71 percent is paid by taxpayers. Part B provides coverage for physician, laboratory, outpatient hospital, and other medical services. It pays 80 percent of the allowed charge as determined by the federal government (after the annual $100 deductible is met), and beneficiaries are responsible for the remaining 20 percent coinsurance required by law.
<p>
	Congress established Part B to create a subsidy for the nation's elderly, but at a significantly lower rate than is currently being provided. Until 1973, SMI premiums were set by law to finance one-half the benefit and administrative costs, in addition to a small contingency amount to go into a separate trust fund. When costs began to increase faster than inflation, Congress decided to limit the percentage increase in the premium to the same percentage as Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. Under this new formula, revenues from Part B premiums decreased from 50 percent to 25 percent of expenditures. This is because Part B costs, much like Part A costs, increased at a much faster rate than inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Beginning in the early 1980s, Congress has taken the politically safe path of voting to set enrollees' Part B premiums at a level which would cover only 25 percent of program costs. Thus, enrollees in 1995 pay only $46.10 per month for insurance that covers 80 percent of allowable charges with a deductible of only $100. The illusion that their Medicare benefits package is inexpensive explains why the elderly have little incentive to control costs -- and why working families must pay even larger shares of the Part B cost out of general revenues.
<p>
Q:  How has the SMI trust fund grown?
<p>
A. Total receipts of the SMI trust fund grew from $324 million in 1966 to $58 billion in 1993. Expenditures for medical benefits were $56 billion in 1993.<sup>37</sup>
<p>
Q:  What will Medicare enrollees pay for SMI (Part B) services next year?
<p>
A:  Beneficiaries will pay just 25 percent of program costs. Under current law, that means enrollees will be paying $43.70 per month in 1996. The premium will rise to $60.80 per month by the year 2002 and $113.90 per month in the year 2005.
<p>
Q:  Has this 25 percent cost-sharing rule always been the case?
<p>
A:  No. The premium for Part B was designed to cover 50 percent of the program's cost. In 1972, Congress limited the annual premium increase to the percentage increase in the Social Security COLA. As a result, the beneficiaries' share of the premium cost fell, reaching a low point of 24 percent in 1981. In 1984, Congress set the premium for beneficiaries to cover 25 percent of the program's cost. In 1990, Congress reinstituted the linkage between the Part B premium increase and the Social Security COLA. Unless Congress changes this, premiums actually will fall next year, even though the program's costs will rise.
<p>
Q:  Is the SMI trust fund financially sound?
<p>
A:  Yes. Because it is funded mostly by general revenues, the taxpayers are forced to subsidize the program, thereby ensuring the trust fund's solvency.
<p>
Q:  So the SMI program is in good shape?
<p>
A:  Not from the standpoint of taxpayers. The problem with the SMI trust fund has been the program's explosive growth, which dwarfs both the rise in medical inflation and the growth in the economy. According to the Medicare trustees, "Growth rates have been so rapid that outlays of the program have increased 53 percent in the aggregate and 40 percent per enrollee in the past five years."<sup>38</sup>
<p>
Q:  How will this affect the rest of the national economy?
<p>
A:  According to Guy King, the SMI trust fund will grow from 0.99 percent of GDP in 1995 to 3.18 percent of GDP in 2025, rising to 3.97 percent of GDP by "the middle of the next century."<sup>39</sup>  While Medicare Part B does require a modest premium, it is now an income transfer program, taxing away income from the working segment of the population and redirecting it to the retired segment without regard to retirees' income.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
Q:  Why can't Congress just freeze or reduce payments to Medicare providers, doctors as well as hospitals?
<p>
A:  That's precisely what Congress has done since the inception of the program. But price controls do not work. Since 1966, Congress has imposed 75 different actions to cut Medicare payments to doctors alone.<sup>41</sup> In spite of congressional efforts to contain costs through price controls, fee schedules, and caps, Part B growth has shown no signs of slowing and is projected to get far worse. No serious health policy analyst regards this rate of growth as sustainable.
<p>
Q:  But aren't price caps on provider payments the most effective way to reduce outlays?
<p>
A:  No. As King notes, "If we merely reduce payments to providers (as has been tried in the past), we would have to save between $330 billion and $340 billion over the next seven years."<sup>42</sup>
<p>
Q:  If Congress raised Medicare enrollees' portion of the Part B premium, adjusting the increase for enrollees' income, wouldn't that amount to a tax increase for our elderly?
<p>
A:  No. An increase in the Part B premium is not a tax. Individuals receiving an explicit service from government -- especially one which could be provided by the private sector -- should pay the full cost of that service absent a compelling reason for a subsidy (such as poverty).<sup>43</sup> As noted earlier, Part A hospitalization is a forced savings program in which workers contribute mandatory, income-related payments. Therefore, there is reason to argue against means testing Part A or reducing its benefits. Part B is voluntary. Reducing the taxpayer-provided subsidy as income increases simply reduces Medicare outlays.
Unsustainable Spending. Medicare is growing at an alarmingly fast rate. The Congressional Budget Office has projected an annual growth rate of approximately 10 percent over the next seven years:
Q:  Has the federal government been able to forecast how much Medicare will cost?
<p>
A:  As the table on the following page demonstrates, government projections vary significantly from Medicare's actual expenditures.
<p>
Q:  Why are actual expenditures far greater than projected expenditures and growing at over ten percent each year?
<p>
A:  While the easily identifiable reasons are congressional mandates expanding covered benefits and eligibility requirements, medical inflation, and a rapidly aging population that is living longer, the main reason is the structure and design of the overall program. Medicare is an open-ended entitlement. The demand for health care services, already high among the elderly, is significantly greater among the very ill who also require more expensive medical treatment and services during the latter stages of life. Since the program is structured around a fee-for-service and third-party payment system, patients and providers do not have to worry about the price or quantity of services being provided as they spend the taxpayers' money.<sup>44</sup> In other words, there is virtually no incentive, absent a minimal cost-sharing requirement, for the Medicare population to help contain costs. Combining a government-organized fee-for-service structure with a third-party payment system serves as a catalyst for unlimited increases in the volume and intensity of services provided to patients, without regard for the efficacy or cost-effectiveness of those services.<sup>45</sup>
<p>

<b>HOW THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY RUNS MEDICARE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1977, Congress established the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to run the Medicare and Medicaid programs. HCFA is an agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Its Administrator, nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, is a powerful federal official who directs the "planning, coordination and implementation" of Medicare, Medicaid, and other HCFA programs and "directs the development of effective relationships between these programs and private and federally supported health related programs."<sup>46</sup>  The Administrator is assisted by a "general deputy Administrator" and reports directly to the Secretary of HHS.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HCFA currently operates with a budget of $262 billion, mostly to pay for Medicare and Medicaid services, and a staff of 4,129. For FY 1996, the Clinton Administration is requesting a total of $274 billion for Medicare and Medicaid benefits and operating costs, an increase of $28 billion over FY 1995. Spending for Medicare represents 64 percent of the HCFA budget, and spending for Medicare and Medicaid combined represents 38.2 percent of the total HHS budget.<sup>47</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HCFA is comprised of 25 offices and bureaus, including the Office of the Administrator, and ten regional offices. The direct administrative cost of HCFA is projected at $3 billion.<sup>48</sup>
<p>
Q:  Does HCFA have a large overhead?
<p>
A:  No. Administration consumes an estimated $3 billion -- only 1 percent -- of the agency's budget.
<p>
Q:  So, as far as bureaucracy is concerned, HCFA is cheap?
<p>
A:  Not at all. Known and direct administrative costs -- those shown on the federal budget -- do not include transactional costs incurred by doctors, hospitals, and other providers forced to comply with HCFA rules, regulations, requirements, standards, and guidelines. In identifying a regulation for elimination, Vice President Al Gore cited the fact that just one requirement, a physician attestation form for persons being discharged from hospitals, is responsible for 11 million forms which consume an estimated 220,000 hours of physician time and $22,500 in labor costs per hospital per year.<sup>49</sup>
<p>
Trust Fund Management. HCFA's mission, beyond program management, is to administer the Medicare trust funds. The Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is financed by federal payroll taxes and overseen by the Medicare Board of Trustees, a panel composed of the Secretaries of the Departments of Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services, the Administrators of the Social Security and Health Care Financing Administrations, and two "public" (non-government) members. Medicare is set up so that taxes paid by current workers are used to pay the hospitalization benefits of current beneficiaries. Any income not immediately needed to pay for these benefits is held in the HI trust fund.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Also administered by HCFA and governed by the Medicare Board of Trustees is the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund. This fund holds all income not immediately needed to pay physician and outpatient medical benefits under the Supplemental Medical Insurance Program and all related expenses. Unlike the HI trust fund, the SMI trust fund is financed by annually established standard monthly premiums paid by Medicare beneficiaries and by federal government contributions based on actuarial rates estimated by HCFA.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>HCFA's Regulatory Regime.</b> The major source of regulatory authority for the Health Care Financing Administration is Title XVIII of the United States Code. Medicare regulations are developed within HCFA but, because HCFA is an operating division of the Department of Health and Human Services, issued as HHS regulations. According to an analysis conducted by Jeremy Rosner of the Progressive Policy Institute, Medicare is governed by 1,050 pages in the U.S. Code, 1,156 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, and guidelines in the form of 19,150 pages in HCFA "manuals" and another 1,000 pages of HCFA "rulings."  Beyond these are approximately 2,000 more pages of "Provider Reimbursement Review Board Hearing Decisions" and "HCFA Administrator Decisions."<sup>50</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HCFA's regulations are developed in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The Secretary of HHS approves all regulations developed by HCFA, after which they are submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Following OMB approval, they are published in the <I>Federal Register</I> and open to public comment before taking effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HCFA regulations have generated a large body of case law because they have the practical force of law. For example, the five-volume <I>Commerce Clearing House (CCH) Medicare and Medicaid Guide</I> for members of the legal profession is twice the size of the <I>Encyclopedia Britannica:</I>  more than 43,196 pages, approximately two thirds of which are devoted to Medicare-related topics.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Beyond formal federal regulations published in the <I>Federal Register</I>, HCFA develops and publishes "guidelines" that govern doctors, hospitals, insurance contractors, and other health care providers in the program. Like HCFA regulations, these guidelines are numerous, extensive, and intricate. And like the regulations, for all practical purposes, they control doctors and hospitals.
<p>
Q:  What is the legal status of an HCFA regulation published as a Final Rule?
<p>
A:  It has the force of federal law.
<p>
Q:  Are HCFA guidelines for doctors and hospitals subject to the Administrative Procedures Act?
<p>
A:  No. For example, revisions in the Medicare Reimbursement Manual are exempt from the public notice and comment requirements of the Act, and the Supreme Court has upheld this exemption.<sup>51</sup> Not surprisingly, legal experts fear that this could be a way for HCFA officials to avoid going through the more public process of publishing formal regulations.
<p>

<b>HOW HCFA CONTRACTS WITH INSURANCE CARRIERS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HFCA delivers hospital and physician services through more than 80 contracts with private health insurance carriers in all 50 states. These contractors process insurance claims, make benefit payments, review Medicare payments to make sure they are "necessary and appropriate," and make improvements in the delivery and productivity of Medicare services under HCFA guidelines and regulations. They also are responsible for reviewing payments to providers in accordance with HCFA rules. HCFA thus relies upon a huge number of contractors to process Medicare's claims and perform a series of ancillary services. As the GAO has observed, "The Medicare program operates through a complicated administrative structure."<sup>52</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HCFA funds a "payment safeguards" program for Medicare contractors to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. The GAO has described the safeguards as cost-effective but insufficient and has criticized HHS budget reductions in the "safeguards program."<sup>53</sup>  The program funds auditing, reviewing bills to make sure that services are "medically necessary," and establishing procedures to make sure that other health insurers who cover the elderly "pay first" if that payment is appropriate. This is directed primarily at employer-provided insurance. In 1965, Medicare was to be the "secondary payor" for beneficiaries covered by both Medicare and Workers Compensation. In the 1980s, Congress made Medicare secondary payor to certain employer-based plans and under automobile insurance. Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Congress specified that employer-provided benefits would continue to be primary to Medicare (meaning that Medicare would be a "secondary payor" of health bills) until October 1, 1995. Employers, under current law, are required to provide beneficiaries with information to that effect.
<p>
Q:  What are the civil penalties for private employers who do not pay first for beneficiaries, or who fail to supply information to eligible beneficiaries that Medicare is a secondary payer?
<p>
A:  A private employer can be fined up to $1,000 per employee for failing to supply such information. Moreover, the federal government can impose an excise tax of 25 percent on private health plans that fail to comply with secondary payer rules.<sup>54</sup> HCFA is seeking to extend the data match among itself, the IRS, and the Social Security Administration (SSA) to identify the "primary payers" for Medicare enrollees.
<p>
Q:  How serious are waste, fraud, and abuse?
<p>
A:  Very serious. Senator William Cohen (R-ME) says that, based on federal investigations of the problem, Medicare fraud costs taxpayers $45 million per day.<sup>55</sup>
<p>
Q:  The GAO has estimated the cost-effectiveness of the HCFA safeguards program. Has either the Congressional Budget Office or the HCFA Actuary ever quantified the savings produced by the general payment safeguard program?
<p>
A:  No. While HCFA officials are likely to claim that these procedures have had a positive effect on Medicare costs, independent reports suggest that they are not enough. For example, according to a 1992 GAO report, "In recent years, the Medicare program has lost billions of dollars to waste, fraud and abuse. Though Medicare's losses cannot be quantified precisely, health industry experts estimate that fraud and abuse could account for as much as 10 percent of the nation's total health care costs."<sup>56</sup>
<p>
Q:  How do these abuses occur?
<p>
A:  According to the GAO, HCFA does not follow up adequately on Medicare beneficiary complaints about waste and abuse; nor do Medicare's contractors. In one case, for example, hospitals owed Medicare over $170 million in overpayments, but contractors "did little to reclaim the money."  In another, contractors paid an estimated $2 billion in claims that "should have been paid by other health insurers."<sup>57</sup>  Some abuses are particularly brazen. For example, a chain of home health care agencies billed Medicare $85,000 for gourmet popcorn for doctors and another $3,200 for "expenses incurred at a golf shop."<sup>58</sup>
<p>
Q:  How many complaints from senior citizens about fraud and abuse are we talking about?
<p>
A:  Millions. In FY 1990 alone, Medicare contractors reported getting 18 million complaints. Over half of these complaints were not referred to the contractors' investigative staffs. Furthermore, those that were referred often were not "adequately investigated."<sup>59</sup>
<p>
Q:  But why wouldn't the private insurance contractors in Medicare follow up aggressively on fraud, waste, and abuse?
<p>
A:  The incentives are not strong in Medicare. It's not their money; it's the government's -- which means the taxpayer's -- money.
<p>
Q:  What does the GAO recommend to combat these problems?
<p>
A:  Stronger policing and even tighter regulation by HCFA. This includes improving oversight of contractor activities, reducing excessive payments, and instituting tighter controls over who is allowed to bill under Medicare.<sup>60</sup> Given the program's monopolistic structure, such recommendations are hardly surprising.
<p>
<b>Claims Processing.</b> Medicare claims processing, despite congressional attempts to improve it, remains very complex. Hundreds of millions of claims are processed annually in an explosion of confusing paperwork for doctors, hospitals, and insurance contractors alike. In a June 1990 review of the system, the GAO reported that the "paperwork required to process claims under the Medicare program is burdensome and confusing to many of Medicare's beneficiaries, as well as to providers of Medicare-covered services."<sup>61</sup>  Because doctors and patients were often unclear as to what was required on the forms, claims were submitted with incorrect or insufficient information. HCFA then requested additional information to clear up the confusion, further delaying the process. In responding to beneficiaries, HCFA communications also were often unclear, and this generated even more frustration and delay. Doctors likewise have found that the information from Medicare contractors was "frustrating and burdensome."<sup>62</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In recent years, HCFA has imposed uniformity on this process simply by putting the burden on doctors to submit all Medicare claims. It also has been moving aggressively toward electronic claims processing. Before 1990, doctors who did not "participate" in the Medicare program (did not accept Medicare "assignment" or payment for services as full and final payment) were not subject to Medicare billing requirements. But in September 1990, pursuant to congressional authorization, HCFA began requiring doctors to submit all claims on behalf of their patients, even when patients wished to submit their own claims and even when doctors were not "participating physicians" in Medicare. In other words, Medicare claims submitted by patients could no longer be accepted legally. Under current law, claims are to be submitted within one year of providing medical care. Doctors may not charge for, or be reimbursed by HCFA for, the costs of completing and submitting claims. Civil monetary penalties may be imposed on any doctor who fails to submit all Medicare claims properly.
<p>
Q:  What if a physician fails to submit an assigned claim as required by law and regulation?
<p>
A:  The Secretary of HHS is to reduce the amount of reimbursement by 10 percent.
<p>
Q:  What kind of penalty can be imposed on doctors who refuse to submit claims properly?
<p>
A:  A fine of up to $2,000 per claim.
<p>
Q:  What if a doctor does not submit the Medicare claim?
<p>
A:  Doctors who "knowingly and willfully" violate the statute are subject to exclusion from Medicare for up to five years. They also are subject to exclusion from state health programs and can be assessed civil monetary penalties.
<p>
Q:  What will happen if a Medicare patient, rather than his doctor, submits a claim?
<p>
A:  HCFA can investigate the doctor to see whether the failure was deliberate and therefore warrants legal sanction.
<p>
Q:  What if a doctor wants to treat an elderly person for free as an act of personal charity?  Is he still required to submit a Medicare claim?
<p>
A:  Yes. Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, all physicians must submit claims for services to all Medicare beneficiaries.
<p>
Q:  What is the law concerning the right of an elderly person to purchase the services of a physician or other entity independent of Medicare?
<p>
A:  Section 1395(b) of Title 42 of the United States Code provides:  "Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be construed to preclude any state from providing, or any individual from purchasing or otherwise securing, protection against the cost of any health service."  Moreover, in Stewart v. Sullivan, a landmark 1992 case in Newark, New Jersey, federal Judge Nicholas Politan, examining the legal question of the right of elderly persons to contract independently with physicians in 1991, noted that there was no regulation and no clearly articulated policy against private contracting.<sup>63</sup>
<p>
Q:  Even so, do HCFA or Medicare's contractors allow elderly citizens to contract privately with physicians?
<p>
A:  Statutory language and recent federal case law to the contrary, HCFA officials consistently deny that the elderly have any such right unless they drop out of Part B; they also threaten doctors who assert any such right with sanctions.<sup>64</sup> Congress thus far has failed to clarify the matter.
<p>
Q:  How will the general movement toward electronic claims processing affect efforts to combat Medicare fraud and abuse?
<p>
A:  FBI Director Louis Freeh is concerned that electronic claims processing may make it even harder to deal with fraud and abuse precisely because there is no "paper trail."<sup>65</sup>
<p>
<b>NO COMPETITION FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unlike private plans which compete directly for consumers' dollars in the FEHBP, Medicare contractors do not compete on the basis of price, quality, or service. Instead, Congress establishes detailed standards for their performance in such matters as paying bills or processing claims. For example, Congress has established claims processing timeliness standards for Medicare contractors, and HCFA is responsible for seeing to it that they meet these standards. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 established timeliness ceilings for claims payments, specifying that 95 percent of Medicare claims were to be paid in no more than 30 days in 1987, 26 days in 1988, 25 days in 1989, and 24 days in 1990 and thereafter. Moreover, "participating physicians" were to be paid 7 days faster than "non-participating" physicians, beginning in FY 1988. Then, in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, not satisfied with ceilings, Congress mandated that Medicare operate on the basis of claims payment floors. Contractors implemented a floor of ten days in July 1988; by September, 59 percent of the carriers were meeting the ten-day floor. But the law increased the floor level to 14 days. By November 1988, 80 percent of Medicare's contractors were meeting the 14-day requirement. HCFA officials have said that the change from 10 to 14 days caused some difficulties, but that contractors have been working to meet congressional specifications.
<p>
Q:  So congressional rules are designed to ensure that bills are paid as quickly as possible?
<p>
A:  Not necessarily. As noted, there are ceilings as well as floors in Medicare's claims processing. Incredibly, Congress has imposed statutory limitations on paying bills too fast. In 1989, for example, bills were to be paid no later than 25 days but no sooner than 14 days after receiving a health provider's claim.
<p>
Q:  Do these congressional timeliness rules apply to plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) for Members of Congress and federal workers?
<p>
A:  No. Consumers in this unique market can punish and reward plans annually, based on their service. Both <I>Consumer Reports</I> and <I>Washington Consumers Checkbook</I> survey customer services in FEHBP plans in such diverse claims-related areas as simplicity of claims procedures, speed and fairness of claims payment, procedures for providing information on benefits and procedures, and the courtesy, helpfulness, and competence of the company's staff. Moreover, <I>Washington Consumers Checkbook</I> lets consumers compare performance by listing or ranking plans by the number of disputed claims per 1,000 federal employees and retirees. Medicare does not make public similar information.
<p>
Q:  What is the Clinton Administration doing to reform HCFA claims processing?
<p>
A:  The Clinton Administration, as part of its effort to reform HCFA's unwieldy regulatory process, has proposed a new national Medicare Transaction System (MTS) to replace the nine different claims processing systems now operated by 72 insurance companies at 57 sites around the country. The object is to simplify administration and improve Medicare services. In January and March of 1994, contracts were awarded to private companies for "design, development, testing and implementation" of the MTS.<sup>66</sup>
<p>
Q:  Are there any estimates of the potential savings in Medicare's computer software for claims processing?
<p>
A:  Yes. The General Accounting Office estimates that with an investment of $20 million in "off-the-shelf commercial software," Medicare could save nearly $4 billion over five years by "detecting fraudulent claims by physicians -- primarily manipulation of billing codes."<sup>67</sup>
<p><b>Regulating Quality.</b> Beyond entering into contracts with and establishing standards for Medicare contractors and imposing price controls, HCFA is responsible for assuring the "quality" of health care services to the elderly and disabled. It attempts to fulfill this responsibility in a variety of ways. First, it certifies health care providers who are qualified to deliver medical services:  doctors, hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, clinical laboratories, renal dialysis facilities, home health agencies, intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded, and nursing homes. Each provider must meet HCFA requirements or "conditions of participation."  To assure quality, HCFA negotiates with the several states to perform surveys of the approximately 2,000 health care facilities that deliver Medicare and Medicaid services to the elderly and the poor. The states thus become instruments by which HCFA can ensure compliance with its rules, regulations, and instructions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In recent years, this survey and certification role has expanded. During the second Reagan Administration, HCFA issued its first state-by-state guide to the nation's 15,000 nursing homes. Designed to assess the quality of care given to the elderly, the guide was billed as a snapshot of conditions using 32 "key measures of the quality of care."  The first report was issued as a screening tool for consumers. Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 1987, HCFA also recertifies skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies. Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988, Congress expanded the agency's survey and certification responsibilities to include clinical laboratories serving Medicare beneficiaries. Approximately 38,000 laboratories around the country are registered with HCFA, all subject to routine inspections on an annual basis. These broad efforts are funded by HCFA out of its Program Management account. HCFA thus has an oversight role over state agencies it funds to do this work.
<p>

Q:  With Medicare administered by contractors at the state level, what about quality of care and access to medical technology?
<p>
A:  It is very uneven. Despite thousands of pages of HCFA rules and guidelines, notes Dr. Lonnie Bristow, President of the American Medical Association, in actual practice dozens of Medicare contractors often set their own rules and standards:  "For example, an older woman is 180 times more likely to be turned down for a mammogram in southern California than in northern California. A chest X-ray that's billable in South Carolina is 500 times more likely to be denied in Illinois."<sup>68</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW MEDICARE STANDARDIZES BENEFITS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Since the enactment of Medicare in 1965, Congress has adjusted the system by increasing benefits, expanding eligibility, and then implementing price controls to offset the effects of its own initiatives. Benefits are unrelated to income or prior contributions and are applied uniformly toward all enrollees. Every participant is subject to a standardized package with no ability to make adjustments in price or in the scope or range of benefits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Medicare benefits are divided into two parts:  Part A, the Hospital Insurance (HI) program, and Part B, the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Part A will pay for:<blockquote>
	All reasonable expenses for the first 60 days of inpatient hospital care, minus a deductible ($696 in calendar year 1994) in each benefit period. For days 61-90, a coinsurance amount ($174 in calendar year 1994) is deducted. When more than 90 days are required in a benefit period, a patient may elect to draw upon a 60-day lifetime reserve. A coinsurance amount ($348 in calendar year 1994) also is deducted for each reserve day.
<p>
	Up to 100 days (following hospitalization) in a skilled nursing facility for persons in need of continued skilled nursing care or rehabilitation services on a daily basis. After the first 20 days, there is a daily coinsurance ($87 in calendar year 1994).
<p>
	Home health visits for persons who need skilled nursing care, physical therapy, or speech therapy on an intermittent basis.
<p>
	Hospice care services provided to terminally ill Medicare beneficiaries with a life expectancy of 6 months or less, up to a 210-day lifetime limit. A subsequent period of hospice coverage is allowed beyond the 210-day limit if the beneficiary is recertified as terminally ill.
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Part B generally will pay 80 percent of the approved amount (fee schedule, reasonable charges, or reasonable cost) for covered services in excess of an annual deductible ($100). Services covered include the following:<blockquote>

	Doctor's services, including surgery, consultation, and home, office, and institutional visits. Certain limitations apply for services rendered by dentists, podiatrists, and chiropractors and for the treatment of mental illness.
<p>
	Laboratory and other diagnostic tests, X-ray and other radiation therapy, outpatient services at a hospital, rural health clinic services, home dialysis supplies and equipment, artificial devices (other than dental), physical and speech therapy, and ambulance services.
<p>
	An unlimited number of medically necessary home health visits for persons not covered under Part A. The 20 percent coinsurance and $100 deductible do not apply for such benefits.<sup>69</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress has established Medicare as a program of defined benefits, in essence promising the nation's senior citizens a laundry list of benefits under Part A and Part B without informing them of or effectively offsetting the true cost. As opposed to protecting the elderly from catastrophic accidents and unforeseen illnesses, Medicare is much like a pre-paid medical services program. Over 95 percent of the elderly receive Medicare benefits today because Congress has created financial incentives for seniors to enroll in the program. The combination of rigid reimbursement -- actually price controls -- for health providers and artificially low premiums and deductibles for enrollees has resulted in a popular but financially unstable and costly social insurance program.
<p>
Q:  How has the structure of Medicare affected private health insurance and working Americans?
<p>
A:  Unfortunately, it has led to overuse of health services by a price-immune population, severe distortion in the private-sector health care market, and an ever-increasing financial burden (tax) on today's and tomorrow's work force, including the almost 40 million uninsured Americans who are mostly workers. Most of these households lack insurance coverage because they cannot afford it; they must spend hundreds of dollars a year to purchase health care for the elderly through the Medicare payroll tax.<sup>70</sup> If Congress had increased Part B medical deductible and premiums to keep pace with inflation and acted to end or decrease the open-ended subsidy of Medi-gap plans, Part B outlays would be significantly less than they are projected to be.<sup>71</sup> As the following table indicates, however, premiums and deductibles have not kept pace with inflation, so Medicare's beneficiaries have been shielded from the true costs of their health care.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Decisions often are political, not medical or scientific, in setting benefits. Since Congress defines the Medicare benefits package, it can add or subtract from it. Historically, however, Congress has added benefits instead of trimming them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Because it is politicians, not doctors and patients, who make the key decisions, the Medicare population -- unlike congressional and other federal retirees, who are covered by plans offering benefits and services for different conditions and needs -- is locked into a government-standardized benefits package. Beyond electing to participate in the voluntary SMI program with its standardized benefits, the only choice elderly Americans make in health insurance is whether they will purchase a supplemental Medi-gap policy to get services and benefits not covered by Part B. Depending on the scope of benefits and services provided in these policies, millions of elderly Americans can spend over $1,000 a year on Medi-gap insurance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Furthermore, the standardized Medicare package does not cover routine benefits included in most health plans in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. For example, the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Standard Option plan available in the FEHBP includes preventive screening (stool tests for blood, prostate specific antigen tests); routine physical exams, including a history and risk assessment only, and a serum cholesterol test, annually at age 65 and over; smoking cessation; catastrophic protection; outpatient prescription drugs; and routine dental care. None of these benefits is available in Medicare.
<p>Q:  What happens when a new treatment is discovered or an old one becomes obsolete?
<p>
A:  Once a standard benefits package has been established, modifying and updating it becomes an administrative, bureaucratic, and political nightmare. Medicare establishes and excludes certain types of services from coverage. HCFA officials must overcome a myriad of internal bureaucratic obstacles whenever they seek to add or withdraw a benefit. Should HCFA decide to expand coverage for a promising medical breakthrough, it must request an evaluation from the Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA), part of HHS's Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR). This is a cumbersome process. Any HCFA official wanting to eliminate a benefit or medical service must be prepared to defend his proposal before Congress and special interests lobbying for the inclusion of their particular benefit or service.
<p>
Controlling Medical Technology. While Medicare benefits are established by Congress, the addition or subtraction of medical treatments or procedures rests with HCFA. The problem of adding a treatment or procedure becomes acute for Medicare patients when the medical technology in question is new.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under Medicare's complex reimbursement rules, it is not always clear that a medical procedure or device is reimbursable under HCFA guidelines. HCFA's staff can do an internal review and determine that a medical technology, particularly a conventional technology, is reimbursable. But the decision to cover it is not left to the regional office; it is referred to the headquarters in Baltimore. The technology assessment is done for HCFA by HHS's Office of Health Technology Assessment. After reviewing the information, OHTA makes its recommendations to HCFA's Office of Coverage Policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under current law, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves prescription drugs and medical devices for safety and effectiveness before they can be marketed in the United States. Outpatient prescription drugs are not covered by Medicare, so FDA decisions in this area apply only to inpatient drugs. Medicare private-sector patients therefore are affected differently. For medical devices, there are special FDA Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) for "breakthrough" or "investigational" devices, subject to patient consent and initial FDA approval. These exemptions are available for doctors and hospitals to treat patients enrolled in private health plans. Historically, hospitals have billed Medicare for new medical devices and for the use of investigational devices otherwise approved by the FDA in clinical studies. In July 1994, the HHS Office of Inspector General issued a subpoena to 130 hospitals and leading medical centers requesting "nearly a decade's worth of billing records on cardiac devices."<sup>72</sup>  HCFA's position was that billing such "investigational devices" constituted "fraud" against the Medicare program. Spokesmen for HCFA asserted that billing Medicare for investigational devices had always been prohibited and that the hospitals and medical centers should have "known better."<sup>73</sup>  HCFA now denies Medicare reimbursement to doctors and hospitals that use these investigational medical devices, even if doctors think they are warranted in treating an elderly patient's disease or medical condition. Because Medicare refuses to pay for these newer medical devices, Medicare patients, unlike patients in the private sector, experience delays in getting such treatments or access to such devices, and sometimes are denied access to them altogether.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If Medicare does agree to pay for a medical device, the payment must be the government-determined rate, regardless of market supply and demand conditions. The law thus limits elderly patients' access to advanced medical technologies.
<p>
Q:  How have leading medical research centers and hospitals responded to HCFA rules and HHS subpoenas governing billing for new or "investigational" medical devices?
<p>
A:  Clinical trials have been shut down and Medicare patients excluded from access to these devices. According to one account, "The subpoenas created a domino effect -- hospitals closed studies, limiting access to devices by Medicare patients. Doctors were no longer able to provide what they considered the latest treatments to many older patients."<sup>74</sup>
<p>
Q:  How has the medical device industry responded to FDA and HCFA regulatory processes?
<p>
A:  According to a survey of the Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA), which represents more than 700 medical device companies, 50 percent have moved some trials of clinical devices to other countries. This means that patients in other countries are the first to benefit from technological innovations developed in the United States.<sup>75</sup>
<p>
Q:  Many physicians use "investigational" drugs and medical devices in difficult or life-threatening cases. Does Medicare make any exception to the ban on reimbursement for such devices?
<p>
A. No. According to Thomas A. Ault, Director of the Bureau of Policy Development at HCFA, "The Medicare manuals do not allow any exceptions to this policy."<sup>76</sup>  Dr. John Rowe of New York's Mount Sinai Hospital testified recently that even using a pacemaker with a new form of electrical contact could run afoul of the rules if the manufacturer was comparing the effectiveness of different contacts. In such a case, the hospital could be turned down for the cost of the entire treatment, not just the pacemaker.<sup>77</sup>
<p>
Q:  So Medicare does not always provide reimbursement for the latest medical technologies, procedures, and pharmaceutical breakthroughs?
<p>
A:  Right. Americans should be extremely cautious about accepting a comprehensive, standardized government benefits package for all plans, especially in an era when medical technology is improving and making rapid advances. According to a recent study of the Medicare system by former U.S. Senator David Durenberger (R-MN) and former congressional health policy analyst Susan Bartlett Foote, Medicare technology evaluation has been underfunded because of competing budgetary priorities, such as payment for a growing volume of state-of-the-art medical services. Durenberger and Foote note that such evaluation has been hampered by ineffective assessments of the cost-effectiveness of technology, due in large part to the politicization of HCFA's decision-making process, and that technology assessments often have been painfully slow. OHTA performed only 10 assessments in 1991 and 8 in 1992, and some have been buried for over three years. Furthermore, a bureaucratic approach to technology policy that affects all Americans, especially the Medicare population, raises serious health-related concerns.<sup>78</sup>

<b>MEDICARE'S EXPERIMENT WITH MANAGED CARE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In recent years, in an effort to catch up with the private sector, HCFA has tried to promote managed care plans in the form of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) as an alternative way to deliver medical services to the elderly. Within HMOs, doctors and other health care providers are paid on a "capitated basis," and their incentives are quite different from those found in the traditional fee-for-service system that characterizes Medicare. HCFA officials think the efficiencies of HMOs would allow them to lower their premiums and attract Medicare beneficiaries into their managed care networks. The Reagan and Bush Administrations encouraged enrollment in HMOs as a "private plan option" for Medicare beneficiaries because they saw managed care as a way to slow the rapid growth of Part B spending. In 1982, in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, Congress permitted Medicare to allow HMOs and Competitive Medical Plans (similar managed care-type plans which contract with physicians) to accept Medicare patients but at full financial risk to themselves. By 1989, over 1 million beneficiaries had enrolled in approximately 133 managed care plans. More recently, Congress established a Medicare Select option -- in practice, a Preferred Provider Option.
<p>
Q:  How many Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in HMOs or managed care plans compared to enrollees in private-sector insurance and the FEHBP?
<p>
A:  Only about 7 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in HMOs or managed care plans. In the private sector, 63 percent of all workers and their families are enrolled in such plans; in the FEHBP, 33 percent of all enrollees are in HMOs. Of the 1.6 million federal retirees, approximately 18 percent are enrolled in HMOs.<sup>79</sup>
<p>
Q:  What is wrong with HCFA's payment to HMOs?
<p>
A:  Under Medicare rules, the capitation rate for doctors in HMOs is 95 percent of local fee-for-service costs. Medicare officials are constantly trying to find the right price for medical services. As former HCFA Administrator Gail Wilensky says, "Inadequate payments for risk appears to produce overpayments to many HMO's, probably underpayments for some HMO's."<sup>80</sup>
<p>
Q:  If an HMO offers a premium for its package below the Medicare payment, can the Medicare beneficiary get a price rebate from the HMO?
<p>
A:  No. The elderly are not allowed to take advantage of actual or potential savings in the Medicare program.
<p>
Q:  How has the Medicare Select PPO option fared?
<p>
A:  As well as could be expected in a bureaucratic system driven by political rather than market considerations. The PPO option originally was limited to 15 states. Congress just extended Medicare Select to all 50 states for 3 years, subject to congressional review at the conclusion.
<p>
Q:  Are "point of service" managed care plans, in which Medicare patients can choose personal doctors outside their own managed care networks, allowed?
<p>
A:  No.<sup>81</sup>
<p>
Q:  May private employers contract with an HMO and enroll their retirees, who also are Medicare beneficiaries, in an HMO or Competitive Medical Plan?
<p>
A:  No.<sup>82</sup>
<p>
Q:  What if Congress just forced the elderly into managed care plans, as many private employers are doing now to workers and their families?  Wouldn't that save money?
<p>
A:  Not necessarily. It is not clear that managed care will guarantee long-term savings, either in the Medicare system or in the private health care system. "Managed care will not provide an instant magic bullet," notes Urban Institute health policy analyst Marilyn Moon. "Health maintenance organizations (HMO's) and other types of managed care have more experience dealing with younger, healthier populations that may not translate easily into treatment of the aged and disabled."<sup>83</sup>
<p>
Q:  Why have HMOs been more widespread in the FEHBP than in Medicare, and why do they seem to have reduced costs?
<p>
A:  Because of personal choice. In the FEHBP, not only is joining an HMO voluntary, but federal employees and retirees can pocket the savings from picking a private managed care plan.
<p>
Q:  Do HMOs in the FEHBP assume all financial risks for enrolling employees and retirees?
<p>
A:  Yes. All private carriers, including traditional fee-for-service plans competing in the FEHBP, assume the financial risk of enrolling federal employees and retirees. This risk is not assumed by the taxpayers.<sup>84</sup>

<b>HOW HCFA PAYS DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Medicare's most prominent regulatory feature may be its complex system of reimbursement for doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers. Its experiences in setting prices for these providers are object lessons both in the deficiencies of conventional third-party payment arrangements that still characterize employer-based insurance and in the failures of administered pricing and central planning as found in Medicare's reimbursement schedules. The administered prices are either too high or too low; the process for setting them inevitably is flawed or lacks sufficient data; the guidelines are confusing or insufficient; or the payment process is compromised by HCFA's managerial ineffectiveness. For example, in a May 1991 report on the pricing of medical technology, the General Accounting Office found that in some localities, Medicare was paying more than twice as much as others for magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs), thereby stimulating greater use of this technology.<sup>85</sup> In November, GAO found that six suppliers of durable medical equipment realized higher profits from their Medicare business than from their non-Medicare business.<sup>86</sup> The next year, in June 1992, GAO found that "HCFA could reduce Medicare expenditures on durable medical equipment subject to unnecessary payments by developing more detailed coverage criteria that give carriers a clear, well-defined, objective basis for paying or denying claims."<sup>87</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If the quality and quantity of information are insufficient, the basis for planning is flawed and payment policies will be wrong. In an examination of Medicare payments to teaching hospitals, GAO reported in 1991 that "Supplemental medicare payments to teaching hospitals are based on inaccurate and unverifiable data, and are causing Medicare to pay millions more in indirect medical education costs than it should."<sup>88</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Occasionally, Medicare pricing policies are bizarre. For example, in a March 1992 report examining payment practices for certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) and doctors, GAO found that "Medicare pays more for anesthesia services performed by CRNA's or residents under concurrent medical direction by an anesthesiologist than for identical services personally provided by an anesthesiologist."<sup>89</sup>  Just as suppliers of durable medical equipment had been overpaid by Medicare, clinical laboratories were doing quite well under Medicare's fee schedules:  "Medicare and other retail customers are essentially subsidizing laboratory sales to discount customers. Based on the principle that Medicare should pay its own way but not subsidize services for other customer groups, we believe that Medicare's fee schedule payment rates are, on average, too high."<sup>90</sup>  Payment also can affect the kind and quality of care given to the elderly. GAO found that Medicare's reimbursement to oncologists determines whether cancer patients are treated in higher cost hospital settings or lower cost outpatient settings:  "What is clear from our results... is that HCFA's reimbursement policies for chemotherapy have unintended consequences that extend beyond whether and how much oncologists are reimbursed by Medicare. Specifically, the policies may affect where a cancer patient gets treated and, as a result, Medicare costs for that patient care."<sup>91</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Hospital Payments.</b> Historically, hospital care has been the single largest item in the Medicare budget. Elderly citizens are more prone to hospitalization, and HCFA officials estimate that approximately one fourth of all Medicare beneficiaries are hospitalized once a year. Not surprisingly, Medicare payments to approximately 6,000 hospitals nationwide account for almost 40 percent of all hospital income.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1983, with the support of the Reagan Administration, Congress enacted the Prospective Payment System (PPS), a new Medicare reimbursement system for hospitals. The program was phased in over a period of five years and fully implemented in 1988. HCFA, of course, administers this system of hospital payments. Under the PPS system, hospitals are paid a standardized amount for each admission. That per capita amount is adjusted by the "wage index" for the geographic area in which the hospital is located and multiplied by a weight assigned to the case according to its diagnostic related group (DRG). Under Medicare, approximately 500 DRGs determine all hospital payments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The DRGs are at the heart of the PPS system, and HCFA officials often are concerned with ways to "refine" the payment formula. For example, classifications do not distinguish between differences in the severity of cases even though, on paper, patients may be classified under the same DRG for purposes of medical treatment. The levels of care are different, but reimbursement is the same. HCFA officials are aware of this deficiency and have sponsored research at Yale University on adjustments that would allow for differing levels of severity in medical condition.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another key element in a hospital's standardized Medicare payment is whether it is located in an urban or a rural area. Standardized amounts have been significantly higher for urban hospitals. "Sole community hospitals," designated by HCFA as the only hospitals available in given geographic (rural) areas, are paid a separate PPS rate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	HCFA planners adjust the PPS rates on the basis of the "hospital market basket," an index that measures annual changes in the "cost of inputs," including such items as the cost of labor, prescription drugs, medical supplies, and even the energy consumed by the hospital in delivering medical services. The hospital market basket is a major component of the PPS update, or rate of increase in hospital payments from year to year. In assessing what hospitals should be paid, Members of Congress are advised by a special government commission, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC), independent of HCFA. Based on its analyses, ProPAC may recommend an average update factor at some percentage, taking into account recent HCFA market basket estimates. Congress is free to accept or reject these recommendations.
<p>
Q:  What about hospitals with a "disproportionate share" of low-income clients?
<p>
A:  The PPS system allows additional payments to help cover the indirect costs of teaching and to help hospitals with a disproportionate share of low-income patients. Because urban and teaching hospitals tend to give low-income and uninsured people uncompensated care, Medicare reimburses them with additional payments. These hospitals have enjoyed higher levels of profitability under the PPS system than other types of hospitals. At the same time, federal law forbids hospitals from transferring, or "dumping," any patient who arrives in an emergency room. Moreover, under the Hill-Burton Act, they must provide free care to uninsured or low-income people to qualify for low-interest federal construction loans.
<p>
Q:  What is HCFA's experience with PPS rates?
<p>
A:  Troublesome. HCFA officials must know the right price for hospitalization services in order to set the right rates. To be at all efficient, central planning and pricing policies require a daunting level of precision in data collection and analysis. The first technical problem for HCFA planners was that they based their initial standardized payment amounts on 1981 hospital cost data and then continued to do so in subsequent years. Thus, annual payments were made on outdated assumptions, rendering them -- at least for purposes of government pricing -- economically meaningless. HCFA planners then argued that they had to "rebase" the PPS standardized amounts, taking into account more recent and more accurate data. For the special interests, rebasing was not a scientific question, but a matter of income. The American Hospital Association, for example, originally opposed rebasing but then reversed itself and supported it because it would increase Medicare payment levels.
<p>
Q:  In other words, by basing its estimates on 1981 hospital data, HCFA set PPS amounts too high?
<p>
A:  Yes. During the first two years, Medicare hospitals' profit margins were about 15 percent. This led HCFA officials to believe they had set the rates too high. In response to PPS, the average length of patient stays fell, and hospitals did what they could to get "heavier" DRG weighting for certain classes of medical services in a fashion that HCFA planners did not anticipate.
<p>
Q:  How have hospitals tried to get a heavier DRG weighting?
<p>
A:  Through a process called "up-coding."  Hospital officials try to document each case thoroughly, noting every complication in the patient's status that would require specific services. This gives the patient's DRG a heavier weight, and thus a higher Medicare payment.
<p>
Q:  How has PPS affected rural hospitals?
<p>
A:  Rural hospital administrators initially thought that PPS reimbursement was too low. In the late 1980s, HCFA officials conceded that Medicare payment levels were disadvantaged by the PPS system. But they also argue that other factors, not the PPS system, are responsible for the financial difficulties of rural hospitals. During the first four years of PPS, admissions declined significantly at rural hospitals, which have much lower occupancy rates than urban hospitals.
<p>
Q:  How has Congress responded to this problem?
<p>
A:  By further modifying and adjusting the PPS system to get the right price for rural hospitalization and by expanding the federal bureaucracy. In FY 1988 and FY 1989, Congress mandated higher annual rate increases for rural hospitals than for urban hospitals; accordingly, the methodology for calculating basic rates was revised in FY 1988, resulting in increased rates for rural hospitals. Moreover, in August 1987, HHS established an Office of Rural Health Policy to coordinate HHS activities relating to rural health policy. In 1988, Secretary Otis R. Bowen established the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health to advise him on the impact of Medicare and Medicaid policies on rural hospitals and other health care facilities.
<p>
Q:  Did these changes in PPS methodology help rural hospitals?
<p>
A:  No. In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Congress authorized a special Medicare demonstration program to award small grants to rural hospitals to help them close and convert facilities and develop alternative types of medical services. In FY 1989, Congress appropriated $9 million for this program.
<p>
Q:  What else did Congress do for rural hospitals?
<p>
A:  Congress simply authorized a change in the definition of "rural" for purposes of PPS. In FY 1989, HCFA standards for designating counties as rural or urban were changed so that 57 hospitals in 38 rural counties would be paid by Medicare as if they were urban hospitals.
<p>
Q:  What has been the effect of the PPS system?
<p>
A:  HCFA officials invariably say it has been consistently effective in controlling costs. For example, between 1979 and 1983, HI benefit outlays increased by over 17 percent per year. For the first five years of PPS, HCFA reported that the growth rate for HI outlays dropped to an annual average of 6.5 percent. HCFA attributes this both to decreases in hospital admissions and the average length of hospital stays and to a shift to outpatient services covered under Part B.
<p>
Q:  In other words, the PPS system shifted costs to elderly patients -- in the form of less hospitalization -- and to the part of Medicare not covered by PPS?
<p>
A:  Yes. One of the system's first noticeable features was a more rapid turnover in hospitalization among Medicare patients. As John Merline of <I>Investor's Business Daily</I> writes, "Hospitals, according to several studies, are releasing some Medicare patients earlier and in less stable condition than they formerly would."<sup>92</sup>
<p>
Q:  So in coping with PPS standardized reimbursements, hospitals simply shift costs from one part of Medicare to the other?
<p>
A:  Yes. Under the PPS system, hospitals have every incentive to shift costs from Part A inpatient hospital services to Part B outpatient services. From 1985 through 1990, outpatient hospital services jumped 20 percent per year. Historically, the big shift in the use of outpatient services has been in diagnostic, surgical, endoscopic, and cataract procedures.
<p>
Q:  Under the Medicare DRG system, hospitals are forbidden to charge more than the Medicare-approved price, even if patients are willing to pay more. But can they charge less than the Medicare-approved price and give rebates to the elderly?
<p>
A:  No.<sup>93</sup><p>
Payments to Doctors. Since 1966, Congress has taken approximately 75 different actions to cut Medicare payments to doctors.<sup>94</sup> These legislated caps and freezes on reimbursement schedules have reduced compensation in the Medicare program to about 59 percent of private-sector rates.<sup>95</sup> Yet costs continue to grow at unsustainable rates. Rather than introduce free-market forces into the program to control costs efficiently, however, liberal Members of Congress have devised even more complex and cumbersome systems of price controls over the past decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Historically, physicians in Medicare were reimbursed according to the "usual, customary, prevailing, and reasonable" rates based on behavior in the private market.<sup>96</sup> In 1975, Congress established a Medicare Economic Index (MEI) and then required Medicare to limit its annual increases in prevailing rates to this MEI. Throughout the 1980s, Congress tried to change, modify, or cap these rate increases. This effort failed. Spending on Part B services continued to soar at about 13 percent per year.<sup>97</sup> Since there is no genuine health care market (at least as economists normally understand the term) in the private sector, Medicare since 1992 has attempted to pay physicians on the basis of a special formula called the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS):
<blockquote>
	Since January 1, 1992, payments for physicians services under Medicare have been based on a national fee schedule that is being phased in through 1996. Under the fee schedule, each service is first assigned a <I>relative value.</I> The <I>relative value</I> for a service has three components:  (1) a physician work component that reflects the time, skill, and intensity of the physician's effort in providing the service; (2) a practice expense component that includes costs such as office rent, salaries, equipment, and supplies; and (3) a malpractice component that reflects malpractice insurance premium costs. A <I>geographic adjustment</I> is made to each of the three components of the relative value. The geographically adjusted relative values are then multiplied by the conversion factor. The conversion factor is a dollar figure that converts the geographically adjusted relative value for a service into a dollar payment amount for that service.<sup>98</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps the most interesting feature of this entire process is the attempt by HCFA staff, using the methods of social science, to measure and weigh the "value" of labor as the key element in reimbursing an entire class of professionals, an enterprise long since abandoned even by practitioners of socialist economics.<sup>99</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two other elements of the new reimbursement formula are Volume Performance Standards (VPS) and restrictions on balanced billing, or the ability of the physician to charge more than the Medicare-approved price for a medical service. Under Medicare's physician reimbursement system, HCFA projects the appropriate rate of growth for the volume of physicians services to the elderly and the disabled. If physicians as a group exceed the projected volume of medical services set by the HCFA in any given year, the aggregate reimbursement is reduced proportionately, as a percentage, two years later. HCFA officials have never been clear as to how a future reduction in fees for all physicians in the Medicare program is supposed to prevent an individual physician from increasing his volume of services in order to offset potential future losses in Medicare income. Nonetheless, this is the Volume Performance Standards' central function. Congress adopted this mechanism in 1989 to offset the likely increase in the volume of medical services encouraged by reductions or restraints in fee schedules and billing. A related measure was a limitation on balanced billing. Thanks to the RBRVS fee schedule and balanced billing restrictions, the Medicare fee schedule became nothing more than a complicated price-fixing scheme.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For over 500,000 physicians, HCFA assigns regularly updated "relative values" for approximately 7,000 medical procedures. Refining these values in the RBRVS is a tedious and never-ending task because, as with previous Medicare reimbursement schemes, the values, and thus the Medicare payments, are rarely right and often controversial. When RBRVS was implemented in 1991, physicians complained that the government's "conversion factor" (translating HCFA value scales into specific dollar amounts) was not high enough. Beyond that, the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC), and even HCFA, conceded in 1991 that many of the values assigned to the thousands of medical procedures were simply wrong.<sup>100</sup>

	Under the RBRVS, HCFA must rely on physicians to participate in setting and adjusting medical service codes. This is a complicated process that forces physicians, operating outside of anything that resembles a market, to function as judges in their own interest and at public expense.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Like all such price-control schemes, Medicare's RBRVS fee schedule encourages doctors to game the system by such means as trying to bill Medicare or patients in creative ways; upcoding, or using a medical service code that guarantees higher reimbursement when more than one medical service code applies to the treatment of a case; and "unbundling," or making charging separately for services that otherwise would be part of, and billed as, a single package of treatment for a given medical condition.<p>
Q:  The market rewards suppliers which provide high quality goods or services that consumers find beneficial. Does HCFA or Congress attempt to incorporate the quality or benefit of a medical service to elderly patients?
<p>
A:  No. Neither the quality nor the benefit of a service is a part of Medicare's RBRVS formula for setting fees for physicians. Patient demand, in an economic sense, is simply ignored. Proponents of the RBRVS say that, with more time, more research, and a better refinement of social science methodology, they hope to incorporate quality and benefit indices for purposes of calculation.<sup>101</sup> But no such indices exist today.
<p>
Q :  Does the Medicare RBRVS fee schedule make any distinctions among physicians on the basis of their professional skills in treating patients?
<p>
A:  No. Medicare reimburses doctors without regard to differences in skills or experience. Highly skilled surgeons with a great deal of experience are paid the same as relatively inexperienced surgeons of lesser reputation.

HOW TO EXPAND CHOICE AND STRENGTHEN MEDICARE'S FINANCIAL CONDITION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Absent any structural reform of the Medicare program, Congress will be forced to choose between two very unpleasant and unpopular alternatives:  a massive tax increase on working Americans, surpassing the Clinton tax bill of 1993, or a similarly masive reduction in benefits to the elderly. Halfway measures cannot restore solvency to Medicare's trust funds. Nor can they achieve the necessary savings needed to help balance the budget and reduce the deficit. Moreover, failure to pass structural reforms allows HCFA's bureaucracy -- with its arcane regulations burdening physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers -- to become even more entrenched.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to the Medicare trustees, "it is now clear that Medicare reform needs to be addressed urgently as a distinct legislative initiative."<sup>102</sup>
<p>

Q:  Private-sector experience often is used as a point of comparison with Medicare. How do Medicare's costs compare with the private sector's?
<p>

A:  In the private sector, large employer health premiums in 1995 dropped by 1.1 percent while overall health care prices rose 4.4 percent. Medicare, meanwhile, experienced more than 10 percent overall growth and is projected to grow at the same rate for the next five years.<sup>103</sup>
<p>
Q:  What other options do retirees have if they choose not to purchase the Medicare Part B package?
<p>
A:  They can buy a private plan. But if they do so, they lose the 75 percent subsidy for premiums available under Part B.
<p>
Q:  Are all retirees treated equally when it comes to purchasing health insurance?
<p>
A:  No. Retired Members of Congress and other federal retirees have access to the FEHBP. Unlike Medicare, this unique, consumer-driven health care system is not run on the principles of central planning and price controls. It is based on the market principles of consumer choice and competition. The FEHBP includes over 400 private health insurance plans nationwide, ranging from traditional indemnity insurance and fee-for-service plans, to plans sponsored by federal unions and employee organizations, to various managed care plans (HMOs, PPOs). Instead of attempting to constrain costs by controlling prices and specifying services to be covered, it sets very broad guidelines over how plans must be structured and marketed and specifies only a brief set of core benefits, permitting federal workers and retirees to choose the plan and benefits that are right for them. Costs are held down through the operation of consumer choice in a market of competing plans. Total costs in the FEHBP have been rising at about half the rate of costs in Medicare, and premiums recently have been flat or falling.
<p>
Q:  Since both the FEHBP and Medicare are run by the federal government, aren't they essentially similar?
<p>
A:  No. The FEHBP works on entirely different principles. For one thing, Medicare is a defined benefits program in which each enrollee has access to a standardized set of health services that are paid for, in whole or in part, by the federal government. The FEHBP, on the other hand, is a defined contribution program in which the government agrees to provide retired Congressmen, Senators, or federal employees with a financial contribution toward the purchase of health plans of their choice.
<p>
The FEHBP is open to all congressional and federal retirees who retired after July 1, 1960. Under current rules, a retiree is eligible to enroll in an FEHBP plan if he retired on an annuity with at least five years of continuous service at the time of retirement, or if he retired on a civil service disability. Retirees can assume coverage for spouses by electing survivor benefits for them, and any survivor annuitant can request FEHBP coverage for grandchildren, under certain conditions, on or after August 11, 1994.<sup>104</sup>
<p>
Q:  What features make an FEHBP-style program more desirable than Medicare for retirees?
<p>
A:  First, retirees would have a wide choice of health plans. Except for federal retirees no other group of retirees enjoys this feature. Private plans range from fee-for-service to different types of managed care plans. Plans sponsored by federal unions and employee organizations and associations are particularly popular; almost one third of federal workers and retirees are enrolled in such plans.
<p>
Second, retirees could choose the services they want covered. Unlike the Medicare population enrolled in a single, standardized government benefits package, federal retirees have various private options available to them. Beyond the normal range of hospitalization and physician services, they can pick from plans that cover such services as dental care, outpatient mental health benefits, routine physical examinations, durable medical equipment, hospice care, outpatient prescription drugs, mail order prescription drugs, treatment for alcoholism and drug abuse, and -- most important -- catastrophic coverage.
<p>
	Third, retirees would have a range of options as to what they will pay in premiums, deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and, in some cases, maximum out-of-pocket expenses. Under the FEHBP's financing formula, the government will contribute each year up to a maximum dollar amount. If a federal retiree chooses a very expensive benefit package that exceeds this contribution, he makes up the difference. On the other hand, if a retiree chooses a less expensive plan, he saves money on his portion of the premium.

<p>
Building a Better System
<p>
Q:  How can retirees get the same types of options Members of Congress and other federal employees enjoy upon retirement?
<p>
A:  Congress can give the elderly greater control over their Medicare dollars so they can select the plans and services that are right for them. Changing Medicare from a defined benefit program into a defined contribution program would allow the elderly to use payments to enroll in private health plans with the benefits and services they want, rather than those chosen for them by bureaucrats or politicians. On the other hand, if they wish to remain in the traditional Medicare plan, they should be free to do so.
<p>
Q:  Would a defined government contribution cover the costs of retirees' health insurance?
<p>
A:  Yes, unless the senior chose a very expensive plan. The size of the government contribution could be the combination of two amounts, reflecting the financing of the existing Part A and a reformed Part B. Medicare currently spends $4,800 per person, or $9,600 per couple.
<p>Part of the defined contribution could be an amount (adjusted by age, gender, and geography) intended to cover the actuarial equivalent of the hospital and other services in today's Part A. This portion of the voucher would not be subject to a means test. Another part could be based on an amount (also adjusted by age, gender, and geography) intended to cover the actuarial equivalent of services currently included in the voluntary and subsidized Part B program. This base amount should be subject to a means test to determine the dollar amount of this portion.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under such a scenario, the elderly finally would be able to purchase health insurance plans of their choice. HCFA would be reduced to a clearinghouse that distributes information regarding these plans to the elderly. A checklist of benefits would be provided to inform beneficiaries as to what type of plan is in their best interest. Enrollees who choose a health insurance plan which costs less than the size of their defined contribution would receive the difference in cash, tax free.<p>
Q:  What kinds of protection would Congress have to establish to make sure that the elderly aren't being conned by rogue insurance companies?
<p>
A:  Health insurance plans participating in a new consumer choice, or "Medi-Choice," system would have to meet certain basic requirements to be marketed as approved plans:
<p>
Requirement #1:  They would have to meet basic financial strength requirements to assure fiscal solvency. A similar requirement exists today in the FEHBP.
<p>
Requirement #2:  They would have to specify benefits, services, and costs in a standardized manner, enabling the elderly to choose a plan without confusion. This is done today in the FEHBP.
<p>
Requirement #3:  They would have to provide information on their benefits, premiums, and patient satisfaction to Medicare. They also would have to adjust premiums by age, geography, etc., but not by health condition.
<p>
Requirement #4:  They would have to contain a core set of benefits, including catastrophic coverage. This also is not unlike the FEHBP. This core benefit package should be leaner than the current Medicare package, enabling individuals to purchase a less expensive plan and pocket the savings. With the help of the defined government contribution, it also would enable the elderly to supplement their basic plans with various services.
<p>
Q:  What would a Medi-Choice system, broadly similar to the FEHBP, mean for the elderly population?
<p>
A:  Elderly Americans would be able to choose the type of private health insurance that meets their individual needs. With advice and counsel from private doctors and family members, they could pick either a basic benefits package or a broader package with a range of services and treatments that are readily available on the open market. Consulting with doctors rather than waiting for approval from government bureaucrats in Washington means that the elderly could enjoy the immediate advantages of state-of-the-art treatments, medical procedures and devices, and service delivery innovations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Financially, America's elderly would be able to pocket any savings from their personal decisions in the form of contributions to Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). While the cost of health care on average is higher for the elderly than for the working population, the level of the government contribution to their health plans also will increase accordingly, based on their age factor. With the establishment of a Medi-Choice system, the powerful market forces of consumer choice and competition should yield the free-market dynamics and positive effects the private sector now enjoys.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After thirty years of existence, Medicare is in crisis. The message -- even from Medicare's own trustees -- could not be clearer:  Without fundamental structural reform, this program will be bankrupt by the year 2002. It is mired in bureaucracy, immune to shifts and changes in the market, and subject to runaway costs that show no sign of slowing down. Furthermore, its 38 million beneficiaries soon will be joined by a huge influx of retirees from the baby boomer generation, severely straining the funds and resources of an already financially troubled system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It is imperative that all retired Americans be afforded the same types of choices and opportunities now enjoyed by retired Members of Congress and all other federal retirees. Allowing private-sector providers to compete freely and fairly for the opportunity to cover the health care concerns of the nation's elderly would reduce the need for a centralized bureaucracy like HCFA. And the pending insolvency crisis could be avoided simply by converting the current defined benefits system into a defined contribution system, broadly similar to the FEHBP.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	America's taxpayers deserve a Medicare system that is financially stable. At the same time, America's elderly deserve an opportunity to choose the health coverage and range of benefits best suited to their individual needs and situations. Only serious structural reform of the Medicare system can accomplish these goals.<p><b>ENDNOTES</b><ol><p><li>

<h2>Comparing Apples With Apples On Medicare</h2>
<h3>By <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/butler.htm ">Stuart M.  Butler</a></h3>
Vice President and Director of Domestic and Economic Policy Studies
</center>
<hr>
<p>
The White House and congressional Democrats have attempted in recent weeks to draw a stark distinction between the Medicare savings projected in the House-Senate Conference Budget Resolution and President Clinton's budget plan, released in June.  Americans are being told that while the President's plan seeks to achieve only $128 billion in savings over the next seven years, the Conference Budget Resolution seeks to achieve $270 billion in savings.  Hence, the impression is created that Congress intends to reduce projected Medicare spending by more than double the amount favored by the White House.
<p>
The facts are quite different.  Because the "baseline" used by the White House is different from the one used by Congress, the comparison made by the White House is the numerical equivalent of comparing apples with oranges.  When the same baseline is used, the savings desired by each end of Pennsylvania Avenue turn out to be much closer.
<p>
A baseline is a projection of spending under current law, using assumptions about utilization, growth of the eligible population, and other factors.  There are savings in a Budget Resolution or a White House budget if the spending targets in the budget document are below the baseline.  Obviously, the level of saving will depend on who develops the baseline and what assumptions they use.
<p>
The reason the White House greatly exaggerates the difference in projected savings between the Administration's plan and that of Congress is that the White House uses a Medicare baseline developed by its own Office of Management and Budget, while Congress uses the baseline developed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (which "scores" all budget-related legislation). 
<p>
Even small differences in assumptions can make a significant difference in a baseline.  For Medicare Part A, for instance, the CBO projects an average annual cost growth of 7.9 percent over the next ten years, while the OMB projects the rate at 7.5 percent.  For Part B, the CBO expects a 12.3 percent growth rate, while the OMB projects only a 10.9 percent growth rate.
<p>
Because the OMB baseline projects a lower rate of Medicare spending under current law than the CBO projects, the savings achieved by any particular budgeted amount for Medicare would seem lower using the OMB baseline instead of the CBO baseline (or, in Washington parlance, a Medicare "cut" looks smaller using the OMB baseline). 
<p>
While there can be a debate about which baseline is a more accurate forecast of Medicare spending under current law, it is clearly very misleading for the White House to use one baseline to score Congress's Medicare plan and another to score its own (especially when that suggests a lower "cut" for the White House plan).
<p>
For Members of Congress and ordinary Americans to compare the two budget proposals, it is thus necessary to provide a comparison using the same baseline.  Doing so, reveals that the projected savings are closer than the White House suggests.
<p>
Using the OMB baseline for the White House plan and the CBO baseline for Congress's plan wrongly implies that the White House wants to reduce future Medicare spending by $128 billion (FY 1996-2002), while Congress intends to reduce it by $270 billion (that is, by $142 billion more than the White House).
<p>
Comparing the two budget plans with the CBO baseline, however, indicates that the White House wants savings of $192 billion, not the $128 billion it claims when comparing its plan with that of Congress.  This makes the difference between the two plans just $78 billion over seven years, not the $142 billion claimed by the White House.  This difference is about half the amount implied by the White House's apples/oranges comparison.
<p>
If the two budgets are compared with the OMB baseline, it is Congress's savings which must be revised down to reflect the lower baseline.  Using this baseline means Congress's savings amount to $205.7 billion (compared with $128 billion for the White House plan, using the same baseline).

<h2>A GUIDE TO MEDICARE REFORM PROPOSALS</h2>
<h3>By John C. Liu<br>
Policy Analyst</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

 When Congress returns from its August recess, it will begin to
consider the future of one of America's most popular entitlement
programs -- Medicare. Much is at stake for Americans of all ages.
<P>
 The Medicare program is in dire financial trouble. According
to the 1995 report of the Medicare Trustees, a seven-member federal
board that includes three Clinton Administration Cabinet members
and two other senior Administration officials, the Hospital Insurance
(HI) Trust Fund is projected to be insolvent by the year 2002.
The need and urgency for change is succinctly stated: "The
Trustees believe that prompt, effective, and decisive action is
necessary." (1)
<P>
 To avoid the collapse of the program, Congress has only two choices:

<P>
<B> Choice #1</B>: Do not change significantly the way Medicare
is run by the government, and assure future benefits by raising
new revenues through higher payroll taxes and other taxes or by
diverting money from other programs. This means Medicare survives
only by draining money from the rest of the budget or by sharply
raising payroll taxes.
<P>
<B> Choice #2</B>: Fundamentally change the way Medicare is run
so that benefits are delivered more efficiently, thereby avoiding
future tax increases or a diversion of money from other programs.
This approach would aim to slow the rate at which costs are anticipated
to grow.
<P>
Several proposals have been put forward in recent months, from
outside Congress, to address the problems of Medicare. During
the August recess, Members and the public can be expected to evaluate
such proposals as they consider what actions should be taken regarding
Medicare when Congress meets to finalize action on the budget.
<P>
 To assist this evaluation, this <I>F.Y.I.</I> summarizes several
of the leading reform proposals. These include plans advanced
by the Clinton Administration, by "think tanks" (the
Brookings Institution, Heritage Foundation, and National Center
for Policy Analysis), by organizations representing the elderly
(the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare
and United Seniors Association), and by major organizations representing
health care providers (the American Hospital Association, American
Medical Association, Federation of American Health Systems, Group
Health Association of America, and Healthcare Leadership Council).
<P>
 This <I>F.Y.I.</I> is intended only to summarize these proposals,
not to evaluate them; as far as possible, documents are quoted
verbatim or paraphrased. Documents used in the summaries may be
obtained from the issuing organizations.
<P>
 While the proposals vary widely in detail, many share common
themes. Only two (the Clinton Administration and the National
Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare) can be described
as leaving the current structure virtually unchanged. The others
tend to emphasize three broad reform themes: 
<P>
<B>1) An option to pick private plans.</B> Virtually all the
reform plans would allow recipients to pick private plans as an
alternative to the traditional Medicare program. Generally this
is seen as a way to improve the quality of care and, by introducing
a much greater degree of consumer choice within a competitive
market, a way to reduce the rate of increase in Medicare spending.
Some proposals would permit beneficiaries to choose plans with
benefits that differ from the current Medicare package (Heritage,
American Medical Association), while others would require the
private plans to contain at least the standard Medicare benefits
(Brookings, NCPA). Virtually all would retain the traditional
Medicare program as an option.
<P>
<B>2) A defined contribution.</B> Virtually all the reform plans
would begin to shift Medicare away from an open-ended program
which pays for a set of benefits (a defined benefit) and toward
a program which makes a financial contribution towards the health
costs of a Medicare beneficiary. This is accomplished in several
ways, such as a budgeted voucher payable to the plan chosen by
the beneficiary (American Medical Association, Heritage) or a
payment linked to the growth in general health care costs (Brookings,
NCPA). Like the general option to pick private insurance in place
of traditional Medicare, moving to a defined contribution system
is intended to change fundamentally the incentives in the program,
encouraging beneficiaries to seek better value for money.
<P>
<B>3) The FEHBP as a model for reform.</B> While virtually all
the reform plans propose some form of new or revised administrative
structure to organize and monitor a Medicare market of competing
private health plans, several proposals (American Medical Association,
Federation of American Health Systems, Heritage) adopt as an administrative
model the program currently serving federal workers, retirees,
and dependents. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program
(FEHBP) organizes a market of almost 400 private plans competing
for the business of over nine million Americans. (2)<p>

<h4>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</h4>
<P>
<I>The following is a summary of the Medicare proposals outlined
by the Clinton Administration on June 13, 1995, when the Administration
unveiled a second budget blueprint. Specific details on the proposal
have not yet been made available.</I>
<P>
 The President's plan to restore the fiscal integrity of the Medicare
trust fund aims to reduce the growth in spending in Medicare Part
A by $79 billion over seven years to ensure the solvency of the
Medicare HI Trust Fund to 2005. These savings are based on the
Office of Management and Budget's projection of Medicare spending
under current law. (The savings to be achieved would be higher
if the Congressional Budget Office baseline is used).
<P>
  The White House plan aims to achieve such savings by reducing
the growth of payments to providers, not by raising beneficiary
costs. In fact, the Administration's proposal reduces the same
beneficiary costs by eliminating the copayment for mammograms.
The White House notes that only 14 percent of eligible beneficiaries
without supplemental insurance schedule mammograms. One factor,
say officials, is the required 20 percent copayment. To remove
financial barriers to women seeking preventive mammograms, the
President's plan waives the Medicare copayment.
<P>
 The President's plan would expand managed care options for retirees
to include variants such as preferred provider organizations (PPOs)
and point-of-service (POS) plans. The plan also seeks to improve
Medicare reimbursement of managed care plans, including a competitive
bidding demonstration proposal. 
<P>
 Finally, the Clinton proposal aims to combat fraud and abuse,
in part through an "Operation Restore Trust," a five-state
demonstration project targeting fraud and abuse in the home health
care, nursing home, and durable medical equipment industries.
The President's budget proposal increases funding for these fraud
and abuse activities.

<h3>RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS</h3><p>

<h4>AARON AND REISCHAUER (OF THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION)</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes a proposal put forward on July 20,
1995, by Henry J. Aaron and Robert D. Reischauer of the Brookings
Institution (3). Reischauer until recently was Director of the Congressional
Budget Office.</I>
<P>
 Like other policymakers, Aaron and Reischauer have defined several
goals and principles around which Medicare reform should revolve.

<P>
 First, Medicare reform should encompass the full package of benefits
most Medicare beneficiaries use.
<P>
 Second, "a reformed Medicare program should not result in
the provision of health care to the elderly and disabled of a
quality materially different from that available to the general
population; nor should the delivery system for the elderly and
disabled be segregated from that of the rest of the population
(other than for definable services where medical reasons justify
separate delivery, as with geriatric care)." 
<P>
 Third, "Medicare should create incentives for beneficiaries
to seek care from efficient plans and should encourage physicians
and hospitals to provide care of given quality at lowest possible
costs."
<P>
 Fourth, "Medicare beneficiaries should have a degree of
choice among health plans similar to that enjoyed by the rest
of the population."
<P>
 Aaron and Reischauer believe the current Medicare program should
be converted from a defined benefits program (service reimbursement
system) into a form of defined contribution program (premium support
system). Instead of paying for all services on a predetermined
list, Medicare would pay a defined and set sum toward the purchase
of an insurance policy that provides a defined set of services.
"As with private insurance for the working population, plans
could reimburse any provider the patient chooses on a fee-for-service
basis (the current method Medicare uses for most beneficiaries),
contract with a preferred provider organization, or operate through
a health maintenance organization."  These plans could manage
care in any of the ways they currently practice or adjust as necessary
for changes that may occur in the future. In short, every "Medicare
beneficiary would receive a pre-determined, geographically variable
amount that would be applied toward the purchase of a health plan
providing defined services." 
<P>
 Health plans participating in the new program would be required
to offer a defined set of services. While the new Medicare plan
would not use the current Medicare benefits package as a model,
it would add prescription drug and catastrophic coverage. Aaron
and Reischauer believe that a standard benefits package is necessary
because it will enable enrollees to compare the cost and quality
of the various plans while reducing the risk of instability in
the insurance market from plans altering benefits in an effort
to attract healthier enrollees. 
<P>
<B> Marketing.</B> Health plans choosing to participate in the
new plan (commercial insurance companies, Blue Cross/Blue Shield
plans, HMOs, PPOs, non-managed care networks) would be invited
to submit bids on the standard benefit package for the "average"
Medicare enrollee within a particular marketing area. The federal
Medicare contribution to help the enrollee defray the cost of
a plan in each market area would be the same regardless of which
plan the Medicare enrollee chose. To ensure that Medicare enrollees
are well-informed of their various options, local marketing organizations
would be established to handle the sale of insurance and act as
consumer advocates. As in the FEHBP, enrollees would choose a
health plan for the upcoming year on an annual enrollment basis.
<P>
 Health plans would receive risk-adjusted payments from Medicare
based on age, gender, disability status, and other health indicators.
<P>
<B> Premium Contribution.</B> The initial federal payment would
be set at 95 percent of the cost of the current Medicare package
in the enrollee's market area. The size of the payment would be
adjusted to exclude direct medical education, indirect medical
education, and disproportionate share payments. It is projected
that during a phase-in period of five to ten years, the federal
payment would grow more slowly than projected budget baseline
costs. Later, the federal Medicare payment would grow at the same
rate as per capita spending on health care for the non-elderly
population. Aaron and Reischauer contend that while this formula
is somewhat rigid and will require periodic adjustments, it is
more than likely that such an approach will yield appreciable
savings over the projected baselines. The authors believe that
as the competitive marketplace develops and enrollees become more
comfortable with choosing their own health plans, the difference
between the federal payment and the cost of insurance could be
rebated to participants as non-taxable income or shared between
the government and participants.
<P>
 The authors believe that even under the most optimistic scenario,
it will take several years for the necessary institutional infrastructure
to develop and become operational. The authors believe that the
current Medicare system should be run concurrently with the new
choice-oriented proposal. But the new system would be mandatory
for everyone who turns 65 and becomes eligible for Medicare at
a date to be determined. Current Medicare enrollees would have
the option of staying in the traditional program or moving into
the new system.
<P>
 Echoing the sentiments of the public trustees of the Medicare
program, and like the authors of most other plans, Aaron and Reischauer
call for the consolidation of Parts A and B.

<h4>THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes Heritage Foundation <a href= "bg1038.html">Backgrounder No.
1038, "What to Do About Medicare,"</a> by Stuart M. Butler,
Robert E. Moffit, and John C. Liu, dated June 26, 1995.</I> 
<P>
 To control costs while improving value and choices for beneficiaries,
The Heritage Foundation advocates a conversion of the Medicare
program into a system in which the government provides beneficiaries
with a defined contribution that may be used either to purchase
a Medicare-approved private health plan or to remain within the
traditional health care program. This system would be, in effect,
a modified version of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program
(FEHBP), which currently makes 400 competing private plans available
to nine million active and retired federal employees and their
family members.
<P>
 The Heritage Foundation envisions a new Medicare system structured
much like the successful FEHBP, but with modifications that refine
the government contribution to make the new program even less
susceptible to adverse selection effects that the FEHBP is and
provide beneficiaries with better information on which to make
choices. The new program would have four basic elements:
<P>
 First, elderly and disabled Americans would have an entitlement
not to a defined set of benefits, but to a voucher worth an amount
based on a number of factors. The total federal expenditure for
the voucher system would be limited to a program budget, with
the voucher amount adjusted each year according to the budget.
To achieve the target for Medicare in the congressional budget
resolution, the Heritage Plan proposes that expenditures for the
voucher be permitted to grow 7 percent in the year of enactment
and 5.6 percent each year thereafter. 
<P>
 Second, the base for the voucher amount would be budgeted Medicare
expenditures (combined net expenditures for Parts A and B) divided
by the eligible population. This base would be adjusted up or
down according to three basic categories:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Primary risk factors, including age, gender, reason for eligibility
(age or disability), institutional status, and End-Stage Renal
Dialysis (ESRD) status.
<li>An income adjustment applied to one-third of the voucher, to
be the equivalent of means-testing today's Part B premium.
<li>A local market variance, to reflect the weighted average enrollee
cost of a "basket" of typical plans in any area. This
would permit adjustments to reflect the cost of approved plans
available in the area. This basket would consist of "typical"
plans, such as the Medicare Standard Plan (see below), a catastrophic
/MSA plan, a Blue Cross standard plan, and a comprehensive HMO
plan. This is a refinement of the "big six" formula used by the Office of Personnel Management to set the government contribution to the FEHBP. Since the plans would have to submit detailed information on their prices and benefits before the annual open season, this adjustment would reflect the actual future market
the beneficiary would encounter in the following year.
</ol>
<P>
 Third, in order to be permitted to sell insurance to Medicare
participants, health plans would have to meet certain threshold
requirements. Beyond these, they could offer varieties of benefits
and delivery systems. There would be no restriction on the number
of plans. To be Medicare approved, a plan must:<p>
<ul>
<li>Have a license to issue health insurance in the state or obtain
approval from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

<li>Provide services in a service area acceptable to HHS.

<li>Meet minimum solvency requirements.

<li>Include a core set of basic coverage determined by legislation.
The basic package would have to cover "medically necessary"
acute medical services, including physician services; inpatient,
outpatient, and emergency hospital services; and inpatient prescription
drugs, with a catastrophic stop-loss amount for these services.
A plan thus could offer a much leaner package than today's Medicare
program (although it would have to provide catastrophic protection,
unlike Medicare today), but it could offer a range of services
beyond the base coverage. For example, some plans might offer
dental benefits, or drug coverage, or an MSA. States would be
preempted from mandating additional benefits for plans serving
the Medicare population. The Medicare Standard Plan (see below)
initially would provide the services available today under Medicare
Parts A and B. This Standard Plan would not be required to add
catastrophic protection unless its board chose to do so or Congress
required such a change in benefits.

<li>File with HHS a standardized statement of benefits (exclusions,
copayments); a table of rates for the same actuarial categories
used to determine Medicare benefits (age, institutional status);
and consumer information as determined by a consumer advisory
board. This information might include the results of enrollee
satisfaction questionnaires, turnover rates, average out-of-pocket
costs paid in the previous year by enrollees for the treatment
of certain illnesses, and perhaps ratings by certain organizations.
This price, benefit, and consumer information also would be available
to any Medicare beneficiary upon request.

<li>Accept and continue coverage for any Medicare beneficiary applying
during an annual "open season," or for any newly eligible
beneficiaries, unless the plan receives a waiver from HHS because
of capacity concerns. This requirement would apply to plans marketed
by affinity organizations, such as churches, unions, or elderly
groups, not merely to plans marketed by insurers or provider organizations.
</ul>
<P>
 Fourth, the government's role in the new system would be kept
to a minimum. Under the new program, HHS no longer would be allowed
to regulate the prices charged by providers; instead it would
take on "umpire" functions more like those being carried
out by OPM in the FEHBP system. The government, however, would
have three important roles:
<P>
<ol>
<li>The government would establish a federal corporation, governed
by an appointed board, to run a Medicare Standard Plan similar
to the current Medicare program. The Standard Plan would be available
in all markets, and the board would set premium prices to meet
long-term solvency requirements. Subject to congressional approval,
the board could adjust benefits, out-of-pocket costs, and payment
levels in the Standard Plan.

<li> As an alternative, the Standard Plan could be the traditional
Medicare program, without a set premium and funded directly rather
than by vouchers. While this alternative might have political
advantages, however, the lack of a premium would make it more
difficult for beneficiaries to compare the Standard Plan with
competing private plans.

<li>HCFA would calculate the voucher amount for each beneficiary,
setting that amount after the plans had filed their price and
benefit information for the following year.

<li>HHS would conduct a Medicare open season, much as OPM does for
the FEHBP. Before open season, Medicare beneficiaries would receive
an information kit from HHS, including the amount of their voucher
and standardized information on prices, benefits, and consumer
satisfaction for Medicare-approved plans in their area, including
the Standard Plan. Beneficiaries also would receive a selection
form on which to indicate their choice. Once the selection had
been made, HCFA would send the beneficiary's voucher to the chosen
plan. The beneficiary would be responsible for any difference
between the voucher and the premium costs, but could elect to
have the government pay that difference and reduce his or her
Social Security check (similar to the Medicare Part B option today).
If the voucher amount exceeded the plan's premium, the difference
would be deposited by HCFA into a Medical Savings Account of the
beneficiary's choice. Disbursements from MSA accounts could be
used only for medical expenditures eligible for the Internal Revenue
Service Schedule A tax deduction.
</ol>
<P>
 Under The Heritage Foundation proposal, Medicare would operate
much as the FEHBP serves federal workers and retirees. Medicare
beneficiaries would be able to pick a private plan which included
the services they wanted (beyond the core package), delivered
in the way they wanted and, if they wished, through an organization
with which they were affiliated (as many FEHBP enrollees do).
Or they could decide to apply their voucher to the premium of
the Medicare Standard Plan. Because beneficiaries would receive
a voucher for a specific amount (paid directly to the plan of
their choice), they would have a strong economic incentive to
pick the plan that best met their objectives of price, quality,
and services.
<P>
 The organization of services, selection of benefits, and payments
to providers would be in the hands of plan managers competing
for enrollees. Unlike the federal officials managing Medicare
today, these managers would have the freedom and the financial
incentive to experiment with new ways to deliver care at a competitive
price. The voucher approach would give all plans an incentive
to strive for the best pricing and not consider the voucher as
a floor price.

<I> Unless otherwise noted, the following summarizes publications
issued by the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis.</I> (4)
<P>
 The National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA) has developed
a proposal to allow "the elderly to withdraw their share
of funds from Medicare, including Parts A and B, and purchase
their coverage from any alternative private source they may prefer." (6)
 These private plans from which seniors may choose include a Medical
Savings Account (MSA), a health maintenance organization (HMO),
or an employer's health plan. Since present and future retirees
would have an option of staying in traditional Medicare or choosing
a private plan, the NCPA proposal "creates new options without
eliminating existing ones."
<P>
 Under the NCPA proposal, the Medicare program would make a payment
to the MSA or private plan of an enrollee's choice to help cover
the costs of care or insurance premiums. The "premium payment"
would be adjusted to reflect the enrollee's age, gender, geographic
location, and health status. Older and sicker enrollees would
receive more financial assistance from the program to purchase
private insurance. 
<P>
 For a private health plan to be eligible to participate in the
new program, it would have to offer a base package, which would
be the existing level of benefits and services currently covered
under traditional Medicare. These plans are not precluded from
offering additional benefits or charging additional premiums to
cover these costs. Private insurers covering Medicare would be
subject to guaranteed issue requirements and would have to provide
coverage to any applicant currently on Medicare, regardless of
health status. A significant aspect of the NCPA proposal is that
private health plans would not be required to accept patients
from other private plans covering Medicare beneficiaries but would
have to accept individuals transferring from the traditional Medicare
program.
<P>
 The NCPA proposal emphasizes the use of Medical Savings Accounts
(MSAs). One of the private options envisioned would be to couple
a catastrophic policy with a Medical Savings Account. Based on
the requirement that all private plans would have to offer the
current Medicare package as a minimum package, all catastrophic
policies would have to offer the same services currently in Medicare.
Contributions to an MSA would be applied against medical expenses
under the particular catastrophic plan's deductible. In addition
to the Medicare contributions being deposited into an MSA, retirees
could direct further deposits to the MSA beyond the payment made
on their behalf by Medicare. While additional funds that are contributed
to the MSA would receive no tax relief, the interest build up
and subsequent withdrawals for health expenses would be tax-free.
The NCPA proposal requires that during a 12-month insurance period,
MSA funds be used only for medical expenditures. However, funds
remaining at the end of the year could be withdrawn tax-free for
any other purpose as well. 
<P>
 The NCPA proposal is intended to slow Medicare's rate of growth.
One option offered by NCPA is to cap the rate of growth as determined
by congressional budgetary targets. Another option would be to
set the growth rate "equal to the rate of growth of private
sector spending on the theory that working taxpayers should not
have to bear the burden of Medicare taxes growing at a faster
rate than their own private health insurance."  A possible
mechanism to achieve this reduction in growth, besides the cost-reducing
incentives created by the voucher mechanism, would be to raise
the current deductible level for Medicare beneficiaries in addition
to increases in copayment-payment fees for services. Low-income
households would be exempted from these increases under the NCPA
proposal.

<h3>RETIREE GROUPS</h3>
<P>
<h4>NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes testimony presented by the organization's
President, Martha McSteen, on July 19, 1995, before the House
Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health.</I>
<P>
 The National Committee believes that the Medicare program has
been a "remarkable success story" and that the private
market's record on coverage of individuals and cost containment
is inferior when compared to Medicare's. The provision of vouchers
to the nation's elderly and disabled to purchase private insurance
is "a type of reform which may well undermine Medicare and
threaten the health security of seniors and the disabled."
 The National Committee is opposed to allowing the nation's elderly
the choice of opting out of the current Medicare program and choosing
a health insurance plan on the private market. While increasing
choice is acceptable to the National Committee, such choices must
be within the current Medicare framework of a defined set of standardized
benefits.
<P>
 The National Committee supports the following principles/proposals
which it believes would secure Medicare's long term stability.
It is the Committee's belief that if all its proposals are enacted
into law, savings of $150 billion in the Medicare Part A Trust
Fund would occur and the rate of growth in Medicare Part B spending
would slow. Specifically, the National Committee calls for Congress
to:
<P>
<ol>
<li><b>Adopt</b> certain elements of the Clinton Administration's budget
proposal. President Clinton proposes to save $10 billion over
five years by making permanent several temporary provisions in
current law, including the setting of Part B premiums at 25 percent.
Other provisions include extending Medicare secondary payer provisions
and permanently lowering payments to home health agencies and
nursing homes.

<li><b>Extend</b> Medicare coverage to state and local government employees.
This is expected to raise $7 billion over five years. 

<li><b>Increase</b> the tobacco tax. The National Committee supports an
increase in the tobacco tax to $2 per package. This would raise
$15 billion a year for Medicare Part A, in addition to $1.5 billion
for medical research.

<li><b>Reevaluate</b> Medicare payments for hospital capital costs and graduate
medical education. The National Committee believes that a reevaluation
could save between $7 billion and $23 billion over five years.

<li><b>Reduce</b> payments to hospitals for outpatient surgery and radiology.
According to a recent HHS study, payments to hospitals for outpatient
surgery and radiology have been excessive because of the formula
for determining such payments. Savings of $20 billion over five
years can be realized, says the National Committee, if a change
to the formula or payment structure is made. Such savings should
be directed toward lowering beneficiaries' copayments for these
services.

<li><b>Introduce</b> stricter utilization review and a streamlining of Medicare
administrative costs. While the National Committee believes that
Medicare has an excellent record on administrative costs, averaging
two percent of program outlays, it believes that further reforms
can improve on this success, including the combining of Part A
and Part B.

<li><b>Increase</b> the eligibility age. The National Committee supports
increasing the eligibility age for Medicare by tying it to eligibility
for Social Security benefits. While the rationale behind such
a proposal is to procure savings in the federal budget, no figures
or estimates were provided by the National Committee in its testimony.

<h4>UNITED SENIORS ASSOCIATION, INC.</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes a publication issued by USA, Inc.,
entitled "A Proposal for Reform:  Resolving the Medicare
Crisis."</I> <6>
<P>
 The United Seniors Association is an organization voicing the
sentiment of senior citizens from across the country who support
the American free enterprise system. Unlike the other national
organizations purporting to advance the interest of seniors, USA,
Inc. does not receive federal funding to lobby Congress. USA,
Inc. has put together the following principles it believes should
guide Medicare reform. 
<P>
<b>First</b>, there should be no tax increases. Therefore, the current
HI payroll tax of 2.9 percent should not be raised. Increases
are unnecessary, says USA, Inc., because revenues from this source
would increase over time as the rate of growth for household incomes
increases. 
<P>
<b>Second</b>, Medicare premiums should not be allowed to increase at
a rate faster than the rate of general economic growth. USA, Inc.
believes this would protect the elderly from facing a potentially
large increase in future premiums, which could happen under current
law.
<P>
<b>Third</b>, USA, Inc. calls for synchronizing eligibility for Medicare
benefits with the retirement age for Social Security. Under current
law, the retirement age for Social Security benefits is to rise
from 65 to 66 between 2000 to 2005, and from 66 to 67 between
2011 and 2022. Thus, under the USA, Inc. plan, future retirees
would not be eligible to receive Medicare benefits until these
later ages.
<P>
 While future expenditures would be reduced, no estimate is provided
of how much the federal government would save. 
<P>
<b>Fourth</b>, USA, Inc. actually proposes to raise the retirement age
sooner and push back the eligibility age even further. Under the
proposal, the retirement age would be delayed three months for
every year starting in 1996, until it reached 70. The rationale
for this change is that longer life expectancies, coupled with
the pending retirement of the baby boomer generation, will produce
a heavy strain on the Medicare program under the current financing
scheme. USA, Inc. believes that keeping individuals privately
insured until age 70, using a combination of employer-provided
insurance and previous savings, would help alleviate the financial
pressures facing the HI trust fund and the overall Medicare program.
<P>
 Fifth, any reform of Medicare must include a restructuring of
the benefit package. Specifically, the Medicare benefit package
must conform to the resources available to finance the program.
Under the USA, Inc. proposal, the Medicare benefit package would
be adjusted annually so that the program does not spend above
the revenues coming in from the HI payroll tax, Part B premiums,
and general revenues (taxes). 
<P>
<b>Sixth</b>, the USA, Inc. proposal calls for an expansion of Individual
Retirement Accounts for retirement medical purposes. This proposal
allows every individual to contribute up to $1,000 per year to
an IRA. While these contributions would be subject to applicable
taxes, the interest would accumulate tax-free and withdrawals
after age 65 would be tax-free for medical and non-medical expenses.
The impact the proposal would have on the federal deficit and
the budget is not estimated. 
<P>
<b>Finally</b>, health insurance vouchers would be provided to the elderly
population below the poverty level.

<h3>PROVIDER GROUPS</h3>
<P>
<h4>AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes testimony before the House Ways and
Means Committee on July 19, 1995, by Richard Davidson, President
of the American Hospital Association.</I>
<P>
 The American Hospital Association includes in its membership
some 5,000 hospitals, health care systems, networks, and other
providers of care. While the AHA has not come forward with a concrete
legislative proposal, it has testified before the various congressional
committees with jurisdiction over Medicare. The AHA has outlined
four principles that it believes Congress should adopt in reforming
the Medicare program: <p>
<P>
<ol>

<li>"Change the delivery system to encourage more use of coordinated
care  -- cooperating groups of hospitals, doctors, and others
who knit the fragmented delivery system together for patients
and have powerful incentives to control costs."

<li>"Change the process by which Medicare benefit and funding
decisions are made."

<li>"Make sure all stakeholders absorb spending reductions."

<li>"Ensure access to high-quality health care for the nation's
most vulnerable populations -- the elderly, poor and disabled."
</ol>
<P>
<B> Changing the Delivery System.</B> According to the AHA's testimony,
"The key is to restructure Medicare to encourage more use
of coordinated care. Coordinated care is working in the private
sector, and it can work in Medicare as well."  The AHA believes
that higher utilization of coordinated care will result in improved
quality because an entire network of providers will be held accountable
for a patient's care. Furthermore, coordinated care networks emphasize
preventive care, and this leads to reduced costs. 
<P>
 Some examples of changes in the delivery system endorsed by the
AHA:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Expanding the types of plans that Medicare beneficiaries can choose.
Among other options, according to the AHA, Medicare should contract
with the growing number of non-managed care networks that also
meet high standards for quality and public accountability and
are able to offer a full range of services for a pre-determined
premium. Under the AHA approach, these non-managed care networks
would share the risk with the Medicare program.

<li><B> Providing seniors with more information on health care plans.</B>
Sending the elderly an annual report that compares coordinated
care (managed care and non-managed care) plans and fee-for-service
plans on the basis of quality, cost sharing, premiums, deductibles,
and benefits will enable them to make sound and informed decisions.

<li><B> Allowing for open enrollment on an annual basis.</B> The FEHBP
allows all federal employees to choose their own health insurance
plans each year. The AHA wants Medicare-eligible patients to be
given the same opportunity. The federal government makes a fixed
maximum contribution toward the health plan of an employee's choice,
and the AHA believes Medicare should do the same for its beneficiaries.

<li><B> Eliminating barriers that discourage creation of coordinated
care networks</B> by inhibiting provider cooperation -- the heart
of coordinated care. For example, the AHA wants Congress to:
<P>
<ol>
<li><B> Modify the physician self-referral law.</B> While the original
goal of deterring physicians from referring patients for unneeded
services based on financial arrangements remains valid, it is
overreaching in today's environment. The physician self-referral
law, says the AHA, is as an impediment to hospitals, physicians,
and other health care providers that are trying to work together
by eliminating duplication of services. Since coordinated systems
require varying levels of referrals and financial arrangements,
this law should be reviewed and reformed.

<li><B> Reject "any willing provider" and mandatory "point
of service" requirements.</B> All health care providers qualified
to be in a network should receive fair and reasonable consideration,
according to the AHA. At the same time, networks must continue
to have high standards for the number, type, and location of providers
made available to enrollees. The AHA believes that forcing a plan
to include any health provider regardless of practice patterns
or history would not be in the patients' best interest. Instead,
the AHA holds firm in its belief that for networks to provide
efficient and effective coordinated care, they must be able to
retain their autonomy in choosing providers that will work best
within their particular goals and objectives.
</ol>
</ul>
<P>
<B> Independent Citizens' Commission on Medicare.</B> The AHA
believes that creation of an independent citizens' commission
on Medicare will serve in several important ways to retain the
integrity of the Medicare program. "While Congress ultimately
must be held accountable,"  the AHA believes that an independent
bipartisan commission should assess each year how much money is
needed to maintain the current program. Congress would review
the commission's recommendations and set its own target through
the regular budget process. The commission also would be charged
with holding public hearings, translating the congressional budget
targets into recommendations for a benefit package and provider
payment rates that would be presented to Congress for an up-or-down
vote (much like the base closing commission's report).
<P>
<B> Shared Responsibility.</B> The AHA believes that reducing
the budget deficit and ensuring the financial solvency of the
Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund requires shared responsibility.
To accomplish this, the AHA endorses a plan which will require
everyone with a stake in Medicare -- hospitals, health systems,
physicians and other providers, and beneficiaries -- to share
the financial task of restoring the solvency of the HI fund. This
means that changes in benefits, beneficiary cost sharing, eligibility,
program revenues, and provider payments all must be included.
Further reductions directed solely at providers are not viewed
by the AHA as reliable and effective solutions. To bolster this
point, the AHA notes that despite spending reductions of approximately
$48 billion in Medicare hospital payments since 1988, Medicare
continues to grow by approximately 11 percent each year. The AHA
adds that for Medicare inpatient and outpatient care combined,
1993 Prospective Payment Assessment Commission data show hospitals
losing 11 cents on each dollar it cost them to provide care. 
<P>
 If Congress adopted proposals which procured savings only by
cutting provider reimbursements, the AHA estimates that by the
year 2000, Medicare inpatient operating margins for hospitals
could fall to <I>negative</I> 20.6 percent. Every type of hospital
(rural, urban, large, small, teaching, and non-teaching) would
be hurt, according to the AHA. To balance the reductions in Medicare
payments, says the AHA, hospitals would have to continue to pass
this loss in revenue on to other payers (non-Medicare patients
and their employers).
<P>
<B> Ensuring Access for the Nation's Most Vulnerable.</B> In its
testimony before Congress, the AHA reiterated a strong commitment
to ensuring access for the elderly and disabled. The AHA believes
that health plans should not be able to exclude individuals based
on where they reside; nor should they be excluded systematically
based on their previous health status or potential need for services.

<h4>AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION </h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes a draft proposal by the American Medical
Association entitled "Transforming Medicare and other Budget
Proposals," dated June 22, 1995.</I>
<P>
 The American Medical Association argues for a voucher type approach
in the Medicare program. As far back as 1986, the AMA endorsed
a voucher for all Medicare-eligible Americans to use in purchasing
health insurance. In its most recent proposal, the AMA proposes
to transform Medicare into a system which emphasizes personal
responsibility and choice. The AMA estimates that its proposal
will save $162.2 billion over a seven-year period, based on an
analysis conducted for the AMA by Price Waterhouse. The AMA believes
that if its plan was enacted and continued through Fiscal Year
2002, it would keep the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund
(Part A) solvent for at least the next 15 years. 
<P>
 Under the AMA proposal, all Medicare-eligible individuals will
be allowed to choose to participate in the current Medicare program
or in the optional "Medichoice" program. For those remaining
in the "traditional Medicare" program, there will be
changes in how the program is financed. These changes would: 
<P>
<ol>
<li>Abolish current HI and SMI deductible and copayment requirements;
<li>Retain one-half of this new amount as a Part A insurance premium
for the reduced cost-sharing requirements;
<li>Establish a Beneficiary Escrow Account (BEA) for each enrollee
to accumulate the remainder of the supplemental amount as it is
received from the enrollee each month;
<li>Charge each BEA beneficiary with benefit payments made on his
or her behalf during the year;
<li>Refund to each enrollee any balance remaining in the BEA that
exceeds benefit payments made on his or her behalf during the
year;
<li>Exempt Medicare beneficiaries eligible for Medicaid and other
"qualified" beneficiaries from the requirement to contribute
the extra amount; and

<li>Reduce the contribution required of Medicare beneficiaries who
have incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty level. The amount
of the reduction will equal 100 percent minus the percent by which
the beneficiary's income exceeds the poverty level. For example,
a beneficiary with an income at 125 percent of the poverty level
would have his all-inclusive deductible reduced by 50 percent.
Physicians will be prohibited from charging beneficiaries with
incomes less than 200 percent of poverty more than the amount
reimbursed by the Health Care Financing Administration (HFCA).
(A mechanism should be established for beneficiaries to establish
their eligibility for this preferential treatment.)
</ol>
<P>
 Enrollees who choose to participate in the Medichoice program
will receive for the following calendar year the appropriate actuarial
value of their Medicare benefits, less the annual amount of any
HI (Hospital Insurance, or Part A) and/or SMI (Supplemental Medical
Insurance, or Part B) payments they otherwise would have to make.
This is the "defined government contribution."  A beneficiary
who chooses the Medichoice option will not be required to pay
the HI/SMI premiums which he/she otherwise would be obligated
to pay for traditional Medicare coverage during the period of
Medichoice enrollment. The enrollee opting for Medichoice picks
a private plan meeting certain conditions. 
<P>
 According to the AMA, the plans must include the following: 
<P>
<ul>
<li><B>Health Benefit Plan Requirements.</B> Any plan may participate
in the Medichoice program provided it meets certain minimum standards
adapted to apply to the Medichoice program from the provisions
governing chapter 89 of title 5, U.S.C., and 5 CFR 890.201 (FEHBP
minimum standard requirements). (7)

<li><B>Types of Benefits.</B> Plans participating in the Medichoice
system must comply with similar guidelines governing the FEHBP
(5 U.S.C. 8904). Benefits covered include payment for or direct
provision of hospital care, surgical care and treatment, medical
care and treatment, obstetrical benefits, health prevention services,
prescribed drugs, medicines, and prosthetic devices, and other
medical supplies and services.

<li><B>Health Benefit Plans.</B> Health benefit plans participating
in the Medichoice program may be of the following types:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Traditional Health Benefit Plans. Plans offering benefits under
which payments for services are calculated according to the usual,
customary, and reasonable fees or charges prevailing in the community
in which a beneficiary obtains services from physicians, hospitals,
or other providers of health services.

<li>Benefit Payment Schedule Plans. Plans offering benefits under
which certain sums of money, enumerated in a schedule of benefits
provided under the plan, are paid to beneficiaries for services
obtained from physicians, hospitals, or other providers of health
services. 

<li>Prepaid Comprehensive Medical Plans. Health Maintenance Organizations
(HMOs), Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), or other plans
which offer comprehensive health benefits on a prepaid basis.

<li>Medical Savings Account Plans. Plans which offer catastrophic
medical expense insurance in combination with establishing a Medical
Savings Account (MSA):

<ul>
<li>Allowed annual deposits to an MSA are limited to the value of
the annual government contribution amount. Part of the funds must
be applied toward purchase of a high-deductible catastrophic insurance
policy each year which must cover the types of services provided
by the FEHBP program.

<li>Contributions to an MSA equal to the value of the government
contribution amount should be exempt from federal and state income
taxation.

<li>Distributions from a beneficiary's MSA should be exempt from
federal and state income tax if used for medical expenses, health
insurance premiums, and long-term care.

<li>Interest and dividend earnings on MSA balances should be exempt
from federal and state income tax while they remain in the account.

<li>Other provisions relating to MSAs held by Medicare beneficiaries
will be governed by rules applicable to IRAs, except that mandatory
withdrawal at a certain age is not applicable to MSAs held by
Medicare beneficiaries.</ul>

<li>Enrollment in Medichoice. Patients choosing the "Medichoice"
option would have access to a wide range of plans similar to those
offered by the FEHBP. Each person would receive:
<ul>
<li>Advance notice of the government's contribution (to be determined
actuarially) toward the cost of Medichoice plans;

<li>Information and rates on plans in the individual's area to assist
"value comparison;" and

<li>A Medichoice election and enrollment form (available on attaining
Medicare eligibility and on an annualized basis).
</ul>
</ol>
</ul>
<P>
 
<P>
Patients would pay the difference when the plan costs exceed the
government contribution or keep the savings when the government
contribution exceeds the plan costs.

<h4>FEDERATION OF AMERICAN HEALTH SYSTEMS</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes proposals for Medicare reform presented
in testimony before the House Committee on Commerce, Subcommittee
on Health and Environment, on July 18, 1995, by Tom Scully, President
of the Federation of American Health Systems.</I>
<P>
 The Federation of American Health Systems is an association representing
1,700 for-profit hospitals. 
<P>
 The Federation argues that while Medicare is in dire need of
reform, it must come in the form of substantive restructuring
in addition to spending reductions. This restructuring means a
new and privatized payment system. While the Federation is opposed
to the level of Medicare budget targets proposed by Congress,
it believes the best way to achieve those goals is to transform
Medicare from a defined benefit program into one of a defined
contribution. 
<P>
 According to the Federation, the best model for a privatized
system is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP).
By offering beneficiaries the flexibility to purchase health plans
with the assistance of a voucher, and by providing financial incentives
to use their medical coverage wisely, says the Federation, Congress
can slow the rate at which the Medicare program is increasing.
Instead of traditional cuts in Medicare, which take the form of
price controls on providers of health care, competition in the
health care market would drive down costs in a restructured program,
just as it has in the private sector. 
<P>
 The benefits of moving Medicare toward a defined contribution
system, says the Federation, are the significant savings the federal
government can achieve and the higher quality of benefits that
the nation's seniors would obtain. Implementing a privatized system
would take several years. "The Federation has advocated a
smooth transition to this system. From 1996 to 2000, all seniors
could opt to stay in the traditional Medicare program or voluntarily
choose a private plan. After 2000, all seniors would choose plans
in a system like FEHBP, where all plans, including traditional
Medicare, received a defined contribution (from the government)." (8)

<P>
 The Federation firmly believes that the free-market forces of
consumer choice and competition, not price controls through federal
regulation, are needed to reduce spending in health care efficiently.
Competition would require health care providers to give value
and better quality for the health care dollars the elderly would
be spending. Furthermore, the Federation is adamant that "if
funding is to be removed from the system, we'd prefer to adjust
and streamline in response to a local market that creates rational
incentives, not cuts in the current Medicare price setting system
that already has created thousands of perverse incentives that
produce only inefficiency."

<h4>GROUP HEALTH ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA</h4>
<P>
<I>Unless otherwise noted, the following summarizes testimony
before the House Committee on Commerce, Subcommittee on Health
and Environment, by Karen Ignani, President of the GHAA, on July
18, 1995.</I>
<P>
 The Group Health Association of America (GHAA) is the leading
national association representing health maintenance organizations
(HMOs). Their 385 member HMOs serve 80 percent of the 50 million
Americans receiving health care through HMOs.
<P>
 The GHAA supports a Medicare reform proposal that would allow
enrollees to choose from various health plans currently "available
to millions of working Americans both in the private sector and
federal government:  Medicare should be reoriented toward a model
in which Medicare beneficiaries have the opportunity to choose
from among a broad array of options that compete on the basics
of quality, service, and cost, and are held to comparable accountability
standards." (9)
<P>
 In coming up with a set of principles and design for such a reform,
the GHAA looked at the experiences of its member plans in both
the private and public (federal government) sectors, including
the approximately three million Medicare beneficiaries enrolled
in managed care plans.
<P>
 The crux of the GHAA's proposed reform is to facilitate the expansion
of existing Medicare markets, encourage the creation of new Medicare
markets, and ensure the viability and solvency of various health
plans so they may absorb the increased capacity of future enrollees.
In general, the GHAA recommends changes in the following five
areas that would:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Improve beneficiary information, awareness, and enrollment process.

<li>Expand the infrastructure of health plan choices available to
beneficiaries.

<li>Maintain strong standards for health plans participating in Medicare.

<li>Begin to transition HCFA from the current regulatory approach
to the beneficiary choice model.

<li>Transition to improved Medicare payment methodologies.
</ol>
<P>
<B>Improving beneficiary information, awareness, and enrollment
process:</B> It is imperative, says the GHAA, in order to allow
beneficiaries to make well-informed decisions about their health
plans, that the information be made readily available and easy
to understand. To do so, the Health Care Financing Administration
(HCFA) should work with health plans participating in the Medicare
program to develop educational information for beneficiaries.
Basic characteristics of the various options, including services
and benefits covered, premiums, deductibles, copayments-payments,
should be made available. Such information should be sent to all
prospective beneficiaries six months before they become eligible
for Medicare. Another change endorsed by the GHAA is to allow
newly eligible Medicare enrollees to elect HMO enrollment that
is effective the first month they become eligible for Medicare,
rather than require them to wait until the second month. 
<P>
<B>Expanding the infrastructure of options available to beneficiaries:</B>
 The GHAA calls for a wider range of options to be made available
to Medicare beneficiaries. Options ranging from catastrophic coverage
plans, to fee-for-service, to the various types of managed care
(HMOs, PPOs, IPAs), point of service, and non-managed care systems
should be allowed to compete on a level playing field. 
<P>
 Maintaining strong standards for options participating in Medicare.
All health plans should meet comparable standards designed to
address access, quality of care, grievance procedures, and solvency.
This is to protect beneficiaries who have been wrongfully denied
access to coverage, or who are unsure about the quality of care
they are receiving in comparison to other providers, and to provide
the comfort and security that comes from knowing they are purchasing
solid health coverage. Anti-managed care laws in existence throughout
certain states should be pre-empted. The GHAA also calls on Congress
to reform certain antitrust laws.
<P>
 Transitioning HCFA to implement new model:  The regulatory and
bureaucratic infrastructure within HCFA needs to be changed to
implement a consumer choice model. In the interim, HCFA should
simplify administrative procedures for submission and processing
of applications and claims. On a regional level, the GHAA says
that HCFA should begin to narrow the variation in interpretation
of policy by regional offices and encourage uniformity in the
review and approval of contracts, products, and marketing materials.

<P>
 Transitioning to improved Medicare payment methodologies. According
to the GHAA, Medicare needs to conform to the changing environment
surrounding health care and future payment policies. In practice,
the GHAA proposes to turn the program from a defined benefits
program into one of a defined contribution with incentives for
beneficiaries to choose plans that deliver high-quality, cost-effective
health care. Specifically, the payment mechanism envisioned by
the GHAA "should permit these options to establish premiums
for the benefits they offer, and should establish a defined government
contribution based upon the per capita cost to the Medicare program
of providing Medicare covered benefits to all eligible beneficiaries." (10)

<h4>HEALTHCARE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL (HLC)</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes a "Draft Proposal" developed
by the council's task force on Medicare. (11) As such, it does not
necessarily reflect an official or final position the HLC has
taken with respect to Medicare reform.</I>
<P>
The Healthcare Leadership Council is comprised of managed care
companies, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals (for-profit and
not-for-profit), medical device manufacturers, and nurse practitioners.
<P>
 The Healthcare Leadership Council's draft legislative policy
initiative centers on five specific areas:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Expand Program Options and Establish Federal Standards for
Qualification.
<li>Modify Program Reimbursement.
<li>Restructure Management and Oversight of Program.
<li>Preempt State Anti-Competitive Health Plan Requirements.
<li>Ensure Appropriate Support for Medicare Education, Research.
</ol>
<P>
 The HLC believes that the free-market principles of competition
and consumer choice should enter the Medicare system. If Medicare
beneficiaries are allowed a wide spectrum of health plan options,
the efficiencies and success of the private marketplace will improve
the Medicare program.
<P>
 In the draft HLC approach, Medicare beneficiaries would be able
to choose from the following list of options:  traditional Medicare;
Medical Savings Accounts; employer-sponsored plans; and all qualified
managed care products (HMOs, PPOs, point of service, managed indemnity,
and integrated provider systems). In order to facilitate the expansion
of health plans in the marketplace, says the HLC, federal standards
regarding health plan qualification must rely on the market, not
a regulatory structure, to help shape effective plan designs that
foster competition. With the exception of plan capacity and ability
to serve new enrollees, all health plans, including Medicare supplemental
plans, must provide coverage to eligible beneficiaries. 
<P>
 While the current Medicare benefit structure would act as a minimum
benefits package in the HLC approach, the copayments-payment and
deductible amounts would be allowed to vary by plan design and
product. Health plans are allowed to offer additional benefits.
The HLC explicitly prohibits the mandating of additional benefits.
Much like the GHAA's proposal, the HLC supports a requirement
which would inform prospective Medicare beneficiaries, at least
6 months prior to eligibility, of their various options and the
nature of the Medicare program. Upon becoming Medicare-eligible,
beneficiaries would have the option of enrolling in the private
health plan of their choice or entering the traditional Medicare
program. New beneficiaries would be enrolled automatically in
the traditional Medicare program if they fail to elect a private
plan option. Beneficiaries currently insured in a private health
plan option who fail to choose another plan during the enrollment
period will remain in their present plan. Enrollees currently
enrolled in the traditional Medicare program could opt out at
any time during the year and enroll in a capitated plan option.
<P>
 To allow the elderly to make informed decisions when choosing
their type of health coverage, there would be an annual education
period sponsored by the federal government. Educational briefing
materials that are easily understood (much like the FEHBP pamphlets
available to federal employees each year) would be made available.
Health plans would be allowed to market their products provided
they meet uniform and consistent guidelines as established by
HCFA. To ensure that low-income beneficiaries did not face increased
costs, subsidies would be maintained under current law (Medicaid
continues to pay applicable Medicare premiums). Discretion would
be given to the states in determining whether subsidized individuals
stay in the current fee-for-service Medicare arrangement or are
enrolled in a managed care option.
<P>
 Federal payments for qualified health plan beneficiaries would
be capitated. To ensure a fair playing field, traditional Medicare
and qualified health plans would be required to accept the same
average rates of increase in their capitated federal payments.
All plans would receive the same federally defined contribution
per beneficiary. Adjustments will be made according to current
AAPCC methodologies (age, gender, and geography). (12) To help facilitate
timely payments to health plans, reimbursements would be made
directly from the government to the plan/provider. To meet annual
expenditures as determined by Congress, increases in the initial
capitated federal contribution would be limited to specified per
capita growth targets. 
<P>
 The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) would be restructured
and streamlined to reflect the changing environment in the health
care market. Inconsistent rulings and determinations by regional
offices would be reformed so that health plans have guidance and
predictability in designing products. 
<P>
 State laws that are deemed to be anti-competitive and that have
adversely affect Medicare choices and innovations in the marketplace
would be preempted. For example, state requirements regarding
"any willing provider, mandatory point of service, essential
community provider, etc."  would not be allowed.

Robbing Peter to Pay Grandma
 -- Heritage </title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<h2>August Insider -- Robbing Peter To Pay Grandma</h2>
<i><b>by John Liu</b></i>
<hr>

<p>Sunday, July 30, 1995, marked the 30th birthday for one of the federal government's largest and most costly programsMedicare, the huge national health insurance program that covers over 37 million elderly and disabled Americans. Medicare was heralded by proponents as both "historic" and "fiscally responsible." Now, however, Medicare is essentially bankrupt, and its ability to maintain the quality of its services is in doubt. What is not in doubt, is the harsh reality that liberals must face up toMedicare is anything but a fiscally responsible program. The hospitalization insurance (HI) trust fund is projected to be insolvent by the year 2002. Equally important, the cost of the Medicare Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) program is exploding. 
Furthermore, U.S. demographics guarantee enormous future burdens on working families. In 1965, when Medicare was enacted, there were almost six workers to every retiree. Today, there are only four. And by 2030, when the nation's 77 million "baby boomers" are well into their retirement, there will be only two workers for every retiree.
<p>
There is a solution to this looming crisis. A solution based on free market principles allowing for consumer choice among competing plans offering different benefits. One prominent model for the reform of the Medicare program, recommended by Heritage scholars, is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the system that currently serves 1.6 million retired Members of Congress and federal workers.
<p>
<br>
<h3>Planning and Price Controls</h3>
<p>
While federal government officials have not been successful in accurately projecting the true costs of the Medicare program, they have had even less success in controlling them. Government bureaucrats have embarked on a quest to find the "right price" for thousands of different medical procedures and treatments or specialists and other providers. In some instances, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals and other health care "providers" too much; in other cases, "too little." Such a system encourages doctors and hospitals and other medical "providers" to engage in more or less elaborate attempts to "game" the price control system. Given its current structure, taxpayers should not be surprised that Medicarecannot control costs. The incentives of the current Medicare system conspire to drive costs up.
<p>
Just how expensive will it be to fund Medicare fully under the current system? The 1995 Medicare Trustees (a federal government board) Report provides some sobering information on how payroll taxes (which finance the HI program) would have to rise to keep the program afloat without reform. "To bring the HI program into actuarial balance even for the first 25 years," a new 1.3 percent payroll tax would have to be added to the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. Based on the trustees' estimates for revenues under the current tax rate, this would raise payroll taxesand hence the cost of employing Americansby an estimated $263 billion over five years and $388 billion over seven years. A worker earning $45,000 would have to pay an additional payroll tax of $585 per year. To achieve long-term actuarial balance of the HI trust fund without reforming the programthat is, to put it on a permanently sound footingan immediate additional payroll tax of 3.52 percent would need to be levied on top of today's 2.9 percent rate. That would raise taxes by $711 billion over five years and $1.050 trillion over seven years. The payroll taxes of a worker earning $45,000 would increase by $1,584 per year.
<p><br>
<h3>A New Model</h3>
<p>If Members of Congress want to retain the single payer, government-run structure of the Medicare program, then they must resort to either much higher taxes or even more draconian controls on doctors and hospitals, including a direct limitation of available services, in a fashion not unlike the British National Health Service.
<p>
If private employer-based insurance is not the best model for the reform of the Medicare system, Members of Congress can always examine their own system, the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). This is the option proposed by The Heritage Foundation as a model for reform. It is also the model now proposed by the American Medical Association (AMA). 
Unlike Medicare, congressional and federal retirees do not have a government standardized benefits package imposed on them with the FEHBP program, but can pick and choose from a wide variety of plans and options. Medicare, on the other hand, offers almost no meaningful choices. And, in terms of economic efficiency, Medicare's bureaucratic and highly centralized system cannot even begin to compete with the market-based system that currently covers retired Members of Congress and federal employees.
<p>
While Medicare costs have been rising almost 11 percent per year, this year's overall private sector costs rose just 4.4 percent and FEHBP premiums costs actually declined by 3.3 percent. Since the free market forces have proven to work well for Members of Congress and retired Members of Congress, there is no reason why the FEHBP model can't work for our nation's elderly.

HOW TO PROVIDE CHOICE AND<br>
SECURITY FOR AMERICA'S ELDERLY</h3>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Physicians Council Report No. 1<br>
August 3, 1995<br>
</center><hr width=50%>                                                         
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An intense debate has begun on the future of Medicare. The majority leadership Congress has made the case that structural reforms of Medicare are necessary to deal with the impending financial collapse of the program and to improve the quality and efficiency of medical services for the elderly. They have said in recent weeks that savings from any reforms of the program should be used to stabilize the finances of Medicare to assure its ability to deliver benefits.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics of this view contend "reforming" Medicare and achieving "savings" in future outlays in reality is merely a smokescreen for cutting benefits. Most of these critics, including the White House, have not proposed any significant reforms in the Medicare program. But the recently released Report of the Board of Trustees of Medicare indicates that the program is in such bad financial shape that the only way to continue Medicare without reforms would be through huge future tax increases. Significantly, of the seven Medicare trustees, five are senior officials of the Clinton Administration -- three of whom are Cabinet secretaries.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There are only two choices available to Congress:
<p><blockquote>
<b>CHOICE #1: Do not change the way in which Medicare is run by the government, and pay for future benefits by raising new revenues through higher payroll and other taxes or by diverting money from other programs.</b> This means Medicare survives only by draining money away from the rest of the budget or by raising taxes.
<p>
<b>CHOICE #2: Change the way Medicare is run so that benefits are delivered more efficiently, avoiding future tax increases or a diversion of money from other programs.</b> Making the program more efficient would improve the quality of benefits and the choices available to retirees while reducing the double-digit rate of outlay increases. This would slow the depletion of the trust fund and stabilize the program
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 1995 Trustees Report explains that if Medicare is not reformed, the cash flow of the HI trust fund (Part A), which finances hospital benefits for the elderly, will go into the red in fiscal year 1997 and the fund will run out of money and become insolvent in the year 2002. The Report then provides some sobering information on how payroll taxes (which finance the HI program) would have to rise to keep the program afloat.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li> To bring the HI program into actuarial balance even for the first 25 years, a new 1.3 percent payroll tax would have to be added on top of the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. Based on the trustees' estimates for revenues under the current tax rate, this would raise payroll taxes -- and hence raise the cost of employing Americans -- by an estimated $263 billion over five years and $388 billion over seven years. For a worker earning $45,000 per year, it would mean an additional payroll tax of $585 per year.
<p>
<li>To achieve long-term actuarial balance of the HI trust fund without reforming the program -- that is, to put it on a permanently sound footing -- taxes could be raised now or raised by a higher amount in the future. If the HI trust fund were to be made permanently sound by raising payroll taxes immediately, an additional payroll tax of 3.52 percent would need to be levied on top of today's 2.9 percent rate. That would raise taxes by $711 billion over five years and $1.050 trillion over seven years. The payroll taxes of a worker earning $45,000 would increase by $1,584 per year.
<p>
<li> If tax increases were delayed until the cash flow of the HI trust fund of an unreformed Medicare system actually went into the red (FY 1997), a 3.65 percent increase would then be required to stabilize the fund permanently. If action were delayed until the fund actually ran out of money seven years from now, the payroll tax hike would have to be 3.91 percent. In this latter case, the payroll tax hike for the $45,000 per year worker would be $1,760 per year.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These calculations, moreover, apply only to the hospital insurance program (Part A of Medicare) paid for out of payroll taxes. Retirees also are entitled to enroll in Part B of Medicare, a voluntary program which covers much of the cost of physician and other services. Part B is approximately 75 percent subsidized by the taxpayer (eligibility for the subsidy is not means tested) and only 25 percent paid for by beneficiaries. Understandably, almost all eligible Americans enroll in Part B, also known as Supplementary Medical Insurance, or SMI.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The trustees point out that, like HI costs, SMI expenditures have been growing sharply. "Growth rates have been so rapid that outlays of the program have increased 53 percent in aggregate and 40 percent per enrollee in the last five years. For the same period, the program grew 19 percent faster than the economy despite recent efforts to control the cost of the program." With the trustees "'intermediate" estimates of future program growth, the annual taxpayer subsidy will grow from an estimated $38 billion in this fiscal year to an estimated $89 billion in five years and $147 billion in FY 2004.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>WE MUST REFORM MEDICARE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Trustees' Report shows that whether lawmakers and advocates for the elderly like it or not, Medicare cannot be separated from the budget. The reason for this is quite simple. Without reform, the HI trust fund will run out, will require heavy new taxes or subsidies, and the taxpayer cost of the SMI program will spiral rapidly upward. The result: The rest of the federal budget must be restructured to keep Medicare afloat through a combination of taxes and money diverted from other programs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The only alternative to this bleak scenario is to reform the program so that outlays are brought under control and Medicare does not have to "crowd out" other programs or impose heavy new taxes on working Americans. <I>Bringing costs under control does not mean cutting medical care for the elderly, however, as critics of reform charge.</I> What it means is bringing the obsolete Medicare program up to date by incorporating innovations that are routine in the private sector and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, or FEHBP (which covers Members of Congress and federal workers, many of whom are retired). These innovations would improve efficiency -- and typically give wider benefit choices than under Medicare today -- and so allow services to be delivered at less cost.
<P>
<b> A MODEL FOR REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If all retired Americans were offered the same type of medical coverage enjoyed by retired federal employees and Members of Congress, Medicare's looming funding crisis would be averted.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By switching from the current "defined benefit ;" Medicare system to a "defined contributions" system similar to the FEHBP, the structural problems causing skyrocketing Medicare costs would be solved and senior citizens would wind up with more health care choices than they have now.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Currently, the federal government reimburses each Washington-approved health care service according to a set payment schedule that defies comprehension and ignores market realities. Instead the government should make a defined financial contribution to the plan of the retiree's choice. The result would be a system that costs less, while giving American seniors an unprecedented opportunity to choose their coverage and range of benefits, just as retired Members of Congress and federal employees do -- and save money at the same time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All of the health plans offered under FEHBP provide coverage against long-term "catastrophic" illness and most offer prescription drug coverage, neither of which is provided by Medicare.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

An FEHBP-style Medicare system would give senior citizens the opportunity to choose premiums that include:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Dental care, out-patient medical services, routine physicals, diabetic supplies, chiropractic care, and other health care services not provided by Medicare.
<p>
<li> Advice and consumer information.</b> Just as various organizations help congressional and federal retirees choose their health care plans, senior citizens would receive similar help in deciding what level of care they need. Some may choose "Cadillac" health plans, for which they would pay more, or less expensive programs that more closely fit their needs.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

An FEHBP-style reform would not only yield these advantages, it would result in fiscal stability for Medicare. The free-market dynamics that come with consumer choice would push Medicare into long-term financial stability. FEH BP premium costs have been increasing at just half the rate of Medicare. And this year, federal workers and retirees saw their health care premiums reduced by an average of 3.3 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both long- and short-term action must be pursued by Congress to end the Medicare crisis. In addition to switching to a FEHBP-style system, action should be taken to reduce the heavy taxpayer subsidy of Medicare Part B premiums. Some options to do this include:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Reducing</b> the current subsidy for more affluent senior citizens, using some of the savings to perhaps raise the level of subsidy for the elderly with very low incomes.
<p>
<li><b>Restoring</b> the premium paid by seniors to its original 50 percent from the current level of 25 percent. This could be done gradually over five years and save approximately $37 billion. Increasing the percentage seniors pay should not be regarded as a tax increase since enrollment in Part B is voluntary.
</ul><p>
<b>TIME TO REFORM IS NOW</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The trustees, including three Clinton Cabinet secretaries, urge Congress to take "prompt, effective, and decisive action" to control the escalating costs of the Medicare program. Critics of Medicare reforms who argue that change should not be "budget driven," including some senior Clinton Administration officials not among the trustees, ignore the simple fact that an unstable and unreformed Medicare program increasingly is driving the budget deficit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 If Congress fails to undertake fundamental reform, there can be only two alternatives: Either the elderly will suffer a dramatic reduction in the quantity and quality of their health care coverage, or already overburdened working families will be forced to pay sharply higher taxes to maintain the current levels of benefits.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On the other hand, a Medicare system based on consumer choice and market competition would mean choice and security for today's elderly and a strong and solvent retirement health care system for future generations as well.

<B>INTRODUCTION</B>

<P>Designed to operate as a federally run health insurance program for 
America's elderly, Medicare was heralded by proponents as both "historic" 
and "fiscally responsible."1   Now, however, Medicare is essentially 
bankrupt, and its ability to maintain the quality of its services is in 
doubt. According to the 1995 Trustees Report, if Medicare is not reformed 
the cash flow of the HI trust fund (Part A), which finances hospital 
benefits for the elderly, will go into the red in fiscal year 1997 and 
the fund will run out of money and become insolvent in the year 2002.2  
The report provides some sobering information on how payroll taxes (which 
finance the HI program) would have to rise to keep the program afloat 
without reform. "To bring the HI program into actuarial balance even for 
the first 25 years,"3  a new 1.3 percent payroll tax would have to be 
added on top of the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. Based on 
the trustees' estimates for revenues under the current tax rate, this 
would raise payroll taxes -- and hence the cost of employing Americans -- 
by an estimated $263 billion over five years and $388 billion over seven 
years. A worker earning $45,000 would have to pay an additional payroll 
tax of $585 per year.

<P>To achieve long-term actuarial balance of the HI trust fund without 
reforming the program -- that is, to put it on a permanently sound 
footing -- an immediate additional payroll tax of 3.52 percent would 
need to be levied on top of today's 2.9 percent rate. That would raise t
axes by $711 billion over five years and $1.050 trillion over seven years. 
The payroll taxes of a worker earning $45,000 would increase by $1,584 per 
year.

<P>And this is only to bail out the hospital program and enable those 
benefits to be paid. Part B also will require a rapidly increasing 
subsidy from general revenues to continue paying for physician services. 
"Growth rates have been so rapid," explain the trustees, "that outlays of 
the program have increased 53 percent in aggregate and 40 percent per 
enrollee in the last five years. For the same period, the program grew 
19 percent faster than the economy despite recent efforts to control 
the cost of the program."4   With the trustees' "intermediate" 
estimates of future program growth, the annual taxpayer subsidy will 
grow from an estimated $38 billion in this fiscal year to an estimated 
$89 billion in five years and $147 billion in FY 2004.5 	

<P>Trying to hold down Medicare's costs through price controls on 
health providers and through stringent regulations is no answer. 
Not only has this strategy failed to control costs, it encourages 
physicians and hospitals to "game" the government rather than 
properly serve their patients. Moreover, price controls have shifted 
costs to the private sector, driving up premiums for working individuals 
and families. 

<P>Instead of trying to tighten current controls and regulations, the 
proper reform is to create a very different dynamic and set of incentives 
to drive the Medicare program. Specifically, the bureaucratic, 
standardized, command-and-control structure of today's Medicare must 
be replaced with consumer choice among competing plans offering different 
benefits. This is the same dynamic that has allowed health costs to be 
brought under control while improving quality in the private sector -- 
and in the government-sponsored health plan enjoyed by Members of Congress 
and other federal employees.

<P>The way to achieve the same results in Medicare is to pattern it 
broadly after the existing Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan 
(FEHBP), which covers almost nine million federal employees, families, 
and retirees, including present and former Members of Congress. This 
new program, perhaps renamed "Medi-Choice," would replace today's
 defined benefit program with a defined contribution program that 
 gives America's seniors an unprecedented opportunity to choose their 
 own health plan and range of benefits, just as retired Members of 
 Congress and other federal retirees do. Under such a system, unlike 
 today's Medicare program, the nation's elderly and disabled could 
 choose sound health insurance from a variety of managed care and 
 fee-for-service arrangements. And retirees could choose coverage 
 for services not covered by today's standardized Medicare program -- 
 such as a prescription drug benefit -- by accepting, say, higher 
 copayments for other covered services. One of the great ironies of 
 the Medicare debate is that those who oppose reform are denying the 
 elderly the chance to receive many basic medical services already 
 available to working Americans, and even to the indigent.

<P>The key financial difference is that the government would make a 
defined financial contribution to the plan of the retiree's choice, 
rather than reimburse each Washington-approved service according to a 
fee schedule that defies comprehension and ignores market realities.6  
This incentive encourages beneficiaries to pick plans with the best 
value for money, pocketing part of the savings from choosing more 
efficient coverage. It already has enabled spending in the FEHBP to 
increase at half the rate of Medicare, in addition to which federal 
workers and retirees this year were treated to premium reductions 
averaging 3.3 percent. Introducing the same incentive system into a 
reformed Medicare program would save hundreds of billions of dollars 
over the next decade, putting the program on a sound financial footing 
so that it can serve both today's elderly and the next generation of 
Americans.

<P>Congress in reality has only two choices when considering the 
future of Medicare. One choice is to make no significant change in 
how Medicare is run and try to pay for future trust fund shortfalls 
either by raising payroll and other taxes or by diverting money from 
other programs. This means Medicare survives only by draining money 
from the rest of the budget or by raising taxes dramatically.

<P>The second choice is to change the way Medicare is run so that 
benefits are delivered more efficiently, avoiding future tax 
increases or a diversion of money from other programs. Making the 
program more efficient not only will reduce the financial burden 
Medicare places on the next generation, but also will improve the 
quality of benefits and choices available to America's senior citizens.


<P><B>HOW TODAY'S MEDICARE SYSTEM WORKS</B>

<P>Today's Medicare program pays doctors, hospitals, and other 
health care providers for inpatient hospital care, some inpatient 
care in a skilled nursing facility, home health care, hospice care, 
physician and supplier services, and outpatient services. In providing 
these services to the elderly and disabled, the program is divided into 
two parts. Part A finances the hospital insurance (HI) portion. Part B 
finances the supplemental medical insurance (SMI) portion, which covers 
physicians' fees. 

<P><B>Part A</B> of Medicare provides premium-free coverage for part of 
the costs associated with certain hospital stays and limited follow-up 
services. Part A is financed currently through mandatory payroll taxes, which are paid into a trust fund by both employers and employees. When Medicare began in 1966, federal actuaries estimated future expenditures for Part A so that a payroll tax could be established based on potential costs. But the government's estimates fell far short of the actual costs of running this portion of the Medicare program. 

<P>The Medicare trustees recently issued a stunning report which reveals 
that the Part A trust fund will be insolvent by the year 2002. 
The reasons for this looming fiscal crisis include congressional 
mandates expanding covered benefits (such as adding coverage for the 
disabled population beginning in 1973) without providing offsetting 
changes in copayments or coinsurance, general medical inflation, and 
increased utilization by an aging population with longer life expectancies. 

<P><B>Part B</B> is voluntary. All persons age 65 or over may choose 
to enroll in the supplemental medical insurance program by paying a 
monthly premium. The current contribution level ($46.10 per month as 
of January 1, 1995) constitutes just 29 percent of the actual cost of 
the Part B program. The remaining 71 percent is provided by the taxpayers. 
Part B covers physician services, laboratory services, outpatient hospital 
services, and other medical services. The program pays 80 percent of the 
allowed charge (after the annual $100 deductible is met); beneficiaries 
are responsible for the remaining 20 percent coinsurance required by law. 
In sharp contrast with typical plans in the private sector, as well as the 
FEHBP which covers retired Members of Congress and federal workers, Medicare 
has all of the undesirable features of a bureaucratic system.


<P><B>1)  Medicare relies on ineffective price controls to try to curb 
costs.</B>

<P>Medicare is a classic example of the failures of price controls to 
slow the growth of prices and expenditures. Not surprisingly, the 
program exhibits all the chronic distortions and inefficiencies that 
typically accompany a price control system.7  It is ironic that as 
countries around the world are abandoning price controls and central 
planning, America tries to use them to deliver health care to the 
elderly. It is also rather astonishing to find some lawmakers surprised 
at the inability of these tools to keep Medicare's expenditures under 
control.	

<P>Price controls in Medicare take such forms as the diagnostic 
related group (DRG) system for hospital payments and the resource-based 
relative value scale (RBRVS) system for physician services -- the latter 
remarkably similar to the obsolete labor theory of value, which is the 
basis of socialist economics.8  Under the DRG system, hospitals are 
reimbursed according to a complex system of fees based on the illness 
being treated, while physicians are subject to a fee schedule according 
to the procedure being used. The "value" of a doctor's labor, along with 
the "value" of other statistically weighted "resource inputs" into the 
provision of a medical service, is calculated according to the statistical 
methods of social sciences. Fees are set on the basis of this statistical 
calculation, as applied to each of approximately 7,000 medical procedures, 
as measured and weighed by experts at HCFA.9  Needless to say, the 
consequences, such as cost shifting and similar distortions, have not 
proven any different from those resulting from the imposition of price 
controls in any other sector of the economy.10  Controls have not worked, 
and the SMI program is growing at an unsustainable rate under current 
legislation and rules.	

<P>This elaborate system of controls has failed to hold the rate of 
growth in Medicare expenditures to a degree comparable to the private 
sector. For example, Medicare has experienced 10 percent overall growth 
and is projected to grow at approximately the same rate over the next 
five years. Contrast this with the private sector, where employer 
health premiums in 1995 dropped by 1.1 percent while medical inflation 
increased by only 4.7 percent. Price controls also have led to distortions 
and inefficiencies familiar to any student of such controls. For example:


<UL>
<LI>Government action to squeeze payments to Medicare hospitals and 
physicians has led to significant cost shifting (or, more accurately, 
"price shifting") to non-Medicare services.

<LI>Price controls have encouraged providers to try to make up for low 
fees by increasing the volume of services (such as calling patients in 
for additional office visits or conducting tests of marginal value) or by 
such actions as reducing the average duration of office visits. The 
government's response -- typical of responses to this form of price control 
evasion -- has been to introduce elaborate "expenditure controls," 
with the result that honest physicians are penalized for hard work and 
attention to their patients.

<LI>Diagnosis codes are modified subtly by physicians and hospitals to 
qualify for better payments. Indeed, software packages are marketed 
routinely to hospitals and doctors to show them how to maximize 
reimbursements from Medicare by choosing one diagnosis code rather 
than another for the same medical problem.

</UL>
<P>The experience of price controls in Medicare is the experience of 
price controls throughout history. Providers, and sometimes patients, 
react to each control by seeking ways to evade it, with a general loss 
of efficiency; then government introduces a new, more elaborate control 
in an attempt to address the deficiencies of the first. The cycle continues 
as the providers find a way around that control. Meanwhile, efficiency 
suffers and expenditure targets are exceeded.


<P><B>2)  Government limits the benefits available to the elderly.</B>

<P>Unlike congressional and federal retirees, who are covered under a 
variety of plans in the FEHBP, most other senior citizens are locked 
into the "one-size-fits-all" Medicare program. There is no freedom to 
choose levels of benefits, or to choose alternative benefits, within 
today's Medicare. Beyond electing to participate in the voluntary 
supplemental insurance program (SMI, or Part B) with its standardized 
benefits, the only choice most elderly Americans make in health insurance 
is whether they will purchase a "Medi-gap" policy for services and benefits 
not covered in the Part B program. But retired Members of Congress and 
federal workers, just like active members of the federal workforce, can 
choose from health insurance plans ranging from fee-for-service coverage, 
to union-sponsored plans, to various forms of managed care. Moreover, they 
can choose plans with different covered services, such as dental benefits 
and drug coverage, that generally are not available under Medicare.

<P>Another important benefit found routinely in private plans but not in 
Medicare is catastrophic coverage. This crucial benefit protects individuals 
against high costs associated with catastrophic illness or accidents. Among 
the other benefits not covered by Medicare but covered by the FEHBP's 
popular Blue Cross Blue Shield Standard Plan are (to take one example):

<P><UL>
<LI>Preventive screening, stool tests for blood, prostate specific antigen 
tests, and related office visit charges.

<LI>Routine physical exam, including a history and risk assessment, and a 
serum cholesterol test, once every year.

<LI>Home nursing care.

<LI>Smoking cessation.

<LI>Home physician visits.
</UL>

<B>3)  Medicare resists innovation in the delivery of care.</B>

<P>In addition to its implicit distortions and evasions, a price control 
system fails to control costs because its bureaucratic nature reduces the 
pace at which efficiency-improving innovations are introduced. In a 
competitive market-based system, choice and competition lead to a 
decentralized, continuous, and rapid introduction of ideas to improve
 the ratio of quality to price. These are accepted or rejected to the 
 degree that buyers and sellers agree they are an improvement. 

<P>In a centrally planned system like Medicare, the process is entirely 
different. Proposed changes must "trickle up" to senior officials 
responsible for the program, after which they typically must be evaluated 
by bureaucrats and boards, proposed to politicians, and subjected to the 
pressures of competing interests before they take effect. The result is 
slow and encourages politically influenced decisions. Moreover, private 
sector managers are motivated by competition to find the best way to 
satisfy the patient at the lowest cost. Bureaucrats are motivated by 
the incentive to avoid risk and controversy, which results in the denial 
of many new services and procedures to Medicare patients. 

<P>Medicare is run by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), an 
agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. HCFA's more 
than 4,000 employees issue and enforce hundreds of pages of regulations and 
thousands of pages of guidelines, managing virtually every aspect of the
 delivery and financing of the health care to the elderly.11  While Medicare 
 claims an overhead cost of just three percent, the rules and regulations 
 emanating from HCFA merely shift large administrative costs to hospitals 
 and physicians. Moreover, Medicare requires far more federal administrators 
 and rules for its operation than does the FEHBP, which also is run by the 
 government -- but on very different principles.

<P>In keeping with Medicare's central planning/price control design, 
Congress and HCFA systematically fail to introduce service delivery 
innovations while depriving seniors of state-of-the-art medical technology. 
For example:

<P><B>Medicare will refuse all reimbursements to hospitals conducting 
clinical studies on Medicare patients, so seniors are denied access to 
medical innovations developed in the United
States.</B> As highlighted in <I>USA Today</I>, "Faced with 
possible federal charges and potentially millions of dollars in fines, 
hospitals slammed on the brakes... shutting down all device studies or 
excluding Medicare patients from them. Doctors were no longer able to 
provide what they considered the latest treatments to many older 
patients."12  

<P>This happens not only because HCFA must formulate guidelines for 
every category of medical equipment, but also because it must decide 
whether each new medical device or treatment meets the criteria for 
coverage under Medicare Part B. This highly regulatory process has 
proven extremely expensive for taxpayers and dangerous for patients. 

<P>Dr. John Rowe, President of New York's Mt. Sinai Medical Center, 
recently gave the Senate Finance Committee a graphic example of what 
this means in practice. He asked the committee to consider a hospital 
performing major heart surgery under Medicare and a patient who needed 
a pacemaker inserted on his twentieth day in the hospital. If a clinical 
test happened to be underway on pacemakers to test the effectiveness of 
alternative electrical leads, HCFA might well rule this treatment 
experimental and deny reimbursement for the patient's stay in the 
hospital.13 

<P><B>Medicare is essentially a "fee-for-service" program.</B> It has 
made little progress in allowing, as an option to the elderly, managed 
care plans such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or competitive 
medical plans (CMSs). Moreover, with the rigid guidelines established 
by the HCFA, Medicare's payment scheme to HMOs is crude.14  As a result, 
former HCFA Administrator Gail Wilensky has testified before the House 
Ways and Means Committee that inadequate adjustments appear to have 
produced large overpayments to many HMOs and underpayments to others.15  

<P><B>Non-HMO managed care options are very limited.</B> For example, 
risk-based "carve-outs" like the package-priced heart bypass operation 
are not allowed except on a demonstration basis.

<P>Slow service design innovation is endemic to Medicare's price 
control/central planning system. While the process conceivably could 
be accelerated, it cannot even theoretically match the pace of 
innovation in a competitive marketplace.



<P><B>THE SCOPE OF MEDICARE'S FINANCIAL CRISIS</B>

<P>According to the Medicare Trustees, the financial soundness of the 
HI and SMI trust funds is of great concern due to their past and projected 
rapid rates of growth. This concern is heightened by the major demographic 
shifts in the workforce which supports the Medicare population. 
Currently, 4.7 workers support each beneficiary, but this ratio is 
expected to decrease significantly:  by the year 2030, only two workers 
will be supporting each beneficiary. Given the trust funds' inadequate 
level of reserves and weak financing structure, however, the HI trust fund 
is projected to reach insolvency long before this demographic change takes 
place.

<P>Medicare has become the second largest entitlement program, after 
Social Security, in the federal budget. It is in long-term financial 
crisis because payroll taxes and other revenues do not cover costs, so 
net outlays must be covered by new taxes or by diverting money from other 
programs in the budget. Such net outlays totaled $144.7 billion in 1994. 
Government actuaries project that under current law Medicare will cost 
taxpayers $198.7 billion by 1997 and $263.6 billion by 2000. It is little 
wonder that the trustees, who include three Clinton Administration Cabinet 
secretaries and two other senior Administration officials, called on 
Congress to take "prompt, effective and decisive action" to curb the 
program's escalating costs.16  	

<P>These general problems appear in both parts of the Medicare program.

<P><B>The Mess in Medicare Part A (HI)</B>

<P>Medicare Part A (HI) is financed through payroll taxes on current employees, their employers, and the self-employed. Before January 1, 1994, HI tax rates of 1.45 percent on employees, 1.45 percent on employers, and 2.9 percent on the self-employed were applied on earnings up to $135,000.17  As part of his Administration's effort to reduce the deficit, President Clinton proposed that all earnings be subject to the HI tax, beginning in 1994. But despite lifting the limit on earnings subject to the HI tax to yield additional revenues, the Administration targeted the additional tax toward deficit reduction, not the HI trust fund. Since the HI tax took effect in 1966, the maximum taxable income level has been increased 23 separate times.18  	

<P>Contrary to widespread belief, HI revenues and expenditures do not go through a real trust fund. As a matter of fact, no trust fund with money in it actually exists.19  The "fund" is merely an obligation on the government to find the money, through taxes, to pay for future benefits. As the Annual Report by the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Program explains, the government has never saved the necessary tax revenues to cover the future health care needs of private sector employees. The reason:  Medicare began paying out HI benefits at the same time it began collecting taxes.20  Younger workers on average contribute more to the Social Security and HI fund each year as their earnings increase. These contributions, however, are not saved. Instead, they are transferred and spent almost immediately on the current Medicare population.21  Moreover, the elderly typically receive far more in benefits than they have paid in payroll taxes.

<P>Long-range HI projections show that Medicare hospital costs will rise much more quickly than inflation. The most recent projections by the Board of Trustees of the HI trust fund use three alternative sets of assumptions:  low cost, intermediate, and high cost. The intermediate set of assumptions is said to represent the trustees' best estimate of the future economic and demographic trends that will affect the program's financial status. Under this option, the present financing structure is sufficient to ensure the payment of HI benefits only over the next seven years:  "As a result, the HI trust fund does not meet the trustees' short-range test of financial adequacy."22   Under the high cost (pessimistic) option, the fund will be exhausted in 2001. Under the low cost (optimistic) option, the fund will be exhausted in 2006. When the trust fund is fully depleted, Medicare is legally obliged to stop reimbursing providers.

<P><B>Medicare Part B's Exploding Costs</B>

<P>Congress established the Medicare Part B (or SMI) program in 1966 to create a taxpayer subsidy for the premiums paid by the nation's elderly, setting it at 50 percent of premium cost. Until 1973, SMI premiums continued to finance 50 percent of the benefit and administrative costs of the program, plus a small contingency amount in a separate trust fund. 

<P>When Part B costs began to increase faster than inflation, Congress decided to limit increases in the premium to the same percentage as Social Security cost of living adjustments. Under this new formula, revenues from Part B premiums for beneficiaries decreased from 50 percent to 25 percent of the expenditures because costs increased at a faster rate than inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), used to calculate Social Security adjustments. Beginning in the early 1980s, Congress has voted consistently to set Part B premiums at a level which would cover only 25 percent of costs. As a result, Medicare enrollees in 1995 pay only $46.10 per month for generous insurance that covers 80 percent of allowable charges with a deductible of only $100. The illusion that comprehensive health insurance is inexpensive means that Americans aged 65 or over have no incentive to control costs.

<P>In their report to Congress, the trustees "[n]ote with great concern the past and projected rapid growth in the cost of the program. Growth rates have been so rapid that outlays of the program have increased 53 percent in aggregate and 40 percent per enrollee in the last five years. For the same time period, the program grew 19 percent faster than the economy despite recent efforts to control the cost of the program."23   As a result of the escalating cost of this portion of Medicare, expenditures are projected to increase from 0.93 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1994 to 4.29 percent of GDP in 2069. With the trustees' "intermediate" estimates of future program growth, the annual taxpayer subsidy will rise from an estimated $38 billion in this fiscal year to an estimated $89 billion in five years and $147 billion in FY 2004.24 

<P><B>HOW TO REFORM MEDICARE</B>

<P>In grappling with Medicare's emerging fiscal crisis, Congress needs to pursue both short-term budgetary measures and a long-term strategy of structural change. Short-term measures are needed to deal with the program's injustices and glaring shortcomings. Long-term reform is needed to deal with structural financial problems and to improve the quality of care for America's seniors. Moreover, to deal with public confusion about the status of the Medicare system and the purpose of reform, Congress must educate the American people about the true dimensions of the problem, including the potential tax burden facing working Americans if action is not taken. This can be accomplished in two ways: 

<P>First, Congress should order the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to notify America's senior and disabled citizens that their Medicare hospitalization program faces bankruptcy as early as 2002, according to the Medicare Trustees Report. HCFA should explain that to keep the program going without reforms will mean billions of additional tax dollars taken from the paychecks of working Americans or diverted from other programs. 

<P>Second, Congress should order HCFA to inform the elderly that the premiums they pay for their Medicare supplementary insurance Part B represents only 25 percent of the premium income for those services and that their children and grandchildren, young working families, are paying for the bulk of these Medicare benefits out of general tax revenues. Most elderly believe that they are paying the full cost of their Medicare benefits; the truth about Medicare's financial condition and circumstances can only improve the quality of the necessary public debate. 


<P><B>Short-Term Reform of Part </B>

<P>Congress should act immediately to reduce the heavy taxpayer subsidy of Medicare's Part B premiums.

<P><B>OPTION #1:</B>  The simplest, though not necessarily the best, option would be to restore the premium to the original 50 percent level. This could be done by gradually phasing down the current level of taxpayer subsidies by five percent per year over a five-year period, which would save taxpayers approximately $37.27 billion over the next five years.25  By financing one-half of Part B program costs, Congress would return to the spirit of the original 1965 "contract" with America's taxpayers.

<P>Reducing the taxpayer subsidy would encourage many enrollees to compare the costs and benefits of more efficient private alternatives with the costs and benefits of the Part B program. The more the subsidy is reduced, the more level the playing field between the private sector and government. The elderly would have incentives to choose more efficient plans in the private sector. The likely result:  not just a reduction in the subsidy, but also a significant reduction in gross budget outlays for Medicare Part B.

<P>One problem with simply reducing the subsidy across the board is that it would impose some hardship on many lower-income Americans while continuing taxpayer support (albeit reduced) for the more affluent. It also would raise the cost to states of enrolling in Medicare some individuals already on Medicaid.

<P><B>OPTION #2:</B>  An alternative would be to reduce the current subsidy as income rises and perhaps raise the level of subsidy for the elderly with very low incomes. The savings from such a change would vary widely, depending on what method of means-testing was introduced. At, say, $65,000 adjusted gross income for individuals and $85,000 for couples, the subsidy might be phased out in increments of three percentage points per $1,000 of income above the threshold. The full premium would be paid by individuals above $98,000 in AGI and couples above $118,000 in AGI.

<P><I>Not a Tax.</I> Contrary to what liberals in Congress may say, a higher Part B premium represents not an increase in taxes, but a reduction in a large direct subsidy. It is not a tax increase because Medicare Part B is a voluntarily chosen service that can be provided just as easily by the private sector. Part B is a subsidized commercial service provided by the federal government in competition with the private sector. If Members of Congress believe it necessary to give high levels of subsidies to enrollees, those subsidies should be targeted not to everyone over 65, but to elderly citizens who cannot afford an acceptable level of physician services and other services now available under Part B.


<B>A POSSIBLE MODEL FOR LONG-TERM REFORM -- THE FEHBP</B>

<P>Members of Congress searching for an alternative model for Medicare reform do not have to look far. For well over three decades, Members of Congress and federal employees -- and federal retirees -- have been enrolled in a unique consumer-driven health care system called the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). Unlike Medicare, it is not run on the principles of central planning and price controls. Instead, it is based on the market principles of consumer choice and competition.26  Beginning in 1960 with 51 plans for the federal workforce, the FEHBP now encompasses over 400 private health insurance plans nationwide, ranging from traditional indemnity insurance and fee-for-service to plans sponsored by federal unions and employee organizations to different forms of managed care, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). In the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, half of all persons with health insurance are covered by one of the 35 plans competing in the FEHBP.

<P>The FEHBP is entirely different from Medicare. For one thing, Medicare is a <B>defined benefit</B> program, meaning each enrollee has access to a specific set of health services which are paid for, in total or in part, by the federal government. The FEHBP, on the other hand, is a
<B>defined contribution</B> program in which the government agrees to provide federal workers or retirees with a financial contribution they can use to purchase the health coverage of their choice. 

<P>Even more important, and unlike Medicare, the FEHBP does not attempt to constrain costs by controlling prices and specifying a comprehensive set of services. It sets only minimal guidelines over how plans must be structured and marketed. The law specifies only a brief category of core benefits, permitting federal workers and retirees to choose the plans and benefits that are right for them. Cost restraint is achieved not with an army of Medicare-style price controllers, but through the operation of consumer choice in a market of competing plans. That is why FEHBP spending is projected to increase at about 6 percent per year while spending for Medicare is expected to grow at 10 percent per year.

<P><B>Choices for Federal Retirees.</B> The FEHBP is open to all congressional and federal retirees who retired after July 1, 1960. Under current rules, congressional or federal retirees are eligible to enroll in an FEHBP plan if they retired on an annuity with at least five years of continuous service at the time of retirement, or if they retired on a Civil Service disability. They also can assure coverage for spouses by electing survivor benefits, and any survivor annuitant can request coverage for grandchildren, under certain conditions, on or after August 11, 1994.27  	

<P>Significantly, while private sector firms have been cutting back, or even eliminating private health insurance for retirees altogether, the FEHBP has improved its coverage. Moreover, while the number of active employees has remained fairly constant over the past ten years, the number of retirees has grown from 1.3 million to 1.6 million.28  Congressional and federal retirees and their dependents now make up 40 percent of total enrollment,29  enjoying access to choices and services denied to Americans enrolled in Medicare. Among the features of the FEHBP:	

<P><B>Wide Choice of Health Plans.</B> No other group of Americans enjoys the range of personal choice over health plans available to active and retired congressional and federal employees. Their private plans range from fee-for-service to managed care. They can obtain plans through organizations they trust. Plans sponsored by federal unions and employee organizations are particularly popular among federal workers and retirees -- almost one-third are enrolled in such plans. Among the managed care plans, which have become quite popular in recent years, there are many different options, including "point of service" plans in which retired federal and congressional workers can choose to use a personal physician outside the HMO network for a higher copayment. 

<P>The FEHBP is very popular among federal retirees -- so popular that a significant number of federal retirees who enroll in Medicare keep their existing federal coverage as a "wraparound" plan. While Medicare is their primary source of insurance, the additional benefits included in the FEHBP (such as prescription drugs, catastrophic coverage, and preventive care) serve as more than adequate protection. As the National Association of Retired Federal Employees states in its 1995 guide to federal health plans for retirees, "All FEHB plans are good.... You can't make a serious mistake in choosing a FEHB plan unless you choose a high cost plan or option when you don't need one."30 	

<P><B>Choice of Health Benefits.</B> Federal retirees do not have merely a choice of plan. Unlike virtually all other Americans, active or retired, congressional and federal retirees also have the freedom to choose the services they want. Unlike Americans enrolled in Medicare, they are not locked into a single, government-standardized benefits package. Beyond the normal range of typical hospitalization and physician services, they can pick from a variety of plans that cover such items as skilled nursing care and home health care by a nurse, dental care, outpatient mental benefits, routine physical examinations, durable medical equipment and prostheses, hospice care, chemotherapy, radiation, physical and rehabilitative therapy, prescription drugs, mail order drugs, diabetic supplies, treatments for alcoholism or drug abuse, acupuncture, and chiropractic services. And FEHBP plans include catastrophic coverage -- in sharp contrast to Medicare.

<P><B>Advice and Consumer Information.</B> Congressional and federal retirees are not on their own in making a choosing a plan. They receive advice from private federal employee and retiree organizations on the best plans and best benefit options. 

<P>In particular, retirees and workers are advised by consumer organizations such as the National Association of Retired Federal Employees (NARFE). Washington's Consumer Checkbook, a consumer organization, advises retirees on the best options, such as enrolling in plans that coordinate with Medicare. Various other groups rate plans and provide information on services, quality, and levels of benefits. 

<P>For example, NARFE advises federal retirees on the range of catastrophic coverage options available to them. Among other tips, it points out to retirees that the High Option Blue Cross Blue Shield plan, while expensive, has "home health care benefits that the Standard Blues plan doesn't have"; that the Alliance Plan covers up to 90 Cardiac Rehabilitation visits for angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and coronary surgery; that the most comprehensive dental coverage is available from the Mail Handlers high option plan, as well as the Postmasters and National Association of Letter Carriers high option plans; that the Government Employees Health Association offers the best value in home health care services; that the Blues offer the best hospice care; and that the best skilled nursing benefits are offered by the Postmasters.31 	

<P><B>Choice of Price.</B> Unlike the limited or non-existent choices available to private sector workers and retirees, and unlike the rigidly controlled pricing under Medicare, FEHBP premiums, coinsurance, or copayments represent a wide range of options. Under the FEHBP's financing formula, the federal government will contribute up to 75 percent of the cost of a plan, up to a maximum of $1,600 for individuals and $3,490 for families.

<P>If congressional and federal retirees wish to choose a very expensive "Cadillac" plan with a rich set of benefits, they may do so, but they make the decision to pay extra. If, on the other hand, they pick a less expensive plan, they save money on their portion of the premium. Private health plans compete directly for these consumers' dollars. 

<P>Needless to say, the dynamics of a competitive market in the FEHBP have had a positive impact on premium prices for federal employees and retirees. According to the Congressional Budget Office:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the past five years, FEHB plan premiums have increased an average of 6.8 percent a year, whereas the premiums paid by medium and large firms surveyed by Hay/Huggins Company, a benefits consulting firm, increased by 10.8 percent a year. Furthermore, FEHB premiums are expected to decline by 3.3 percent in 1995; the Congressional Budget Office projects, however, that aggregate private health premiums are likely to rise by about 5
percent.32</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>According to the CBO, Medicare hospitalization (HI) costs will rise 8.4 percent per annum between 1995 and 2000, and Medicare supplemental medical insurance (SMI) costs will rise at 12.9 percent per year.33 

<P><B>Deficiencies of the FEHBP.</B> The FEHBP is not without deficiencies.34  The most significant is that plans must offer a form of community-rated premiums, meaning they must offer a plan to a healthy 19-year-old at exactly the same premium as a very sick 89-year-old. This inevitably leads to adverse selection. Still, the FEHBP functions so well that even this problem does not undermine the program, although it does introduce distortions and perverse incentives that prevent it from functioning as effectively as it should. A wise reform would be to vary the degree of assistance to FEHBP enrollees at least according to their age and to permit plans to vary premiums, also by age. That would allow plans to compete more effectively and to offer services with less vulnerability to adverse selection.


<B>A REFORM AGENDA FOR MEDICARE</B>

<P>Congress has committed itself to curbing the growth of Medicare spending in order to restore financial stability and prevent out-of-control spending from draining money from other programs or forcing huge increases in taxes. To carry out this wise commitment, Congress can proceed in two ways. It can impose tighter regulation and stricter price controls while cutting medical services for the elderly, as it has in the past. But experience shows that this strategy yields only short-term spending reductions at best. In the long run, it does nothing to curb runaway spending and undermines the quality of care for the elderly. 

<P>The other option for Congress is to achieve spending restraint by giving the elderly greater control over their Medicare dollars and greater opportunity to use their dollars to select the health care plans and services that are right for them. Such a reform, modeled after the system serving federal retirees, would use consumer choice and competition to curb waste and improve care. 

<P>Such a reform would include three principles:

<UL>
<B><LI>PRINCIPLE #1:</B> Medicare should be changed from a defined benefit program to a defined contribution program.

<B><LI>PRINCIPLE #2:</B> The elderly should be allowed to use their Medicare dollars to enroll in a plan with health services that they choose, not services that bureaucrats or politicians have chosen for them.

<B><LI>PRINCIPLE #3:</B> Cost control should be achieved through consumer choice and competition, not central planning and price controls. HCFA's complex system of price controls and other restrictions should be phased out.

<P>One reform incorporating these principles would be to provide Americans eligible for Medicare with a voucher to purchase the Medicare plan of their choice. The sum provided would be the combination of two amounts, reflecting the financing of today's Part A and a reformed Part B. The two elements of the voucher would be:

</UL>

<P><B>Portion (A)</B> Part of the voucher would be an amount -- adjusted by age, sex, reason for entitlement (age or disability), institutional status, ESRD (end-stage renal dialysis) status, and geography -- intended to cover the actuarial equivalent of the hospital and other services in today's Part A of Medicare. This portion would not be means-tested.

<P><B>Portion (B)</B> The other part of the voucher would be based on an amount -- adjusted by age, sex, and geography -- intended to cover the actuarial equivalent of the services currently in Part B. This base would be means-tested to determine the dollar amount of this element. Since today's Part B is voluntary, the elderly should be allowed to decline this portion of the voucher if they so choose.

<P>An alternative form of defined contribution would be for Medicare to cover a certain percentage of the premium for the plan of the elderly's choice, up to a maximum dollar amount. This would be more like the FEHBP but would mean somewhat less financial assistance for the lower-income elderly.

<P>The elderly could use the voucher (or percentage contribution) to purchase a Medicare-approved health plan of their choice. Medicare would distribute information on the plans to the elderly, as well as a checklist from which they could pick the desired plan. Medicare would then inform the appropriate plan of the retiree's choice.

<P>These plans, somewhat like those offered through the FEHBP to retired federal workers, would have to meet certain requirements to be marketed as Medicare-approved:

<P><B>Plan Requirement #1.</B> A plan would have to meet certain financial requirements to assure solvency. It would also have to be licensed in the state in which it provided coverage to Medicare enrollees.

<P><B>Plan Requirement #2.</B> The plan would have to specify its services and costs in a standardized manner to enable the elderly to choose without confusion. It would also have to make this information available to the government for distribution to Medicare beneficiaries.

<P><B>Plan Requirement #3.</B> Each plan would have to contain a core set of benefits, including basic hospital and physician services with catastrophic coverage. This core would be leaner than today's Medicare, thereby permitting the elderly to purchase a less expensive basic plan and supplement it with optional services or -- with the help of the voucher -- to buy those services directly from providers. As an option, plans could include a Medical Savings Account from which the enrollee could pay directly for services with insurance only for catastrophic expenditures. Funds in a Medical Savings Account could be used only for health care services.

<P>The core benefits for those declining the Part B portion of the voucher would be less extensive and focused on hospital services. Seniors who declined the Part B portion could buy additional insurance or pay for benefits without any requirement that these additional services comply with federal guidelines. Thus, the equivalent of Part B coverage would continue to be non-compulsory.

<P>An alternative would be for Congress to require that, at a minimum, each plan contain the specific services available today under Medicare, yet allow plans to offer additional services -- with perhaps higher copayments for services currently in the Medicare package.

<P>States would be precluded from mandating any benefits or premium structures for plans serving the Medicare population.

<P><B>Plan Requirement #4.</B> Each plan would have to set premiums according to limited underwriting principles:  age, sex, reason for entitlement (age or disability), institutional status, ESRD status, and geography, but not health status.35  One possible exception might be to permit "lifestyle" premium discounts for seniors willing to enroll in sickness prevention and health promotion programs.

<P><B>Plan Requirement #5.</B> Each plan would have to accept any Medicare-eligible applicant for coverage at its published terms during an annual "open season" enrollment period.


<P><B>Government's Role</B>

<P>The government's role -- particularly HCFA's -- would be limited but important. HCFA would be precluded by law from regulating either the prices of medical services to the elderly or the premiums for plans. It would have three very important functions:

<P>a) The government would create a federally sponsored corporation to offer a "Medicare Standard Plan" which would offer the standard Part A and Part B benefits available today. The Medicare Standard Plan would be assigned a premium, and any Medicare enrollee would be able to choose it in preference to any of the private plans. Enrollees would have to apply their vouchers toward the plan premium. The standard plan would have to comply with exactly the same disclosure and other requirements as any private plan.

<P>b) Each year HCFA would be responsible for running the "open season," the period in which the elderly and disabled in Medicare chose the health plan they wanted for the following year. Just before the open period, HCFA would send all enrollees information on which to base their choice:  the value of their voucher, a list of Medicare-approved plans in their area with a standardized listing of benefits and premiums, and a form for indicating their choice. This is virtually identical to the role played by the Office of Personnel Management in the FEHBP.

<P>c) Once a Medicare retiree had made a choice and returned the form, HCFA would send the voucher to the chosen plan if the premium exceeded the value of the voucher. The enrollee would be responsible for the difference but could choose to have HCFA send the entire premium, paying for the difference by reducing the amount of his Social Security check (this is how most of the elderly now pay their Part B premium). If an individual chose a low-cost plan which cost less than the voucher, HCFA would deposit the difference in a Medical Savings Account of the enrollee's choice. This money could be used only for health care payments.


<B>ADVANTAGES OF THE REFORM</B>

<P>A reform based on this consumer-choice approach would have numerous advantages for the elderly and the taxpayer.

<P><B>Freedom to Choose Plans and Benefits.</B> Under a consumer choice Medicare system, elderly Americans could choose the private health insurance that best meets their individual needs. With the advice and counsel of their doctors, they could pick not only the level of benefits above a basic set of hospital and physicians services, but also a broad range of medical services and treatments available on the free market -- for instance, a plan with drug coverage or dental care -- which they do not get under Medicare. Consulting with their doctors, rather than waiting for approval from HCFA bureaucrats, also means the elderly could take advantage of changes in treatments, medical procedures, and service delivery innovations -- something lacking in today's Medicare. The only large elderly group with access to similar breakthroughs today are retired Members of Congress and federal employees.

<P><B>Value for Money.</B> Like federal and congressional retirees, Medicare beneficiaries would be able to pocket any savings from their personal decisions. While the cost of health care is considerably higher for the elderly than for active workers and their families, the government contribution to their health plans also would be higher, depending on differences in age, sex, and geography.36  

<P><B>Controlling Costs.</B> While by no means a perfect market, the FEHBP has been able to control costs better than either private, employer-based insurance or the current Medicare program, according to the Congressional Budget Office and such private econometric firms as Lewin-ICF.37  This success is due in large part to the ability of Members of Congress and other federal workers, families, and retirees to shop among the various health plans in their geographic regions to get the best value for their money. In recent years, even though the FEHBP enrolls approximately 1.6 million higher-cost retirees and dependents and includes progressively higher benefits, outlays have increased at a much slower rate than the Medicare program's.38  With the establishment of a Medi-Choice system similar in structure to the current FEHBP, the powerful market forces of consumer choice and competition should produce similar dynamics and results in the Medicare program. 

<P><B>Reduced Red Tape and Bureaucracy.</B> To improve administration, Congress could relieve the Health Care Financing Administration of trying to dictate the minutiae of virtually every facet of health care financing and delivery for the nation's elderly. Instead of administering complex, cumbersome, and economically inefficient price controls or promulgating a seemingly endless stream of rules, regulations, and guidelines, HCFA could simply transmit defined contributions, either as vouchers or through electronic transmissions, to the plans chosen by enrollees, certify private plans as meeting basic hospital and physicians benefits, meet fiscal solvency requirements, and guarantee catastrophic coverage (a benefit Medicare does not provide). Moreover, HCFA could promulgate and enforce rules protecting elderly citizens from fraud by insurance companies. 


<P>An AARP Health Plan?

<P>Much like the National Association of Retired Federal Employees (NARFE), which rates and grades the quality and benefits of plans offered to congressional and federal retirees, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and other senior citizens' organizations could play an important role in a revamped Medicare system by rating and approving competing plans on the basis of price, service, quality, and benefits. In fact, there is every opportunity for organizations like the AARP to sponsor and market their own health care plans in competition with established insurance carriers, as do certain federal unions and employee organizations within the FEHBP.


<P><B>CONCLUSION</B>

<P>Unless Congress acts soon, Medicare costs will continue to rise at unsustainable rates and the program will become insolvent. The Medicare program is structurally unsound. It provides a false sense of security for the nation's elderly. Attempts to hold down annual cost increases of more than 10 percent per year through arbitrary price controls have failed. The Health Care Financing Administration has become entrenched, intrusive, and overly bureaucratic, issuing volumes of rules, regulations, and guidelines that are confusing not only to the public and lawmakers, but also to doctors, hospital administrators, and patients. 

<P>The new debate over Medicare reform is one of the most important since Congress debated comprehensive health care reform last year. Congress must make decisions that affect the lives of every American, working or retired, rich or poor, healthy or ill. It is imperative that participants in this debate, particularly Members of Congress, focus their attention not only on the financial health, but also on the administrative structure, including the regulatory details, of the Medicare system. While pursuing necessary spending restraints in Medicare and other government programs in order to secure an end to ruinous deficits, lawmakers also must begin a fundamental restructuring of the program with a view toward improving the quality, availability, and security of health services for the elderly well into the next century. 

<P>If Congress fails to institute fundamental reform, either the elderly will be faced with a dramatic reduction in the quantity and the quality of their health care coverage, or already overburdened working families will be forced to pay sharply higher payroll taxes just to maintain the current level of benefits. Either consequence is tantamount to fiscal and political disaster. But if Congress uses this historic opportunity to create a new Medicare system based on consumer choice and competition, it will mean health care choice and security for today's elderly and a strong and solvent retirement health care system for future generations of Americans as well.

<BR>(35) For example, rather than simply approving insurance carriers, OPM still tries to negotiate rates and benefits for hundreds of plans -- although premium prices in reality must meet the test of market demand.  Moreover, reversing a historical pattern of "passive management," the Clinton Administration has in some instances required the inclusion in plans of certain controversial services.  And Congress recently imposed the Medicare fee schedule, although it restricted it to services for federal retirees.
<BR>(36) The authors believe that the demographic risk factors are sufficient to protect health plans from undue "adverse selection."  However, if Congress determined that additional risk adjusters were needed, they could be added.
<BR>(37) As noted earlier, one central weakness of the FEHBP is its outdated insurance underwriting practices.  It currently uses a crude form of community rating, with no distinction in premium payments for active and retired federal workers and their families.  This arrangement also contributes directly to the persistent problem of "adverse selection" in the FEHBP.  The problems could be largely eliminated by an adjustment in the FEHBP premium structure that instituted higher premiums for retirees than for active workers, along with an increase in the government contribution to retirees' chosen plans or a tax credit for federal retirees to offset the increased cost.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What

can government do, if anything, to make sure that the overwhelming majority of American children grow up with a mother and father?" <i>Policy Review</i> asked a number of family experts across the political spectrum to address this question, considering state and local government as well as the federal government. <p><hr><p>
<a name="largent"><b>Rep. Steve Largent</b></a><br>
<b><i> Encourage Parental Involvement </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	In the classic movie <i>King Kong</i>, the giant ape lifts the tiny heroine into his hairy hands with a puzzled look on his face, as if to say, "She's small and cute, but now what do I do with her?" Similarly, what can or should that giant leviathan known as "government" do to provide children with parental guidance? My first thought is the same one I had when I saw the massive Kong delicately hold the fragile heroine: "I hope he doesn't hurt her."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	 Government should always keep in mind that no one loves children more than their parents. There are many in Washington who believe otherwise, and think that <i>they</i> know what's best for your children. The best thing that government can do to ensure children grow up with a mother and father is to recognize that parents -- both a mother <i>and</i> a father -- are fundamental to a child's upbringing in the first place.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	 Government needs to encourage and solicit -- not frustrate -- parental involvement in the education of children. In the early 1930s, there were more than 130,000 school boards in the United States. Today, there are fewer than 15,000. We need to encourage parental participation by restoring local school boards for each and every school and empowering them -- together with faculty and administrators -- to determine educational policies and curricula. We must also enact school choice and voucher plans to give parents more control over their children's education.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Finally, we must stem the tide of divorce, including so-called "no-fault divorce." Nothing harms children more than losing the support and involvement of either parent, a frequent result of divorce. We should give the institution of marriage greater respect and protection. A marriage ought to be difficult to enter and even more difficult to leave. How about requiring a waiting period before every wedding?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We need to acknowledge that government -- in any form -- can never provide what children need most: love. Only two people are qualified for that -- Mom and Dad.

<b><i> Revive the "Marriage Culture"</i></b>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A distressing number of children in this nation will go to bed tonight without the participation of both a mother <i>and</i> father in an important family ritual: reading a bedtime story, saying nighttime prayers, and being tucked in with reassuring goodnight kisses. This experience is more and more often a solo act for one reason: the slow death of a marriage culture. It is being replaced by a culture of divorce and illegitimacy, each of which now exists, for the first time in our nation's history, in equal proportion to their opposites. It is paramount that we re-establish an appreciation of the value and virtue of marriage, both for the individual and society. As recent history shows, this work cannot rest on the ever-expanding shoulders of government (also known to some as "the village").	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; When Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote his report on the declining health of the black family in America, few authorities took his warning seriously -- except his boss, President Lyndon Johnson. Largely influenced by Moynihan's work, Johnson's "Great Society" swelled a small government bureaucracy of 45 domestic social programs to a leviathan of 435 by the end of his administration. Yet for all this "help," things have only gotten worse since then. What can be done?

<td hspace=5>



&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; There are four obvious imperatives for government. First, it should clearly define marriage as a lifelong commitment between a man and woman. Second, states should reform no-fault divorce laws. Third, government should end our confiscatory tax structure, which undermines the financial stability of families. Our tax policy ought not merely level the playing field for married couples; we should actually <i>tilt it in their favor</i>. Fourth, the federal and state governments should reform welfare in order to end current incentives for conceiving children outside of marriage.

	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; But the real recovery of a marriage culture requires tools that the government doesn't possess or even recognize. Our nation needs both a vision for the purpose of marriage and the personal and spiritual resources to build strong unions. These can only be provided by our faith-based institutions, which are divinely commissioned and uniquely gifted to undertake this work. Without this vital contribution, many children will never enjoy the irreplaceable benefits of a home with a mother and a father. Consequently, society will suffer.<p><i>James Dobson, a psychologist, is the founder of Focus on the Family, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</i><p> 
<a name="engler"><b>Gov. John Engler</b></a><br>
<b><i> Acknowledge the Limits of Government</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government policy should follow the Hippocratic Oath. Government policies should in no way discourage the formation and preservation of families, nor add momentum to the powerful centrifugal forces breaking our families apart. Here are three reforms at the top of my list:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Tax reform. Government must reduce the tax burden on families and eliminate the marriage penalty in the tax code. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, real average weekly wages are 5.5 percent lower today than during the Reagan years. As a result, many families are in debt. Spouses are entering the work force to help make ends meet, and they raise total family income by about one-third. Yet these families must also pay almost 28 percent of their income to the federal government. In effect, mothers are having to work just to pay off Washington.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	It is useful to put the burden on our families in historical perspective. In 1954, the last year Republicans controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, federal taxes amounted to less than the tithe to your local church -- 8 percent of total family income. Often one parent chose not to work. Today, however, few families are free to make that choice, and government tax policy has burdened them unnecessarily.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Welfare Reform. Remember the stories about couples splitting up so welfare benefits would keep coming in? That was due to the "100-hour rule," which kept intact couples from working more than 100 hours per month. Unfortunately, it's still federal law. Michigan was one of the first states to apply for and receive a waiver from the federal government to exempt two-parent families from this destructive policy. The 100-hour rule is just one example of where federal welfare policy is wrong. Until states are free to undertake far-reaching reform, the system will continue to fail families.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Divorce reform. Because of the terrible impact of easy divorce on women and children, state lawmakers are taking a second look at their no-fault laws. In Michigan, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and a half-dozen other states, Republicans and Democrats alike are seeking to make the decision to get divorced a more considered one.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	A national leader in turning back no-fault divorce has been Jessie Dalman, a Michigan state legislator. She has sponsored 12 bills that would deny a divorce if only one spouse wants it -- unless that spouse could prove infidelity, desertion, alcoholism, physical or mental abuse, or other serious problems. Her legislation would also require participation in a pre-divorce program for all parties in an uncontested divorce where young children are involved.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	In addition, Dalman's legislation seeks to reduce the number of impulsive marriages by requiring a 30-day waiting period and encouraging every couple to receive counseling before their wedding day. A state marriage license would cost $20 for those who get counseling, $100 for those who do not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	It is essential that our society rethink the no-fault revolution. Over the past quarter-century, easy divorce laws have helped tear apart American families. As a society, it is time to refocus more on the needs of children and less on the desires of parents. We must make it harder for children to be victimized by a no-fault system that gives all the legal clout to the party that wants to break the marriage.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	It is essential that Washington acknowledge the limits of government. It never has been, nor will it ever be, a substitute for the family. Family renewal must, in the end, come from within the family. Despite well-publicized divorce statistics, I am hopeful that our nation can slow down the forces of disintegration. The brisk sales of works like <i>The Book of Virtues</i>, the recognition that "Dan Quayle was right," the growing impact of groups like Focus on the Family and Promise Keepers -- all these signs give me encouragement.

<b><i> Praise the Two-Parent Family </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government's first and most immediate task is to stop undermining the two-parent family. Whatever government subsidizes, it will be inundated with. In the 1930s, when government subsidized pigs, the Midwest was up to its hips in pigs. Today, we are subsidizing illegitimate children, and the result is a social catastrophe.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government ought to dismantle every welfare program that promotes single-parent families. The litmus test is simple: Any program that encourages out-of-wedlock births and supplants fathers should be eliminated. Next, government should aggressively <i>promote</i> two-parent families. The Bible says that rulers have been established "for the praise of those who do good" (1 Peter 2:14, NKJV). Here are a few ways government can "praise" the two-parent family:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Make divorce more difficult to obtain. Reduce the tax burden on the family. Defend traditional (one man, one woman) marriage. Uphold parental authority over children. Empower parents with educational choice.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	A century ago, the Supreme Court called the traditional two-parent family "the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble in our civilization; the best guaranty of that reverent morality which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political improvement" (<i>Murphy v. Ramsey</i> [1885]). I pray for leaders at all levels to have the wisdom -- and the courage -- to stand on such principles today.

<b><i> Remove Perverse Incentives </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government must encourage families to come together and stay together through cultural, not governmental, pressures. The most important role for government is to remove the perverse incentives of the welfare state.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Current policy encourages parents to abdicate financial and moral responsibility for their children to the government. Our entitlement system induces some irresponsible fathers to abandon their families, cavalierly confident that government will step in. If we resist the temptation to cure every societal ill with more government programs, I believe parental influence and responsibility will fill the void. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We must weed out invasive government policies, so that our culture can recuperate. Our current welfare system penalizes marriage and work and fosters dependency, and it must be reformed. We should also eliminate the marriage penalty in the tax code. In addition, we should modernize 60-year-old labor laws to grant working parents the opportunity for flexible work schedules, so that families can spend more time with their children.

<b><i> A Modest Role</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We should be appropriately modest about the role of government in promoting family stability. Current rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock birth reflect deep cultural changes over which law and public policy have limited influence. Still, there are some responsible steps government at various levels should take.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Reducing out-of-wedlock birth. In the past decade, several promising programs to reduce pregnancy among unmarried young people have been developed at the local level. The federal government should create -- or help the nonprofit sector create -- a clearinghouse to inventory these programs, evaluate them rigorously, and provide reliable information to states, localities, and community-based organizations. Since recent research suggests a connection between the welfare system and out-of-wedlock birth, welfare reform should permit states to adopt new policies that reduce perverse incentives.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Making marriage pay. The federal tax code tilts against families. To correct this, we should dramatically increase the dependent exemption for young children and do what we can to eliminate the marriage penalty. In addition, tax credits for education and training should be made available to parents who leave the paid work force for extended periods to care for young children and then seek to return.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Restricting divorce. States should reshape their laws of divorce to make divorce more difficult when minor children are involved. I favor the elimination of unilateral no-fault in such cases, with the alternative of a five-year waiting period. In addition, as Maggie Gallagher, Elizabeth Scott, and others have suggested, states should stand behind the premarital agreements of couples who wish to make their own marriages harder to dissolve than state law requires.

<b><i> Find the Will </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Can government do anything to reverse the trend of fatherlessness? Yes. Reform no-fault divorce laws, eliminating the right to unilateral divorce on demand. Lengthen waiting periods for divorce. Create financial and other incentives for engaged couples to participate in marriage preparation and for couples with troubled marriages to get counseling.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Reform school curricula that trivialize or denigrate marriage. Stop the practice of mainstreaming pregnant girls and teen mothers through the school system. Prohibit boys who impregnate girls from participating in sports and other extracurricular school programs. Enforce statutory rape laws. Put the current welfare system out of its misery and replace it with public and private efforts, including faith-based initiatives, that embody effective compassion and promote marriage.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Eliminate the antimarriage bias in the Earned Income Tax Credit. Increase the value of the marriage deduction in the tax code. Calculate child-oriented tax exemptions and credits on a per-parent basis -- that is, permit households with two parents twice the exemption and credit value of one-parent households.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Give priority to married couples in public housing. Reform adoption laws and procedures so that more children will be adopted, sooner, by married couples. Appoint and hire people who will publicly insist that unwed childbearing is wrong, that our divorce rate is far too high, and that our society should dedicate itself to increasing the proportion of our children who grow up with their two married parents.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	The real question is not whether we know what would work, but whether we want to do what would work.<p><i>David Blankenhorn is the president of the Institute for American Values and the author of </i>Fatherless America<i> (<a href="http://www.harpercollins.com">HarperCollins</a>).</i><p><a name="quayle"><b> Dan Quayle </b></a><br>
<b><i> Preserve, Protect, Defend the Family </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	There is no question government has a role, albeit a minor one, to play in strengthening families. In recent years, the real problem in our society hasn't been so much that families have failed but that government has failed to act in the best interest of families. Some common-sense reforms would do much to correct the government's anti-family bias.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Taxes. The government could and should immediately repeal the marriage penalty, increase the tax exemption for children and index it for inflation, and repeal regulations prohibiting employers from paying "family wages." As a long-term solution, I support a modified flat tax that maintains the deductions for home mortgages and charitable giving.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Divorce. States should reassess their "no-fault" divorce laws, and make children's interests paramount in divorce proceedings.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Welfare. We should scrap our current system, which encourages illegitimacy and discourages work, in favor of new ways to help those truly in need. Senator Dan Coats's "Project for American Renewal" is a good place to start.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Adoption. The House of Representatives has passed reforms removing barriers to interracial adoption and making adoption easier in general. The Senate should pass this bill and send it to the president.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We also desperately need help from nongovernment institutions like the media and the entertainment community. They have a tremendous influence on our culture and they should join in when it comes to strengthening families. <p><i>Dan Quayle, the 44th vice president of the United States, is the chairman of Campaign America.</i><p><a name="weyrich"><b> Paul M.

<b><i> Reverse an Anti-Marriage Bias </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	In 1987, the Free Congress Foundation pioneered the development of cultural conservatism with a book called <i>Cultural Conservatism: Toward a New National Agenda</i>, by William S. Lind and William H. Marshner. This book suggests that, to strengthen American families, government could:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Raise the personal exemption (for dependents only) to its original, 1948 value, which in today's dollars would be more than $6,000. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Make the child-care credit universal, so parents who care for their own children receive the same benefits as those who send their kids to day care.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Permit employers to offer a "family wage," that is, a higher wage to heads of families. The family wage was a major Victorian reform that was made illegal by a Department of Labor regulation issued in 1966.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Eliminate "no-fault" divorce.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Assign children their own guardian <i>ad litem</i> in any divorce proceeding. The guardian would represent the children's interest in having the parents stay together.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Limit cash welfare benefits to intact families and offer "matching grants" to heads of intact families with full-time jobs whose income is insufficient to support a family.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Fund programs in which volunteers build homes for sale (not rent) to the poor, with the proviso that these homes may only be sold to intact families.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Current government policies reflect a consistent bias against traditional families. The proposals above depend upon the willingness of those who make government policy to favor such families and regard them as essential to the nation's future. In the face of the influence of "political correctness" (which is to say, cultural Marxism) in both political parties, that most basic change will be the most difficult to bring about.

<b><i> Do No Harm </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government's first obligation is to do no harm. For 60 years, Big Government has engaged in massive intrusion into the family -- with disastrous consequences. It is time to get out of the way. <p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	What the government should not do has been obvious to conservatives for many years. It should not maintain a tax system that punishes two-parent families and forces both parents to work; it should not grant "no-fault" divorces more readily than drivers' licenses; and it should not maintain a welfare system that rewards illegitimacy and punishes women who get married.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Ronald Reagan used to say that "government does not solve problems; it subsidizes them." Social engineering, whether done by liberals or conservatives, is still social engineering. Imagine the horrific programs the federal bureaucracy would create to "help" the family. First, it would redefine "family," then "mothers," then "fathers." Could they really even settle on a definition of a child? <p><i>Kay James is the dean of the Robertson School of Government at <a href="http://www.regent.edu/">Regent University</a>, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.</i><p>

<h2>A Solution Waiting to be Adopted</h2>
<b>by Charmaine Crouse Yoest</b>

</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">W</font>hen 48-year-old Hillary Rodham Clinton confessed to <i>Time</i> magazine recently that she wanted to adopt a child, it set off a small tempest of controversy. Her comment was hailed by supporters as evidence of her bona fides as a child advocate and decried by detractors as yet another reincarnation of the First Lady as First Mother. Some dismissed the remark as an effort to minimize the fallout from her husband's veto of the bill to ban partial-birth abortions. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Interpretations aside, the incident highlights the unique position adoption occupies in our political firmament. Although many in the adoption community wish it were otherwise, adoption is closely tied to the abortion question. And as abortion politics grow more heated, adoption demands attention as the nearest thing to middle ground in a polarizing issue.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But adoption is enmeshed in politics of its own. It continues to suffer from the controversy over transracial placements and from the bureaucratic delays of the foster-care system. President Clinton, for example, says he will support a House bill that would prohibit states from denying adoptions based on race, but the proposal faces intense opposition from special interest groups attached to the Democratic Party. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This complex issue has two sides: infant adoption and adoption out of foster care. For many years now, only 1 to 2 percent of women faced with unwanted pregnancies have made adoption plans. At the same time, the number of couples waiting to adopt is usually estimated at around 2 million. The tragic paradox is that while many families desperately wait for children, many children wait for families. According to the Institute for Children, state welfare agencies have adoption plans for 100,000 foster-care children nationwide, and 50,000 are legally free to be adopted but are languishing in foster care.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The National Association of Black Social Workers has for years decried adoption of black infants by white families as "racial genocide." Accepted social-work practice holds that a child be held in foster care until an "appropriate" -- read "racially correct" -- family is found. This sometimes occurs even when a white family is waiting to adopt a particular minority child. In theory, race-matching of infants and adoptive parents makes sense; in practice, it means that minority children in some states typically wait two to three years longer for new homes than white children.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Meanwhile, children are often trapped in foster care by the false hopes of the "family preservation" philosophy. With misguided compassion, social workers and judges work to preserve families broken apart by drug addiction and physical abuse, when the children need loving, stable homes. Moreover, the foster-care system is sustained by monetary incentives to keep children in care: Federal money comes into the system based on each day a child stays in foster care. The hurdles to get a child into a permanent adoptive home are high, while the incentives are low. As a result, children can drift in the system for years, waiting for the elusive "family reunification."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Eva is one of those children. She last saw her biological mother 10 years ago, when she was eight. Her biological father is not involved in her life in any way. But 1996 was a year of exciting milestones for Eva. She graduated from high school, and a court finally approved her adoption by her long-term foster parents. It took the law a long time to sanction the family they'd already formed--eight and a half years ago.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why the delay? Eva's biological father refused to consent to the adoption. Eva wants her story told because it isn't over. Her two younger brothers have been living in a residential placement center for nearly nine years, even though her new family would like to adopt them as well. Compassion and common sense say yes; red tape says no. Eva's story is much too common. The time that children spend in foster care before their situations are resolved can be excruciatingly long. Ten percent of children in foster care stay more than 7.4 years. And the number of children in state care keeps increasing. Between 1982 and 1992, the number rose 69 percent, from 262,000 children to 442,000.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Behind the statistics are thousands of Evas yearning for homes. Fortunately, reform is in the air. Frustration with lengthy stays in foster care, rising incidents of child abuse, and concern over persistently high abortion rates are helping to focus renewed attention on adoption. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Various efforts -- by private groups, state governments, and Congress--aim to reform the system to let needy children connect with a loving family. The following are some recent initiatives:<p><b>The Texas Model</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Texas governor George W. Bush presides over one of 10 states in which 75 percent of the nation's foster-care population resides. Texas currently has 12,000 children in foster care, of whom 1,400 are available for adoption. But even the children ready for permanent homes may face a long journey: It usually takes the state two years after termination of parental rights to place these children in permanent adoptive homes. Most important from a child's view, foster care itself is a pretty bumpy ride: children average four different placements before they get a permanent adoption.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The 1996 annual report of the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services found that, since 1991, the average length of stay for children who were ultimately adopted was 40.8 months. It took 15 months to terminate parental rights after entering foster care, another 18 months to be placed for adoption, and another seven months to finalize the adoption.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	Bush wants to cut the time kids spend in foster care in half, and has established the Governor's Committee to Promote Adoption to help make Texas a model of adoption reform. The 13-person committee includes several adoptive parents, pastors, and representatives of private adoption efforts such as One Church and One Child. It is due to hand the governor a report in September identifying state policies that hinder adoption. State adoptions, for example, are subject to challenge up to two years after the finalization of the adoption decree -- leaving families and children in a legal limbo.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So far the committee has targeted two areas for reform: judicial and administrative. Beverly Jimmerson,  Policy Advisor to the governor, notes that courts waste a lot of time when they fail to schedule prompt hearings concerning a child's adoption status. In addition, the committee has discovered that state agencies providing social services to adults fail to prioritize parents who need mental services or addiction treatment. Parents may wait months, or even years, for treatment while their children languish in foster care. The committee's goal is to propose a legislative reform agenda for the 1997 legislative session. <p><b>Kids and the Race Card</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A significant reason for adoption delays in Texas and other states is the ongoing debate over leaving minority children in foster care until suitable minority parents can adopt them -- even though white families are willing and able to take the children in. That battle is now being waged in Washington in the form of the Adoption Promotion and Stability Act. The bill, which passed the House and remains in Senate committee, proposes three significant policy changes:
<ul><li><b>	Give a $5,000 tax credit to middle-class families that adopt children.</b> The bill provides a tax credit for families with income under $75,000 to offset their expenses in adoption. Agency fees, court costs, and attorney fees can create an insurmountable hurdle for many families that might otherwise be able to adopt.<p>
<li><b>	Prohibit the practice of denying adoptions based on race.</b> The goal is to stop state agencies from using racial considerations to delay or prevent adoption of children under their care. In 1994, former senator Howard Metzenbaum shepherded to passage the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to eliminate racial barriers to adoption. In designing regulations to implement the bill, the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Donna Shalala essentially nullified its race-neutral intent.<p>
<li><b>	Amend the Indian Child Welfare Act to prevent tribes from nullifying adoptions.</b> The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), a federal law passed in 1978, grants Indian tribes the legal standing to contest the adoption of any baby with any Indian ancestry. At the time, the law was necessary to halt unethical adoption practices that preyed on Indian babies. But the act, which assigned the tribe a legal interest in the child "on a parity with the interest of the parents," has strayed into reverse racism. 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A current Ohio adoption case illustrates how convoluted and damaging this mindset can be. The Rost family adopted two twin girls. Subsequently, the birth-grandmother decided she wanted the babies. Grandparents do not have standing to contest an adoption; under the ICWA, Indian tribes do. The grandmother then retroactively enrolled herself, her son, and the twins in the Pomo Tribe of California. The tribe is now contesting the adoption on the grounds that three of the twins' 32 great-great-great-grandparents were Pomo Indian. Courts have previously decided that as little as one-256th of Indian blood (that's one great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparent) qualifies a case for consideration under the ICWA.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The ramifications for adoption could be enormous. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado informed the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that, although there are just over a million people officially enrolled in tribes, at least 15 million Americans can claim Indian ancestry. Echoing the National Association of Black Social Workers, Congressman Don Young of Arkansas told the committee that adoption of Indian children outside the tribe amounted to "a form of brain drain and genocide." While adults argue over rights and racism, children are the ones who wait and suffer.<P>

<b>Casey Goes to Bat for Kids</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A new private project to promote both infant adoption and adoption out of foster care is the Fund for the American Family, founded last summer by former Pennsylvania governor Robert Casey. A prominent pro-life Democrat, Casey is marshaling his political clout to raise the profile of adoption, which he believes is a cornerstone in rebuilding the American family. He is lobbying heavily on adoption reform and recently testified before Congress in support of the adoption tax credit.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Making adoption a national priority is one of the group's top four projects. It has already sponsored two adoption summits, bringing together leading experts to discuss ways of breaking down the barriers to adoption. Casey expects to publish a set of reform proposals this fall to spur state and federal officials to reform the system.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Our goal is to see 100,000 adoptions each year for the next five years," up from 50,000, says Chris Casey, the executive director of the fund. To realize this goal, Casey is trying to bring together all 50 governors for a summit similar to the 1989 governor's conference on education.

<b>A Memo for Reform </b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1993, the Cambridge-based Institute for Children began Assignment Adoption to change foster-care and adoption practices in all 50 states. In the first 12 months after Massachusetts governor William Weld signed on to the initiative, adoptions from foster care increased by about 47 percent. The Institute is now working with Texas governor George Bush and recommended to his Adoption Committee the following plan for reform:<p>1. Make foster care a truly temporary form of caring for vulnerable children; enact policies and practices that have as their goal a 12-month maximum stay for children in substitute care. <p>2. Grant biological parents no more than 12 months to prove their fitness to resume custody of their children.<p>3. Give biological fathers 30 days from the birth of the child to formalize paternity, or forfeit the right to contest adoption.<p>4. Prohibit any race-based delays in adoption.<p>5. Terminate parental rights for abandoned children after 30 days, and allow them to be adopted through a private agency--without placement in long-term foster care.<p>6. Find adoptive homes for children within 30 days after the termination of parental rights or contract the process out to a private agency.<p>7. Make entrance requirements for foster families as stringent as those for adoptive families.<p>8. Hold the state Department of Human Services accountable for reporting its progress in finding homes for children in foster care.<p>9. Encourage private-sector involvement in improving components of the substitute-care system.

<center><h2> Pro-Life Dilemma: Pregnancy Centers and the Welfare Trap </h2>
<b>By Frederica Mathewes-Green </b>
<p>
<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>
<a href="/heritage/p_review/jul96/toc.html">July-August 1996, Number 78</a></i>
<hr width=50%></center>
<blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A story like this begins perhaps a thousand times every day: A woman's hand trembles as she scans the big-city Yellow Pages. The ads for abortion clinics have flowers and birds and slogans about caring, and one shows a pretty couple grinning at each other at the seashore. That makes her start crying again. Her boyfriend never looked at her like that.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But elsewhere on the page she sees an ad showing a woman curled around a baby. The phone number ends with the letters H-O-P-E. She hadn't thought about hope, but she feels like she really needs to talk to someone who has some, right now. She dials the number.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Half a year later, she is stepping out of the Hope Pregnancy Center. It's her first visit since the birth. Her little boy fusses while everyone hugs her. She stands for a moment in the spring sunshine. She's made it through these months after all. It's taken courage, and it's been tough, but this precious child has been brought through safely and given the gift of life. Without the love of the women at the center, this child would have died. She looks down at his wizened face. He is all she has now. Tears prick her eyes again, as she turns and walks to the bus stop.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What happens to mother and child next?	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"It horrifies me sometimes," says Pat Evans, the unpaid director of Birthright, a crisis-pregnancy center in Annapolis, Maryland. "She's on the list for public housing, but that housing is invariably in bad sections. But if she turns it down, she's off the list, or put back on at the bottom to wait all over again."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And how does she support herself? "She probably gets $225 a month on welfare, and there's food stamps, WIC [nutrition aid to women, infants, and children], and medical assistance," says Evans, who has counseled thousands of women in her 16 years there. "In all these years, I've seen less than a half-dozen find a way to work. Once they have that baby, how can they find a job that pays enough to buy a car to get to the job, and cover day care as well?" Evans's center, which assists about 1,200 women a year, can help some with housing for a year after the birth, but can't offer permanent housing or employment. "I don't see any answer to that; it's almost impossible. When she has a child, everything gets very hard."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America's 3,000 pregnancy centers have been rescuing women and their unborn children for 30 years now. When we list the nonbureaucratic, grass-roots organizations that are doing the most to save threatened lives, pregnancy centers must rank near the top.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These privately funded, storefront operations offer women material and emotional support free of charge, and they help hundreds of thousands each year to have their babies. Perhaps more than any other institution, these centers are shaping attitudes about abortion and the unborn--one person at a time--in a decidedly pro-life direction. While conservatives debate the wisdom of a pro-life agenda for the 1996 presidential campaign, tens of thousands of volunteers are quietly keeping a candle glowing through the darkest night of many women's lives.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the old joke, a grandmother peevishly greets the exhausted hero who has just rescued her grandson from a frozen lake: "But where are his mittens?" The pregnancy centers and their staff endure difficult, lifesaving work, little or no pay, and obscurity occasionally alleviated by insult. It hardly seems right for those of us who value these centers' hard work to punctuate our praise with grumbling about lost mittens. But the recent evolution in society's attitudes toward welfare compel a closer look.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For all the good crisis-pregnancy centers do, 80 to 90 percent of their clients--about 200,000 a year--eventually set up single-parent households. Most of these mothers and their children soon find themselves on their own, with no reliable means of financial support. Many end up permanently dependent on government welfare. Some even slip into homelessness. And we all know the eventual outcomes for many of the children born into such households: poverty, low academic achievement, susceptibility to crime. If pregnancy-counseling centers are to serve the best long-term interests of children, many of them will need to think beyond pregnancy and birth--to finding each one a two-parent home.<p><b>A Welfare World View</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To Evans and others like her, welfare is a necessity. Without it, the young women they serve would grow even more desolate and desperate. "We do put people on welfare," says Evans. "We do create the single-parent homes, but at least the baby is alive. Someone has to help us if this is going to change. As it is, the volunteers are doing it all themselves--counseling, giving supplies, taking women to live in their homes."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But it is important to acknowledge that welfare causes more crisis pregnancies. By making single-parent households possible, welfare dollars remove the stigma of sex and pregnancy outside marriage. Girls who grow up without a father are more than twice as likely to have a baby out of wedlock themselves.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is time for the pregnancy-care movement to broaden its vision of how best to help unwed mothers. Such a change has already begun in the last six years or so. The movement once focused narrowly on saving unborn babies; now it emphasizes giving the mother practical support so she can save her own child.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The movement's next step is to seek the best possible future for both mother and child. Too often, the crisis mentality of the moment envisions only two possibilities: The woman will have an abortion, or she'll "keep the baby," usually as a single mom. In reality, there are two other options that merit pro-lifers' support.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A poll conducted by <a href="http://www.frc.org/">Family Research Council</a> in 1995 asked respondents which course they thought would be best for an unwed, pregnant teen. Twenty-nine percent thought her best choice was to place the child for adoption. Slightly fewer, 24 percent, felt she should marry the father of the child. Eleven percent thought single-parenting was her best course. Only 8 percent recommended abortion.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Reality turns these numbers upside down. In 1991, 46 percent of pregnancies to unwed mothers ended in abortion. Most of the rest, 44 percent, were carried to term. (Miscarriages make up the difference.) Of those births to unwed moms, only 2 percent were placed for adoption; the remainder of the unwed moms kept their babies. How many of those also married the babies' dads is unknown; pregnancy-care workers reckon the figure is quite low.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the pregnancy-care movement could find effective ways to encourage women to choose <a href="http://www.infi.net/adopt/">adoption</a>, they could help give children a two-parent home and offer both the children and their moms greater security. By thinking beyond merely "saving that baby" or getting the woman through pregnancy, counselors can help bolster the social institutions that undergird a healthy society and replace welfare bureaucracy with family-based alternatives.<p><b>Talking about Adoption</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	Most two-parent homes are created by marriage, and a few pregnancy centers encourage their clients to consider this option. But in general, pregnancy centers seem better equipped to incorporate the adoption option into their work. June Ring, the coordinator of adoption resources for Presbyterians Pro-life, is one of a handful of pro-lifers who are charting such a course. She has devised a seminar, "Adoption: Making a Plan for Life," to train the center's staff to present adoption as an attractive alternative. The counselors' first duty is to raise the topic in the first place. "One study found that in 40 percent of counseling situations, adoption was not even mentioned to the client as an option," Ring says, "even though the majority of counselors felt favorably toward adoption." She proposes that pregnancy-care workers resolve to mention adoption to every single client. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
According to the National Council for Adoption, a 1991 study found that pregnant, unmarried teens who were counseled in a program that mentioned adoption to every client were seven times more likely to choose it. When the teen's parents were involved in counseling, they were six times more likely to choose adoption. Teens asked to compare adoption with single parenting were also six times more likely to choose adoption.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But pregnancy centers are cautious about how they discuss this option. Some women who placed their infants for adoption have subsequently sued the centers where they had received counseling, saying they had felt coerced. In Florida, state authorities warned a pregnancy center that volunteers could not discuss adoption with clients, since the center was not a licensed adoption agency. A federal court later declared this "gag rule" unconstitutional.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Incidents like these tend to scare off cash-poor pregnancy centers. They may use a "reality therapy" approach, helping clients compare the tough life of a single parent with that of a mom who chooses adoption, but they won't state that adoption is better. "We don't coerce, convince, or make the decisions, but we do give complete, objective, and accurate information," Ring says. "We want the client to consider adoption equally and in as much depth as other options."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One problem many centers confront is the one-visit client. A woman comes in for a free pregnancy test, gets a positive result, and leaves, never to be seen again. Even then, Ring says, the center can "plant an adoption seed" by mentioning that alternative. "Emphasize her motherhood," says Ring. A positive result on the pregnancy test means she's already the mother of an unborn child. What does she think goes into being a good parent? Might those be things an adoptive couple could do for her child? "Help her see that planning an adoption can accomplish those parenting goals for her."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ring's cool phrasing about helping the woman "accomplish parenting goals" avoids a trap that ensnares some unwitting pregnancy workers. When counselors see only two alternatives, aborting the child or giving it life, they may try to tip the scale toward life by awakening the maternal instinct. As the woman falls in love with her unborn baby, the center may shower her with baby gifts, give her a handmade quilt or blanket, and introduce her to previous clients who are now cuddling beautiful babies. Once her maternal emotions are ignited, the mom might not be able to let her child go. (The 1991 study cited above found that pregnant teens counseled in programs that introduced them to teen parents were four times less likely to choose adoption.) 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Counselors must strike a delicate balance: Encourage mothers-to-be to love their babies enough to give them life, yet still be willing to place them with two-parent homes. To some women, planning for adoption smacks of abandoning the child and of being a bad mother.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Anne Pierson, of a group called Loving and Caring, is also trying to increase awareness of adoption. Pierson, who offers training to pregnancy centers and maternity homes, has incorporated Ring's materials into her "A Future and a Hope" seminar. "The pregnant woman needs to see that she's giving the child the gift of a family," Pierson says, "not that she's giving the adoptive couple the gift of a child. She is being a very good parent by making a good plan for the child."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While counselors target the client, Pierson targets the counselors. Those who have had children may harbor an unconscious bias against adoption, she says, because many cannot understand how another mom could "give up" her own child. "We find that one reason counselors are ineffective in presenting adoption is that it's not settled in their own hearts," says Pierson. "They don't understand what it means to be an adopted child of God; they don't understand Scripture." Pierson believes that a better understanding of the biblical teaching about adoption--how it suggests God's unconditional acceptance of people into his spiritual family--can help counselors present it more effectively.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Counselors need practical advice as well, and Loving and Caring is setting up seminars to deliver it. "We work with them on key issues: how to bring it up, how to talk about it, the experience of grieving, the mom's experience of learning new things about herself," says Pierson. "The journey of adoption, the entire process, is as important as the decision itself." 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the LIGHT House maternity home in Kansas City, Missouri, 10 percent of the clients--well above the national average--choose adoption. One reason is that the home strips away myths about motherhood, adoption, and abortion. "We don't push one decision or another, but we do help them make an informed decision," says Shirley Gibson, the director of residential services and adoption. "We want them to have a realistic view of being a single parent--not only the financial but the emotional cost." Residents talk frankly about the good and bad sides of any decision, including the grief they may feel after an adoption placement. But it's hard not to be starry-eyed over the prospect of cuddling a sweet baby.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of a pink cherub, however, clients get to hold "Baby Jamie"--an electronic infant that records such things as how long the girl takes to respond when it cries, how long to feed it, and whether it's being abused. Girls who think they'd like to parent can take a turn with Baby Jamie. They must carry a diaper bag and get up in the night for "feedings," while keeping to their regular school schedule.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another reason for the high adoption rate at LIGHT House is its emphasis on reaching abortion-minded women. "Women who are considering abortion are more open to adoption," says Gibson. "Some people don't mind being pregnant. All they want is free medical care. Our primary goal is alternatives to abortion." If the woman is considering abortion because she doesn't want to raise a baby, adoption can accomplish her goal as well.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to individual counseling, women contemplating adoption participate in an intensive, 20-week adoption class. The course covers everything from legal issues like the birth father's rights to preparing for birth, handling grief, and deciding whether to write a letter to the child that the adoptive parents can put aside for later. (The LIGHT House does not encourage ongoing contact between the birth mother and the adoptive family.) "The scariest part is these feelings you're having," Gibson says. "You think you're the only one having them. It's reassuring to learn that [all] birth mothers feel the same way. After the birth, if you feel like changing your mind, that might be an intellectual decision--or it might be an emotional decision. We ask them to think: Are the reasons you initially decided for adoption still valid?" 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Most pregnancy counselors agree that adoption needs to become more visible. Mariam Bell, a would-be adoptive mom in Annandale, Virginia, spends many Saturday mornings with friends setting up a table outside a nearby abortion clinic. The table is covered with a gingham cloth, and stocked with coffee and doughnuts; helium balloons and signs reading "Choose Adoption" and "We Care About You" complete the scene. If cars pause on the way in, Bell hands the passengers a packet containing information about adoption and profiles of prospective adoptive couples. Many passengers stop to talk, then leave without entering the clinic. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"Many girls are crying as they're being driven in," Bell says. "They're not joyfully exercising some right to privacy; they are in trauma. Seeing that was very important in reinforcing my belief that this is the approach we need to take." An approach, that is, that demonstrates pro-lifers can stand outside an abortion clinic doing something peaceful, positive, and ultimately hopeful.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Among society's most pressing problems is the seemingly endless supply of pregnancies to unwed mothers. Pregnancy centers have 30 years' experience in offering mothers the personal support and encouragement needed to make a life-affirming choice. But once born, that baby deserves a better life than welfare and single-parenting can offer. Pregnancy centers, which have already done so much to better the prospects of women and children, need to expand their vision one more time. They should do far more to encourage mothers to consider adoption. This is less a criticism of pregnancy centers' valiant work than a discovery. It turns out that we've found the mittens after all. We just need to put them to use.<p><I>Frederica Mathewes-Green is a syndicated columnist and the author of</I> Real Choices: Offering Practical, Life-Affirming Alternatives to Abortion<I> (Questar, 1994).</I>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When President Clinton vetoed welfare reform last year, he also vetoed significant adoption reforms included in the package. Congress will soon take up the adoption issue again in the Adoption and Stability Act of 1996 (<a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.03286:">H.R. 3286</a>), sponsored by Representative Susan Molinari (R-NY).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The key component of this bill is a $5,000 tax credit to encourage adoption. This tax relief is phased out gradually for families with annual incomes between $75,000 and $110,000. Beyond ending inequities in interracial and Indian adoptions, the bill also permits employees to deduct from their taxes up to $5,000 in employer assistance for additional adoption expenses. These reforms are financed by changes in foreign trust law and in energy subsidies, both mechanisms also approved by the House and Senate last year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The $5,000 tax credit, which may be spread out over five years, defrays a significant portion of the costs of adopting a child and is a bargain to taxpayers who now pay an average of $13,000 per year to foster a child.<sup>2</sup>  But the bill still does not allow the credit to apply to payroll taxes, and thus prevents families who adopt but pay less than $1,000 in federal taxes each year<sup>3</sup> from benefiting from the adoption tax credit. These are precisely the families who need help the most.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Ending Discrimination.</b> H.R. 3286 removes obstacles to interracial adoption by penalizing, with a decrease in funding, any state that refuses to allow any person to adopt a child regardless of race or color. It also ends an unjust application of the Indian Child Welfare Act. Today, parents who are totally or partially Indian and have not maintained close contact with their tribe may have the adoption of their child by non-Indian parents blocked. This can be achieved by admitting the child or one of the parents to full membership in the tribe, even after the adoption has taken place. In the future, under H.R. 3286, unless one of the parents maintains a significant affiliation with the tribe, adoption by non-Indian parents may not be blocked.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Other reforms are needed in the adoption and foster care system if the rate of adoptions is to increase. Removing the barriers to adoption in the social service bureaucracy is the most significant of these remaining reforms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption rates have declined in recent decades as adoption has fallen out of favor with state governments and the social services establishment. In 1979, 598,000 babies were born out of wedlock; almost one in four was adopted. In 1991, of the 1,225,000 born out of wedlock, only one in 25 was adopted (see <a href="bg1080c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). Yet public interest has increased: close to two million couples would like to adopt these children. Clearly, the problem is far more basic than any financial burden that may be involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of the vast need for adoption and the large pool of parents willing to adopt, Congress not only should encourage adoptions through generous tax relief for adopting parents, but also must change the public social service ethos by eliminating all barriers to speedy and permanent adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The simplest and fastest way to bring about these improvements is to privatize all adoption services. Government agencies have institutional strengths in applying and enforcing the law, but private institutions can better harness the human qualities needed to nurture and develop children. To encourage adoption through private organizations, and to reduce barriers to adoption through government agencies, Congress, the Administration, and the states need to take several important actions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the federal government should do:
<P><ul>
<li>Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.
<p>
<li>Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of a very effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.
<P>
<li>Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.
<p>
<li>Require federally funded family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.
<p>
<li>Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.
<p>
<li>Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit any use of race or ethnicity to deny or delay the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.
<p>
<li>Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.
<P>
<li>Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the states should do:
<ul><p>
<li>Privatize adoption services.
<p>
<li>Change the way public welfare agencies are financed so that they are obliged to contract for all public adoptions.
<p>
<li>Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments.
<p>
<li>Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children.
<p>
<li>Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions.
<p>
<li>Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.
<p>
<li>Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.
<p>
<li>Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.
<p>
<li>Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.
<P>
<li>Enact legislation subjecting public social service agencies to the same licensing standards and requirements as those imposed on private adoption agencies.
<P>
<li>Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.
<p>
<li>Prohibit the removal of a child eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt, except when the child is being returned to his legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.
<p>
<li>Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption works. It increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the public. It brings much happiness, both to the adopting parents and to the adopted child. It is good for all involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The current welfare reform debate in Congress offers one of the best chances in decades to promote adoption. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add steadily to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. At the same time, up to two million couples waiting to adopt frequently find themselves hamstrung by government agencies and government practices.
<p>
<b>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past 25 years there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of children born out of wedlock, children being raised by single parents, families on welfare, and children entering the foster care system because of abuse and neglect. Family disintegration is widespread. There also has been a sharp decrease in the number of children being adopted, with formal adoptions dropping by almost 50 percent: from 89,000 in 1970 to a fairly constant 50,000 annually throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to Christine Bachrach, now Director of the Demographic and Behavioral Sciences Branch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), adoption has declined since the early 1970s primarily because of a drop in the proportion of white mothers who place their babies for adoption. Birth mothers who have continued to place their babies for adoption are more likely to have well educated mothers, are still at school,  have never worked, and are older. Also, they are more likely to place daughters for adoption than sons. Levels of adoption have remained low for blacks and are virtually non-existent for Hispanic women.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Women likely to adopt tend to be married, sterile,<sup>6</sup> and 30 years of age or older. Nearly half of all women with these characteristics have adopted.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Council for Adoption estimates that of the 50,000 children adopted annually, 25,000 are healthy children under age two, 10,000 are healthy children over age two, and 15,000 are children with "special needs" (the social work term of art for children considered difficult to place because of their age, physical or mental condition, race or ethnicity, or need to be placed with siblings).<sup>8</sup>  About one-third of these adoptions are arranged by government-funded and government-managed public agencies, some by contract with private agencies. Another one-third are arranged by private, mostly nonprofit agencies, and the rest are contracted outside of agency auspices, mostly through lawyers in private practice. International adoptions accounted for an additional 8,000 adoptions during 1994.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption fell out of favor among social workers during the 1970s, even as single parenthood and abortion became more widespread. Advocates of government-sponsored social programs argued that increases in welfare would make it possible for unmarried mothers to rear children without the assistance of a father.<sup>9</sup>  Yet, as is evident from the skyrocketing foster care numbers<sup>10</sup> and from the chronic problems associated with the absence of fathers, such as crime, poor school performance, poor health status, and low income,<sup>11</sup> that view has turned out to be a tragic mistake. By contrast, children adopted by two parents are doing as well as their peers raised in their own intact families.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<b>PATTERNS OF PARENTAL NEGLECT </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The rapid increase of illegitimacy and the staggering problems of children born out of wedlock and raised without fathers are well documented.<sup>13</sup>
<p><ul>
<li>In 1991, 29.5 percent of all births and 68 percent of minority births were out of wedlock.<sup>14</sup>  In 1970, 10.7 percent of all children and 37.6 percent of minority children were born to unmarried mothers.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1986, 66 percent of unintended pregnancies ended in abortion and 33 percent ended with a woman choosing to be a single parent. Only 1 percent ended in adoption.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1992, 659,000 children were in state-sponsored foster care and institutional care for all or part of the year. On any given day, half a million American children live in government-sponsored substitute care.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1982, 7,100 infants were in substitute care outside their homes; in 1988, there were over 17,000.
<p>
<li>In 1991, 2,000 children died from abuse or neglect. Some were murdered. Between 30-50 percent of children killed by their parents or caretakers were known to child protective services before their murders took place.<sup>18</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There has been a sharp increase in the number of infants abandoned by their frequently drug-addicted mothers. According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 12,000 infants were abandoned in 1991.<sup>19</sup>  In response to this crisis, there has been a proliferation of "boarder baby"<sup>20</sup> homes to care for these children until their parents can be located and rehabilitated. A 1993 General Accounting Office report showed that 10,000 infants were being boarded in hospitals for no medical reason. Less than 40 percent of the boarder babies -- and none of the abandoned babies -- were expected to leave in the care of their parents.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The average total cost of caring for these babies in hospital after their medical treatment is almost $13,000.<sup>21</sup>  Nonetheless, only 2.5 percent of the boarder babies and 6 percent of the abandoned infants were expected to go into adoptive placements.<sup>22</sup>  The vast majority of these children will spend years in and out of the foster care system while the biological mother attempts to get her life together.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Federal efforts to deal with this have been small and swamped by the size of the problem.<sup>24</sup>  When Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL) introduced the At-Birth Abandoned Infants Act (H.R. 2936) in 1994 to help move abandoned babies out of the system and into permanent adoptive homes, the child welfare establishment lobbied against it, arguing that creating a two-tiered system -- a fast track for new-born abandoned babies and a slower, less responsive one for older children -- was unfair.<sup>25</sup>  The bill was not enacted.
<p>
<b>WHY ADOPTION SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED</b>
<p>
<b>Benefits for Children</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adopted children do as well as or better than their non-adopted counterparts, according to a 1994 study by the Search Institute, a Minneapolis-based public policy research organization specializing in questions of concern to states and cities.<sup>26</sup>  This study, the largest examination of adopted adolescents yet undertaken, concludes that:
<p><ul>
<li>Teens who were adopted at birth are more likely than children born into intact families to live with two parents in a middle-class family.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted children score higher than their middle-class counterparts on indicators of school performance, social competency, optimism, and volunteerism.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted adolescents generally are less depressed than children of single parents and less involved in alcohol abuse, vandalism, group fighting, police trouble, weapon use, and theft.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted adolescents score higher than children of single parents on self-esteem, confidence in their own judgment, self-directedness, positive view of others, and feelings of security within their families.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
<li>On health measures, adopted children and children of intact families share similarly high scores, and both those groups score significantly higher than children raised by single parents.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<li>Adopted children do well at school. In 1981, only 7 percent of children adopted in infancy repeated a grade, while 12 percent of children living with both biological parents repeated a grade.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li>Compared with the general child population, children placed with adoptive couples are better off economically. Their parents are better educated and older than the parents of other children.<sup>33</sup>
<P>
<li>Adoptive parents are less likely to divorce.<sup>34</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Virtually all of these findings have been replicated by Nicholas Zill, Vice President and Director of Child and Family Studies at Westat Research Corporation of Maryland, in his analysis of data from the federal government's 1988 National Health Interview Survey on Child Health.<sup>35</sup>  Results from the survey were compared across four groups: adopted children, children of unmarried mothers being raised by the mother, children of intact families, and children being raised by their grandparents. The data indicated that adopted children:
<p><ul>
<li>Enjoy a quality of home environment superior to all the other groups;<sup>36</sup>
<p>
<li>Have superior access to health care compared to all the other groups;<sup>37</sup>
<p>
<li>Enjoy health similar to that of children of intact families and superior to that of the other two groups; and
<p>
<li>Do better in educational attainment than single-parent children and children raised by grandparents.<sup>38</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When compared with those adopted later, born outside of marriage and raised by the single mother, or raised in an intact family, children who are adopted in infancy:
<ul><p>
<li>Repeat grades less often than any other group;
<p>
<li>See mental health professionals less than all other groups, except children of intact families;
<p>
<li>Have better health status than all other groups;
<p>
<li>Have a better standing in their school classes than all other groups, except children raised in intact families; and
<p>
<li>Have fewer behavior problems than all other groups, except children raised in intact families.
</ul><P>
<b>Benefits for Mothers Who Give Up Children for Adoption</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Significantly, teenage mothers who choose adoption also do better than mothers who choose to be single parents.
<ul><p>
<li>They have higher educational aspirations, are more likely to finish school, and less likely to live in poverty and receive public assistance than mothers who keep their children.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
<li>They delay marriage longer and are more likely to marry eventually.
<p>
<li>They are more likely to be employed 12 months after the birth and less likely to repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
<p>
<li>They are no more likely to suffer negative psychological consequences, such as depression, than are mothers who rear children as single parents.<sup>40</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All the goals of liberal government programs like job training, supplemental education, and family planning are attained with greater ease, and at lower cost, through adoption.<sup>41</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW MANY POTENTIAL PARENTS ARE THERE?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although growing numbers of children need adoption, there are more than enough families to meet the demand. The National Council for Adoption estimates that at least one million infertile couples and an additional one million fertile couples would like to adopt.<sup>42</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Christine Bachrach of NICHD concluded from the National Survey of Family Growth that over 2,000,000 women have sought to adopt at one time or another, and about 200,000 were actively seeking to adopt in 1988.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Couples who want to adopt are not looking just for healthy, Caucasian infants, despite assumptions to the contrary. The National Down's Syndrome Adoption Exchange reports a waiting list of over 100 couples who would like to adopt a child with Down's syndrome -- more than enough to accomodate parents who want Down's children given up for adoption. Nor is it difficult to find families for children with spina bifida and children who are HIV positive. For example, the National Council for Adoption is identifying children who will be orphaned when their parents die of AIDS, so that appropriate plans can be made before the parents' death. The response by individuals and families willing to adopt such children has been overwhelming.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Americans are also willing to help with children from overseas, especially because of the anti-adoption bias in the United States. When the communist regime in Romania fell, ABC-TV's "20/20" reported that thousands of children were warehoused in government orphanages. Pictures showed many children with health and developmental problems. ABC received over 25,000 self-addressed, stamped envelopes from people who wanted more information, and within six months 2,000 Romanian children were adopted by Americans,<sup>44</sup> many of whom had not considered adoption until this need became known. This suggests that the pool of parents willing to adopt could be expanded signficantly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1993, over 56 percent of the 7,348 children from other countries adopted by American parents were over the age of one. Of these, 9 percent were between the ages of five and nine, and 5 percent were over the age of ten.<sup>45</sup>  In addition, many of these foreign-born children have physical and emotional problems at the time of their adoption.<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the evident readiness and desire to adopt, many families report a lack of support or encouragement from the social services establishment. They report such things as unanswered phone calls, inadequate networking with other agencies which may have children ready for adoption, a disinclination to identify children with needs that correspond to the gifts of the family, and a general lack of support to bring couples successfully through the adoption process.<sup>47</sup>
<p>
<b>THE BARRIERS TO ADOPTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although adoption meets the interests of the needy child better than any other option, Elizabeth Bartholet of Harvard Law School concludes that "our adoption system has failed to live up to even its own limited vision.... Laws and policies that are supposed to protect children have created barriers to adoption that function effectively to prevent these children from getting the kind of protection they most need 'a loving, nurturing and permanent home.'"<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The legal system often resolves cases in ways that trouble many Americans. In two widely publicized recent cases, for example, children were wrested from their adoptive parents on the basis of biological ties. Baby Jessica was given to her biological father, who had failed to support two previous children, and Baby Richard was given to his biological father, with whom he had never lived, instead of being allowed to remain with the adoptive family which had nurtured him from birth for three years. In both cases, the overriding "biological ties" of the fathers prevailed over the needs of their children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several barriers make it very difficult for many families to adopt children.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #1: Anti-Adoption Bias in Pregnancy Counseling</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Only 1 percent of women who experience an "unwanted pregnancy" choose adoption for their children.<sup>49</sup>  A University of Illinois study explains some of the causes:
<ul><p>
<li>Some 40 percent of individuals in a variety of settings (health, family planning, social services, and adoption agencies) who identify themselves as "pregnancy counselors" do not even raise the issue of adoption with pregnant clients.
<p>
<li>An additional 40 percent provide inaccurate or incomplete information to clients.
<p>
<li>By contrast, 38 percent of the clients whose counselors offered adoption went on to choose adoption.<sup>50</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress's efforts to require adoption information and counseling in one federally funded program providing services to pregnant women have met with resistance from family planning professionals. For instance, the Adolescent Family Life Act<sup>51</sup> was passed in the early 1980s to provide a modest ($7.8 million), more "pro-life," adoption-friendly alternative to the pregnancy counseling provided by established Title X and Title XIX family planning services (typically over $300 million per year). The bias among professionals against adoption can be seen in the evaluation of the program's effectiveness. Some 7 percent of the grantees violated the most basic terms of their grants by not providing any information on adoption to their clients. Most grantees failed to provide either adequate adoption information or counseling.<sup>52</sup>
<p>
<b>BARRIER #2: Misuse of the Foster Care System</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1980, Congress enacted P.L. 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act. This legislation sought to provide permanent homes for children at risk of abuse and neglect by establishing a hierarchy of services for these children and for their families. In order of priority, these services were:
<p>
1. Family preservation;
<p>
2. Short-term foster care with a goal of family reunification; and
<p>
3. Long-term foster care or adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This legislation requires that each child's situation be reviewed every six months. Within 18 months of opening every case, a permanent plan for the child's future must be in place. This placement plan embodies a decision by the child welfare agency as to whether the child will be returned to the family or placed for adoption. Such decisions and plans must be in place before the work of clearing the child for adoption can be undertaken. Only after both steps have been taken can the search for adoptive parents begin.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the 1980s, these permanency planning guidelines evolved into the operating principle of "family preservation" -- keeping families intact through early, intense, comprehensive social services. The goal was to keep families united and thus avoid the high costs of foster care.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of their own high costs, however, family preservation services cannot be sustained for long periods; and because of high demand, caseworkers move quickly to take care of the next family in crisis. This approach did succeed in stopping the removal of children from the home, but not necessarily in preserving them from further abuse.<sup>53</sup>  In fact, there is evidence that children fare worse under these new practices. In New York City alone, during the 12 months of 1992, 21 children were killed by a parent or mother's boyfriend after the Child Welfare Administration had intervened.<sup>54</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A study by John Schuerman and his colleagues at the University of Chicago found that the "Family First" program did not realize even its central goal: preventing the removal of children.<sup>55</sup>  Neither did it protect children from further abuse. There is evidence that some families continue to abuse their children even during the period of intensive state intervention.<sup>56</sup>  By contrast, there is strong evidence that children do better when left in foster care than when they are returned to abusive families.<sup>57</sup>  This evidence leads to a simple and commonsense conclusion: children need a permanent home to which they can belong. For children at serious risk, an adoptive home is their best chance for real permanence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some child advocates challenge the principle of applying the "family preservation" approach in all cases. At a 1994 conference sponsored by the National Council for Adoption at Boys Town, Nebraska, Dr. Richard Gelles of the University of Rhode Island, a pre-eminent child abuse researcher and an early and optimistic supporter of family preservation programs, presented the following paraphrased views on these practices in light of recent evaluation data:
<p><blockquote>

	There are a now a number of studies of children who were returned home only to be abused again or even killed. These studies show dramatically that some abusive parents cannot be rehabilitated.<sup>58</sup>  In these cases the appropriate care of such a child is to terminate the parents' rights as quickly as possible and place the child with a permanent caring adoptive family.
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Boys Town conference highlighted the central problem of family preservation services. The first logical step should be to assess whether the child should be removed immediately and whether the parents are likely to benefit from support services. Instead, family preservation services are assumed to be the best first treatment. Though these services are activated because of abuse to the child -- sometimes very severe abuse -- they must fail before the child can be protected from the abusing family.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The foster care system is the aggregate network of parents who work for state and local social service agencies by taking abandoned, abused, or neglected children into their homes. They receive a set amount each month with which to feed, clothe, and nurture these children. Foster parents try to function as substitute parents. Prudently, they are admonished not to expect that placement will be permanent. However, from among the couples who take on this work come many who would like to adopt, particularly as they get to know these children and their lack of prospects for a happy and safe life in their families of origin.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Government funding reinforces an anti-adoption bias by supporting "family preservation" programs with free technical assistance and generous grants while providing only restricted support for adoption. The National Council for Adoption and the Institute for Justice report that numerous families, including foster families, have had their attempts to adopt waiting children rebuffed by the social service agencies for whom they work.<sup>59</sup>  Conna Craig of the Institute for Children in Boston reports receiving hundreds of letters from foster parents who are willing and able to adopt their foster children, some of whom have been eligible for years.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #3: Overload and Confusion of Social Service Roles</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to Douglas J. Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute, the rising incidence of reported child abuse keeps local child welfare agencies extremely busy on policing activities, diverting time and resources from adoption.<sup>60</sup>  Often the same staff must investigate abuse reports, provide family preservation services, file for the termination of parental rights, and recruit and prepare adoptive families.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The child welfare system typically does not separate the responsibility for terminating parental rights of parents who continue to abuse and neglect their children from the responsibility to help those parents who can be helped. Deaths of children result, as in the cases of the 21 who died in New York in 1992. By contrast, in Arizona and Oregon, separate professional units are used to make initial determinations and to justify the necessary court proceedings. Professionals are not trapped in the role confusion caused by simultaneous demands to reunite every family while also protecting the child.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If units like those in Arizona and Oregon were in general use, a number of benefits would result:
<P><ul>
<li>Courts could separate those children more decisively and quickly from parents unlikely to reform or benefit from family preservation services.
<p>
<li>Children in danger of severe abuse would be separated more quickly and expertly from their families and made available for adoption.
<p>
<li>Social workers involved in helping the more tractable parents would be free to pursue that work with much less likelihood of endangering the child.
<p>
<li>Local government agencies could turn to the adoption services of nonprofit agencies much more quickly and frequently. Private agencies do not have the immense burden of child protective services and related policing requirements that public agencies have. Their mission is to recruit and prepare adoptive families, and they tend to have great expertise in this work.
</ul><p>
<b>BARRIER #4: Unsatisfactory Protection of Confidentiality</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
State adoption laws generally guarantee the confidentiality of the identity of the mother, the inviolability of the internal intimacy and harmony of the adoptive family, and the peaceful development of the adopted child.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In adoption law and philosophy, there has arisen a view which parallels the modern revisionist view of marriage and parenthood embodied in "no-fault" divorce. New relationships between parent and child are imagined, and a new type of contract is forged between parents. Open adoption is akin to no-fault divorce, and the "birth parents" take on the role of the visiting parent who has not yielded up all his rights to the child, particularly rights of visitation and vacations together. The adoptive parents are bound not just to their adopted child, but also to the birth parents and must facilitate the continuing relationship between the child and his birth parents. This form of open adoption exists in Oregon from birth and in Indiana for children over two years of age.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Open adoption provides no seal of confidentiality regarding the identity of the birth parents, the adopting parents, and the child. It essentially blends birth families with adopting families, directly undermining the creation of a permanent new family for a child. The professional literature shows a frequent confusion of roles when the birth family continues a relationship with the child. This also interferes with parent and child bonding<sup>61</sup> in the adoptive family and inhibits the birth parents' grieving process.<sup>62</sup>  There are parallel experiences and research findings with respect to divorce and the increased risks of being raised in blended families.<sup>63</sup>
Confidentiality, especially in infant adoptions, helps minimize these risks.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Oregon is an example of a state in which open adoption allows birth parents to take adoptive parents to court to uphold visitation agreements. This policy undermines the rights of adoptive parents to make parenting decisions. It also changes the nature and dynamics of a close, intact, inviolably intimate adoptive family, exposing it to the disruptions, conflicts, and anxieties characteristic of divorced and blended families. The professional literature on childhood emotional and behavioral development shows that children of blended families do less well than children of single parents and intact families.<sup>64</sup>  If successful, the growing push for open adoption<sup>65</sup> could cause similar difficulties for adopted children, undermining the generally strong mental health reported by the Search Institute and Nicholas Zill.<sup>66</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents of open adoption even recommend abolishing adoption in favor of "guardianship," which does not offer the same permanency of family for the child.<sup>67</sup>  Like any other government policy which treats the adoptive families differently from intact families, this undermines the very essence of adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Understandably, many children become interested in knowing about their birth parents as they reach early adulthood. Their desire may be fulfilled if everyone involved is prepared to cooperate in lifting the veil of confidentiality. Most states try to maintain confidentiality if there is not full agreement among all concerned. Others do not. Two, Alaska and Kansas, will release the original birth certificate with the names of the biological parents to the adopted person after the age of eighteen, regardless of the birth mother's desires.<sup>68</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Proponents of opening adoption records seek legislation at the federal level. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) has introduced various versions of a "national reunion registry" to help connect birth parents with persons who are adopted. The National Council for Adoption and many of its affiliated private adoption agencies have challenged the vagueness of the legislative proposals which do not assure confidentiality. They also have questioned the need to federalize a state issue.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #5: Unknown, Uninvolved, or Unmarried Fathers</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another major barrier for unmarried women considering adoption for their children is the need to obtain the consent of uninvolved fathers. Fortunately the Supreme Court, in a series of opinions,<sup>69</sup> has clarified and restricted the rights of uninvolved, unmarried fathers. According to current federal law, these rights correspond to the effort the father has made to establish a relationship with his child. The unmarried father who is unknown, is uninvolved, or has otherwise demonstrated no responsibility or interest in the child may not be entitled to the same consideration as an involved and responsible unmarried father. Federal courts have ruled consistently<sup>70</sup> that ignorance of a pregnancy is no excuse for uninvolvement, because the father was present at conception and could have followed through to assure adequate care for the child. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A growing trend in state legislatures, upheld by the Supreme Court in <I>Lehr v. Robertson</I>,<sup>71</sup> is the establishment of father registries which make the father responsible for asserting his parental rights. The registry usually requires the father to file a paternity action within 30 days of the child's birth. This will result in his being notified of a pending adoption. He then will have an opportunity to demonstrate that he has tried to establish a relationship with the child and to take responsibility for the child's care. If he fails to meet any of these requirements, he forfeits his rights to contest the adoption of the child, and the adoption can proceed. While many conservatives think an absent unmarried father should never be an obstacle to adoption, this procedure at least frees the mothers to place children without registered fathers for adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House welfare bill requires paternity establishment at birth for all fathers. This is a major step in the right direction. Fears that efforts to locate unknown, unmarried fathers will slow down, and possibly stop, adoption are unfounded. If the mother is not seeking AFDC support (and she will not if she is placing her child for adoption), she will not need to identify the father. Simultaneously, the putative father registry protects the due process rights of all fathers. Those who do not register, however, cannot benefit from the protection it would have given them.
<p>
<b>BARRIER #6: Race of the Child and Adoptive Parents</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Two forms of racial discrimination take place within adoption: against adoptive parents and against children waiting to be adopted. Potential black parents lose the chance to give their love to needy children of their own race. Black children in foster care are deprived of new parents and a stronger foundation in life, in addition to being exposed to the risks of retarded social and intellectual development. Both forms of discrimination must be eliminated. Fortunately, the means to accomplish this already exist within the private sector. There is no need for coercive race-matching legislation.
<P>
<b>THE SPECIAL PLIGHT OF BLACK CHILDREN</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Interracial adoptions account for about 8 percent of adoptions and consist primarily of adoptions of black children by white parents.<sup>72</sup>  There are more black children waiting in foster care than there are prescreened black families ready to adopt them. With the need for permanent adoptive homes growing more acute and the exit rate from foster care slowing continually, the likelihood of multiple placements for black children increases.<sup>73</sup>  Indeed, some 24 percent of the children in foster care today have been in three or four different homes.<sup>74</sup>  According to Ira Schwartz of the University of Michigan, 53 percent of all children in Michigan who entered the foster care system as newborns are still in foster care at age four.<sup>75</sup>  A number of regional studies confirm this trend and demonstrate that black children typically wait two to three years longer than white children for adoptive homes.<sup>76</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The length of stay in foster care is very important. The longer the newborn stays in foster care, the more at risk he is of approaching the "difficult to adopt" age and the greater the problems associated with long-term foster care become. If half the children who arrive in foster care at birth are still in it at age four, the system is not serving their needs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This statistic highlights the need for termination units -- specialized units of social workers who work with the courts to determine whether the parental rights of an abusing or neglectful parent should be withdrawn so that the child may be placed for adoption. If the "best interest of the child" principle is used, this decision will be made quickly. If the "family preservation" principle is used, the decision will be delayed again and again, often until repeated neglect convinces the authorities that parental rights must be removed. At this point, in addition to having suffered even more, the child is older and more difficult to place.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given these figures, public welfare agencies are a major source of neglect of young black children. The bias against adopting early, when the child is most adoptable, feeds the foster care system and ensures a larger clientele for public agencies. The present system of financing foster care and not financing adoptions perversely rewards this form of government neglect.
<p>
<b>Black Families and Adoption</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is some evidence that blacks adopt at a much higher rate than whites if one controls for family structure, income, and age of parents.<sup>77</sup>  A 1983 Department of Health and Human Services study78 put these comparable rates at:
<p><ul>
<li>7 adoptions per 10,000 black families for all black families;
<p>
<li>2 adoptions per 10,000 white families for all white families; and
<p>
<li>2 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families for all Hispanic families.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Controlling for age of parents (below 55), family income (above poverty level), and family structure (intact families), the rates change to:
<p><ul>
<li>18 adoptions per 10,000 black families within the range;
<p>
<li>4 adoptions per 10,000 white families within the range; and
<p>
<li>3 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families within the range.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These figures convey the reality of much higher adoption rates among blacks than among whites or Hispanics for children in public welfare agencies who are available for adoption.<sup>79</sup>  There is, however, conflicting evidence that white women were more likely to make adoption plans than black women.<sup>80</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To meet the needs of all children within their own racial communities by placing them in couple-headed families above poverty, the same study suggests that the response rate among black families would have to be far higher than it is. It would need to approach 44 per 10,000 families for blacks, compared with 6 per 10,000 families for whites and 6 per 10,000 families for Hispanics. This would require an enormous increase in the rates of adoption by blacks and Hispanics. Richard Barth of the School of Social Welfare at the University of California at Berkeley sums up the conclusions to which these data lead:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The growth of African-American adoptions have increased by 92% in the last 5 years and Hispanic adoptions by 80%. The growth of African American adoptions would have to grow four times faster than that during the next five years in order to give African American children parity of access to adoption. For Hispanic children, the growth rate would have to double for their opportunity to be adopted to reach parity with Caucasian children.<sup>81</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To achieve these levels of adoption will require a great community effort by black and Hispanic people.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As well-run private agencies demonstrate, large pools of adoptive parents can be developed over time. Even pools of parents for "harder to place children" can be developed when the effort is made by a committed organization. For instance, Down's syndrome children are adopted quite quickly because there is a network of screened parents in place and ready to adopt. Similarly, a pool of parents ready to adopt HIV-positive babies has been developed by the National Council for Adoption.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a 1980 study of black parents, sociology professor Robert Hill of the Institute for Urban Research at Morgan State University estimated that three million black households are interested in adopting children. This translates into one hundred black families for every black child in foster care waiting for adoption.<sup>82</sup>  Given this potential, a pool of prescreened adoptive parents big enough to take care of the needs of black children represents an achievable goal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The private sector can best develop this pool because private organizations are motivated to do so. Building pools of parents is not the strong suit of public agencies.<sup>83</sup>  Some private organizations in the black community have achieved remarkable results. Recently, for instance, in just one year, Detroit's Homes for Black Children placed 132 children in black homes -- more than all the other 13 child welfare agencies in the city.<sup>84</sup>  To increase the rate of adoption within black families, the leadership of the black community should commit itself strongly to using private organizations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the emphasis should be on making it easier for black families to adopt, blocking transracial adoptions just because the children are black and the parents are white discriminates against many needy black children because of race. Moreover, it does not increase the rate of in-race adoption. California, despite a law requiring a 90-day search for a same-race family before a child can be adopted across racial lines, still has twice as many black children as white children waiting for adoption, often for long periods.<sup>85</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Institute for Justice last year filed suit on behalf of a white foster couple who had cared for a black child since birth. When the child became eligible, they sought to adopt him but were blocked by the public welfare agency because they were not black. Even when black parents were not found, the agency persisted in blocking this adoption. No one can argue that this was in the best interest of the child.<sup>86</sup>  Similar racial discrimination prevented the adoption of a white child by a black couple who had fostered the child since birth. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1984, liberal black columnist Carl T. Rowan argued against the "abominable notion that race must be the dominant factor in deciding who can deliver loving care and protection to a child."  Rowan equated the position of black social workers who support only in-race adoption with a 1954 statement by a segregationist Mississippi editor that "every child has the right to be educated among children and by teachers of the same racial background."<sup>87</sup>  Furthermore, according to professor Rita Simon, sociologist at the American University and expert in transracial adoption, "The data in our studies and indeed in all the studies that have been done show that transracial adoptions serve the children's best interests."<sup>88</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Still, opposition to transracial adoption is strong. When former Senator Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH) steered S. 1224 through Congress in 1993, he did so to outlaw obstacles similar to the above restrictions that exist in most states. But the Clinton Administration, which supports race matching, succeeded in changing the legislation so that lack of race matching could be used to deny or delay a placement.<sup>89</sup>  Instead of encouraging solutions, such as private adoption agencies that specialize in placing black children, the Administration's policy aggravates the problem.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Bunning Amendment, incorporated into the House-passed welfare bill, repeals the Clinton policy. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) had a similar amendment (S. 637) to the Senate version of the welfare reform bill. The Children's Defense Fund supported the Clinton Administration's approach,<sup>90</sup> despite the evidence of researchers such as Rita Simon, who shows that transracial adoption does not damage the child emotionally or developmentally and that transracially adopted children do just as well as those adopted by parents of their own race.<sup>91</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Race matching can be achieved easily if there are enough prescreened adoptive parents. The difficulty lies not in the lack of parents but in the poor track record of public agencies in building a pool of black adoptive parents.
<p>
<b>THE NEED FOR FEDERAL LEADERSHIP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A child's needs are best served, and his potential fostered most effectively, by the love and sense of belonging provided by a stable family environment. As in other areas of social concern, however, the government's ability to increase love and dedication is limited. This competence resides primarily with the family, the church, and the school. However, through their power to enact wiser laws and provide leadership, lawmakers at the federal level can affect the rate of adoption. They can expound upon its benefits for the child, for the mother who gave birth, and for the parents who adopt.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption is one of those rare good solutions to many thorny problems. Political leaders should help the country realize that it is one of the most effective ways to alleviate the problems arising from illegitimacy, child abuse, and neglect.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lawmakers also must challenge the leaders of other major institutions, especially church leaders, to talk about the goodness of adoption. Educational leaders, particularly in social studies areas, ought to be challenged to develop good materials on adoption. Health insurance leaders ought to be challenged as well, for adoption is a less costly solution to infertility than is fertility treatment, which averages about $35,000 per course of treatment. Media leaders ought to harness their expertise in communications to promote adoption to the nation at large, instead of attacking it.<sup>92</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The more this is done, the more attractive adoption will be to growing numbers of families. America also needs to celebrate parents who adopt and parents who care for foster children -- especially those who both foster <I>and</I> adopt. They show a double generosity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adoption is a national resource that should be encouraged and expanded by government where possible. The federal government should undertake a public relations campaign, targeted to girls under the age of 18 who have conceived out of wedlock, on the benefits of adoption. In addition, Congress should:
<P>
<b>1)  Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress permits a tax deduction for the medical costs of fertility treatment (typically between $35,000 and $50,000 for testing, test tube conception, and deep freeze, development, and discard). The average revenue loss for such treatment is about $8,000. Some corporate health plans, the costs of which are fully excludable from employees' taxable income, also cover fertility treatment. By contrast, the Treasury would gain financially from a one-time $5,000 tax credit that encouraged parents to assume the total cost of caring for foster children -- each of whom now costs taxpayers over $13,000 each year.<sup>93</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tax credit should be fully refundable (including against Social Security taxes) so that poorer parents who adopt a child receive the same level of support as those who earn more and have larger tax liabilities. The object is to encourage and support those who want to adopt. Being less generous with poorer parents (and more black parents are poor compared to white parents) is unwise because it reduces the incentive to adopt.
<p>
<b>2)  Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of an effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers inflicts pain and damage on cocaine-addicted babies. With some 350,000 children affected each year, there is an obvious need for a change in federal law to permit the testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction. These babies are at high risk for foster care and for severe damage to their health and development.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

South Carolina Attorney General Charles Molony Condon ran a successful program of testing, mandated treatment, or a jail sentence if the mother refused treatment. The result was dramatic: the incidence of cocaine-addicted mothers fell from 24 per month in Charleston to five or six per month.<sup>94</sup>  The Clinton Administration, however, called the program punitive and racially discriminatory and threatened to cut off all federal reimbursements to the hospital involved, effectively threatening to shut down the program and discouraging other states interested in replicating the Charleston model.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should take steps to reverse this Administration policy. The use of cocaine by pregnant women is a major factor in the death or severe damaging of many thousands of cocaine-affected newborns.
<p>
<b>3) Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To redress the poor quality of national data on adoption and foster care, Congress should instruct the Department of Health and Human Services to issue comparative report cards on the performance of each state in a number of areas concerning the family condition of children, including:
<p><ul>
<li>The number and rate of out-of-wedlock births,
<P>
<li>The rate of adoption,
<p>
<li>The length of stay in foster care, including information on the longest stays,
<p>
<li>The typical period between the availability of a child for adoption and the child's adoption, and
<p>
<li>The typical period between the beginning of foster care and the agency's finalization of a placement plan (decision regarding the future of the child).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dissemination of such information will keep state residents better informed and help encourage agencies to find children good, permanent homes.
<p>
<b>4)  Require hospitals and clinics receiving federal funds for family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.
</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress should require HHS to contract with pro-adoption experts for the writing and distribution of an appropriate brochure on the benefits of adoption for both mother and child. Congress then should require that this brochure be distributed in all hospitals which receive federal funding, either directly or indirectly, and in all federally funded family planning clinics, and that the staff of such hospitals and clinics draw attention to this material.
<p>
<b>5)  Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the best ways the federal government can help these churches is by providing an incentive for members to adopt more children waiting in foster care. The full refundability of the $5,000 tax credit will do much to effect this. Unless their members are able to pay most of the normal costs of adoption, there is little likelihood that black churches in poor neighborhoods will be involved. With the tax credit and with church involvement, however, the probability of an increase in adoption is significantly greater.
<P>
<b>6)  Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit clearly the use or consideration of race or ethnicity in denying or delaying the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The fundamental principle behind all civil rights is equality of rights and equal treatment under law. A young child without a family cries out for as quick a placing as possible within a caring family, so that his long-term human potential may not be thwarted at critical early stages of development. The "personness" of that child is infinitely more important than his or her "blackness," "Indianness," "Hispanicness," or "Asianness."  In cases where parents of similar ethnic background are unavailable within, say, a 90-day period, then those who are available and willing to adopt should be united with the child, both for the child's benefit and for the good of society.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Those who are anxious to have the children of a community adopted within that community must ensure a sufficient supply of parents wanting to adopt. The onus is on the community and ought not to be placed on the waiting child. To help assure a pool of parents, Congress should work with states to streamline and simplify adoption procedures in minority communities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many opportunities for developing a pool of waiting parents are available. The network of minority churches is extensive. By linking with private adoption agencies, these churches can help respond to the needs of minority children awaiting adoption. Many other ethnic organizations can be harnessed to bring the pool of minority adopting parents up to the level needed. The press could carry public service announce-ments in minority communities. Minority fraternities and sororities also could play an important role. These and similar community efforts would raise public consciousness about adoption.
<p>
<b>7)  Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While fully respecting the right of Indian nations to regulate adoptions within their territories, and while fully respecting the rights of all Indian parents giving up their children for adoption to request that the Indian nations take these children for adoption, Congress ought to change civil rights law so that the rights of Indian or part-Indian parents living outside the nations' territories are upheld.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Under current law, a child with as little as one sixty-fourth Indian ancestry may be under the control of that Indian tribe for adoption, no matter where the child lives. While the number may be modest, the principle of "personness" again is paramount. Just as a foreign-born American citizen is not subject to the adoption laws of his country of origin, an Indian who has chosen freely to leave the Indian nation and to marry someone outside it should no longer be subject to its laws. H.R. 3286 addresses this issue well.
<p>
<b>8)  Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This charter could preclude adoptions for millions of children over time and deny U.S. couples the option of adopting foreign children. The unsigned U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child may come before Congress in the near future for ratification. In the current draft, international adoption is declared to be a last option, after the home country has exhausted its search.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As in cases of transracial and race-matching adoption, each nation has a responsibility to assemble a pool of prescreened adoptive parents if it has children waiting to be adopted. If a nation does not have such a pool, and yet blocks couples from abroad from adopting, that nation is neglecting its children. The United States should be on the side of the child rather than on the side of governments that seek international acceptance of some specious "right" to neglect their nation's children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the language of the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child is accepted by Congress, it could mean an end to most international adoptions. The Hague Convention, to which the United States is a signatory, and which guides present policies, is superior though far from sufficient. Its guiding principle is that care in a family is better for a child than care in an institution.
<p>
<b>WHAT THE STATES SHOULD DO</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because regulating adoption is a state function, most of the practical reforms must be enacted by state legislatures. And because of the particular need to address the transracial adoption issue in a just and caring fashion, the states must take special care to eliminate discrimination against black adoptive parents and black children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To increase the pool of available parents to fill the needs of all children, states should encourage the privatization of adoption. Specialized agencies can work constructively with those sections of the community that are willing to serve the many different needs of children: black children, older children, children with special medical problems, and children with other emotional or developmental difficulties. As different groups already have demonstrated, it is possible to line up a pool of screened and qualified parents more than willing to adopt children with even the most difficult needs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One effort, started by Fr. George Clements in Chicago in the mid-1980s, had each church set about achieving the adoption of one child within the congregation.95  Though initially the program received wide publicity and had some impact, it has not become a sustained and organized national effort. However, in Florida, One Church, One Child of Florida has developed a successful partnership between church and state. Between March 1988 and September 1990, this organization placed 805 black children in adoption.<sup>96</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Phoebe Dawson, a social worker who heads New Beginnings, a licensed nonprofit adoption agency in Columbus, Georgia, has been very successful in this work. For instance, an agency in Cleveland, Ohio, was not able to find minority parents for a young minority child, leaving the child at serious risk of a protracted wait for adoption. One worker at the agency contacted New Beginnings, which was able to resolve the problem quickly because of its close ties to black Baptist churches across the country.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To encourage adoption, states should:
<p>
<b>1)   Privatize adoption services.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Private adoption services are more efficient and more effective than state agencies where adoption is concerned, as illustrated by the track record of Detroit's Homes for Black Children. They are accountable to a board of directors, while state agencies are not. Private organizations may be sued, which increases their accountability to the children and parents they serve. By contrast, state agencies often cannot be sued. Furthermore, people are more inclined to donate money, time, services, and goods to a private adoption agency than to pay taxes for government agencies.
<p>
<b>2)  Change the way public welfare agencies are financed. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Public welfare agencies dealing with children receive more money to keep children in foster care than they do to clear them for adoption. States should make the allocation of Title IVE monies to these agencies contingent on their record in making final determinations on the future status of children within 12 months of entering foster care. Those not returning to their families must be adopted within three months or handed over to a private agency for adoption.
<p>
<b>3)  Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These units should make the initial decision whether to terminate the rights of the parent and bring the process to court or return the child to his family. All babies under 12 months of age coming into the protective custody of a public welfare agency should be processed through the termination unit as a matter of course. A great many such children should be placed for adoption quickly. This in turn would prevent the buildup of a large number of children in foster care -- children who grow more and more difficult to place with each passing year, as the significant drop in the percentage of older children who get adopted clearly indicates.
<p>
<b>4)  Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This makes it possible for many middle and low-income families to adopt a sick child they would not be able to care for without Medicaid support. It makes sense for government to provide this support, for the special-needs child in foster care will cost the government even more.
<p>
<b>5)  Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions. </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While working to increase the pool of minority parents and to enhance the flow of prequalified and ready-to-adopt minority parents, states should continue the practice of transracial adoption when no same-race parents are available. When the child becomes ready for adoption, his need is immediate and acute. Minority community groups can monitor the pool of prescreened, qualified minority parents for all the relevant categories of children: older children, older male children, sibling groups of children, medically needy children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to the issues involved in ending discrimination against black children waiting to be adopted and against black couples waiting to adopt, there is much else to be done by the states.
<p>
<b>6)  Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Governors and state legislatures should consider mounting campaigns to increase interest in adoption. With the prompting and advocacy of the Institute for Children in Cambridge Massachusetts, the State of Massachusetts, under Governor William Weld's direction, embarked upon Assignment Adoption, a series of government reforms to reduce the number of children in foster care and to increase the practice of adoption.
<p>
<b>7)  Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When the difficult duty of assessing the appropriateness of terminating parental rights is commingled with the mandate to preserve the family at all costs, the good of the abused child suffers. The long-term good of the child is helped by establishing separate units of social workers who help the court reach clear and speedy decisions regarding the parents' right to continue as parents. These workers can help the courts without the conflict of interest that is present when they also try therapeutically to help the family come together or stay together. It is best that such work be carried on by a different set of professionals. The best interests of the child remain paramount while the effort to help the parent is vigorously pursued.
<p>
<b>8)  Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A University of Chicago study finds that children who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent longer than other young children.<sup>97</sup>  Within a 12-month period, the court and the termination unit should decide whether a child should be returned to his parents or placed for adoption. Continuance in foster care beyond that time must be regarded by all as a failure to provide properly for the needs of the child. To be lax or negligent in this matter is to be guilty of serious child neglect.
<p>
<b>9)  Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In order to facilitate the practice of adoption and the reduction of foster care lengths of stay to the minimum time needed, the collection of accurate data is critical. At present it is poor and varies greatly in quality between states. National leaders, national and state campaigns to encourage adoptions, and the stimulation of executive action to initiate and maintain reforms all require an accurate picture of what is happening to children in adoption and foster care. The state Office of Vital Statistics or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all adoption information, and the state Office of Human Services or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all foster care data.
<p>
<b>10) Enact legislation requiring of public social service agencies the same licensing standards and requirements as those now imposed on private adoption agencies.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Just as Congress has passed a law (H.R. 1 and S. 2) to subject itself to the same regulations it imposes on the rest of the country, all state agencies involved in adoptions ought to be subject to the same reporting and regulatory oversight as adoption agencies are. This reform will likely have the speedy effect of reducing these regulations to the bare minimum needed for the good of the child.
<P>
<b>11) Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of the high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers, because of the pain and damage done to cocaine-addicted babies, and because this condition now affects 350,000 children a year, states should push for a federal law permitting the drug testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction so that hospitals may participate in such programs without being threatened with a cutoff of federal funds as happened in the South Carolina case discussed above.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Children born to drug-addicted mothers are at risk for a host of difficulties and abuses: lower birth weight, physical abuse, and not getting the affectionate nurturing critical for early attachment formation and its concomitant long-range benefits, among them the formation of a solid conscience and the ability to relate well with others. Given these risks to the child, the requirement of drug testing when cocaine or crack cocaine ingestion is suspected is an appropriate protection.
<p>
<b>12) Prohibit the removal of a child who is eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt the child, except when the child is being returned to the legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the parents are deemed by the agency as suitable for fostering the child, they should qualify automatically as suitable for adopting the child. Today, many foster parents are willing to adopt the children they have fostered once they become available for adoption. However, mainly because of the effective prohibition of transracial adoptions, these parents frequently are denied the chance to adopt the children who have become attached to them. These couples should have the right to adopt the child once the courts have decided he may be adopted. If child welfare agencies have not made this possible within six months of the court decision, foster parents ought to be granted the standing in law to sue the adoption agency and initiate adoption proceedings.
<P>
<b>13) Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This rule should apply for any child in out-of-home care for six months whose parent has not engaged in meaningful interaction with the child during that period. Due process in the courts will protect the rights of parents barred from contact with their children due to very unusual circumstances. However, a child left alone for six months is a child without a dedicated parent.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

More and more of the nation's children are at risk of child abuse and neglect as rates of illegitimacy rise. Their plight merits the generous response of dedicated people. Few responses can match the depth and devotion entailed in adopting a child. This dedication reduces a host of problems for the nation: the costs of extended foster care, the poorer health and slower development of children in foster care or in the home of neglectful and abusing parents, and the higher incidence of addiction, crime, and dependency.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the taxpayer. It brings much happiness to the adopting parents. It is good for all involved.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Adoption works.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By vetoing the adoption legislation passed last year, President Clinton defeated the most significant reform in the practice of adoption to be seen in decades. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. As this pool of needy children grows, all too often, up to two million couples waiting to adopt are frustrated in their efforts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The need is great and the solution is obvious: adoption. Yet government agencies and practices actively discourage this solution which, unlike present policies, could help solve a major national problem while also reducing both welfare dependency and long-range costs. The situation cries out for reform. The suffering of the children cries out for reform.

<li>    Most boarder babies are cases of neglect of a severity which easily would justify termination of the parental rights of the mother.

An Attributional Analysis," <I>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</I>, Vol.  48, No.  4 (1985), pp.  1054-1066.  An interesting anomaly has emerged from an analysis of adoption studies.  Clinical studies traditionally have shown adopted adolescents to be overrepresented in psychiatric settings.  The same occurred here, but these adolescents were found not to have emotional or psychological problems at these rates.  Adopted adults are less likely to receive treatment than the general population.  This seeming contradiction occurs because adoptive parents are more likely to refer their adopted children for possible treatment.  Of all adopted children referred by parents for clinical treatment, only 27 percent had a clinical diagnosis.  The remainder -- almost 75 percent -- received counseling for normal adolescent issues.<p>

The fact that the exit numbers of minority children are smaller than those of white children will result in additional increases in the proportion of minority children in care.  If current trends continue, minority children will become the clear majority in the nation's substitute care population in the next few years.  There already are more minority children than white children in the substitute care systems of several large urban states today.

<title> Kicking America's Welfare Habit -- Heritage </title>

<hr>
<h3> Kicking America's Welfare Habit: Politics, Illegitimacy, and Personal Responsibility</h3><br>
<p>By The Honorable Pete Wilson, Governor of California. Governor Wilson spoke at The Heritage Foundation's Lehrman Auditorium. Wednesday, September 6, 1995. His speech was sponsored by The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/gov_for.htm">Governors' Forum</a>. 
<p> 

It's a pleasure to be back at Heritage. I've enjoyed your hospitality many times before.
Your willingness to hear from the nation's governors is just one bit of evidence that this institution has the wisdom-- all too rare in this town -- to know that Washington doesn't have a monopoly on good ideas.  
<P>  
The American people are fed up with an arrogant and out-of-touch federal government. That's what fueled  
the ballot box rebellion of 1994. 

Yet, despite the enormous success of the House Republicans in delivering on the Contract with America,  
voters remain deeply cynical about Washington's ability to make change. 
  
In fact, a poll done last week by <i>USA Today</i> showed voters' faith in Congress at an historic low. 

Why? Well, I can't think of a better example of what fuels voter cynicism about Washington than the status  
of welfare reform. 
<P>  
The American people are justifiably outraged by a federal welfare system that contradicts their values. It  
penalizes work, discourages marriage, and encourages illegitimacy. 

A foreign power bent on ruining America couldn't have designed a more destructive system than the one  
Washington has imposed on the American people. 

That's why in 1992, a candidate who promised to "end welfare as we know it" held such appeal for many  
voters. But what we've seen since has only deepened their contempt for D.C. 
<P>  
Bill Clinton has been President for almost a thousand days, three quarters of it with heavy Democratic  
majorities in Congress. 

And how far has he gotten on his pledge? 

Well he spent $33 billion of the taxpayers money on "welfare as we know it." 

Nearly a million more people have enrolled in "welfare as we know it." 

And today, 600,000 more children are living on "welfare as we know it." 
 <P> 
But Bill Clinton hasn't changed one word of federal law to "end welfare as we know it." Not one. 

Cal Ripken isn't the only guy with a streak still going strong. 

Every day Bill Clinton sits on the Oval Office, he's still not ending welfare as we know it.  He's extending  
welfare, and he knows it. 
<P>  
Voters understand that it is possible to change welfare. 

Millions of them -- in states as diverse as Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and California --  
have seen their governors do it, often with bipartisan support, often with limited resources, and often  
despite lawsuits from the welfare defenders. 

In California, I've reduced welfare grants by 20 percent, saved the taxpayers $9 billion, doubled the  
number of welfare recipients at work, and insisted that teenage parents on welfare live in their parents'  
home, that parents get the check, and the girl stay in school to learn the skills that will let her and her child  
escape welfare. 
<P>  
By contrast, the federal model of welfare simply provides a welfare check to an unwed child-mother -- who  
is too young to get a driver's license -- so she can move out to her own apartment.  How utterly  
irresponsible. 

Then she is given even more accessible prey to the next man seeking a junior-high school one-night stand  
romance. 

It doesn't have to be that way.  People can escape welfare.  But it takes work, and it happens one person at  
a time. 

A great example is Trish Molina. 
<P>  
I met Trish in California's Riverside County after she graduated from our successful welfare work program  
known as GAIN. 
 
She got an entry-level job at a small wireless cable company.  She's since been promoted three times.  
  
Today, she's the assistant to the head of the company.  She's happy. She loves her career.  She just needed  
the skills and discipline to take a job and stick with it. 

Most important, the job isn't just helping her, it's helping her children. 

They now have the example of a mother who gets up every morning and goes to work, teaching them what  
it means to accept responsibility for yourself and contribute to your community. 
 <P>
The young mother says that now that she's working she respects herself and her children respect her too. 

That's why we need welfare reform that demands personal responsibility, encourages work and discourages  
irresponsible behavior. 

Yet, President Clinton has not only failed to make significant welfare reform in Washington, he's actually  
blocked state like mine that are trying to make that change. 
<p>
At a meeting of the nation's governors, he promised to approve welfare waivers in 90 days or less, whether  
he agreed with the changes or not. 
 
In California, we sought a federal waiver for one reform we wanted to make to reduce welfare grants...and  
to make work more attractive than welfare. 
 
That was over a year ago. 

And the Clinton Administration continues to delay it at a cost to traxpayers of $3 million a week. 
<P>  
We've sought another waiver since November. 

This one would allow us to end the practice of giving larger and larger welfare checks to women who have  
more and more children while already on welfare. 

We think it's simply wrong to reward that kind of irresponsible behavior.  Working families don't get an  
automatic pay raise when they have more children, so why should women on welfare? 

And why should a young couple working and saving to have a child be taxed to subsidize that welfare  
mother's irresponsibility? 
<P>
It seems simple enough to me, but it took the Clinton Administration months to respond to our request. 
 

Then, in twisted logic that could only make sense to Washington, the Clinton Administration decided we 
could stop rewarding adults for having more and more children on welfare...but they insisted we had to 
continue rewarding teenagers for the same irresponsible behavior. 
<P>
Well, I've got news for them: Having more and more children on welfare is wrong whether you're and adult 
or a teenager. 

That's why I refuse to accept this absurd condition from President Clinton. 

Today, I'm rejecting President Clinton's half-baked waiver and insisting that he live up to his promise.

Mr. President, grant this waiver and every other waiver California has requested as you promised you 
would...with no strings attached. 
 
It's what you promised the American people.  Have the guts to keep your word. 
<P>  
Unfortunately, like a lot of voters, I'm skeptical he will. 
<P>
And his continued failure to reform welfare is why action in the Congress is so important.  Congress is our 
last best hope for real reform. 

When the House passed welfare reform in less than 100 days, a skeptical public were given a glimmer of 
hope that things might really be changing in Washington.  

But then, welfare reform landed in the Senate. 
<P>  
More and more, the Senate looks like the graveyard for the Contract with America. 

0n the balanced budget amendment.  On tax cuts.  On the crime bill.  And now, on welfare reform.

The Senate's continued delay holds states hostage to the whims of Bill Clinton's welfare bureaucrats.  We 
are compelled to wrench reform from hostile guardians of the status quo. 
 <P>
Worse yet, the compromises being cut in the Senate raise serious doubts as to whether the Senate 
Republican Leader really understands the mandate voters gave us last November to make drastic change.

There's been plenty of hot rhetoric on the Senate floor about freeing states from federal mandates.

But under the Dole welfare compromise, states would be denied the chance to make even the most basic 
decisions. 

In many cases, Senator Dole would simply leave us with watered-down version of current law. 
<P>  
For example, Senator Dole's compromise would continue to set the minimum level a state must spend on 
welfare. 

A similar, so-called "maintenance of effort requirement" in current law is what's preventing me from 
saving taxpayers $3 million a week. 

Why would a Republican committed to fundamental change support a federal mandate like that?

Congress has no business dictating terms like that to the states. 

California is a proud and sovereign state, not a colony of the federal government. 
<P>
In another concession to Senate liberals, Senator Dole has agreed to extend federal disability benefits to 
individuals whose only disability is self-inflicting drug and alcohol abuse.

Today, nearly 100,000 individuals collect such benefits.  And the number grew nearly six-fold in five years.

But why should that surprise us?

What alcoholic would pass up a chance to have the taxpayers pick up their bar tab?
<P>
That's why the House welfare bill ended this absurd practice next month.

The budget I just signed would end these benefits on the same day.  But Senator Dole's bill would force us 
to continue paying these benefits for more than a year. In California alone, that would cost taxpayers more 
than $1 million a week.

That's not only an insult to taxpayers, it's an outrage for the federal government to be subsidizing 
someone's addiction.  As the head of one homeless shelter described it, it's "suicide on the installment 
plan."
<p>
It's wrong and it's got to stop.
<P>
Yet, even as Senator Dole is imposing these indefensible mandates on the states, he's ignoring the one 
crisis that deserves national attention -- the epidemic of out-of-wedlock teen births.

Today, one in tree children is born out of wedlock. In some of America's largest cities, more children are 
born to unmarried women than into two-parent families.

And the 14-year-old girl who becomes an unwed mother is all too likely to give birth to a girl who will 
become a 14-year-old unwed mother herself, or a boy who will become a 14-year-old triggerman for a 
drug gang.
<P> 
If Senator Dole is truly concerned about the crisis of values in America, he should not be content with 
talking about the perverse values promoted by our popular media.  He should start doing something about 
the perverse values promoted by the federal welfare system.

The Contract with America included many reforms we've made in California to stem this crisis of 
illegitimacy.

It stops rewarding women with bigger welfare checks for having more and more children out-of-wedlock.

Yet, Senator Dole excluded this important change from the Senate version of the bill.  He was unwilling to 
include this fundamental reform.
<P>
It is not leadership to settle for less than the fundamental change we need by cutting deals which 
compromise our values.

We must demand nothing less than the courage and conviction to make fundamental change in policy...if 
we're to have any hope of changing a tragically permissive culture.

America deserves better, and must demand it.
<P>
If we make these changes, we'll free millions of Americans from the chains of dependency that stifle 
opportunity.

We'll renew the dream of a nation where work is respected and rewarded and where rights are balanced by 
responsibility.
<P>
The biggest mistake we can make is to be too timid in our reforms.  The task we face is great, but we dare 
not miss this opportunity.  It may not come again soon.

Thank you, very much.  Now, I'd be happy to take your questions.

Executive Memorandum No. 466<br>
January 17, 1997<br><BR>
</CENTER>

<P>
<DD>
A pressing humanitarian issue facing world leaders is the killing and maiming of civilians, often children, by unattended anti-personnel land mines (APLs). This horrible occurrence -- caused by the proliferation and indiscriminate use of these types of mines by rogue groups -- is unconscionable. It should be stopped. However, certain steps being considered by the Clinton Administration will do little to achieve this goal.

<P>
<DD>
The Administration is considering joining a Canadian-led effort known as the Ottawa Conference that would seek to ban all land mines. The Ottawa Conference is seriously flawed, and has attracted little interest from many other countries. A ban on the production and use of any type of land mine will disarm the few countries that are willing to abide by an agreement, but it will do nothing to force the cooperation of the countries and groups that use them indiscriminately. Moreover, such a ban will prohibit the legitimate use of self-destructing land mines, specifically those used by U.S. armed forces to protect American ground troops in combat. These American land mines are not part of the problem: They automatically deactivate, are not used in civilian areas, and do not linger for years in fields waiting for an unsuspecting civilian to tread on them.

<P>
<DD>
If the U.S. approves a global ban of all land mines, American soldiers will be put in greater danger and a harmful double standard will be created in arms control: A country not causing the problem -- the United States -- will disarm while rogue nations proliferating civilian-killing mines will not join the agreement and will not disarm. The Clinton Administration should not join the Ottawa Conference. It should not sign an agreement that will do little to address civilian casualties but much to harm U.S. military capabilities.
<P>
<DD>
<b>An Important Military Tool.</b> Banning the use of illegal "dumb mines" is laudable. Indiscriminately placed and incapable of self-destruction, these unmarked mines are continually responsible for civilian casualties. However, a global ban that would include "smart mines" will not help to solve the humanitarian problem. Smart mines automatically deactivate after prescribed periods of time. They are used in accordance with international laws of warfare, and are laid in well-marked areas threatened by hostile military forces -- not in civilian areas. Such mines have proven to be an effective deterrent to aggression against U.S. forces or their allies.

<P>
<DD>
U.S. Army doctrine recognizes the effectiveness of smart mines in protecting U.S. forces and denying terrain to an attacking enemy. In certain scenarios, the Army estimates that the proper use of smart APLs could cut American casualties in half by reducing the mobility of opposing forces and offering an effective early warning against attack. The responsible use of such mines, when deployed against an attacking military force, will save U.S. lives and not endanger civilians.

<P>
<DD>
Today, the U.S. manufactures only mines that self-destruct, and the self-destruct rate of 32,000 smart mines tested since 1976 is 99.996 percent. Furthermore, there are no reported cases of unintended civilian injury or death by U.S. APLs in either 1995 or 1996. The mines used by the U.S. armed forces are rigidly controlled and responsibly used, and have had no identifiable impact on civilians. In other words, the use of mines by American forces is not part of the land mine problem that the President seeks to solve.

<P>
<DD>
Even the Clinton Administration recognizes that the legal use of APLs is a legitimate means of defense in U.S. military operations. The Administration recently led a successful international effort to promote the responsible use of land mines by strengthening the Landmine Protocol in the U.N. Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). This convention establishes guidelines on the proper use of mines and conventional weapons in war.

<P>
<DD>
<b>A Misdirected Policy.</b> In spite of these facts, the Administration's policy is to promote an eventual global ban on all anti-personnel land mines. It has not said exactly how this goal might be reached. In the meantime, the U.S. has not prohibited its use of land mines, but has limited the legitimate use of less sophisticated dumb mines to training exercises and the demilitarized zone in Korea.

<P>
<DD>
The U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly last November in favor of a U.S.-sponsored resolution that called for a legally binding international agreement to ban the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of all APLs. Ten states, including Russia, China, North Korea, Syria, and Cuba, abstained on the grounds that such mines were a legitimate means of self-defense and national security. Without a commitment from those countries, the ban is unlikely to be effective.

<P>
<DD>
Supporters of the Ottawa Conference asked some 50 pro-ban countries to sign a legally binding international agreement banning the production and use of APLs. They hope to stigmatize the use of all land mines and to shame nations that refuse to join the conference into signing the treaty at a later date. China and Russia will not participate in the Ottawa negotiations, and Cuba, North Korea, and Syria have stated they oppose such a ban.

<P>
<DD>
The Ottawa Conference's so-called solution to the irresponsible use of dumb mines by rogue elements in places like Angola, Cambodia, Bosnia, and Mozambique is misguided. By forcing the world's responsible states to disarm, the conference will establish a double standard for the use of critical weapons. Responsible states like the U.S. will not be able to protect themselves in wartime with the same weapons that rogue states certainly will continue to possess and use.

<P>
<DD>
This double standard in arms control is not new to the Clinton Administration. In 1996, the Administration attempted to force the Senate to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention and ban chemical weapons despite the fact that countries such as Iraq, Libya, and North Korea were not willing to participate. The Administration signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in September 1996 to ban explosive nuclear tests despite the fact that India and Pakistan refused to go along. (Both countries are presumed to be capable of manufacturing and testing nuclear weapons.)

<P>
<DD>
This double standard also is not accidental. It is seen as a precedent that will allow Congress and the American people to believe it is acceptable for the U.S. to deprive itself of weapons that other countries retain and most likely will use. If the U.S. prohibits its own use of smart mines in the face of aggression, then other categories of weapons, perhaps including nuclear weapons, could be next.

<P>
<DD>
<b>A Better Approach.</b> U.S. participation in the Ottawa Conference amounts to unilateral disarmament and does little to solve the problem. The U.S. should, however, take steps to address the scourge of anti-personnel land mines in countries racked by conflict. It should contribute more technological support to international efforts to find and defuse mines in war-torn areas. And it should begin negotiations in the U.N. Conference on Disarmament for a comprehensive ban on the use of dumb mines. Such determined steps will neither denude U.S. armed forces of a critical military capability nor deprive the U.S. of an effective barrier to an attack on its ground troops.

<P>
<DD>
Rather than focus on an unenforceable global ban, signed by few countries, and hope that rogue states will honor it, the Administration should work aggressively to outlaw mines that do not self-destruct. An enforceable pact, such as the comprehensive international agreements of the recent Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, can help control the proliferation and use of these unsophisticated mines. This approach will be far more effective than an indiscriminate global ban in preventing the humanitarian atrocity of civilian casualties.

<title>The Chemical Weapons Convention: Unverifiable, Unenforceable, and a Burden to Business - Heritage</title>

<h3>THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION:
UNVERIFIABLE, UNENFORCEABLE, AND A BURDEN TO BUSINESS</h3>

Executive Memorandum No. 460<br>
September 12, 1996 <br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Later this week, the United States Senate will vote on ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The CWC is a multilateral treaty that would bar the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons by the countries that ratify it.  Given its sweeping provisions, the ratification of the CWC carries important implications for U.S. policies on  arms control, non-proliferation, defense, regulation, and above all, national security.  As a result, Senators need to consider the CWC carefully and not assume that it deserves support merely because it professes to outlaw chemical weapons.  In fact, the CWC will fail to achieve its stated goal of a global ban on chemical weapons.  Moreover, the CWC will make America more vulnerable to chemical weapon attack in the future while imposing an unwarranted and costly burden on American business. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	If ratified, the Chemical Weapons Convention would:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Increase the risk of chemical weapons being used.</b>  By undermining the U.S. chemical deterrent, the CWC may increase the likelihood that chemical weapons would be used.  The experience of World War II shows that an aggressor possessing chemical weapons will hesitate to use them to attack a country that also possesses such weapons. If the U.S. bans all of its chemical weapons, as required by the CWC, outlaw states that retain them will have a military advantage over the U.S. and other countries that have banned them. This military advantage increases the likelihood that chemical weapons could be used against the U.S.
 <p>
 <li><b> Be unverifiable.</b> Despite elaborate and burdensome verification provisions, compliance with the CWC cannot be adequately verified.  At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, then-Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey warned that "the chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
 <p>
 <li><b> Be unenforceable.</b>  Violations of the CWC are likely to go unpunished. If a violation were to occur, the United Nations Security Council would have to impose penalties severe enough to change the behavior of an outlaw state.  But the five permanent members of the Security Council can veto any enforcement resolution lodged against them or their friends.  China and Russia, for example, can simply veto resolutions imposing sanctions on them if they disagree with other Security Council members.
 <p>
 <li><b> Impose a heavy regulatory burden on U.S. businesses.</b>  There are over 7,700 production facilities in the U.S. that may be subject to CWC-related reporting and inspection requirements.  The direct cost to business could be as high as $200 million annually, while indirect costs could run into billions of dollars a year.
 <p>
<li><b> Increase the risk of proliferation of chemical weapons.</b>  Article XI of the CWC requires cooperation among nations in the peaceful uses of chemicals.  In many respects, this provision resembles the 1950s Atoms for Peace arrangement to foster the peaceful uses of nuclear power.  This is the approach to arms control and trade that has been used to justify Russia's sale of nuclear reactors to Iran. The last thing the world needs is a "Poison for Peace" program that helps spread chemical weapons around the world, as the Atoms for Peace did for nuclear reactors to Iran and North Korea.
<p>
 The chief lobbying group for the chemical industry, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), supports ratification of the CWC, and the prospect for increased sales of dangerous chemicals to countries like Iran may be the reason why. CMA member companies that produce and export chemicals would be subject to stricter limits on exports if the U.S. does not ratify the CWC. It would be sad indeed if the CMA were putting its own economic interest ahead of the nation's security in supporting ratification.
 <p>
<li><b> Not enhance U.S. security.</b>  By making arms control an end in itself, the CWC will not protect U.S. national security.  Arms control is only one of several means for achieving the goal of national security. America needs the additional tools of deterrence, defenses, and even offensive military operations. It makes no sense for America to give up its chemical weapons if other nations still possess them.
<p>
<li><b> Be inconsistent with America's global responsibilities.</b> The CWC, by treating all nations alike, fails to acknowledge America's special role in global security. Superpower status imposes important global responsibilities which the U.S. can fulfill only by maintaining armed forces capable of projecting overwhelming force around the globe. Because America has these special responsibilities, it is treated as an exceptional case under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty regarding the possession of nuclear weapons.  The same principle should apply to America's chemical weapons arsenal.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Advising and consenting to the ratification of treaties is one of the Senate's most solemn constitutional responsibilities.  This is particularly so when the treaty under consideration has profound implications for the security of the nation.  Given all that is stake with the CWC, Senators should scrutinize carefully all the provisions and implications of the treaty before they vote.  This will lead to an inescapable conclusion: Ratifying the CWC would leave America less secure and would pose unreasonable costs on American businesses.

<h3>RATIFYING THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION: AMERICAN BUSINESS WILL PAY THE PRICE</h3>

F.Y.I. No. 111<br>
July 18, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="fyi111t1.gif">Table</a>: CWC's Impact on Business Widespread
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


By September 14, 1996, the Senate will be voting on ratification of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.1732:">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> (CWC), a treaty that would ban the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons. The CWC contains serious shortcomings. It is neither reliably verifiable nor enforceable. As a result, it will not serve the security interests of the United States. But the potential damage from the CWC is not limited merely to national security. It also will impose a costly regulatory burden on American businesses and thus harm America's economy. This burden will result from the CWC's requirement that businesses prove to the U.S. government and international inspectors that they are not producing or stockpiling chemical weapons. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in companies' being fined as much as $50,000 per incident.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

What follows is a state-by-state breakdown of the industrial facilities that are likely to be subject to the requirements of the CWC. These data are provided by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and are based on aggregate data maintained by the federal Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). Following the data on production facilities is a flow chart provided by the Department of Commerce describing the regulatory process governing the data collection effort.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Estimates of the direct cost that implementing the CWC will impose on U.S. businesses range as high as $200 million annually. The potential indirect costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the loss of confidential information, are difficult to estimate. However, billions of dollars in losses are not out of the question.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is true that the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) supports ratification and implementation of the CWC. Because the CMA is a prominent trade representative in Washington for the chemical industry, its support for the treaty would appear to suggest that the potential regulatory burden is not excessive. But the CMA does not speak for all chemical manufacturers. In fact, more than 60 percent of the facilities most likely to be affected by the CWC are owned by companies not represented by the Association. Further, small businesses, which are less likely to be represented by the CMA, are the ones most likely to be hurt by the increased regulatory burden, because they do not have the money to cover the added costs that will be imposed by the new regulations. Finally, something which the CMA does not emphasize is that chemical companies are not the only ones subject to this treaty. So, too, are food processors, brewers, distillers, pharmaceutical companies, paint companies, petroleum companies, and rubber companies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the Chemical Weapons Convention served the national security interests of the U.S., it would be reasonable to ask American businesses to assume some portion of the burden imposed by the inspection regime. But to ask American businesses to assume the excessive cost burden imposed by implementing a treaty that actually harms U.S. national security makes neither economic nor security sense.

President Bill Clinton and other opponents of national missile defenses charge it will cost too much to defend Americans against missile attack.<sup>1</sup>  As evidence Clinton points to a May 15 estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that a missile defense system required by the Defend America Act of 1996 would cost as much as $60 billion.<sup>2</sup>  Both the President and the CBO are wrong. Defending America from nuclear attack will not cost as much as the CBO thinks. The U.S. could deploy a missile defense system for as little as $8 billion.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The CBO estimate is wrong because it is based on a flawed assumption that a ground-based system is the best option for ballistic missile defense (BMD). It is not. A sea-based option would not only be more effective, it would cost much less. Besides, the CBO report has been mischaracterized by critics of missile defense. All the critics say is that such a defense will cost $60 billion. What these critics ignore is that in the CBO estimate the initial defense system would cost only a fraction of the $60 billion claimed. The larger total applies to the deployment of several defensive systems, not just one, over a fourteen-year period. Critics pretend that the total cost figure would have to be paid in order to defend America from attack. This is not true. Using CBO's approach, an initial missile defense system costing as little $14 billion could provide coverage for the territory of the United States against very limited attacks with unsophisticated missiles.
<p>
<b>The CBO Report</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Congressional Budget Office is charged by Congress to estimate the budgetary impact of legislation. In performing this function, the CBO issued an estimate on May 15 of the cost of enacting the Defend America Act, which would commit the nation to the deployment of a national missile defense system by 2003. However, the act is essentially a statement of strategic policy goals or priorities. It includes no budgetary authorization and mandates no particular BMD system or "architecture" which can be costed with any precision or certainty. This allowed the CBO to estimate the cost on the basis of its own assumptions. These assumptions led to a general cost estimate of $31 billion to $60 billion to deploy a combination of several national missile defense systems, extending over a fourteen-year period. This wildly varying estimate has been used by critics of missile defense to distort the real cost of missile defenses.
<p>

<b>CBO's flawed assumption.</b> The CBO estimate of the cost of the Defend America Act is based on a flawed assumption: that the ground-based approach pursued by the Clinton Administration is the only option for fielding an initial defense. The CBO began its analysis by examining hypothetical approaches proposed by the Clinton Administration's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). However, the Clinton Administration is opposed to national missile defenses and has no incentive to discuss the most cost-effective approach to deployment, even hypothetically. The Administration's hypothetical approach would deploy a single site of 100 fixed, ground-based interceptors, as allowed by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. This system, according to the CBO, would cost $14 billion if an array of sensor satellites were included in the deployment plan. The CBO then added two additional interceptor sites. This ran the cost of the system up, according to the CBO, to $18 billion. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
But the ground-based-only approach is not the only option. In fact, it is the worst option, not only costing too much, but not doing the job of effectively providing a wide-area of coverage against attack. The CBO failed to consider the option of modifying existing Navy AEGIS cruisers to serve as BMD platforms. The Heritage Foundation's Missile Defense Study Team ("Team B") estimates the cost of this alternative at $2-3 billion over six years, with an additional $5 billion for the sensor satellites.<sup>3</sup>  Therefore, the cost of an initial defense could be between $7 billion and $8 billion, as opposed to CBO's estimate of between $14 billion and $18 billion.<p><b>Distortions of the CBO estimate.</b> The failure to consider other more viable options was not the only problem with the CBO estimate. Another is the wide range in the estimate of $31 billion to $60 billion over 14 years. The 100 percent variance in this estimate is so broad as to make it meaningless. No one can seriously base a judgment on it. Estimating the cost of missile defenses over a 14-year period would have been akin to devising a similar cost estimate in 1958 for the cost of five generations of intercontinental ballistic missiles (the <i>Titan I,</i> the <i>Titan II,</i> the <i>Minuteman I,</i> the <i>Minuteman II,</I> and the <i>Minuteman III</i>) through 1972. If the procurement cost of these systems -- likely more than $200 billion -- had been debated prior to the decision to develop ballistic missiles, perhaps Congress would have been equally shocked by the "sticker price" of deploying a nuclear deterrent for the next 14 years. The country should be very glad indeed that the Congress did not engage in such a spurious debate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Further, the assertion that deploying a missile defense system will cost $60 billion distorts the CBO's analysis. First, the $60 billion estimate is an upper limit. Even by its own analysis, CBO's cost of a multiple-system deployment could be as low as $31 billion. Second, this range of estimates covers the period from fiscal 1997 through 2010, or 14 years. That amounts to between $2.2 billion and $4.2 billion per year, or less than 2 percent of annual defense budgets. Third, the five-year estimate (fiscal 1997 through 2001) is less than $10 billion. Finally, and most important, the CBO assessment includes additions to the initial deployment that consist of space-based interceptors and space-based lasers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While any long-term deployment plan may cost any amount of money, the fact remains that CBO's initial deployment of ground-based interceptors, along with sensor satellites, would cost as little as $14 billion. Thus, despite the fact that CBO adopts an expensive approach to missile defense, even its own plan is still clearly affordable under defense budgets that will range between $250 billion and $350 billion per year (as measured in current dollars) for the 14-year period in question.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The presumed high cost of a national missile defense system serves merely as an excuse, not a reason, to oppose a decision to deploy national missile defenses. The CBO cost estimate is based on the flawed assumption that the Clinton Administration's approach to deployment is the most cost-effective. It is not. For this reason, Congress can safely ignore CBO's estimate and it certainly should ignore the misrepresentations of CBO's analysis provided by President Clinton. The fact is that a decision to deploy a national missile defense system is compatible with the defense budgets proposed by both the Clinton Administration and Congress.

<title>Flawed Intelligence Report No Guide To Missile Threat - Heritage</title>

F.Y.I. No. 103<br>
May 21, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Very soon, both the House of Representatives and the Senate will debate identical versions of the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.03144:">Defend America Act of 1996</a>. The Defend America Act commits the nation to deployment of a national missile defense system by 2003. It is similar to the provision in the FY 1996 defense authorization bill vetoed by President Bill Clinton on December 28, 1995. How Members of Congress vote on this bill will rest primarily on their understanding of the immediacy of the missile threat. Members who see the threat as present and growing will likely vote in favor of the bill; those who see the threat as remote are likely to vote against it.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In November 1995, the U.S. intelligence community issued an intelligence assessment describing the ballistic missile threat to the United States.<sup>1</sup>  Among other things, it concluded that there is little threat of a missile attack on the U.S. during the next 15 years. President Clinton and congressional opponents of the Defend America Act use this assessment to justify their opposition to deploying a national missile defense as soon as possible. Since this assessment is crucial to the coming debate on missile defense, and since the vote on this legislation may well determine the future of U.S. security against missile threats, the assessment deserves thorough analysis.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Normally, it is impossible for the public to pass judgment on the content of intelligence assessments because they are classified. In the case of the intelligence assessment on the missile threat, however, the same summary version that was provided to President Clinton has been published.<sup>2</sup>  Thus, the public has an opportunity to decide whether the assessment is credible.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An evaluation of this intelligence assessment reveals that it is not credible. In fact, it contains a number of flaws. The authors of the assessment:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Inexplicably discount the threat posed today by long-range missiles in China and  Russia.</b> The intelligence community concluded that the U.S. will not face a missile threat for the next 15 years. But this inexplicably discounts the already existing threat posed by Russia and China. The assumption is that because these countries already have long-range missiles, nothing new will happen in the next 15 years to change the level of the threat. But things can change, and very quickly. This is particularly true regarding the emergence of hostile intent toward the U.S.
<p>
The immediacy of Chinese hostility was revealed earlier this year when Chinese officials were quoted as saying that China could take military action against Taiwan without the U.S. intervening because U.S. leaders "care more about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan."<sup>3</sup>  This was nothing less than a thinly veiled threat to attack the U.S. with long-range nuclear missiles if it intervened on behalf of Taiwan.
<p>
Another potential nuclear threat is posed by Russia -- as Clinton's Pentagon already has admitted. In fact, the intelligence report's findings on Russia blatantly contradict a fundamental conclusion of the Clinton Administration's own 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, its official statement of nuclear arms policy. This statement recognizes the volatility of the U.S. relationship with Russia.<sup>4</sup>  It even includes an option for "hedging" against a reversal in U.S.-Russian relations by arguing that America may have to exceed limits imposed by arms control agreements with the Russians if Moscow again becomes hostile. Russia is a strategic wild card -- a fact which the authors of this intelligence report blithely ignore. In short, the report's "findings" are fundamentally at odds with the Clinton Administration's own nuclear policy.
<p>
<li><b>Write off Alaska and Hawaii as territory to defend against missile attack.</b> The finding that the U.S. will not face a missile threat for 15 years is based on examining the missile threat to "the contiguous 48 states and Canada."  Alaska and Hawaii are not considered. Why this is done becomes clear when it is revealed that North Korea is developing a missile, the <I>Taepo Dong</I> 2, that could reach Alaska and Hawaii. North Korea could deploy this missile in three to five years. It is truly remarkable that the Clinton Administration appears to believe that the people of Alaska and Hawaii are strategic second-class citizens who deserve less protection than New Yorkers or Californians. It is even more remarkable that the President appears to believe that Canadians deserve more protection than Alaskans and Hawaiians.
<p>
<li><b>Are overly optimistic about how long it will take rogue states to develop long-range missiles.</b> The intelligence estimate states: "We [of the intelligence community] are likely to detect any indigenous long-range missile program many years before deployment."  But the intelligence community has a poor track record in detecting illicit weapons programs. It failed, for example, to detect major portions of Iraq's nuclear weapons program. International inspections of Iraq's nuclear program following the Persian Gulf War revealed that it was far larger and far more advanced than the U.S. intelligence community had predicted before the inspections.<sup>5</sup>  Saddam Hussein was only months away from deploying an explosive nuclear bomb, not years away as the intelligence community had predicted.
<p>
<li><b>Unwisely downplay the potential impact of foreign assistance on the missile threat to America.</b> They conclude that foreign assistance is a "wild card" that could be used by developing countries to accelerate their missile programs. Chinese assistance, for example, reportedly helped Iraq extend the range of their Soviet Scud-B missiles.<sup>6</sup>  The post-Gulf War inspections in Iraq revealed that the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission relied on a wide variety of foreign sources to accelerate its nuclear weapons program. The foreign sources include corporations in the U.S. and Germany. This is one reason why the U.S. was surprised by the scope and advanced state of the Iraqi program. United Nations inspector David Kay commented on October 17, 1991, that "there is no region of the world that you will find that did not contribute to [the Iraqi nuclear weapons] program."<sup>7</sup>
<P>
<li><b>Underestimate the impact of space launch vehicle development on missile proliferation.</b> The intelligence estimate states that "if a country were to purchase an SLV [space launch vehicle], converting it to an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] would involve technological obstacles roughly as challenging as those involved in an indigenous ICBM program."  This statement is surprising since space launch vehicle and missile components are very similar. Of the eight essential components of a ballistic missile, all but one -- the warhead -- are found in somewhat modified forms in space launch vehicles.<sup>8</sup>  Thus, the transfer of space launch vehicle components is virtually certain to assist countries in developing missiles.
<p>
Downplaying the potential impact of widely available space launch vehicle technology on missile development programs reflects the intelligence community's historic tendency to underestimate the pace of technological advancement in foreign weapons programs. Fifty years ago, U.S. intelligence failed to predict Soviet acquisition of atomic bomb technology. The Soviet Union tested its first atomic weapon in August 1949, years earlier than was predicted. America was shocked for a second time in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched its <I>Sputnik</I> satellite. Predicting that a missile threat to America is 15 years away indicates the same sort of complacency that resulted in surprise at the Soviet atomic test in 1949 and <I>Sputnik</I> launch in 1957.
<p>
<lI><b>Are completely unrealistic about the potential sale of long-range missiles and space launch vehicles.</b> The intelligence assessment concludes: "We expect countries that currently have ICBMs will not sell them."  This finding is contradicted by historical experience. China sold intermediate-range missiles to Saudi Arabia in 1988 and Pakistan in 1993. Why the intelligence community is so certain that China would not sell long-range missiles is a complete mystery. Moreover, even the Clinton Administration recognizes that Russia will be marketing its ballistic missiles as space launch vehicles. On September 28, 1995, the Clinton Administration agreed to modify the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) to lift restrictions on converting missiles to space launch vehicles.<sup>9</sup>  It did this to satisfy the Russians, who want to sell modified SS-25 <I>Sickle</I> long-range ballistic missiles as space launch vehicles. In short, the Administration agreed to modify an existing arms control treaty precisely to permit the kind of proliferation which is dismissed so easily in the intelligence estimate, and which it supposedly opposes so vehemently in its declared anti-proliferation policy. Apparently the Russians are beginning to implement this policy. Press reports on a classified Pentagon study reveal that Russia is selling SS-18 <I>Satan</I> ICBM components to the Chinese as space launch vehicle technology.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Inexplicably dismiss the threat of accidental or unauthorized missile launches against the U.S.</b> The intelligence assessment states: "We conclude that the current threat to North America from unauthorized or accidental launch of Russian or Chinese strategic missiles remains remote and has not changed significantly from that of the past decade."  Yet Russia and China are undergoing great political turmoil. Any fracturing of either country's political leadership cannot help but cause a break in the chain of command governing nuclear weapons. This is precisely what happened when an attempted <I>coup d'etat</I> against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev took place in 1991. Nobody knew who had control of the Soviet nuclear arsenal during that time. Such political crises occur frequently, with little or no warning. It is all but impossible to understand why the intelligence community is so confident that the threat of accidental or unauthorized missile launches is so remote.
</ul><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The intelligence assessment of the missile threat to the United States contains so many flaws, contradictions, and ambiguities that critics naturally wonder about its objectivity. There are deep suspicions in Congress and the expert community that political leaders in the Clinton Administration intervened in the intelligence process to get the answer they wanted. Indeed, the Clinton Administration made a decision in 1993 to cut the national missile defense budget by some 80 percent. The Administration may have felt pressured to justify this decision by encouraging an intelligence assessment that minimized the threat of a missile attack on the U.S. The U.S. General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, is trying to determine whether the Clinton Administration did in fact intervene. If it is found that the Administration "cooked" this assessment, then President Clinton's veto of the FY 1996 defense authorization bill will appear to be not merely an act of willful ignorance, but the <I>coup de grace</I> in a shameless plan of deception.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whether the intelligence assessment is objective or not is now a matter for Congress to decide. However, for purposes of the debate on the Defend America Act, it is enough to know that the possibility exists that this assessment was "cooked," that it is fatally flawed, and that it is therefore a poor guide to policy.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should not rely on this assessment as an excuse for deferring the decision to deploy a national missile defense system. Further delay in deployment could result in a surprise missile attack against which the U.S. would have no defense, and which could cost many American lives. If this were to occur, Members of Congress would not be able to hide their responsibility. The time for Congress to live up to this responsibility is now, before it is too late.

<p>
<b>THE DECADES-LONG EFFORT TO BAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The history behind the Chemical Weapons Convention is a long and tortuous one. It has long been the aim of diplomats to curtail both the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons. Among the earliest attempts in modern times to ban the use of chemical weapons was the 1907 Hague Convention. Approved by the European powers, the convention prohibited the use of weapons containing poison, but the widespread use of chemical weapons in World War I proved that this prohibition had little effect. After the war, a League of Nations conference convened in Switzerland to approve the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibited the use of both biological and chemical weapons in war, but not their development, production, and stockpiling. Among the countries signing the Geneva Protocol were the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Japan. Unlike the 1907 Hague Convention, the Geneva Protocol was successful once war broke out. Chemical weapons were not used widely during World War II, but this success was due to implicit threats by allied leaders, particularly President Franklin Roosevelt, to respond in kind to any chemical attack. It is one of history's clearest examples of a successful deterrence policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Geneva Protocol is still in force, and the U.S. honors its terms, although it did not ratify the protocol until 1975. It is, however, a weak agreement. If countries violate it, they remain unpunished, and there are no established procedures for determining the veracity of reported claims of biological or chemical weapons use. It is sometimes referred to as the "no first use" agreement because participating states agreed to comply with its terms so long as biological or chemical weapons were not used against them first. Some states, including the U.S., ratified the agreement with the reservation that it would cease to be binding if they were attacked first.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Violations of the Geneva Protocol have occurred on several occasions since the end of World War II. The Soviet Union and its clients, for example, used mycotoxins, commonly referred to as "yellow rain," against civilians in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia in the 1970s and 1980s, and Iraq used chemical weapons during its eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Negotiations leading to the Chemical Weapons Convention began in 1971 when the U.N. Conference on Disarmament's predecessor organization, the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee, voted to conduct separate talks on banning biological and chemical weapons. This allowed for the conclusion in 1992 of the Biological Weapons Convention, which banned the production and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons, but put negotiations to ban chemical weapons on the back burner for well over a decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the mid-1980s, the Reagan Administration, expressing concern over the large-scale Soviet chemical weapons program, began producing a new generation of chemical munitions for the U.S. military. The subsequent U.S. program was legal because the 1925 Geneva Protocol outlawed only the use, not the development, production, and stockpiling, of chemical munitions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Diplomatic efforts in the 1980s focused on stopping the spread of chemical weapons to Third World countries. In 1984, Australia proposed to establish controls on the export of ingredients that could be used to manufacture chemical weapons. This proposal was made to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an organization of the industrialized states to coordinate economic development policies for the Third World. The Australians wanted participating countries to coordinate export control policies to stem the transfer of chemical weapons-related technologies to the Third World. Specific restrictions and enforcement mechanisms were left to individual governments. The "Australia Group" now has 29 members, including such prominent nations as the U.S., France, Britain, and Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The informal and voluntary nature of the Australian proposal has limited its effectiveness. For example, the enforcement of the export restrictions falls to individual member governments, but industrialized nations have a spotty record on how vigorously they enforce export restrictions. In the 1980s, a Phillips Petroleum Company subsidiary in Belgium delivered the chemical thiodiglycol (used in manufacturing mustard gas) to Iraq, and Britain is reported to have sold thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride to Iraq in 1988 and 1989. Both transfers were contrary to the commitments made by Belgium and Britain in the Australia Group. Export control policies, while useful to pursue, by themselves cannot stop the spread of chemical weapons.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President George Bush came to office determined to ban chemical weapons. President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev signed an agreement on June 1, 1990, in Washington to reduce the chemical stockpiles of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to 5,000 metric tons each. No accord, however, was reached outlining inspection procedures for confirming the destruction of these weapons. That was left to subsequent negotiations, which were supposed to be completed by December 31, 1990. This deadline passed without agreement between Moscow and Washington, and the "bilateral destruction agreement" has yet to be brought into force. This failure, to some extent, was due to the turmoil in the Soviet Union, which was collapsing politically. Further, both sides were aware that progress was being made on the Chemical Weapons Convention at the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, and that this convention would have extensive inspection procedures and would ban the weapons entirely. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the setbacks at the bilateral level with Russia, President Bush announced on May 13, 1991, that the U.S. would agree to a complete ban of chemical weapons even if some other nations did not eliminate their arsenals. Bush also pledged that the U.S. would forswear the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances, including situations in which U.S. forces are attacked with such weapons first.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Until that time, Washington had reserved the right to use chemical weapons if attacked with them first and to maintain a chemical weapons stockpile for the purpose of deterrence and possible retaliation. This unilateral concession by the U.S., along with another to drop the demand for stringent "any time, anywhere" inspections of possible chemical weapons facilities, put the Chemical Weapons Convention negotiations on the fast track. The final draft of the convention was completed on September 3, 1991, in Geneva. It was signed in Paris by more than the 65 countries required for ratification to bring the convention into force, including by the United States. Now the Senate, in fulfilling its role to advise and consent to all treaties, must decide whether the United States will ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention.  
<p>
<b>PROVISIONS OF THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I think it would be useful to review the content of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The purpose of the convention is to ban chemical weapons and forbid their production, stockpiling, and use by participating states. It would do so by establishing elaborate procedures for eliminating all chemical weapons no later than ten years after the convention enters into force and by requiring the elimination of chemical weapons production facilities within the same ten-year period. The convention, however, does not require the destruction of toxic chemicals, their precursors (chemicals that can be combined to form toxic chemicals), or facilities that are used for peaceful purposes. Likewise, small stockpiles of lethal chemicals may be retained for the development of defenses against chemical weapons. These chemicals, precursors, and production facilities are subject to verification measures to detect any attempt to convert them into weapons. The convention is of unlimited duration, which is designed to make the destruction of chemical weapons permanent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Overseeing the implementation of the agreement will be a large international bureaucracy that in many ways resembles the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a U.N. agency that fosters cooperation among nations in the peaceful uses of nuclear power. In a similar vein, a new chemical weapons bureaucracy will be created, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Headquartered at The Hague, this organization will have three parts. The first will be the Conference of State Parties, consisting of the representatives of all states participating in the convention. It will establish general policies for implementing the convention and will oversee the functions of the organization. The second will be the Executive Council, the executive arm of the organization, consisting of the representatives of 41 participating states picked to achieve geographic balance. The third will be the Technical Secretariat, led by a Director General, which will be responsible for carrying out the inspections to verify compliance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first meeting of a commission preparing the groundwork for the chemical weapons organization took place on February 8, 1993, at The Hague. Since that meeting, the Preparatory Commission has focused on building the Provisional Technical Secretariat, the forerunner of the monitoring agency that will be created after the convention comes into force. Activities of the Preparatory Commission thus far have included finding a building to house the agency, establishing inspection procedures, drafting inspection manuals, procuring and testing inspection equipment, and hiring and training inspectors. According to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the 1995 budget for the Preparatory Commission was roughly $17 million, of which the U.S. paid 25 percent. Once up and running, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will operate at a cost of about $200 million annually. On the basis of a 25 percent contribution, U.S. taxpayers could be expected to pay $50 million annually to support this international organization.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The verification responsibilities of the Technical Secretariat are vast. The convention's Annex on Implementation and Verification (Verification Annex), over 100 pages long, establishes a long list of inspections to verify that chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facilities are destroyed. The Technical Secretariat also is tasked with ensuring that commercial chemical production facilities are not used to develop and produce weapons. The Verification Annex outlines a number of inspection procedures, including the timing of inspections, the appointment of inspectors, the privileges and immunities that governments must extend to inspectors, and the equipment inspectors may bring with them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Verification Annex establishes eight different kinds of inspection regimes, all of which must be carried out by the Technical Secretariat. The first kind of inspection verifies whether chemical weapons are destroyed. The second is to verify the destruction or conversion of chemical weapons production facilities. The third, fourth, and fifth kinds of inspections are to detect whether certain types of chemicals have been used in building chemical weapons, based on how easily each of three categories (schedules) of chemicals can be turned into weapons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The sixth kind of inspection pertains to production facilities that produce chemicals not found in any of the first three schedules. The seventh is the most sensitive insofar as it involves short-notice inspections of states suspected of violating the terms of the convention. The final kind of inspection requires investigating sites where chemical weapons may have been used.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At first, the U.S. demanded that so-called challenge inspections be allowed anywhere and at any time a violation was suspected. It ultimately abandoned this approach in favor of a British proposal for so-called managed access to suspect sites. Under this provision, the inspected state may take steps to guard its national security, as long as they do not involve evading the convention's terms. In order to protect its security, an inspected state may remove sensitive papers; shroud displays and equipment; log off computers; restrict the types of analyses that may be carried out on air, soil, and effluent samples; and even limit which inspectors may gain access to particular areas at a suspect site.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The inspection process is long and involved. It starts with OPCW officials inspecting the locations declared by a member state as weapons sites. The declaration must be filed with the Technical Secretariat no later than 30 days after the convention enters into force. Work on destroying the chemical weapons at the sites must begin within two years and must be completed within ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once on a weapons site, inspectors will place seals and monitoring devices to guard against a violation. Similar procedures, such as for placing cameras, exist for monitoring whether chemical weapons, production facilities, and non-weapons chemical production facilities have been destroyed. As many as 1,000 inspections a year may be required.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Operating this complex arrangement of inspection regimes will prove costly to U.S. industry and the government. According to expert David Evans of Analytic Services, Inc., of Arlington, Virginia, U.S. industry can be expected to incur costs of between $20 million and $200 million annually to support the inspection process. The higher costs are more likely in the early stages of implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. But this general cost to industry assumes that everything goes as planned. If the mechanism in the convention to protect proprietary and other sensitive business information fails, Mr. Evans estimates that the cost to business could exceed $1 billion annually. The U.S. government will have its responsibilities for implementing the convention as the national authority serving as an intermediary between industry and the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The cost of these activities to the U.S. government is estimated to be $25 million annually. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention also contains a provision on compliance. The Executive Council bears the responsibility for demanding that a participating state redress a violation. If corrective action is not taken, the Conference of State Parties may suspend the offending state's privileges under the convention. This could include terminating cooperative programs to assist states in developing chemicals for peaceful purposes or denying the offender the right to vote in the Conference of State Parties. In more serious cases of violation, stricter countermeasures would be taken. For example, trade in all chemicals with the offending state could be shut off. In cases where violations pose a threat to the security of other states, the Conference of State Parties may refer the matter to the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council. Ultimately, the Security Council serves as the court of final appeal in the enforcement process.
<p><b>
A FIVE-PART TEST OF ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS AND THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To deserve the support of the Senate, any arms control agreement should pass a five-part test. This test should serve to determine whether a particular arms control agreement meets the minimum standards necessary to serve the national interest. The test consists of five questions, all of which must be answered affirmatively when applied to a particular agreement to insure that it does not contain a fatal flaw. These five questions are: 1) Does the agreement reduce the risk of war?  2) Are the agreement's requirements consistent with U.S. global security responsibilities?  3) Is the agreement adequately verifiable?  4) Is the agreement enforceable?  and 5) Does the agreement enhance national security?  The Chemical Weapons Convention fails to pass this test in all five particulars.
<P>
<b>QUESTION #1: Will the Chemical Weapons Convention reduce the risk of war?
<p>
ANSWER #1: By undermining the U.S. chemical deterrent, the Chemical Weapons Convention may increase the likelihood of war or result in the escalation of an existing conflict.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Reducing the level of armaments is not the most important goal of arms control. Reducing the risk of war is far more important. Arms control agreements should not be destabilizing. It is counterproductive to achieve an arms control agreement that, by reducing arms, only invites attack.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yet this is precisely what the Chemical Weapons Convention will do. The Chemical Weapons Convention is the product of a policy that equates reduced levels of armaments, in this case reduced to zero, with greater security. But the experience of World War II shows that having chemical weapons can deter a chemical attack. If the U.S. bans all of its chemical weapons, outlaw states that retain them will have a military advantage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Almost as important as reducing the risk of war is the goal of preventing the escalation of an existing conflict to a higher level of violence. The Chemical Weapons Convention, although unintentionally, will encourage escalation in two ways. First, chemically armed enemies, knowing that the U.S. and its allies do not possess chemical weapons, will have little incentive to refrain from using such weapons. They will enjoy a unilateral advantage over the U.S., and in time of war they are likely to use it. Second, the convention may increase the likelihood that nuclear weapons will be used. Lacking chemical weapons, the U.S. will be forced to rely on nuclear weapons to deter a chemical attack on U.S. forces. While it is prudent to reserve the right to use nuclear weapons, it is certainly unwise to take steps that lower the threshold for the employment of nuclear weapons.
<P>
<b>QUESTION #2: Are the Chemical Weapons Convention's requirements consistent with America's global responsibilities?
<p>
ANSWER #2: The Chemical Weapons Convention, by treating all nations alike, fails to acknowledge America's special role in global security.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
With the Cold War over, the U.S. is the world's sole superpower. Superpower status imposes important global responsibilities which the U.S. can fulfill only by maintaining armed forces capable of projecting overwhelming force around the globe. Because America has these special responsibilities, it is treated as an exceptional case under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The same principle should apply to America's chemical weapons arsenal. In Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and elsewhere, the U.S. has proved on numerous occasions that it exercises its unmatched power in a manner that is both responsible and respectful of the legitimate interests of other states. But America's global responsibilities also mean that its forces are the most likely to be engaged in major conflicts. The more dangers America faces, the greater the likelihood that chemical weapons will be used against U.S. forces.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention ignores the special responsibilities of the U.S., treating all countries in the same manner. It assumes that U.S. troops face the same likelihood of chemical attack as the tiny constabulary force fielded by Costa Rica, which has the same rights and obligations under the treaty. In this way it contrasts sharply with one of the more successful arms control agreements of the post-World War II era, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, under which the U.S. and four other nations (Britain, China, France, and Russia) are treated in a manner fundamentally different from all other nations. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty accounts for the special responsibilities and broad political roles played by these five acknowledged nuclear weapons states in world affairs. The Chemical Weapons Convention also could have done so, simply by adopting the same discriminatory approach established by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<p>
<b>QUESTION #3: Is the Chemical Weapons Convention adequately verifiable?
<p>
ANSWER #3: Despite elaborate and burdensome verification provisions, compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention cannot be adequately verified.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention is not adequately verifiable. Many lethal chemicals are common and have peaceful uses, and trying to keep track of all these chemicals throughout the world is an impossible task. In a devastating report prepared for the Defense Nuclear Agency in 1991, contractors stated: "Detecting most types of cheating [possible under the Chemical Weapons Convention] will be highly unlikely, if not impossible."  This committee itself was notified of the problems with verification during a June 23, 1994, hearing. At that hearing, then-Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey stated: "But, still, the chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
<p>
<b>QUESTION #4: Are the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention enforceable?
<p>
ANSWER #4: Violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention are likely to go unpunished.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Verification of compliance with an arms control agreement is not enough. The U.S. also must be able to do something if other countries are caught violating the agreement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention makes only a feeble attempt to address the question of enforcement. It states that unspecified sanctions can be imposed on a state that is violating the convention, either by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons or by the United Nations. Ultimately, the United Nations Security Council would have to impose penalties severe enough to change the behavior of an outlaw state.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The history of the Biological Weapons Convention provides an object lesson in what can go wrong with this agreement. Starting in the early 1980s, the U.S. acknowledged that it suspected the Soviet Union of violating the Biological Weapons Convention. Yet the U.S. never lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council, which is charged with resolving the Biological Weapons Convention's enforcement problems just as it would under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The reason for this inaction is clear: If the U.S. had lodged a complaint against the Soviet Union, Moscow simply would have vetoed any enforcement resolution brought before the U.N. Security Council. China and Russia will have an equivalent veto authority against enforcing the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention as they pertain to their programs.
<p>
<b>QUESTION #5: Does the Chemical Weapons Convention enhance U.S. national security?
<p>
ANSWER #5: By making arms control an end in itself, the Chemical Weapons Convention will not serve to protect U.S. national security.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This question establishes the most important test of arms control. Arms control is one of several means for achieving the goal of national security. It should never be thought of as an end in itself. Reduced arsenals are not always better. A comprehensive security strategy will make room for the tools of deterrence, defenses, and even offensive military operations, as well as arms control. In short, any arms control agreement must serve the supreme purpose of foreign policy, which is protecting the nation's security.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention does not meet this most basic test. The convention requires that the U.S. completely abandon its chemical deterrent. But this requirement will not enhance U.S. security. Since no country is compelled to join the convention, it will be perfectly legal for those that do not join to retain chemical weapons. And since it is unrealistic to expect countries which want to retain chemical weapons to join, the result cannot possibly be global chemical disarmament. It makes no sense for America to give up its chemical weapons if, as a practical matter, other nations still possess them. By way of analogy, would it be in the U.S. interest to conclude a similar agreement relative to nuclear weapons?  Such an agreement would require the U.S. to dispense with its nuclear arsenal even though some other countries may retain nuclear weapons. This is no longer an academic question. India, among other nations, is demanding that the U.S. commit to such an agreement in principle at the negotiations over banning nuclear tests at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The precedent set by U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention would indicate that the U.S. is willing to accept a similar agreement attempting to ban nuclear weapons.
<p>
<b>TOWARD AN EFFECTIVE COUNTER-PROLIFERATION POLICY: THREE PRINCIPLES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention is not just an arms control agreement; it is also a non-proliferation agreement. As such, it carries important implications for U.S. non-proliferation policy. While the U.S. has a clear interest in stopping the proliferation of chemical weapons around the world, an effective counter-proliferation policy cannot depend on arms control alone. A truly effective policy will balance arms control with deterrence, effective chemical defenses, and, if necessary, military options for destroying chemical weapons and weapons facilities. As the Senate considers the merits of the Chemical Weapons Convention, it should ask whether it is part of an overall counter-proliferation policy that rests on the following three principles. 
<p>
<b>PRINCIPLE #1: The need to deter a chemical attack.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Deterrence requires maintaining a credible threat to retaliate for chemical attacks against the U.S. or its allies. This retaliatory threat must be able to convince any potential aggressor that he has nothing to gain by attacking the U.S. with chemical weapons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By requiring the destruction of chemical weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention would deny the U.S. the capability to retaliate in kind for a chemical attack. America therefore would be left with only two options in case of a chemical attack: 1) to escalate the conflict by launching large-scale counter-attacks with conventional (non-chemical and non-nuclear) arms, or 2) to retaliate with nuclear weapons. But the Clinton Administration has not made the adjustments necessary to deal with these options. Not only is it cutting the conventional forces needed to deter chemical attacks; it also has not declared that nuclear weapons have a role in deterring chemical weapons attacks.
<p>
<b>PRINCIPLE #2: The need for defenses against chemical weapons.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are no guarantees, however, that deterrence will always work. Such dictators as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qadhafi may not act rationally in a crisis or exhibit restraint. Therefore, the U.S. needs some insurance against chemical attack if deterrence fails; it needs defenses against chemical weapons and their delivery systems. U.S. forces need to be outfitted with garments, masks, and decontamination kits, and they need to be defended as well from aircraft and missiles which may carry chemical munitions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There certainly is room for improvement in chemical defenses. The General Accounting Office's Director of Army Issues, Richard Davis, testified before Congress on April 16, 1991, that America's soldiers were neither adequately trained nor equipped to conduct operations in an environment contaminated by chemical weapons. Although some progress has been made in improving the chemical defense posture of U.S. forces during the intervening years, it is unlikely that all the vulnerabilities cited by Mr. Davis in 1991 have been eliminated. As for defenses against the delivery systems used to launch chemical attacks, the Clinton Administration has cut funding for the nation's missile defense program by more than 50 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, if history is any guide, the Chemical Weapons Convention will make it politically difficult to field better defenses. In 1969, President Nixon announced that the U.S. would forswear the use or development of biological weapons in preparation for the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972. After the Nixon decision, the U.S. biological defense program withered. This outcome was not the result of a provision in the Biological Weapons Convention outlawing defenses; it was the result of constant criticism of these programs by arms control advocates who viewed them as contrary to the spirit, although not the letter, of the Biological Weapons Convention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The unintended consequences of the Biological Weapons Convention surfaced during the Persian Gulf War. An interim report to Congress on the results of the Gulf War stated that America's biological defense capabilities were so weak that if the Iraqis had used biological weapons, which later evidence shows they possessed, the casualty levels would have overwhelmed the military medical care system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This same sort of vulnerability to chemical attack is likely to be the unintended consequence of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The convention does not outlaw defensive programs, yet arms control advocates are sure to lobby against defenses. The argument will go that they are not needed because chemical weapons have been banned.
<p><b>
PRINCIPLE #3: The need for offensive capabilities.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Defensive systems are not the sole means for countering a chemical attack. U.S. armed forces can destroy preemptively an enemy's chemical weapons and weapons facilities with air strikes and other forms of offensive combat operations. Targets for such strikes should include chemical production facilities and storage depots, as well as forces armed with chemical munitions. Destruction of the production facilities and storage depots would limit the enemy's supply of weapons, and targeting enemy forces armed with chemical munitions would lessen the chances chemical munitions will be used against U.S. and allied forces.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration should be required to devise a comprehensive strategy for destroying enemy weapons and facilities in time of war. It can do so by continuing and improving Pentagon programs already underway. The Air Force has conducted "sensor to shooter" experiments with the aim of devising a system for directing attacks against enemy forces within minutes of detection. The Navy has an equivalent concept called the "cooperative engagement capability."  These programs need to be coordinated and focused on destroying the weapons and forces capable of delivering chemical munitions.
<p>
<b>REDRAFTING THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Chemical Weapons Convention is a flawed agreement. Likewise, the existing U.S. policy to counter chemical attacks also is flawed. Neither is solely the fault of the Clinton Administration. The decisions to conclude and sign the convention and to change U.S. policy toward countering chemical attacks were made by the Bush Administration.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nevertheless, the Clinton Administration has chosen not to alter the policies begun by the Bush Administration. As the Clinton Administration proceeds down the same path, it will be up to the Senate, as it considers the Chemical Weapons Convention, to adopt a different approach. It can do so through the advice and consent process established by the United States Constitution for approving the ratification of treaties. As it does so, it should consider that:
<p>
<b>1. A chemical weapons treaty should be modeled on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two treaties serve as models for agreements on controlling weapons of mass destruction throughout the world: the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 and the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Biological Weapons Convention is a discredited treaty. It seeks to ban biological weapons in their entirety by requiring all participating states, including the U.S., not to develop and deploy biological weapons. But it is now known that the Biological Weapons Convention was violated by the Soviet Union from the beginning. Further, a report issued by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency on May 30, 1995, states that China, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Russia, and Taiwan either definitely have or may have violated the terms of the convention. In most of the listed cases, it is impossible to determine with absolute precision because compliance with the convention cannot be verified. Further, the report states that Egypt and Syria may have biological weapons programs. These two countries have signed but not ratified the Biological Weapons Convention. Thus, despite the evidence that other countries retained biological weapons, the U.S. has destroyed its biological deterrent. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, by contrast, has been relatively successful. While it has not prevented the spread of nuclear weapons, it has limited proliferation significantly. Today only a handful of countries outside the five declared nuclear states have nuclear weapons. More important, the Non-Proliferation Treaty did not require the elimination of the U.S. nuclear deterrent. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration could have resolved many of the problems with the Chemical Weapons Convention by sending the treaty back to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament to be redrafted. The Administration, unfortunately, chose not to take this step. The Senate has the option of concluding that the treaty is flawed. If this conclusion were reached, the Senate could request that the Clinton Administration renegotiate the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention so that it is modeled on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the Clinton Administration resists, there is a second alternative available to the Senate. The advice and is not limited to approving or disapproving ratification. The Senate can amend the text of a treaty. Through this amendment process, the Senate itself can redraft the Chemical Weapons Convention so that it resembles the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Doing so would require amending the convention in several articles. After adopting these amendments, the Senate then could approve its ratification. The practical effect would be that the Clinton Administration would have to ask other treaty signatories to accept the changes made by the Senate. Thus, the net effect would be a demand to renegotiate the treaty.
<p>
<b>2. A new policy is needed to deter chemical weapons strikes.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Changing the Chemical Weapons Convention itself, however, will not address the threat to U.S. security posed by chemical weapons. This would require changing the overall chemical weapons policy adopted by the Bush Administration. The policy established by President Bush on May 13, 1991, essentially committed the U.S. to the unconditional elimination of its chemical arsenal. This policy should be dropped, and the U.S. should state it will preserve the broadest possible array of responses to a chemical attack, including retaliation with conventional military means, an in-kind response, and, in the most extreme circumstances, a nuclear response. Further, it should not describe the specific circumstances under which it will resort to any particular response, in order to retain the greatest deterrent effect possible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While it would be preferable that the Clinton Administration make these changes in U.S. chemical deterrence policy, the Senate also can take actions that result in the same changes. First, the Chemical Weapons Convention would have to be amended to permit a U.S. chemical deterrent. Second, the Senate could adopt a reservation -- a means by which the Senate can qualify its approval of ratification -- that declares that the U.S. reserves the option of retaliating against a chemical attack with nuclear weapons. It must be acknowledged, however, that in order to adopt such a reservation the Senate may first be required to strike Article XXII of the convention. Article XXII bars reservations. Striking Article XXII is something that should be of general interest to the Senate in any event. Barring reservations narrows the freedom of action of the Senate in terms of its advice and consent role. The Senate should not accept any provisions in this convention or any future treaty that so limits its freedom of action.
<p>  
<b>3. U.S. defenses against chemical weapons need to be improved. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pursuing an effective defense program is not prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention, even as currently drafted. In fact, the convention explicitly allows for the continuation of defense programs. The danger is that the implementation process will be hijacked by arms control advocates who oppose such programs and who will undermine them with calls for budget cuts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Senate can counter these pressures on U.S. chemical defense programs in three ways. First, it can provide adequate funding levels for chemical defense programs in the annual authorization and funding bills for the Department of Defense. But since the funding question is under the jurisdiction of other Senate committees, the Foreign Relations Committee may prefer to focus on establishing clearly defined standards for the military in terms chemical defense preparedness. A condition could be attached to the resolution of ratification that requires the Secretary of Defense to certify that the Department of Defense has met the requirements for improving chemical defense preparedness made by Richard Davis of the General Accounting Office in testimony before Congress. These include meeting minimum chemical training standards set forth in service regulations and properly integrating chemical defense training into the overall training program for U.S. troops. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Senate should also set requirements for improving U.S. defenses against delivery vehicles used to launch chemical attacks, particularly ballistic missiles. This must include a requirement for the development and deployment of missile defenses capable of effectively destroying chemically armed ballistic missiles in the boost phase. The Senate could force this outcome by adopting a condition requiring the Administration to propose such a boost-phase defense for deployment by a specific date.
<p>
<b>4. The U.S. capability to destroy chemical weapons production and storage facilities, as well as deployed forces with chemical weapons, should be improved.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Defensive systems cannot meet all the requirements for defending U.S. and allied forces and civilians against chemical attack. These can be met only by maintaining offensive capabilities for striking at enemy positions. For example, countering enemy artillery firing chemical munitions requires an offensive response with opposing artillery or air strikes, as does interrupting enemy command and control networks and destroying chemical production and supply facilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. proved during the Persian Gulf War that it has an effective deep strike capability. Many command and control centers, for example, were destroyed by U.S. air power in and around Baghdad. But this is not to say that improvements cannot be made. For example, the U.S. had trouble countering Iraqi mobile <I>Scud</I> missiles with air power. To deal with this problem, the military services, and the Air Force and Navy in particular, have launched programs which are focused on enhancing the U.S. ability to strike quickly and accurately at enemy forces and facilities. The Senate should direct the Department of Defense to coordinate these programs and focus them on countering weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, including chemical weapons. The Senate again has the option of adopting a condition during its advice and consent process that forces the Clinton Administration to continue these programs and gear them to meeting the weapons of mass destruction threat.
<p>
<b>5. The Chemical Weapons Convention's arms control enforcement mechanisms need to be strengthened. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are three problems with U.S. policy for enforcing compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention. First, the Chemical Weapons Convention has a built-in conflict of interest in terms of enforcement. By establishing the U.N. Security Council as the court of last appeal in its enforcement process, the convention will allow the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members to veto any pending resolution ordering sanctions against it for an alleged violation. Any attempt to impose sanctions -- on China, for example -- for violating the convention are doomed to failure at the outset. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This problem can be resolved by redrafting the Chemical Weapons Convention along the lines of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Since the redrafted convention would establish declared chemical weapons states, it would be logical that these states be the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, thereby eliminating the conflict of interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second enforcement problem is that the U.S. historically has been reluctant to take action to remedy a violation by an arms control treaty partner. Despite clear evidence of Soviet violations of the Biological Weapons Convention and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the U.S. did not take the proportionate steps allowed to it under international law. Thus, the violations went unpunished. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Solving this problem will require a change in the government process for handling these issues. Currently, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency reports annually on arms control treaty violations, but there is no requirement for follow-up. Ultimately, the law could be changed to require that the President propose a proportionate response to a reported treaty violation no later than 60 days after the report is issued. This would guarantee a substantive response once a violation is discovered. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The third problem is addressing the actions of states that refuse to ratify or accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention. This can be dealt with only by retaining a strong military posture that can deter and, if necessary, retaliate against a chemical attack. This is the ultimate insurance policy, but it can be maintained over the long term only by the actions of a Congress determined to fund and supervise America's defense programs.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meeting the chemical weapons threat requires redrafting the Chemical Weapons Convention to declare that a few countries, including the U.S., are weapons states. It also requires a policy under which the U.S. reserves the right and capability to respond to chemical attack either in kind or with nuclear weapons, in addition to conventional means.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps the best example in history of a successful deterrence policy came during World War II. Despite the existence of chemical arsenals, chemical weapons were not used widely during that conflict. The reason: The Allied powers, including the United States, convinced the Axis that the use of such weapons would result in swift retaliation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. may now be throwing away this successful policy. By adopting the Chemical Weapons Convention and declaring a unilateral policy of neither maintaining nor using chemical weapons, even in retaliation, the U.S. would eliminate its chemical deterrent even though it could never be sure that potential enemies have taken equivalent steps. U.S. national security interests demand that this process be reversed. The U.S. must not abandon its ability to deter attacks with chemical weapons.

<title>Clinton Is Bypassing the Senate on the ABM Treaty -- Heritage</title>

<h3>CLINTON IS BYPASSING THE SENATE ON THE ABM TREATY</h3>

Backgrounder Update No. 266<br>
December 15, 1995<br>
<p>
(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 867, "Removing the ABM Treaty Obstacle to U.S. and 
Soviet Defenses Against Missiles," November 15, 1991.)
<p>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
The Clinton Administration has reached a "framework agreement" with Russia to resolve two long-
standing disputes over the future and scope of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) 
Treaty.<sup>1 </sup>  The ABM Treaty all but bars the United States from deploying defenses 
against long-range ballistic missiles. The agreement with Russia would do two things: 
<p><ol>
<li>Name which republics of the now-defunct Soviet Union are subject to the treaty; and 

<li>Define a new dividing line between defenses against long-range missiles, which are subject to 
the ABM Treaty's restrictions, and defenses against shorter-range missiles, which are not. 
</ol><p>
The U.S. Constitution requires that the executive branch submit these new agreements to the Senate 
for its advice and consent. Failing to do so would be illegal.
<p>
Yet this is exactly what President Bill Clinton intends to do. The President wants the new 
agreement with Russia to be implemented as an "agreed statement" in the Standing Consultative 
Commission (SCC), a joint U.S.-Soviet committee established in 1972 to consult on the details of 
implementing the ABM Treaty. "Agreed statements" in the SCC do not require the consent of the 
Senate. In effect, the Clinton Administration is attempting to bypass the Senate, thereby 
circumventing its constitutional role in the ratification of international treaties. This is not only 
illegal; it is strategically unwise. The Senate needs to ensure that its constitutional prerogatives are 
preserved. It needs to take action to force the Clinton Administration to submit the U.S.-Russian 
agreement to the Senate for its advice and consent.
<p>

<b>The Framework Agreement with Russia</b>
<p>
While the official text of the framework agreement between the U.S. and Russia has not been made 
public officially, the press has published a classified version of it.<sup>2 </sup>  From public 
reports, it is clear that the agreement framework attempts to resolve two problems regarding the 
ABM Treaty. These problems have remained ever since the collapse of the U.S.S.R. in December 
1991, which effectively nullified America's previous partner in the ABM Treaty -- the Soviet 
Union.
<p>
<b>Problem #1</b>: The first is designating which republics of the former Soviet Union would 
replace the U.S.S.R. as the new legally bound partners of the treaty. Press reports reveal that the 
Clinton Administration plans to "multilateralize" the treaty by designating several of the 15 former 
Soviet republics as the new treaty partners.<sup>3 </sup>  These republics would include Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine, among others.
<p>
<b>Problem #2</b>: The second unresolved problem is to define a new line between defenses 
against long-range (strategic ballistic) missiles, which are subject to ABM Treaty restrictions, and 
defenses against shorter-range missiles, which are not. The original language in the text of the 
ABM Treaty is ambiguous. Article II both fails to define "strategic ballistic missiles" and Article VI 
fails to explain exactly when non-ABM systems are given an ABM capability or are tested in "an 
ABM mode."
<p>
The framework agreement would establish entirely new definitions for these systems. Any anti-
missile interceptor tested against a target missile with a velocity of 3.1 miles per second or higher 
and a range of 2,175 miles would be considered a defense against strategic (long-range) ballistic 
missiles. Therefore, such an interceptor would be subject to the treaty. Second, the agreement 
would impose a limit on the speed of interceptors. If the interceptor speed is 1.9 miles per second or 
less, it would not be regarded as a treaty-limited, strategic defense system. An interceptor with a 
speed in excess of 1.9 miles per second would be presumed to be a strategic defense interceptor and 
thus subject to the ABM Treaty. 
<p>
In addition, the framework agreement includes a number of "confidence-building measures."  One 
would be to impose restrictions on the number and location of defenses against shorter-range 
missiles deployed by the U.S. The purpose would be to ensure that short-range missile defenses 
cannot be used as interceptors against the long-range missiles deployed by Russia.
<p>
The new definitions and restrictions established in the framework agreement apparently are 
designed to kill the Navy Upper Tier system, a missile defense system the Navy is developing for 
use on cruisers. The Navy Upper Tier's interceptor, called the <i>Standard</i> missile, has a 
velocity of greater than 1.9 miles per second; therefore, it would be subject to ABM Treaty 
restrictions under the framework agreement. Since Article V of the ABM Treaty prohibits the 
development, testing, and deployment of interceptors on mobile platforms such as ships, the 
velocity for the <i>Standard</i> missile would have to be reduced to comply with the Treaty. This 
would weaken the capability of the missile, effectively making it less useful as a defense against 
ballistic missiles. 
<p>
Moreover, the confidence-building measures contained in the agreement would give the Russians 
and other countries a veto over where and in what numbers the Upper Tier ships may be deployed. 
The reason: The agreement requires the U.S. to provide assurances to its ABM Treaty partners that 
deployed defenses against short-range missiles will not pose a realistic threat to long-range 
missiles. But this means that Russia and other countries, not the U.S., will judge whether these 
deployments are a threat. If they feel threatened by U.S. defenses, they simply will veto America's 
deployment of the Upper Tier ships.
<p>
<b>Clinton Bypasses the Senate</b>
<p>
Anticipating that the Clinton Administration was likely to bypass the Senate with a new resolution 
on the ABM Treaty, Congress last year sought to ensure that an agreement with Russia and perhaps 
several other republics of the former Soviet Union would be subject to review by the Senate. 
Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Public Law 103-337) 
states: "The United States shall not be bound by any international agreement entered into by the 
President that would substantively modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is entered 
pursuant to the treaty making power of the President under the Constitution."
<p>
In the past, the Clinton Administration has argued that it could not pledge in advance to submit 
ABM Treaty agreements to the Senate because it could not know whether their content would 
warrant Senate review. Of course, the content of the agreement is now known, but the Clinton 
Administration still refuses to submit the agreement to the Senate. Instead, it rushed to a meeting of 
the Standing Consultative Commission, on December 4, in order to formalize the agreement with 
the Russians. All outward appearances indicate that the Administration intends to treat the 
agreement as an SCC "agreed statement" not subject to Senate review.
<p>
In short, the Clinton Administration apparently plans to present the Senate with a <i>fait 
accompli</i>. The President's advisors may try to argue that the Russian agreement does not 
substantively modify the ABM Treaty. But this would make a mockery of the law and the facts. 
The very first clause of the ABM Treaty begins by saying that "The United States of America and 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, hereinafter referred to as the Parties" will be subject to the 
treaty. Surely, striking the reference to the Soviet Union and replacing it with the names of as many 
as 12 countries substantively modifies the ABM Treaty.
<p>
Changing the names of the parties amounts to more than a formality. It could result in a 
fundamental change in the deployment restrictions of the treaty. A 1974 protocol to the treaty limits 
each side to one ABM site of 100 interceptors.<sup>4 </sup>  If 12 states are designated to replace 
the Soviet Union, each as a legal party to the treaty, then the ABM Treaty now would allow 12 
ABM sites on the territory where it previously allowed only one. Surely, adding 11 new ABM sites 
is a substantive change in the treaty.
<p>
Further, the SCC was designed to work as an implementation forum between two parties. 
Substantive arrangements for the functioning of the SCC must change if more than two states are 
participating. Under the new arrangement, the U.S. would face as many as 12 representatives on the 
other side of the table instead of one. One of those representatives is certain to be Russia. Most of 
the other countries in the SCC would likely be under the influence of Russia and might even form a 
voting bloc with Russia, thereby easily outvoting the U.S. in settling disputes. It would be absurd to 
argue that changing the SCC in this way is not substantive.
<p>

<b>What the Senate Should Do</b>
<p>
The impending actions by the Clinton Administration present the Senate with a challenge to its 
treaty-making authority. The Senate has political and legal tools at its disposal to confront the 
Clinton Administration's attempts to bypass it.
<p>
The political tool is to withhold Senate action on matters deemed important by the President until 
the agreement is submitted to the Senate. The logical targets of delay by the Senate would be other 
treaties, including the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II 
(START II), and, if the dispute carries on beyond next year, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban 
Treaty as well.<sup>5 </sup>  The Senate leadership should make it clear that it will not complete 
action on any of these treaties if the Administration tries to circumvent the Senate with its changes 
in the ABM Treaty.<sup>6 </sup>
<p>
The legal tool is for the Senate to pass a resolution calling on President Clinton to submit the 
framework agreement for the advice and consent of the Senate. Assuming Clinton refused, the 
Senate could instruct its Office of Legal Counsel to file suit against the Clinton Administration with 
the intent of barring implementation of an ABM Treaty agreement that does not have Senate 
approval. While the statute governing the operation of the Senate's Office of Legal Counsel does 
not expressly authorize initiating lawsuits on behalf of the Senate as an institution, it would be 
possible for the Senate leadership to authorize this action by adopting a Senate resolution. Further, 
an individual member of the Senate could file a similar suit on his or her own. It would be 
preferable, however, for the Office of Legal Counsel to file the suit and speak for the Senate as an 
institution.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
The framework agreement which the Clinton Administration has reached with Russia, assuming it 
is formalized in the coming days, will have a profound impact on the nation's security. It will 
determine which countries become ABM Treaty partners, change the way the ABM Treaty 
functions, and impose new restrictions on U.S. programs for fielding defenses against both shorter-
range and long-range missiles. The voice of the Senate deserves to be heard on such important 
matters.
<p>
However, hearing the Senate's voice appears to be too inconvenient for the President. He is trying 
to bypass the Senate by changing the ABM Treaty on his own, without submitting his changes to 
the Senate for its advice and consent. This is patently illegal. The treaty-making powers vested in 
the Senate by the Constitution exist to protect the nation's security, not to suit the convenience of 
the Clinton Administration. The Senate should be prepared to fight to uphold both its 
responsibilities and the nation's security. The Administration's framework agreement on the ABM 
Treaty should be brought before the Senate for its advice and consent.
