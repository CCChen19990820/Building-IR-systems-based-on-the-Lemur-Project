1958, it was part of the Federation of French West Africa, a group of West African French 
colonies. It gained independence from France in 1960. Until his recent death, President Felix 
Houphouet-Boigny ruled the country with little regard for free market reform or democracy.

<H2>JAPAN</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>


<P>	Japan has been one of the fastest-growing economies in the post-World War II era. 
With a democracy firmly in place by 1946 and an economy in ruins, Japan eliminated most 
elements of socialism and adopted the basics of a free market system which helped propel it to the 
economic status it now enjoys.
<P><IMG SRC="alb.gif"> 

<P><B>Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of protectionism)</I><BR>
Many economists argue that Japan is very protectionist. Yet Japan's average tariff rate is 
among the lowest in the world, around 1.5 percent--less even than the U.S. Japan also has 
eliminated quotas in rice, something not even considered just a year ago, and has begun to 
open up its market. While tariffs have never really been the problem in Japan, like the U.S. 
and the European Union it remains plagued with non-tariff barriers. These include 
government red tape, government toleration of business collusion, exclusionary private 
business practices, a fragmented distribution system, and a relatively unapproachable 
government bureaucracy. While these often prove to be impediments to imports, Japan's 
market is more accessible than those of most countries in the world.
 <FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>  Therefore, by global standards, especially when compared to countries 
like Bangladesh, India, and Yemen, Japan's trade barriers are relatively low.

Score - Corporate taxation: 4-Stable (High tax rates)<BR>
Final Taxation Score: 4.5 (Very high tax rates)</I><BR>
Japan's top income tax rate is 50 percent. The tax rate that applies to the average income level 
is 20 percent. Japan is now considering an income tax reduction. Japan has a top marginal 
corporate tax rate of 37.5 percent. In addition, Japan has an inhabitant's tax that is paid to 
the prefecture or municipality in which the company is located, a capital gains tax of 37.5 
percent, and an enterprise tax of 6 percent to 12.84 percent.
<P><B>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low government consumption)</I><BR>
Government consumption as a percentage of GDP is 9.4 percent.  The Japanese government 
has gone from periods of extensive subsidies to opening up its market for some products, 
such as rice. Moreover, Japanese government expenditures have been kept lower than 
those of other countries because the United States has provided for Japan's defense.
<P><B>Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low level of inflation)</I><BR>
Japan's annual inflation rate averaged only 1.5 percent from 1980 to 1991. Inflation was 1.8 
percent in 1992. In 1993, Japan actually had a negative inflation rate of about 2 percent. So 
far in 1994, prices are still shrinking.
<P><B>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Japan's foreign investment procedures were overhauled in the early 1990s. However, Japan 
continues to maintain investment restrictions on agriculture, aircraft, atomic energy, 
fisheries, forestry, leather goods, oil and gas production, and space development. 
Moreover, Japan's close government relationship with private businesses often proves to be 
a barrier to foreign investment because some businesses and government agencies collude 
to make foreign investments too costly.
<P><B>Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
The banking industry is very competitive in Japan. The government places few restrictions on 
Japanese banks and their ability to engage in a variety of services. For example, banks are 
allowed to underwrite, deal, and broker all kinds of securities through subsidiaries. This 
allows banks to be more competitive. Japan remains the world's largest net creditor. Some 
minor restrictions exist on foreign banks.
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
There are no price controls in Japan except on rice. Wages are mainly set by the market. Japan 
has a minimum wage.
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very high protection of private property)</I><BR>
Japan has an efficient legal and court system capable of protecting property rights. Government 
expropriation of property is unlikely.
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR> 
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of regulation)</I><BR>
While Japan's economy often is characterized as heavily regulated, most businesses enjoy a 
large amount of economic freedom. The process for opening a business in Japan has been 
made easier in the last several years. Moreover, while some regulations may pose burdens 
directly on individuals, Japan's regulations on businesses are aimed at allowing them 
enough room to maximize profits. Therefore, many regulations on businesses either are not 
enforced or are not a significant burden on business. For example, Japan rarely enforces its 
anti-trust laws, allowing businesses to join forces without the threat of anti-monopoly 
litigation from competitors. Therefore, by global standards, Japan's level of regulation is 
low.
<P><B>Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low level of black market activity)</I><BR>
The Japanese government has undertaken an immense crackdown on such illegal activities as 
the buying and selling of guns and narcotics.

<P>	Following the Korean War, economic liberalization became the standard in the South_the Republic

foreign assistance in the 1960s, South Korea reformed its economy to attract foreign investment and to 
develop its export industries. With little foreign aid, Korea has become one of the fastest-growing countries 
in the world.

Korea's average tariff rate is 7.9 percent.  However, the Republic of Korea has significant non-tariff 
barriers. These include business licensing requirements and the use of anti-dumping and other duties 
which increase the cost of imports, making them less competitive with domestically manufactured 
goods.

The government of South Korea has relied on foreign investment to build its export economy.  Foreign 
investments have been particularly useful in developing the ROK's high-tech industries, which are 
heavily involved in exports. Yet Korea's foreign investment code is subject to variable interpretation 
and is not always applied systematically. For example, foreign investors do not always receive equal 
treatment with domestic firms. Foreign investors may face discriminatory lending practices from 
local financial institutions. Some restrictions remain on land ownership.   
<P><B>Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
Foreign banks were welcome in South Korea as early as 1967. By the early 1990s, the government had 
completely removed itself from direct ownership of banks. Local banks are permitted to underwrite, 
deal, and broker all kinds of securities and to invest in some real estate ventures.

Most prices are set by the market. However, price controls are imposed on beef, electric power, garlic, 
petroleum products, red pepper, rice, and transportation services. The government also maintains 
stockpiles of foodstuffs that it releases into the market to raise or lower prices. Korea maintains a 
minimum wage law, but some companies are exempt. 
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR> 
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very high level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
Private property is secure in South Korea. Expropriation is very unlikely. The ROK has a stable, 
efficient legal system to protect private property.

<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of regulation) </I><BR>
Obtaining a business license in South Korea is a simple process. All businesses must be registered, but 
Korea's efficient process is not a major burden. However, in some cases, the government fails to 
publish all of its regulations and enforcement of some regulations remains haphazard.  Sometimes 
businesses find themselves in violation of regulations that they do not know exist. In addition, Korea 
enforces most labor standards only on domestic firms, leaving foreign firms vulnerable to radical 
labor activities like arbitrary strikes. In some cases, these activities have forced the bankruptcy of 
foreign firms, which flee the country without paying their employees. As a result, Korea mandates 
that foreign firms deposit three months worth of wages in a special account. 
<P><B>Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>

Korea has a fairly small black market. However, a sizable number of employers try to avoid the 
minimum wage laws.

1960, Madagascar had little economic growth in the 1960s. In 1970 its economy took a massive 
turn for the worse because the government moved from a market-based economy to a command 
economy.  However, beginning in 1988, the government began to institute some limited economic 
reforms that have produced modest rates of economic growth. In 1991, calls for political reforms 
sidetracked economic reforms. Today, Madagascar's economy is in shambles as economic reforms

<P>	Malawi is located in central Africa. It gained independence from Britain in 1964. 
Throughout the rest of the 1960s and into the 1970s, Malawi used increased agricultural production 
as an engine for economic growth. During that period, Malawi's GDP more than doubled with 3 
percent annual growth rates.  However, this changed in the 1980s. As drought brought on an 
agricultural depression, and as refugees from the nearby Mozambique civil war flowed into the 
country, Malawi's economy sank into a deep recession.  The government responded by restricting 
imports and raising government spending on social programs. This caused the budget deficit to 
balloon and pushed the country further into a depression.  As a result, Malawi's economy shrank 
nearly 8 percent and real per capita GDP dropped by 11 percent in 1992. The government has yet 
to recover from the depression.

<P>	A vast and sparsely populated West African country, Mali is one of the world's poorest 
countries. It received its independence from France in 1960. Immediately thereafter, it adopted 
socialist economic policies under the leadership of President Modibo Keita. After years of a state-
dominated economic policy, Mali has begun to rely more on the market for everyday economic 
decisions. In 1992, it held its first democratic national elections, which were contested by 21 
political parties and judged to be free and fair.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	After years of suffering from socialist economic policies and limited economic freedom, 
Mexico is well underway in liberalizing its market. As with many countries reforming their 
economies, many of the benefits of the free market are just beginning to take effect in Mexico. 
Moreover, Mexico's efforts to integrate its economy with that of the U.S. and Canada with the 
passage of the North American Free Trade Area agreement will liberalize the Mexican economy 
even more. However, despite the NAFTA, Mexico still imposes limits on economic freedom, 
especially in respect to non-NAFTA members. In addition, Mexico's political system has not been 
reformed as rapidly as its economy, although some progress has been made.  Government 
corruption continues, particularly in the form of bribes and kick-backs for government projects, and 
there is a large black market.  Nevertheless, the overall prognosis for Mexico is good.  The reforms 
are taking root and the political system, despite some recent assassinations of major political figures, 
is holding firm.

Mexico's average tariff rate is about 9.4 percent. Moreover, Mexico maintains import licenses 
for 198 different products, including beans, cars and trucks, corn, dairy products, firearms, 
and poultry. As a result of the NAFTA, Mexico's tariffs on U.S. goods will drop to 
insignificant levels, although barriers will remain for non-NAFTA members.

Mexico's top marginal tax rate is 35 percent. The tax that applies to the average income level is 
17 percent. Mexico has a top corporate tax rate of 35 percent. Corporate capital gains are 
also taxed at the corporate rate. Mexico has a value-added tax of 10 percent, a 34 percent 
capital gains tax, a state tax on salaries, and a resident tax. 
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic

<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low level of government consumption) </I><BR>
Mexico's government consumption as a percentage of GDP figure is 9 percent. 
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR> 
<I>Score: 5+ (Very high level of inflation) </I><BR>
While Mexico has made great strides in containing inflation, it has had a poor history of doing 
so. Mexico's average inflation rate from 1980 to 1991 was 66.5 percent. However, as a 
result of imposing a tighter monetary policy, the inflation rate was running at below 10 
percent in 1994.
<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
Mexico has reformed its foreign investment code to attract more investors, allowing for more 
equal treatment for foreign and domestic firms. Moreover, the NAFTA will further open 
Mexico to foreign investors from the U.S. and Canada as it becomes an attractive place to 
establish businesses.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4+ (High restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
Mexico heavily restricts foreign participation in its banking industry. Foreigners are permitted to 
own only a minority number of shares in Mexico's financial services industry. Areas in 
which foreign participation is strictly regulated include banks, brokerages, and insurance 
companies. Foreigners are prohibited from engaging in foreign exchange and credit unions. 
Moreover, domestic banks are prohibited from investing in real estate and industrial firms. 
There is some corruption involved in the dispensing of loans to state-owned companies.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
Mexico maintains a minimum wage with incremental cost of living increases. Prices are set by 
both the market and the government. Some goods affected by price controls are black and 
white television sets, beer, bleach, blenders, cigarettes, electric batteries, electric irons, gas 
stoves, light bulbs, note books, pencils, pens, razors, refrigerators, and toothpaste. 
However, the government plans to eliminate these and other price controls over time. 
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (High level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
Private property is guaranteed by the Mexican constitution. As more state-owned property is 
privatized, private property will be increasingly protected by law. There is now little fear of 
expropriation under the current political system.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4+ (High level of regulation) </I><BR>
Opening a business remains a complicated task. Each business must obtain a license or some 
other form of certification from numerous government agencies, including the Public 
Registry of Commerce, the Bureau of Statistics, federal and local tax authorities, the 
Mexican Social Security Institute, and the National Housing Fund. In addition, some 
localities require each business to belong to a local chamber of commerce and trade 
association. Moreover, additional licenses may be required from the Ministry of Health and 
other agencies. Although Mexico is making attempts to end corruption, its current 
regulatory environment remains an obstacle to business creation.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of black market activity) </I><BR>
Mexico has a thriving black market that extends beyond drugs, prostitution, and guns. In many 
Mexican cities, a black market in transportation services such as taxis and busing is 
rampant. Black market labor is often available to businesses wanting to skirt minimum 
wages laws. Some estimates peg black market labor in Mexico City at over 40 percent.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	The North African country of Morocco gained its independence from France in 1956. A 
constitutional monarchy, the government of King Hassan II recently has imposed free market 
reforms on the country's mixed economy. For example, taxes, tariffs, government spending, and 
subsidies have been reduced. The Moroccan economy has experienced slow but steady growth in 
recent years, and it aspires to become a major manufacturing base, serving markets in both Europe 
and Africa. However, Morocco's expensive military effort to retain control over the disputed 
Western Sahara is potentially destabilizing to its regime.

<P><B> Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5+ (Very high level of protectionism) </I><BR>
Morocco's average tariff rate is 17.6 percent. In recent years it has moved away from such 
protectionist measures as government monopolies and import licenses to straightforward 
tariffs for all but a few goods. Value-added taxes are also levied on imported goods at rates 
of between 7 percent and 30 percent, depending on the imported product.

<I>Score - Income taxation: 4+ (High tax rates) <BR>
Score - Corporate taxation: 3+ (Moderate tax rates) <BR>
Total Taxation Score: 4+ (High tax rates) </I><BR>
The government plans to reduce the general income tax from 48 percent to 47 percent, 
following a previous reduction from 52 percent in 1993. However, the lowest rates will 
apply to people who previously were exempt from paying taxes.<FONT SIZE="-
2">[1]</FONT>   The corporation tax rate is fixed at 36 percent of profits. This is down 
from 40 percent in 1992. A value-added tax is payable at rates of 7 percent or 19 percent 
on sales and 7 percent on banking activities. 
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic 
Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of government consumption) </I><BR>
The Moroccan government's consumption as percentage of GDP is 15.3 percent. Morocco's 
ambitious privatization effort began in 1992. Over 100 government-owned enterprises 
worth over $2 billion are slated to be sold by 1995. King Hassan exercises governmental 
control over several major Moroccan commercial enterprises.
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of inflation) </I><BR>
Morocco's average annual rate of inflation was 7.1 percent between 1980 and 1991. It was 4.5 
percent for 1993. 
<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
Foreign and locally owned investments are treated the same by the government. One hundred 
percent foreign ownership is permitted. Tax holidays are granted, and there is a tax-free 
zone at Tangier. However, neither foreigners nor Moroccans may invest in industries 
competing with the state energy and water monopoly, rail and transportation services, or 
the mining and processing of phosphates.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR> 
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
Foreign banks are relatively free to operate in Morocco. They are permitted to possess 
controlling interests in Moroccan banks. However, the government is heavily involved in 
banking. For example, the government controls credit through government-owned financial 
institutions.  Moreover, over 20 insurance companies are subject to regulations concerning 
the investment of their funds in certain sectors of the economy. 
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>  
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
Price controls recently have been eliminated except on bread, cereal, gasoline, milk, and sugar. 
These products also are subsidized by the state. While wage and salary increases are freely 
negotiated between the government and businesses, there is a minimum wage. When the 
Central Commission for Prices and Wages records an increase of at least 5 percent in the 
cost of living, the government can raise all wages and prices by decree.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR> 
<I>Score: 2-Stable (High level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
The Moroccan constitution prohibits the expropriation of private property except in special 
cases prescribed by law. There are no outstanding cases of expropriation or nationalization 
of investments. However, disparities in wealth continue to breed class resentment against 
property owners. 
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR> 
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of regulation) </I><BR>
While there are no significant bureaucratic obstacles to business activities, the large bureaucracy 
presents problems, particularly for foreign investors. Foreign businesses face complicated 
procedures, special taxes, and corruption. There also are cumbersome administrative 
procedures which local banks must follow.

<P>	Located in Southern Africa, Mozambique is the poorest country in the world. Portuguese 
control led to the start of a conflict for independence in 1964. By 1974, Portugal was fighting 
independence movements in Angola and Guinea Bissau as well as Mozambique. In that year, 
Mozambique was granted independence. Two years later, Mozambique entered a bloody civil war 
that only recently was concluded. Having held multi-party elections, Mozambique is now attempting 
to build a democratic government. With such a history of bloodshed and civil unrest, there has been 
little opportunity to develop a free market. Mozambique remains one of the most economically 
repressive countries in the world.

figure severely understates government consumption in Peru. It is probably the result of 
poor record keeping. More informal estimates place Peru's government consumption at

The many battles fought in the Philippines caused great structural damage, and much of the 
infrastructure was destroyed. On July 4, 1946, the Philippines became the independent Republic of 
the Philippines. The U.S. played a major role in the reconstruction of the Philippines after the end 
of World War II. However, between 1945 and 1953, the government's socialist economic policies 
prevented the country from establishing a free market economy. Successive administrations were

<P>	Once a communist member of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact, Poland has made 
economic progress since the fall of the Iron Curtain. Poland's six-party coalition, led by Prime 
Minister Hanna Suchocka, collapsed in September 1993. It was replaced in 1994 by a two-party 
alliance of the former Communist Party and the Agrarian Party. While the new government says 
that it wants to continue economic reform, it faces increasing populist pressures from disillusioned 
constituents. Farmers want more agricultural subsidies, while other groups want export subsidies 
and more welfare spending for the poor.

<P>	Although the Portuguese economy grew at an average annual rate of 5.3 percent from 1965 
to 1980, it collapsed in the 1980s because of socialist economic policies. The revised Portuguese 
Constitution of 1982 called for the public ownership of land, natural resources, and the principal 
means of production. Today, Portugal still is burdened by a cumbersome bureaucracy.

<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of protectionism) </I><BR>
As part of the European Union, Portugal has a average tariff rate of 3.6 percent. However, it

has a 36 percent capital gains tax, a value-added tax ranging from 4 percent to 30 percent, a

Portugal had an average annual inflation rate from 1980 to 1991 of 17.4 percent. In 1992,

<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
Portugal has opened most of its industries to foreign investment. As a member of the European 
Union, Portugal treats all foreign companies equally with domestic companies. However, 
foreign investments are not permitted in postal carriers or in such public utilities as sewage 
treatment, transportation, and water services. While the European Union has reformed 
investment procedures, individual countries may have higher barriers to non-members. 
Such a case exists in Portugal with regard to local content requirements. 
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
The government is 100 percent owner of some of Portugal's large banks, including the Caixa 
Geral de Deposito, and the Banco Fomento Exterior SA. This allows the government to 
play a large role in controlling the lending practices of private banks. Since the government 
subsidizes the state-owned banks, they get an unfair competitive advantage against private 
banks.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
The government eliminated almost all price controls in 1993. However, price controls remain

 <P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (High level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
Portugal is privatizing much of its bloated state-owned sector. Citizens are increasing their 
purchases of shares in state-owned companies. This is providing an expanding base of 
private property.  Portugal has a relatively efficient legal system that adequately protects 
property in most cases. Expropriation is unlikely.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of regulation)</I><BR>
Despite some liberalization, Portugal still maintains some significant regulations. One specific 
example is the 1987 environmental protection law that is the most stringent in the European 
Union. As a result of this law, new businesses and proposed business expansion projects 
must undergo very cumbersome environmental impact reviews by various government 
bureaucracies. This law often proves to be too high a hurdle for some businesses to jump. 
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of black market activity)</I><BR>
Portugal's black market consists of selling such scarce goods as auto parts and pharmaceutical 
products. These scarcities are created by government-imposed price controls and trade 
quotas.

However, the current government of Ion Iliescu has established an economic reform plan that, if

Communist control of the economy kept the official inflation rate artificially below what it

Romania has yet to establish a system of property protection. The legal system remains unable

due to the government's massive privatization plans and growing free enterprise. For

Russia's tariff ranges from 5 percent to 30 percent. Tariffs on luxury items can be significantly higher: 
as much as 150 percent. Russia's average tariff rate is about 14 percent. However, duty rates 
change rapidly and arbitrarily. Moreover, Russia maintains many trade restrictions left over from 
the Soviet regime. For example, safety standards, licensing and testing, and other requirements pose 
a significant non-tariff barrier. Corruption is present in the customs services, and bribes are 
sometimes necessary to bring goods into the country.

Russia has a top income tax rate of 30 percent. The tax rate that applies to the average income level is 
12 percent. Russia has a top corporate income tax rate of 38 percent. This amount includes federal 
and regional taxes. Moreover, Russia has a 35 percent capital gains tax, a 20 percent value-added 
tax, a tax ranging from 85 percent to 100 percent on foreign profits, and a social payments tax. 
Because taxes are so high and arbitrary, tax evasion is widespread.
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of government consumption) </I><BR>
Russia's government officially consumes 22.7 percent of GDP. However, state-owned enterprises still

A 1991 Russian law permits foreigners to acquire newly privatized firms in Russia. Few legal restrictions

instability.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
Many state-owned banks have been privatized. There is fierce competition in the commercial banking 
market. Foreign banks are now operating in Russia. However, Russia has yet to create a stable 
banking environment. A November 1993 presidential decree froze registered foreign bank activity 
and bars new foreign banks from entering Russia with less than 30 percent Russian ownership. This 
conflicts with a September 1993 decree sheltering foreign investors from adverse changes for three 
years. The entire banking system remains tightly controlled by the central bank. Moreover, most 
banks in Russia offer only a few services and are not as competitive as banks in the West. 
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
Some 90 percent of all prices are set by free enterprise, while 5 percent are fixed by the state and 
another 5 percent are subject to government limits on the amount of profitability. However, because 
the government controls much of the economy through ownership of the public sector, it maintains 
a high level of indirect control over wages and prices. Russia maintains a minimum wage.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
While private property is guaranteed in Russia, protection remains significantly lacking. The Russian 
court system works poorly; no clear and concise method of settling disputes of property has been 
developed. Moreover, protection of private property receives varying levels of police attention in 
different localities. Finally, corruption and organized crime remain a significant threat to private 
property. Expropriation remains possible due to unstable economic and political conditions.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of regulation) </I><BR>
Russia is experiencing a wave of dynamic entrepreneurial spirit. Many small businesses are growing 
around the larger cities. Small businesses are sprouting up by the hundreds in cities like Moscow. 
These businesses are easy to establish, and little regulation is imposed on them. However, the 
Russian government has yet to extend this "hands off" attitude to larger enterprises. Some 
regulations are arbitrary and unevenly enforced, posing a burden to business.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5+ (Very high level of black market activity) </I><BR>
Russia's black market is massive. Despite recent moves to establish a free market, there are many black

<P>	Singapore won its independence from Malaysia on August 9, 1965. Since then, the country 
has undergone economic liberalization, eventually moving the country into the industrialized world.  
Singapore had average annual growth rates of about 6.5 percent from 1965 to 1990. Today, 
Singapore is one of the richest countries in Asia.  It has made remarkable progress by maintaining 
an open trade and investment environment; a corruption-free, pro-business regulatory system; 
political stability; an efficient, strike-free labor force; and tax incentives for foreign investors.

Singapore's top rate is 30 percent. However, average income is not taxed. In fact, one needs to 
make twice the average income before the lowest taxable bracket, 21 percent, applies. 
There are no taxes on capital gains. Singapore has a flat corporate tax rate of 27 percent. It

many economic benefits, including a modern industrial sector, a well-developed infrastructure, and 
abundant natural resources. The government over the years has maintained a great deal of control 
over the economy, and this policy is continued by the new government. However, some badly 
needed economic liberalization has begun, including the privatization of some state assets, the 
state's withdrawal from the distribution of agricultural goods, and the trimming of public sector 
personnel.  This course of liberalization is nonetheless uncertain. The new government will be 
tempted to spend more on social programs to improve quickly the lives of previously 
disenfranchised black South Africans.

There is no government approval required for foreign investment. Foreign investors are subject 
to the same laws as domestic investors. There are no requirements for South African 
participation in management. However, the new government led by the African National 
Congress may not maintain a hospitable investment climate. Its egalitarianism could lead to 
increased economic control by the government, which would deter investors.

Quantitative and administrative controls over deposit and lending rates have largely disappeared. 
The banking and insurance industries nevertheless are strictly controlled. Legal restrictions 
which discriminate against foreign-owned financial institutions have been eliminated.  
However, the new government may pressure the banks into making politically motivated 
loans.

<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
The government has abolished price controls on all but a few politically sensitive items, such as 
the supply of gas, coal, and electricity. It has also deregulated the agricultural sector. Only a 
few years ago, as many as 22 now-abolished marketing boards fixed prices for agricultural 
products. Moreover, to lower prices, the government has abolished import restrictions on 
fertilizer, farming equipment, and cement. No national minimum wage exists.

<I>Score: 3- (Moderate level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
No private-sector company, whether South African or foreign-controlled, has ever been

government, including its land reform program, may weaken private property rights.     
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of regulation) </I><BR>
Regulation of economic activity is minimal in South Africa. It takes only takes 4 to 10 days to 
incorporate a business, and most businesses can be started with a minimum of formalities. 
While licenses are required for certain activities, they can be obtained with relative ease. 
However, there will be increasing political pressure to practice more affirmative action in 
the hiring and firing of personnel.
<P><B>Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>  
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate level of black market activity) </I><BR>
Legal restrictions which prevented black South Africans from owning businesses, obtaining 
skilled jobs, or living in major urban centers were lifted in 1991. This will reduce black 
market activity. Nevertheless, South Africa's continued high level of trade restrictions 
encourages smuggling.

It is Africa's largest country. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir's Islamic fundamentalist regime,

was declared a supporter of terrorism by the U.S. State Department in 1993. The ruling National 
Islamic Front tolerates no political opposition and is engaged in an expensive and brutal civil war 
with southern Sudanese separatists. Though the government has implemented modest economic 
liberalizations, Sudan's economy is unfree and continues to deteriorate. Sudan's economic

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	Sweden's economy has changed dramatically over the last several years. Once considered a 
workable socialist economy, Sweden experienced a severe economic recession in the 1980s that 
exploded the myth that a cradle-to-grave welfare state could be maintained without destroying the 
economy. By the end of the 1980s, it became increasingly clear that Sweden's economic policies, 
which included tax rates as high as 98 percent, were leading the country down the road to economic 
ruin. Because of  Sweden's generous social welfare spending, worker retraining programs, high 
unemployment compensation, and high tax rates, Sweden's GDP shrank by 6 percent from 1991 to 
1993 and unemployment rose to around 10 percent. In the end, Sweden was forced to abandon 
most of its socialist policies and follow a more market-oriented economy. Proving to be far from a 
"worker's paradise," Sweden now stands as a shining example of how socialism, no matter how 
watered down, does not work and how real economic reform produces sustainable economic 
growth.

<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of protectionism) </I><BR>
Sweden's average tariff rate is about 3 percent on manufactured goods and 5 percent on 
finished goods. Thus, the average rate is around 4 percent.
<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>  However, Sweden maintains significant import licensing 
procedures for such items as agricultural goods, ferroalloys, fiberboard, and semi-finished 
iron and steel.

50 percent.<FONT SIZE="-2">[3]</FONT>   The tax rate that applies to the average

to reduce government spending. 
<P><B>Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of inflation) </I><BR>
Sweden's average inflation rate from 1980 to 1991 was 7.4 percent. This rate is dropping 
because Sweden has pegged its currency to the European currency unit (ECU) and has 
followed a tighter monetary policy. Inflation rates since 1991 have averaged around 3 
percent to 4 percent per year.
<P><B>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
Sweden has few barriers to foreign investment. However, some restrictions continue on foreign 
ownership of air transportation companies, the maritime industry, and items considered 
necessary during time of war, such as arms manufacturing.
<P><B>Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
All commercial banks in Sweden but one are domestically owned and operated.  Two more are 
directly owned by the government. While foreign banks have been permitted to establish 
subsidiaries and branches in Sweden since 1980, the application process still remains a 
barrier for most foreign bankers. However, the government is trying to liberalize the 
banking system, making it easier to open new banks.<FONT SIZE="-2">[5]</FONT>  
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
Most wages and prices are set by the market. There is no national minimum wage law. 
However, the government influences wage rates by establishing a minimum wage for 
employees of state-owned industries. Prices are also affected by government-owned 
businesses, which are subsidized.
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (High level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
While Sweden has a rather extensive history of nationalization and expropriation of private 
property, it has recently undertaken a massive privatization program that is returning private 
property to the private sector. However, private property still receives less protection in 
Sweden than it does in other parts of Western Europe or in North America.
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of regulation) </I><BR>
Obtaining a business license in Sweden is relatively easy.  Businesses must register with the 
Patent and Registration Office and the appropriate tax offices. Moreover, Sweden 
maintains a comprehensive safety, environmental and consumer regulatory structure that 
poses a burden to businesses.  For example, the Environmental Protection Act of 1969 
requires all businesses to obtain permission from the government before they release any 
pollutants into the environment. In cases where the expansion of a business may result in 
more pollution, a company must undergo a lengthy and sometimes extremely burdensome 
investigation.  There are many other regulations on businesses, such as a government-
imposed five-week vacation.
<P><B>Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Low level of black market activity) </I><BR>
While Sweden once had a rather large black market in the construction industry, economic 
reforms are making it easier for most goods and services to be exchanged legally.

1960s. It guaranteed private property, set up a legal system to protect it, reformed its banks and

Taiwan places limits on foreign participation in the banking industry. Moreover, the

independence Tanzania developed a socialist economy, nationalizing industry and collectivizing 
agriculture. As a result, Tanzania became one of the world's poorest nations. Despite receiving tens 
of billions of dollars in foreign aid from the West, Tanzania remained mired in the economic 
doldrums until the late 1980s. At that time the government of President Ali Hassan Mwinyi began to 
introduce limited market reforms. Tanzania is moving toward a multi-party political system after 
years of one-party rule.

<P>	Thailand could be the next Asian tiger. From 1987 to 1991 its gross domestic product grew 
at around 10 percent annually. The current government of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai is 
committed to continued economic liberalization. Political opponents of the regime are trying to limit 
the expansion of increased foreign investment and may ultimately endanger continued economic 
reforms. Thailand's rapid growth has not been without difficulty. For example, Thailand's roads, 
bridges, and rail systems, have failed to keep up with industrial expansion. And, economic 
expansion has not reached everyone. Most cities have pockets of poverty.

artificially high rates. The tariff on an imported product is assessed not according to its 
current price, but according to the price the last time the product entered the country. If the 
invoice price is lower, the Thai government can impose a tariff rate assessed at the previous

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	Turkey became an independent state in 1923 after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. 
After decades of one-party rule, a multi-party system was adopted in 1950.  After a military coup in 
1960, the army drafted a new constitution in 1961, starting a trend of continued rule by a series of 
ever-weaker governments. As a result, a growing radical socialist and labor movement emerged. 
Beginning in the 1970s, Turkey became a recipient of large amounts of U.S. foreign aid. This aid 
did little to promote economic growth. In fact, it was often used to postpone badly needed 
economic reforms. Recently, however, Turkey has begun to make reforms. It has lowered taxes, 
increased opportunities for foreign investment, and increased its reliance on market forces.  Despite 
such progress, the nation is still plagued by skyrocketing inflation and huge unemployment rates.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	Ukraine became an independent republic in 1991. It has been very slow to shake off its 
communist past.  The first government of Leonid Kravchuk was composed of old communist 
apparatchiks who resisted reform.  The result has been that Ukraine has made less progress than 
Russia in reforming its economy.  However, there is some hope that the new government of Leonid 
Kuchma, who was elected president in 1994, will begin to turn things around.  Kuchma has plans to 
balance the budget, reduce wasteful subsidies to state-owned industries, privatize the massive state 
sector of the economy, and reduce barriers to trade.

free market reform under the leadership of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The result was an 
extensive market liberalization policy that has made Britain one of the strongest economies in the 
European Union. Thatcher's reforms provide an example not only of how increased economic 
freedom produces sustained economic growth, but of how a country that was once sliding back 
down the scale of economic freedom can turn itself around.

<P>	The United States is one of the most industrialized nations in the world. It is the biggest 
exporter and importer of goods, has the largest economy, and has the highest standard of living. It 
has one of the freest economies in the world, but not the most free. Recently, the U.S. has 
increased government regulations, taxes, and government spending. As a trend, the U.S. has been 
reducing the levels of economic freedom since the 1940s. As a result, economic growth and living 
standards have leveled off as some economic activity is being hindered by increased government 
intrusion. Still, America's vast resources and high levels of accumulated wealth have kept it from 
sliding more into economic stagnation.

steel, sugar, textiles, and other items.<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>   Moreover, the 
U.S. is an aggressive user of unilateral trade retaliation. For example, it uses antidumping 
laws, which allow the U.S. to impose tariffs and duties on products imported at too low a 
price. It also relies on countervailing duties, which allow the government  to impose duties 
on imports that are subsidized in their home markets. However, the U.S. has successfully 
negotiated passage of the North American Free Trade Area, which reduces trade barriers 
among Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and has completed a global free trade pact 
called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Thus, U.S. trade policy is really 
heading in two different directions at the same time. Given the propensity of the Clinton 
Administration to threaten U.S. trading partners with trade retaliation, it remains a 
possibility that the U.S. could become more protectionist.

<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>

Wages and prices in the U.S. are set by the market. The U.S. Congress, however, imposed 
wage and price controls with the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970. Later, President 
Richard Nixon imposed wage and price controls in 1971 with Executive Order 11615, 
which placed a 90-day freeze on all prices, rents, wages, and salaries. The U.S. 
government continues to set prices on some goods and services, such as agricultural goods, 
through its purchases of excess production. In addition, the U.S. maintains a federally 
imposed minimum wage standard.

Moreover, the U.S. has many, albeit well intentioned, onerous regulations like the 
Americans With Disabilities Act, various civil rights regulations, health and product safety 
standards, and food and drug labeling requirements. If current trends continue, the U.S.

<P>	Divided for most of its early history into warring factions, Vietnam was occupied by France 
in the 19th century.  After World War II, revolutionaries in northern Vietnam called on the French 
to withdraw. In 1954, France agreed to withdraw from the northern part of Vietnam and moved 
south below the 17th parallel. The communists in the North then established the communist 
Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Fearing economic collapse and political repression, non-
communist Vietnamese rushed south and established the Republic of South Vietnam.  After the 
defeat of South Vietnam in the Vietnam War in 1975, the communists, who now controlled the 
entire country, established a communist system for the entire country. While the government is 
liberalizing its economy in some areas, the economy remains generally repressed.

<P>	Yemen is one of the oldest regions of human habitation. After centuries of domination by 
various empires, including the Romans and the Ottomans, the southern part of Yemen became a 
protectorate of the British in 1839. Turkey controlled the northern part of Yemen. Turkey lost 
control of northern Yemen after World War I, and in 1934 it became independent. A civil war 
erupted in northern Yemen in 1962. Civil unrest spilled over into southern Yemen, forcing the 
British to withdraw in 1967. A Marxist government took over southern Yemen soon after, sending 
the economy into a nose dive. After two decades of political and civil chaos, North and South 
Yemen united into a single country in 1990.  Some progress toward economic liberalization had 
begun, but it was cut short by the outbreak of a civil war in 1994.

A WORD FROM L. BRENT BOZELL III<br>
CHAIRMAN, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER<br>
JUNE 1996<p>

CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg said it best: &quot;The old argument that the networks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true it's hardly worth discussing any more.&quot; From Walter Cronkite to Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas, more and more media personalities are admitting the liberal bias they denied for so long, while ridiculing conservatives who raised that charge. 
<p>
The recent Freedom Forum poll of Washington reporters and editors found 89 percent of them voted for Bill Clinton in 1992, to only seven percent for Bush; 61 percent identified themselves as liberal or moderate-to-liberal, to only nine percent who were conservative or moderate-to conservative; 59 percent called the Contract with America &quot;an election-year campaign ploy,&quot; to only three percent who thought it was
&quot;a serious policy proposal.&quot; 
<p>
And their coverage of public policy and politics reflected these views. We are not here today to prove a blatantly obvious anti-conservative bias in the press. We have proven that for almost a decade. We are here to demand an end to the non-stop media onslaught against the conservative movement -- against our ideas, our character, and our leaders. We are here to demand the media be fair and balanced -- for once. 
<p>
To this end, I announce &quot;Media Reality Check '96,&quot; a 2.8 million dollar campaign by the Media Research Center to expose for the American electorate the
blatant left-wing agenda that has made a mockery of the term &quot;objective journalism.&quot; The message from the conservative movement, like the line from the movie &quot;Network,&quot; is loud and clear: &quot;We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it any more.&quot; 
<p>
&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; will combine the most sophisticated media research operation with the most advanced technology to produce what we believe the most comprehensive and creative national campaign ever waged to confront, expose, and neutralize the liberal bias that dominates the news media today. 
<p>
Knowing how so many establishment media outlets feel it is their right to examine everything and everyone under the sun, while refusing to allow any criticism of themselves, this year we are bypassing the establishment media and going straight to the voters through the fledgling conservative media. And based on the test-marketing of this campaign over the past month, I can confidently state that our message will reach,
on average, at least 50,000 conservative activists and 25 million voters every week. As well, all of our findings will be made available to thousands of journalists on a regular basis to let them know their days of journalistic political activism are over.
<p>
&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; will have nine major components: <br>
<ol>
<li>Research. The basis of all our products is research by our eight-member media analysis team, who are taping and analyzing every single network newscast, national
newspaper and news magazine to document trends of liberal bias. Our comprehensive network news tracking system will not only document bias in 1996, but show, with scientific data, just how this follows the pro-Clinton, anti-conservative coverage in 1992.

<li>Publications. All of the MRC's monthly and bi-weekly publications -- MediaWatch, MediaNomics, Notable Quotables, and Flash -- will focus almost exclusively on the issues and trends of campaign '96 for thousands of reporters, subscribers, and activists.

<li>Pattern of Deception. MRC Senior Analyst Tim Graham's new book documents the astonishing bias Bill Clinton has benefited from in the last four years and sets the stage for a national discussion of the media's obvious preference for this President. In less than six weeks, he has conducted interviews or had his blockbuster book cited on over 50 radio shows, from local shows to nationally syndicated programs like the G. Gordon
Liddy show, the Ollie North show, and Rush Limbaugh. 

<li>Talk Radio. Over the past several months we have established an informal network of over 100 radio talk shows -- including every major nationally-syndicated show -- to provide them with up-to-the-minute evidence of left-wing bias in the establishment press masquerading as &quot;objective news.&quot; As well, MRC spokesmen are now conducting daily interviews on numerous shows coast to coast to expose the liberal media.

<li>The Internet. Using the Internet, the MRC will be communicating with hundreds of thousands of conservative activists while providing immediate intelligence to the conservative media. The MRC website will be up and running on June 24 for public
and media use during the 1996 campaign, with a full slate of studies, profiles, and special reports. MRC Executive Director Brent Baker is providing &quot;Reality Check Cyber Alerts&quot; through e-mail to the nation's most influential opinion leaders three to five
nights a week for a rapid response to media bias.

<li>Media Outreach. Two-page &quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; rebuttals are being sent via &quot;blast fax&quot; to over 1500 media and political contacts across the country on a regular basis. In addition, bias during major campaign events -- such as the upcoming conventions -- will be addressed with news releases and news conferences throughout the year.

<li>Conventions. Once again this year, the MRC will publish a daily newsletter during the two party conventions to document the ongoing political slant in prime-time convention
coverage. This year, the MRC is also considering a daily national radio feed to provide evidence of reporters' biased coverage. This daily commentary will reach tens of millions of voters.

<li>Conservative Grass-Roots Activism. To make the so-called objective national media an issue in this campaign, the MRC is mass-producing thousands of bumper stickers,
pens, refrigerator magnets and other novelty items with the tag line &quot;I Don't Believe the Liberal News Media.&quot; The national distribution efforts are already under way. MRC members -- 75,000 nationwide -- will also participate through letter-writing  campaigns and other efforts to expose and confront liberal bias at the local level.

<li>Paid Advertising. The MRC will be advancing its efforts through a paid advertising campaign. Conservative newspapers, magazines, and radio talk shows will be the vehicle of choice for our paid advertising efforts; again, based on the test-marketing of this communications strategy, we are confident it will have a huge impact.
</ol>
Will the national media try again to tilt the election in favor of Bill Clinton? Will they try again consistently to label the Republicans as &quot;extremists&quot; -- or worse -- and the Democrats as moderates, even conservatives?<br>
Will they regularly denounce Republican ads as &quot;wrong&quot; when they were proven right, while ignoring Clinton ads altogether?<br>
Will they try again to single out the Republicans as mudslinging campaigners while presenting the Democrats as a hopeful force for positive change? If so, the MRC will be there to show America just how distorted the message really is. 
<p>
By no means do we suggest that all reporters in the national press are culpable. Many have distinguished themselves, and continue to distinguish themselves with their dedication to balance and fairness. And that's all we conservative ask. But this year we demand it.

What should every schoolchild know about the history of this land of liberty we call America?  The National History Standards Project, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the U.S. Education Department, attempted to provide an answer to this
question; however, their report, released in late 1994, contains serious omissions and amusing political correctness.  In response, the Family Research Council prepared <I> Let Freedom Ring!, </I>an outline of U.S. history that avoids political fashion and emphasizes real knowledge of America's past.

BADEN</P><P>           THE Montana chapter of Defenders of Wildlife has announced a new program to encourage wolf re-introduction. This is noteworthy because it seeks to do so with the help of ranchers, until now some of the wolves' staunchest  opponents. This approach could hold the key to fostering the recovery of  endangered species nationwide and have implications for the Northwest's debate  over the spotted owl.</P><P>  While the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires species preservation, it does little to address the means of such preservation. The Defenders of Wildlife  program pledges to pay $5000 to any landowner in the Northern Rockies who has wild wolves successfully reproduce on their private land.</P><P>     &quot;Our fondest dream is to give away a lot of money,&quot; says Hank Fischer of Defenders of Wildlife. The wolf program will supplement the ESA and its  mandates, utilizing the power of economic incentives, which until now have  worked against the wolf.</P><P>     There are many reasons why the carrot of economic incentives may be more  effective than the stick of the ESA. It turns opponents of preserving specific  species into proponents by offering to pay for their assistance. Hundreds of  individuals will now seek ways to directly improve wolf habitat instead of being indifferent at best, hostile and destructive at worst. Individuals who are being paid to harbor wolves are unlikely to sue over land-use restrictions. And it is a first step toward recognizing the real economic importance of endangered species.</P><P>     While conservationists argue that species are &quot;priceless,&quot; that does not change the reality and incentives facing those who are most directly affected by recovery efforts. The decision to foster species recovery is ecological, but the impacts are economic and political. Those impacts must be addressed before successful recovery can take place.</P><P>     The prime rule of ecology - that everything in an ecosystem is linked - explains why &quot;indicator species&quot; that measure the quality of habitat (such as the spotted owl) are important. A threat to them indicates the system is awry.</P><P>     Such interdependence is also found in political and economic systems. There, too, it is impossible to do only one thing. We take one action and see unintended consequences as the spontaneous order adjusts. Mandates that seem simple from Washington, D.C., have unexpected consequences when implemented in the West.</P><P>     Under the current system, no federal agency has an incentive to consider  economic efficiency. Once a recovery plan is written, the only incentive for  public and private land managers to follow the plan is the threat of a lawsuit, the stick, if they do not. The Defenders of Wildlife have tried to change that by offering the carrot.</P><P>     Since 1987, the Defenders of Wildlife have run a program that compensated ranchers for cattle killed by wolves. It has paid over $12,000 to 10 Montana ranchers who have lost cattle. However, this program, while reducing the risk to ranchers, gave them little incentive to actually facilitate wolf re-introduction. Indeed, many still believe that the associated hassle is not worth the benefits of wolf re-introduction.</P><P>     Ranchers risk losing control of their property when a wolf pack chooses their land as its territory. The long arm of the federal Endangered Species Act could force them to alter long-established land-use practices if they threatened the viability of a resurgent wolf population. An endangered species takes precedence over private property rights. Not only could ranchers lose control over their property, but they risked their cattle as well. Even if they would be compensated for predator loss, was it worth the hassle?</P><P>       This is the central problem of the Endangered Species Act: It imposes the costs of species survival not widely upon those who like the animals, but narrowly upon those who own the habitat. This is the preservationists version of the NIMBY problem: Many people like wolves, but Not In My Barn Yard. Just as few people wish to live next to a waste incinerator, few ranchers with horses and other livestock want the worries of wolf predation.</P><P>     This is where the Defenders of Wildlife has entered. By pledging to pay ranchers who have wolf dens on their lands, they have changed the entire incentive structure. Now if a rancher has habitat that attracts a pack of wolves, he has incentives to encourage their success. Instead of seeking to hide the wolves presence - &quot;shoot, shovel and shut-up&quot; - he would inform scientists and wildlife officials so that he might be compensated. Instead of discouraging continued habitation through various, possibly illegal, means, he might choose to improve habitat to ensure future payments. More could be spent studying growing populations and less spent turning ecologists into law-enforcement officers.</P><P>     No longer will those who have the most reason to oppose wolves be charged  with their upkeep. The costs would be spread among those who most strongly  desire healthy wolf populations. It is likely that this will result in more rapid population expansion, to the benefit of both those who love wolves and those who harbor them.</P><P>     The issue of wolves in Montana can teach us much about our own debates over the spotted owl. The Defenders of Wildlife have shown us how the right incentives can change landowners from victims to supporters of endangered species.</P><IMG SRC="/free/Images/wolf.gif" WIDTH=358 HEIGHT=263><P>__________________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>I'VE sent my check to the Salvation Army for the relief of California's earthquake victims (Salvation Army, Earthquake Fund, 615 Slaters Lane, P.O. Box 269, Alexandria, VA 22313). People are in genuine distress and there is clearly a need for outside help. But I've also written letters to my congressional representatives, urging them to not provide federal aid for long-term relief. This is because I firmly believe long-term federal aid does more harm than good.</P><P>       In the last century, when we were much poorer and more vulnerable, efforts to dispense federal disaster aid met fierce resistance. For example, the Texas Seed Bill of 1887, a measure to distribute $10,000 to help farmers in drought-stricken Texas, was vetoed by President Grover Cleveland. Why veto so small a sum for so good a cause? Cleveland justified his action stating: &quot;A prevalent tendency to disregard the (government's) limited mission  . . . should be steadfastly resisted to (enforce the lesson) that, though the people support the Government, the Government should not support the people.&quot; Cleveland was being compassionate, not cruel, and his advice remains sound today. He understood the slippery slope of political aid.</P><P>     Providing voluntary aid to one's fellow citizens is admirable, and emergency federal assistance (e.g., tents, food and water, and National Guard troops) for areas struck by major natural disasters is justified. Such aid serves a humanitarian purpose in the immediate aftermath of a crisis. It is cruel to apply narrowly economic criteria during this period. But it is vital that economic incentives play a major role during the recovery. Long-term federal aid that reduces the costs of rebuilding or repairing homes and other property is a subsidy. Like most subsidies, it distorts useful economic incentives and has perverse consequences.</P><P>     The problem is twofold. First, when people do not bear the consequences of their actions they are encouraged to build and live in places prone to disasters, e.g., flood plains and earthquake zones. Second, the availability of federal aid encourages officials to grant disaster aid to areas that lack genuine need. We have seen raids on the Treasury grow ever larger as people come to expect federal bailouts.</P><P>     The first problem is easy to understand. It is an example of what economists call &quot;moral hazard.&quot; When people are not responsible for the full costs of their actions, they behave in riskier (i.e., potentially more costly) ways. Thus, rental cars are often abused because the people who rent them never directly pay for the wear and tear they inflict on transmissions or brakes. Very similar are people who build on earthquake faults, flood plains or barrier islands if they receive insurance that subsidizes the cost of repairing damaged homes, cars and so forth. They take fewer precautions, precautions that may extend to not living, or building expensive structures, in disaster-prone locations.</P><P>     The moral question to ask is not whether people who are suffering should be helped, but what incentives are we creating for future behavior? If the government encourages unsafe construction practices and locations via subsidies, the human and material costs of disasters will only grow larger than otherwise. This includes significant environmental costs because many disaster-prone locations have substantial biological or aesthetic value. In effect, by helping victims now, we create many more victims, human and ecological, later.</P><P>     The second consideration is equally important. It may have been President Cleveland's main concern. As long as federal disaster subsidies remain, politicians will have significant incentives to acquire those monies, even if they have not suffered anything remotely approximating a disaster. The prospect of receiving federal aid may have prompted Montana's governor to declare a state of emergency following the eruption of Mount St. Helens (May 18, 1980), even though the post-eruption situation in Montana was far from disastrous.</P><P>     When aid is available, opportunism can color decisions. President Clinton had incentives to move quickly to disburse emergency aid in part because of California's importance to his re-election and to the 1994 congressional races. Making federal aid available during real disasters generates pleas for such aid when more local and perhaps private efforts would suffice. Eventually, disaster aid disproportionately goes to the politically shrewd or powerful. Moreover, the generosity of federal aid programs rachets upward while non-federal matching proportions slide.</P><P>     Even when raw political considerations are not paramount, the question remains: Where do we draw the line? When do disasters merit federal subsidies? Clear distinctions are impossible and the mindset &quot;they got theirs and I should get mine&quot; dominates since relative need or merit cannot be exactly determined.</P><P>     Direct federal costs grow, politicians feed on federal monies, and worst of all, the impulse toward private giving is eroded. The loss of such civic virtue is of vital concern, but is exceedingly difficult to measure. Its presence builds bonds of fellowship among Americans.</P><P>     We should feel compassion for the quake victims. But let us not pursue policies that foster worse situations in the future. It is tempting to open the federal purse. But we should do so with great reluctance, realizing that some consequences are quite negative. President Cleveland got it right: the government should not support the people. It is indeed a slippery slope.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School. Tim O'Brien contributed to this report.</P><P>Correction: In my Jan. 12 column, I incorrectly state the National Park Service was established in 1906. It was set up in 1916.</P><!--FOOT--><HR>

BADEN</P><P>           MANY recreationalists bristle at the prospect of recreation fees on our national forests. Why should we pay to hike on &quot;our&quot; land? They are outraged, however, when they encounter clear-cuts near timberline on these same lands. But if they could choose between recreation fees and timber cutting, might fees then be accepted as the lesser of two evils?</P><P>        The reason for clear-cuts is, as you might expect, money. The Forest Service budget increases with every timber sale. Specifically, with every board-foot that it sells, the Forest Service generates income from Congress and lumber companies. The more it sells, the bigger its budget. Recreation and aesthetic interests, however, return few dollars to the Forest Service budget. How can they compete with timber when decisions are made by budget-maximizing managers?</P><P>       Congress' answer has been the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. It states that Forest Service management should give equal weight to &quot;outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes.&quot; In practice, it means that creative Forest Service planners suddenly discover that recreation and environmental benefits are produced by logging. For example, new roads into pristine wilderness areas improve access while clear-cuts provide increased &quot;edge&quot; habitat for forest animals. Congressional multiple-use mandates are thus trumped by budgetary incentives.</P><P>     So multiple use fails because budgetary pressures for logging and grazing need not compete with revenue from recreation. Recreation fees can level the playing field and guarantee that non-timber values are considered. Revenues from biking, hiking, and camping in the national forests can provide monetary incentives for land managers to consider non-timber values. If they do not consider such values, they will sacrifice income. And as timber shows, income speaks.</P><P>     The Forest Service estimates that the market value of national forest recreation is over $5 billion per year. A more modest estimate by forest economist Randal O'Toole, using a recreation fee average of only $3 per day, is $1 billion per year. Even so, O'Toole estimates that such recreation fees would outweigh timber receipts on 80 percent of the national forests. So recreation can compete. With fees, eight of ten national forests, those ill-suited for commercial timber production, would see little timber cutting. And even on the truly productive forests, cutting would likely be more sensitive as managers sought to maintain some recreation income.</P><P>     Fees would come from day permits and annual passes. Enforcement would occur by making permits visible, either on vehicles or a ski-lift type tag. Similar methods work well with fishing licenses, in national forest campgrounds, and in Washington State Sno-Parks.</P><P>     Equity is a concern. But if the poor were asked which free goods and services they would most like, would hiking and camping make the top ten? When considered relative to outdoor equipment and transportation costs, fees fade to insignificance.</P><P>     But the benefits of such fees would be substantial. Timber cutting on our national forests should occur only when timber values exceed those values lost to logging. Fees would help ensure this result. Much less would be cut, and that which was cut would likely be more sensitive to aesthetic and recreation values. We would also have a rational means for evaluating recreation - timber trade-offs.</P><P>     This would also change the incentives faced by private forest managers. When our national forests give away recreation, private managers cannot compete. But when national forests charge fees, private land may open up to recreation, also for a fee. Private landowners, who currently can only profit from timber sales, would have an alternative source of revenue and increased reasons to act with sensitivity toward the land.</P><P>     Such private sector incentives are important because much private land has non-timber value. Recreation fees encourage landowners to recognize such value and preserve their lands. And by reducing the cut from marginal timber sites on our national forests, we will foster more careful management of private commercial forests, most of which are biologically better suited for timber production.</P><P>     Recreation on public lands is similar to timbering or livestock grazing in that each use affects other opportunities. There is a cost measured in other uses foregone. This &quot;opportunity cost&quot; of using the national forests for recreation is often some foregone logging or grazing. Without recreation fees, it is no contest. Logging and grazing revenues win. With fees, logging will face the opportunity costs of lost recreation income.</P><P>     While the Forest Service has a multiple-use mandate, it faces a dominant-use incentive. True multiple use implies multiple incentives. Recreation fees will help to level the playing field and protect our national forests for the uses we most value.</P><P>_____________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           IN every language the term &quot;bureaucracy&quot; bears a crust of derision.</P><P> This is no accident, for bureaucratic incentives invariably produce problems. Bureaucracies tend to replace the goals that justified their creation with actions that protect their budgets. The good news is that we can harness this fatal propensity in a way that will improve government and reduce its costs. While our plan won't do it all, here is a beginning.</P><P>     President Clinton's appeal for mutual sacrifice in the form of higher taxes and foregone benefits have been well-received. Our new president is an excellent political salesman. And many Americans are sufficiently responsible to be willing to buy the goods. But if special interests undermine success, citizens will feel betrayed.</P><P>     Here is a decision rule for such budget-cutting: Programs that are both economically wasteful and environmentally destructive will be zeroed out. Logging subsidies and most new Bureau of Reclamation water projects fall in this category. But that is not enough. Cuts must go deeper, to the myriad &quot;demonstration&quot; projects and special initiatives that riddle every appropriations bill.</P><P>     In the abstract, cutting spending is appealing. Most people feel that much of their tax bill is wasted by the government. But specific programs that benefit special interests have strong supporters. In contrast, few taxpayers have an incentive to lobby against specific programs; the portion of their tax bill going to any item other than entitlements is quite small. The average citizen has little incentive to become active while the beneficiaries have strong reasons to fight for their programs.</P><P>       This problem is the classic one of &quot;factions&quot; that so concerned Madison and the founders of our nation. The temptation of politicians to concentrate benefits and disperse costs has been the ruin of democracy through the ages. As we became a society based upon transfer payments, government was transformed from an agency of order to an engine of plunder.</P><P>     So in addition to dealing honestly with entitlements, how can we cut major chunks from the federal budget? The accumulated programs that have led to our crisis develop strong and stable constituencies. Such programs are best headed off in their infancy. One way is to create a government agency that draws funding solely from successful attempts to eliminate and pare back both existing and newly proposed government programs; let's consider a predatory bureaucracy.</P><P>     The Bureau of Reclamation proposed rebuilding the Teton Dam, a structure that failed when first filled in 1976. This dam had damaging ecological consequences and the economic costs far outweighed the economic benefits. Yet interests, such as those who expected to benefit from subsidized irrigation, lobbied for it.</P><P>     A predatory agency would marshal its resources against this project, employing ecologists, economists, and local residents who like the river as it is. They would advertise these costs to Congress. If the dam were cut, our predatory bureaucracy would receive 1 percent of the project's estimated costs and the Bureau of Reclamation's operating budget would decrease by the same 1 percent. The predatory bureaucracy would thus thrive only if it were successful at eliminating programs, and the offending department, in this case the Bureau of Reclamation, would be punished not only by losing this project, but by losing an additional portion of its budget.</P><P>     This system would provide incentives for government to police itself against waste and pork barrel projects, both by the predator and the prey, as projects are weeded out in anticipation of attack by the predator agency. Such a department could be established with a single two-year appropriation. After the first two years, it would exist solely upon funds gleaned from cut programs. Its size would vary just as predator numbers follow the size of prey populations.</P><P>     The proposal is not without its drawbacks. I find the creation of another bureaucracy somewhat offensive but this is a problem of political economy, not political theology where sin is well-defined. It is also possible that some worthwhile projects might be killed. But the real question is whether the benefits outweigh the costs. And on this score, it is likely to be quite successful.</P><P>     The fundamental logic behind this proposal is that bureaucracies are driven by their budgets. Just as corporations are driven to seek profits, government agencies seek to maximize their budget. They normally do this by pleasing a special-interest clientele. Our proposal would utilize that insight by creating an agency which, to increase its budget, would cannibalize the unsound proposals of other bureaucracies. In doing so it would foster the public interest rather than special interests.</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>HARVARD University Press recently published a book on risk regulation written by Stephen Breyer, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals, First Circuit. Breyer argued that &quot;the resources available to combat health risks are not limitless.&quot; He is exactly right. We maximize health and environmental quality by investing our money and efforts where the payoffs are highest.</P><P>       It makes good sense to prioritize environmental protection. Unfortunately, good sense is conspicuously absent in current efforts to ban the use of chlorine. Greenpeace calls for a &quot;chlorine-free society.&quot; Support also comes from other environmental organizations. George Coling of the Sierra Club states &quot;. . . the debate is no longer whether to phase out these chemicals, but how&quot; and Tim Eder, of the National Wildlife Federation notes, &quot;When it comes to (these chemicals) you don't make them, produce them, or dispose of them . . . you just get rid of them!&quot; We should be wary of their claims, for they suggest political opportunism, not sound science.</P><P>     Greenpeace and its allies argue that chlorine and all organochlorines (i.e. compounds containing chlorine) threaten wildlife and people. They see an outright ban as the quickest and most effective way to improve environmental quality. Further, they claim that a &quot;chlorine-free society&quot; is achievable at modest economic cost. None of these claims are accurate.</P><P>     Their first mistake is failing to distinguish among chlorinated compounds. A rigorous toxicology analysis composed by CanTox, a group of consultants in toxicology, health and environmental sciences, convincingly argues that the mere presence of chlorine does not render a compound carcinogenic. Assuming a substance is harmful merely because it contains chlorine is akin to assuming water is flammable simply because it contains hydrogen, a highly flammable element. Different compounds with the same elements often have very different properties.</P><P>     Clearly, certain chlorinated substances, such as PCBs, DDT and dioxin, do harm wildlife at sufficiently high concentrations. However, PCBs and DDT were banned years ago and today dioxin emissions are kept to virtually undetectable levels. The point is this: Regulations should target specific substances whose environmental harm has been clearly demonstrated through rigorous scientific studies. The ad hoc reasoning used by Greenpeace and others is no substitute for careful risk analysis.</P><P>     In addition, it's hard to tell if a chemical &quot;causes harm.&quot; Harm varies with the extent of exposure and disappears entirely below certain threshold doses. In the Great Lakes, bald eagles, double-crested cormorants and other predator bird populations rebounded as DDT and PCBs were phased out and emission regulations reduced dioxin concentrations. Moreover, at the concentrations typically found in our environment, no organochlorines seem to cause identifiable human health problems.</P><P>     Industrial uses aside, it is worth remembering that until chlorination became widespread, dirty water was the most serious public health problem, spreading cholera, typhoid fever and dysentery. Contaminated water supplies still kill 25,000 children a day in the Third World. The substitutes Greenpeace favors are more costly and much less effective at maintaining water purity.</P><P>     Will chlorine substitutes be safer than chlorine? No one can be certain. But, we have an enormous amount of practical experience using and controlling chlorine - experience that does not exist for many substitutes and cannot exist for many innovations. Past experience indicates that new risks will appear once the substitutes are used regularly. Thus, Greenpeace presents us with a false choice - the danger of chlorines or the safety of substitutes. Chlorines are not nearly as dangerous as they portray and substitutes are unlikely to be as safe as they claim.</P><P>     A chlorine ban also implies substantial economic costs. For example, pulp and paper manufacturers often use chlorine to bleach wood pulp to create high quality paper. Switching to chlorine-free processes (i.e. &quot;totally chlorine-free bleaching&quot;), would require extensive reconstruction of many mills at a cost of roughly $9.4 billion. The switch would cost an additional $2.4 billion per year because chlorine-free production is a less effective and less well-known method of manufacturing. The cost across all industries of a chlorine-free society, given current technology, would approach $91 billion annually.</P><P>     The EPA has proposed a regulation that &quot;only&quot; eliminates the use of elemental chlorine in pulp and paper manufacture. Chlorine compounds such as chlorine dioxide (ClO) are permitted. This is the mildest response we could expect from an agency where politics often trumps science.</P><P>     Ultimately, the effort to ban chlorine is not a simple struggle between greedy industries and good, public-spirited environmentalists. Alleged defenders of the public interest reap money and power by advocating and enforcing regulations. If successful, they often divert time, money and personnel from genuine and important environmental risks. This is the social cost of crisis entrepreneurship.</P><P>     Industrial chemicals are produced for beneficial public purposes, not for corporate whim. Although we should insist that these chemicals be managed in an environmentally responsible manner, we should also be vigilant toward those who amplify and exploit public concerns and reap private gains. No one has a monopoly on virtue or knowledge.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           WHEN considering the proposed &quot;Ancient Forest Summit&quot; or &quot;Timber Summit&quot; (word choice is significant), we should carefully segregate our hopes from our expectations. Yet I'm hopeful that the summit will increase understanding and improve policy. Here's why.</P><P>       Twenty years ago my colleagues and I at Montana State University advocated market incentives and property rights as environmental tools. Few considered this a viable option. Environmentalists and journalists considered us &quot;the wild bunch of Montana.&quot; We were the academic analogs of gunslingers and cowboys.</P><P>     But today this emphasis on incentives is becoming mainstream. Many environmental leaders who once considered pollution sin against nature (and as such immune from economic analysis) now favor market incentives to control it. However, the concept of private property rights has not gained this acceptance. In fact, property rights are under siege. The April summit could be decisive in this struggle of ideas.</P><P>     Environmental regulations, including the Endangered Species Act, often threaten property rights. They constrain land-use options, reducing income and land value. Few owners are indifferent to this outcome - especially when they are not compensated for their lost opportunities. Here in the Northwest with our high timber values and spotted owl controversies, the situation is especially dramatic.</P><P>     The problem with the spotted owl is primarily one of scale. It is not just a golf course or a shopping mall that is being challenged by an endangered species. If we were to protect the 900 or so owl circles in Washington, 1.5 million acres of land would be restricted from logging. Clearly, owl circles dramatically threaten the property rights of many landowners. This impact is significant. As an estimate, enough lumber to build 3.5 million homes would be withheld.</P><P>     America's founders understood the importance of secure property rights. They saw how people in other times and other lands used the government to transfer wealth. To help preclude this they gave us the Fifth Amendment's clause, &quot;. . .  nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation  . . .&quot; They designed our laws and regulations to encourage productive, rather than predatory, activities.</P><P>     Environmentalists sometimes favor regulations that strip value from property. Taking seems cheaper than buying. It isn't. Actions have unintended consequences. When property rights are threatened, behavior changes. People lose incentives to be good stewards of their land. They have incentives to &quot;cut out and get out.&quot; This process is evident on the timber lands of Western Washington, Oregon and California; people fearing land-use regulations understandably act before they lose opportunities to do so.</P><P>     Friends often tell me, &quot;We can't afford to pay for the environments we must save.&quot; But if voters lack the taste and understanding to pass bonds to buy lands for environmental preservation, are we to impose our tastes and &quot;take&quot; land by regulation? Ethically, can we impose our values upon others, even for a &quot;good&quot; cause? When should individual choice and freedom be sacrificed to environmental ends? The answers are seldom obvious.</P><P>     Some who testify at the summit are likely to justify uncompensated takings with environmental appeals. Before accepting such views, I suggest we consider ecologist Garrett Hardin's question: &quot;And then what?&quot; Much of what follows from threats of takings can be anticipated - e.g., cutting timber before it's &quot;taken&quot; by regulation. The &quot;Shoot, shovel, and shut-up&quot; approach to endangered species is another reaction to these threats of takings.</P><P>     I hope the summit will explain how we can move toward a harmony of environmental protection and private property rights. Secure property rights are essential to liberty, they foster prosperity, and promote environmental health. These values are interdependent.</P><P>     Rather than increase the threat of regulation, environmentalists at the summit should help private landowners realize the ecological values of their lands. Conservation easements, endowment funds for endangered species, and recreation user fees are all based upon property rights. We have a host of mechanisms that allow and encourage individuals to express their environmental concern with economic means. The summit can identify, publicize and promote them.</P><P>     I suggest that while our hopes for the summit are bountiful, our expectations should be spare. Political management has been with us for many years and people are accustomed to it. In the late 1800's, the Progressive Era reformers identified serious problems with America's environment. Unfortunately, their diagnosis of causes was flawed. Their reforms promoted bureaucratic, command-and-control resource management. The results were often disastrous.</P><P>     Nearly a century later a new group of &quot;progressives&quot; is again addressing these problems. We can expect better solutions only if President Clinton and others understand the possibilities and the limits of both property rights and bureaucratic approaches. As we await the summit, please keep your hopes and expectations in separate baskets.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Twice in August we had snow at 6,500 feet. Our ranch is between Bozeman and Big Sky, Mont. Normal rainfall is just under 20 inches per year.</P><P> This year we had 14.5 inches in July. Hay wouldn't cure and the barley is still in the field. &quot;Where is global warming when we need it?&quot; was a common question, repeated over the summer as a series of visitors joined up in the Big Sky country.</P><P>     Despite this, our annual migration back to FREE's summer office was wonderfully rewarding. We worked hard, played hard and got the mix just right. FREE hosted a week-long seminar in environmental economics for academics and another, co-sponsored by the Environmental Management program at UW's Business School, for federal judges.</P><P>     We held several shorter programs for business leaders and environmental writers. A summer highlight was our annual &quot;seminar on wheels,&quot; a 407-mile bike trip from Yellowstone to Glacier national parks. (Economists call our team the FREE riders.) This was a seven-day exercise in stoic epicurism. We twice ground our way up the Continental Divide, Marias and Flesher passes, but as a result could indulge our appetites with impunity. Ah, the leisure of the theory class.</P><P>     Aside from the writers, few of our guests specialize in environmental matters. Most accepted conventional environmental perspectives and were surprised that I do not. &quot;How can you care about environmental quality and yet reject the `green' view?&quot; was a recurrent question, and &quot;Are you optimistic about Gore?&quot; another. Here are my answers.</P><P>     I believe that our vice president exemplifies the new public policy elite. He is sensitive, especially about the environment, ambitious, and confident of his superior knowledge of the way things really ought to be. When he ran for president in the spring of 1987, he saw global warming as a key campaign issue. His book, &quot;Earth in the Balance,&quot; deals with this issue. Gore's treatment of global warming illustrates the process and problems of his brand of environmentalism.</P><P>     &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot; was on the New York Times bestseller list for 22 weeks. Why is this book so attractive to the new policy elite? And why do they ignore arguments that contradict Gore's apocalyptic assertion? Given the recurrent and predictable failures of bureaucratic, command-and-control environmental management, why do Gore and his followers neglect an environmentalism based upon property rights and the market process? Here's my hypothesis.</P><P>     Gore and the new elite specialize in abstract symbols, not material things. They don't get dirty or do heavy lifting. They don't experience the daily reality checks so familiar to most Americans, especially to people who sign payroll checks. The defining characteristics of Gore's peer group include intelligence and a dedication to politics. They seem confident in their ability to know what is good for other people - and quite willing to employ state coercion to enforce its realization. That is how they get things done.</P><P>     Global warming gives them justification to control other people's lives. From their standpoint, global warming is a special kind of environmental issue, for it has a huge political benefit. It gives policy-makers a &quot;legitimate&quot; reason to constrain our liberty to act - e.g., by denying us safe, private vehicles. They want us to believe that the specter of global warming is so severe, the projected consequences so bad, that radical action is necessary. If global warming is both certain and dire, they can justify regulations to prevent this calamity. This is why Gore and others feel compelled to stifle debate and declare the issue decided. As they portray it, global warming gives rulers license to expand their rule.</P><P>     This summer I worked on FREE's upcoming book with the Pacific Research Institute of San Francisco, &quot;Balancing the Earth's Economy and Ecology.&quot; The contributors are a distinguished lot, and they deal with the philosophic and scientific issues of &quot;Earth in the Balance.&quot; Some argue that severe global warming is unlikely. And even if some global warming occurs, some consequences will surely be beneficial. On balance, we can't tell.</P><P>     But whether the subject is global warming or deforestation, environmental problems are complex and highly emotional. Good data and clear thinking are required to deal with them. As Gore says in &quot;Earth in the Balance,&quot; &quot;. . . to exclude inconvenient facts from the calculation of what is good and what is bad is a form of dishonesty&quot; (p. 188). Sensitive and sound environmental understanding is too important for truth to be gored by a collectivist ideology and a quest for governmental control.</P><P>     This is a theme of my Winter Quarter course, &quot;Business and the Environment: the Political Economy of Environmental Policy&quot; (BA 590). Although it's a Business School offering, students from all over the university take it, as do a few townspeople.</P><P>     Some of my lectures become columns. I invite you to follow my Wednesday columns. I welcome your suggestions of topics. The quality of our environment is important enough to merit our most careful and honest consideration.</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>I'M home at the ranch for the holidays, recalling Christmas traditions.</P><P>      Both my family and my wife feed our animals special rations on Christmas morning. My grandmother would bake oatmeal biscuits with lots of meat trimmings for their dog and a warm corn mash for her chickens. Granddad would give the cows and sheep leafy, second-cutting clover and the horses extra oats, even though they wouldn't work that day. My wife, Ramona, and her father would take a toboggan-load of hay to the old buffalo bulls on the Targhee National Forest.</P><P>     The ewes on our Montana ranch, bred to lamb in March, were on maintenance rations: 7 bales of hay for each 100 ewes. As they became heavy with lambs, we fed more and more of ever more nutritious feed. Yet, on Christmas, we'd give them a treat and a preview of good food to come: second-cutting alfalfa and some soybean cake.</P><P>     In financial terms this made no sense, but the sheep loved it and we felt warm. We depended on our animals and they on us. Each Christmas we'd give them more than good husbandry.</P><P>     Urban people can't easily celebrate Christmas by pampering livestock. However, they can still do a good deed for animals, predators and, later, those lower on the food chain, by restoring balance to the system. My proposal even fits with the new mood in Washington, D.C. Here it is.</P><P>     After writing your holiday letters to friends and loved ones, write another to your senators and member of Congress asking them to cut off the federal Animal Damage Control (ADC) program.</P><P>     The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The ADC's program is quite broad. It helps protect corn and sunflowers from blackbirds, airplanes from hawks, geese, and owls, and pasture land from prairie dogs. However, the ADC's largest single mission is livestock protection (or predator control) in Western states. With overhead, its livestock protection costs run $13 million a year.</P><P>     Many of us find the ADC's predator-control program offensive. Not only has ADC exterminated wolves, bears, and mountain lions in many of the contiguous 48 states, it employs barbaric methods. Many people find cyanide poisoning, steel leg traps and aerial hunts offensive. We carried rifles to protect stock from rogue animals, but ADC is indiscriminate, killing problem animals and innocents alike.</P><P>     Even people indifferent to animal welfare should question the value of the ADC. ADC efforts are allocated politically. A series of National Academy of Sciences reports consistently indicate these efforts don't significantly reduce livestock predation. This is again documented by Randal O'Toole in his magazine, Different Drummer.</P><P>     It shouldn't be so expensive to kill animals, but federal laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act all constrain ADC's effectiveness. These laws divert time and money from predator control to environmental-impact reports. We again find the government doing inefficiently something it shouldn't be doing at all.</P><P>     Congress' desire to use predator control as a re-election tool means that funds are politically targeted to favored congressional districts not, for example, spent on non-lethal research. Congress targeted $2.1 million to protect North Dakota sunflowers from blackbirds and $248,000 to protect maple trees from squirrels during 1987-1994. These funds overwhelmingly went to states with congressional representatives on the agricultural subcommittees of the appropriations committees. Nearly 40 percent of the ADC's federal funds accrue to the 27,000 ranchers who graze livestock on public lands. The average subsidy is $550 per year, and far more for those ranchers who have permits for cheap grazing on federal rangelands.</P><P>     Concentrating the ADC's benefits on politically connected people makes little economic sense. Losses to predators or other wildlife are a cost of doing business. We lowered coyote, bear and mountain lion predation by placing guard dogs with our sheep. This was expensive and time intensive but ultimately a good investment.</P><P>     The mere existence of the ADC encourages ranchers and farmers to take fewer private precautions against predator losses. Subsidies short-circuit market signals telling us which areas are best suited for range stock operations. A bounty for coyote pelts - paid by stock growers associations, not by taxpayers who object to the practices - would be significantly cheaper and surely more ethical. Should a committed vegetarian be forced to subsidize this killing?</P><P>       Subsidizing the destruction of animals is offensive on ecological, ethical and economic grounds. It is past time to put ADC away. Do something nice for animals this holiday season by writing Washington, D.C. And be sure to copy Newt.</P><P>_______</P><P> John A.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>8. What is FRC's stand on divorce reform?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes there needs to be revisions in public policy that
would increase the commitment of society to the institution of
marriage, the protection of children and justice for innocent
parties.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Reform of the current no-fault divorce
laws in every state by establishing fault for grounds and dissolution
where there is no mutual consent.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The current situation began in
1969 when California passed the first &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce
law.  Intended to remove animosity during divorce, reduce perjury
and collusion, establish standards for alimony and property awards
and give relief to marital conflict, no-fault laws passed in 45
states in the next five years.  By 1985, all 50 states had passed
laws establishing no-fault divorce.

<p>

What have been the results of such a significant shift in the
way that we view the marriage contract?  We have shifted from
a culture of marriage to a culture of divorce.  Divorce rates
have surged 34 percent from 1970 to 1990.  It is estimated that
one half of all new marriages will end in divorce.  The United
States is the divorce leader of the industrialized world.  What
are we communicating when it is easier to divorce your wife of
25 years that it is to let go that employee you hired two weeks
ago?

<p>

More specifically, no-fault divorce has had a detrimental affect
on the innocent parties involved, especially the children.  No-fault
divorce reduces the protection and negotiating rights of the spouse
who wants to maintain the marriage.  Divorced women experience
a 30 percent drop in income the first year after a divorce.  Three
out of four teen suicides are committed by children from broken
homes.  Children of divorce are also 70 percent more likely to
have been expelled or suspended from school, and are twice as
likely to drop out of school.  Of juveniles and young adults serving
time in long-term correctional facilities, 70 percent came from
broken homes.

<p>

No-fault divorce has not only added to societal problems, but
it has not remotely addressed the problems it originally set out
to solve.  Animosity during divorce has simply shifted to animosity
during the settlement.  Fights over custody and support are more
prevalent today and just as humiliating as those over grounds.
In the overwhelming majority of cases before the adoption of
no-fault grounds, there was no litigation at all, let alone hostile
litigation.  Perjury and collusion have also just shifted from
the grounds arena to the collateral arenas of custody and visitation.

<p>

Dr. Allen Parkman has summed it up this way:  &quot;Seldom in
U.S. history have laws been enacted with higher hopes and poorer
results than the no-fault divorce statutes.&quot;  Not surprisingly,
in a recent FRC survey, by a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent,
Americans said that they favor divorce reform to strengthen the
rights of spouses who want to save their marriage.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Divorce reform will strengthen our families and
society by increasing the incentive for spouses to invest in their
marriage.  It will offer justice for those who are unwilling parties
of divorce, especially for any children involved.

Their perspective can help us develop environmental reforms that are both sensitive and practical.</P><P>     I believe that Hayek's classic 1945 article from the American Economic Review, &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot; is the best introduction to economics ever written.</P><P>     Hayek shows us how economies are like ecosystems. They are interdependent, complex, and must constantly adjust. When we read this article, we can better understand why there are such huge conflicts between bureaucracies, which drive toward uniformity, and ecosystems, where knowledge of local circumstances is critically important.</P><P>     Planning fails because the information needed to create products and coordinate human activity is widely scattered. Central planners, like everyone else, can obtain only a tiny fraction of this knowledge, and are thereby precluded from serving people's economic desires and fostering innovation.</P><P>     Hayek's simple, yet tremendously powerful and far-reaching insight has grown in importance over time. Economies, like ecosystems, cannot be designed. No one can run them. Both evolve and prosper to the extent that their inhabitants remain in sync with the laws of nature.</P><P>     A capitalist ecosystem is populated by organizations and industries rather than organisms and species.</P><P>     Economic life evolves by technological innovation and market competition much as biological life evolves by genetic mutation and natural selection. Both involve intricate webs of innumerable participants, each pursuing his own interests, but linked into a whole greater than the sum of the parts.</P><P>     Hayek's legacy is powerful because his insights are timeless; they speak to all ages and cultures. But equally important, they have been vindicated by experience. As he warned in &quot;The Road to Serfdom,&quot; socialism has failed everywhere it was tried at the national level, creating police state nightmares from Utopian dreams and economic chaos from &quot;rational planning.&quot;</P><P>       One of socialism's many victims was environmental quality. Throughout the former U.S.S.R. the legacy of bureaucracies' single-minded focus on industrialization and production is starkly evident.</P><P>     For example, at Russia's Magnitogorsk, site of the world's biggest steel complex, 90 percent of the children born in the city suffered from pollution-related illnesses. Feshbach and Friendly, authors of &quot;Ecocide in the U.S.S.R.,&quot; state that in 1992, &quot;there are no major industrial cities in the Soviet Union where air pollution is not shortening the life expectancy of adults and undermining the health of their children.&quot;</P><P>       Aside from a few professors insulated from reality, Americans realize that communism and socialism are corrupting and economically bankrupt systems. Less clear, but just as pernicious, are the consequences of our experiments in sylvan socialism, begun with the creation of the U.S. Forest Service in 1897.</P><P>     The Forest Service was the prototype for much of environmental management. Our most recent major creation, the EPA, relies on the same assumptions with tragic consequences. For example, a joint EPA-Amoco Corporation study of Amoco's Yorktown refinery found that EPA-mandated pollution controls were three times more costly than necessary. By making environmental protection more expensive, the EPA reduces the amount of protection people demand and can afford.</P><P>     As we prepare to celebrate the centennial of the Forest Service, it is incumbent on us to consider the deficiencies of the socialist model. Hayek contributes to our understanding. By following his principles we can create policies that harmonize ecological and economic values.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

<h2>Institute to hold grand opening gala for national training headquarters</h2>
<I>Supporters invited to join festivities at Steven P. J. Wood Building</I>
</center> 
<P>
<Br>
	<B>BY DAVID J. LINTON</B>
<P>
<DD>	ARLINGTON, VA, July 4  While Independence Day fireworks lit the Washington Monument in bursts of patriotic colors, Leadership Institute staff, interns and friends celebrated and watched from the Jefts Beede Roof Terrace of the new national training headquarters.<BR>  
<DD>	It was the first event in the Institute's new Steven P. J. Wood Building.  And a foretaste of the grand celebration planned for the building's official opening on September 18.<BR>  
<DD>	Megan Lott, a coordinator of the opening event, said, "Although there aren't any fireworks planned for the grand opening, it will certainly have plenty of spark.
<P>
<DD>"It's a time to celebrate the success and growth of the Institute, made possible by <DD>so many generous donors around the world, and to lay the foundation for further <DD>growth," Lott said.
<P>
	Institute president Morton Blackwell said, "Far-seeing donors have made the Institute's past successes possible and will secure its future.   Naturally, I want to show them first hand what their labor has built."
<P> 
<H3>Training headquarters equips conservatives</H3>
<DD>	The new national training headquarters hastens the day when conservative principles of limited government, free market economics, strong national defense and traditional values triumpheven in Washington.
<DD>	The new building enables the Leadership Institute to improve and expand its current programs and train more conservatives.  
<DD>	The building is much more accessible to students and faculty, since it's closer to Washington and only 100 yards from a subway station.  There's even a dorm for out-of-town students.  
<DD>	When classes in the F. M. Kirby National Training Center end each day, students can do their homework in the Elizabeth J. Fitzgerald Study Room or discuss issues in the Norma E. Zimdahl Student Lounge.   
<DD>	The new facility is much more cost-effective and efficient.  The Institute won't have to rent facilities around the city but instead will receive rent from commercial tenants.  
<DD>	More resources will go directly for training.  And Institute staff won't waste time lugging equipment and supplies around Washington.
<P>
<H3>Political technology goes high tech</H3>
<DD>	The new building will provide state-of-the- art computer systems, catapulting the Institute into the 21st century.  
<DD>	For example, each staffer and intern will receive access to a high-speed, shielded computer network.  Each employee will have electronic mail, an internet connection and the ability to search libraries and databases around the world.   
Improved computer technology will enable the Institute to better teach political technology.
<DD>	However, none of these exciting developments would be possible without the generous support of donors, whose gifts continue to allow the Leadership Institute to train young conservatives  to win the battle for our country's future.
<P>
<H3>Donors invited to September grand opening</H3>
<DD>	That's why Morton invites donors to join the celebration of the building's completion at the September 18 grand opening.  
<DD>	Supporters will join the ribbon-cutting ceremony; tour the facilities and meet staff, graduates, faculty and fellow donors.   
<DD>	They'll see first-hand how the building allows the Institute to train more conservatives to effectively fight for the principles of their forefathers.
<DD>	Supporters will have the chance to meet congressional advisory board members and attend a seminar by a national expert on how to maximize personal tax advantages through planned giving. 
<P>
	<I>There will be lots of food and loads of fun.  So come if you can this September 18.</I>
<P>

<DD>	The Institute has arranged special airline and hotel rates.  And the designated hotel will have regular buses that shuttle back and forth between it and the building.  
<DD>	To make travel arrangements at the special rates, please contact Omega Travel at (703)998-2990 or (800)756-6342 as soon as possible. 
<DD>	For more information about the building or how you can attend the dedication, please contact <B>Megan Lott</B> at <B>1-800-827-5323 or 1-703-247-2000.</B>

<title>10 Basic Resume Tips  - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">


<CENTER>

<h3>10 BASIC RESUME TIPS</h3></CENTER>

<p>
<b>PURPOSE OF THE RESUME</b><blockquote>
	The purpose of the resume is not to get you a job, but to get you an interview. The 
	resume is the first stage of initial employer/employee contact.</blockquote>

<b>THE LENGTH OF THE RESUME</b><blockquote>
	A resume (particularly in Washington, D.C.) should be one page. If your resume is more than one page, shrink it.  A resume is not a comprehensive, detailed history of your life and career- that is a curriculum vitae typically used in academia, the legal profession and other fields.  A resume should be a summary of your skills and experience.  It should be user friendly- easy and quick to read. .</blockquote>


<b>PAPER COLOR</b><blockquote>
	White or Ivory colored paper is recommended.  It is important to avoid bright neon colors 
	or any colors that appear loud and unprofessional.  It is not the color of the resume that 
	makes a candidate stand out, it is the clarity of his/her resume. .</blockquote>


<b>PROOFREADING</b><blockquote>
	It is important to have three different people proofread your resume for mistakes. The 
	most common mistakes are spelling errors, inconsistency, and gaps in dates.  Ask current 
	or past employers, your colleagues, and your mother or father to critique it for the 
	common errors.	.</blockquote>


<b>RESUME STYLE</b><blockquote>
	In Washington, D.C., it is important to list your resume with experience first.  This is the 
	first item people will look for.  Education and skills should follow.
	 For job seekers right out of school- it is perfectly acceptable to list your education first 
	since experience may be limited. Experience and skills should follow.  
	It is also important to list internships.  This will help recent graduates show some 
	experience and familiarity with the business world.  
	Make sure your resume is written using one or two clear fonts of a reasonable size ( 8 
	point is too small, 16 point is too large). .</blockquote>


<b>SHOW DATES AND LOCATIONS</b><blockquote>
	It is important to list dates and locations for any held jobs, internships, etc. Make sure that 
	dates showing large gaps or overlap are justified. .</blockquote>


<b>AVOID LONG SENTENCES AND LARGE BLOCKS OF TYPE</b><blockquote>
	At first glance, your resume will be scanned and not read.  Make your resume easy to 
	understand, avoid acronyms and lingo. You do not want someone to have to sit and 
	think about what your are trying to convey. .</blockquote>



<b>TAILOR YOUR RESUME</b><blockquote>
	It is fine to tailor your resume so that it emphasizes your skills concerning a particular 
	job. For example, if your are seeking a political job, you should put all relevant political 
	experience (College Republicans or College Democrats, any campaign experience).  If it is 
	a job in the business world, list all retail, sales, administrative, and part-time work 
	experience. .</blockquote>


<b>LOCAL ADDRESS</b><blockquote>
	It is very important to have a local address for D.C.-area employees.  If you do not have 
	one, try to list a friend's or relative's address in the area who can easily reach you or relay 
	a message in a timely fashion.  Typically, employers are looking to fill a position within a 
	month and need to start the interview process immediately.  It is also important to list your 
	e-mail address if you have one. .</blockquote>


<b>WHAT TO LEAVE OFF</b><blockquote>
	   For an entry-level position, do not put an "objective" section on your resume. This will 
	immediately limit your employment opportunities. 	
	  Unless you are right out of school, it is not customary to put your high school on your 
	resume. 
	   Also, there is no need to put "References available upon request" on your resume.  	    
	It is understood that you will furnish references when asked. .</blockquote>

FRC's staff of public policy experts -- and extramural family experts recommended by FRC -- are frequently called to testify before Congressional committees debating pending legislation or seeking guidance on vital family issues.  FRC also routinely submits unsolicited testimony to House and Senate Committees open to informed public opinion.  Topics range from the mundane and technical to the speculative and controversial.  Congressional testimony represents one of FRC's prime educational functions as a nonprofit organization located in the nation's capital.

The author gratefully acknowledges the assistance and collaboration of Marc Wheat, a good friend and fellow Illinoisan, without whom this handbook would probably still be an outline. Marcs assistance to young conservative activists seeking public policy employment is given unselfishly to all who ask for it.
<P>
	Much credit goes to The Honorable Morton C. Blackwell, President of the <a href="/lead-inst/home.html">Leadership Institute,</a> whose article, Staffing the Conservative Movement [ Conservative Digest, April 1979], inspired this booklet.  Morton taught me and many others the importance of his rule: Go out of you way to help other conservatives.
<P>
	Thanks also goes to Ed Frankenberg and Dave Mason of <A HREF="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</A>, who are the  forces behind Washington Conservative Placement Network, the publishers of this handbook.
<P>
	Finally, personal gratitude is extended to the people who helped me learn first hand, through my own job searches, the information I have shared in this handbook:  Larry Herbolshelmer, Joe Duggan, Walt Longyear, David Barron, the late Lee Atwater, Helen Sanders, Dennis Kilcoyne, David Miner, Jim Lamb, Dave ONeal, Sandy Butler, Richard Viguerie, and many others.
<P>
	This handbook is affectionately dedicated to every young conservative job seeker who finds something useful here. Re-inventing the wheel can be fun, but I hope this booklet will help you some of the trouble.  Good luck!

<P>
		If youre coming to Washington to look for a job, dont be worried that you dont have high-level contacts at the White House or on Capitol Hill.  If youre a movement conservative who has fought the good fight on campus or in your community, you will find there are many people in Washington who will help you get your first job here.  You just need to ask them to help you.
<P>
	However, there are a number of things you can and should do before you come to town that will help speed things along.
<P>
	First, write and print out your resume at home (about 100 copies should be plenty).  A high-quality resume is important to making the right impression --  more about this in Section IV.
<P>
	Next, phone and write all conservative Job Banks through The Washington Conservative Placement Network (WCPN).  See the Appendix for a complete list.  The can hold you get all the proper forms you will need to complete.  Try to have these finished and mailed back at least two weeks before you come to Washington.
	If you already know of any prospective employers for whom youd like to work, contact them as well. Send them your resume.  In your letter, give them the date when youll be in town, and tell them youll call their office on a specific date to set up an appointment. Then call everyone you contacted, to set up appointments for the first week youll be in Washington.  Confirm all appointments with a written thank you letter on the same day the appointment is made. The more times a perspective employer sees your name cross his desk, the better your prospects will be.  More on this in Section V.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><A NAME="where"><FONT SIZE = "+2">W</FONT>here to <FONT SIZE = "+2">L</FONT>ive</H3></A></CENTER>
<P>
	Okay, so we would all like to live in a fashionable townhouse on Capitol Hill.  Put this idea out of your mind right now!  The job-seekers life is not a glamorous one-- you may have to sleep in a sleeping bag on the floor for a month or so.  Many job-seekers are lucky enough to have friends or relatives who already live in the Washington area. If you can stay with someone free of charge, you should do so--for as long as their hospitality will allow.
<P>
	For those who are blazing their own trail, there is another option.  Almost all the colleges in Washington rent rooms in their dormitories, during the summer only.  You should contact each of the universities before you leave home to compare rates and access to Metro and other amenities. (Q friendly hint: you may want to ask about air conditioning--not all of the dorms have it.)

You may also want to check the bulletin boards near the cafeterias and carry outs in the House of Representatives and Senate office buildings.  Ask the security guards or stop any staffer for directions.  Hill staffers often advertise sub-lets, even for short periods mostly during the summer, which are very affordable.  Delis and carry-outs in the Capitol Hill neighborhood often have similar listings on their bulletin boards..  And you may want to check the Housings to Share listings in the Washington Post Classified Section.
<P>
	Finally, local churches sometimes have listings for people seeking roommates and sub-lets.  Phone numbers are available through Directory Assistance for area codes 202(Washington D.C.), 703(Virginia),and 301(Maryland).  Many Universities have Washington D.C. phone books in their libraries.

<P>
	You will find that the availability of jobs and the competition you face in getting these jobs varies widely with the season.   While jobs are available in Washington year round, the period of greatest movement in the public policy job market tends to be focused around three main times of year.
<P>
	Summer:  This is perhaps the most difficult time to find a permanent job.  One drawback to job-hunting in the summer is that many entry-level positions go unfilled because summer interns are doing the work at very little cost to the employer.  But, with lots of internships available, you can easily get one and use it as a great platform from which to look for and secure a permanent position when the interns leave.  Internships can also help you expand your network (more on this in section V).  An internship also can help you build your credentials and references for a permanent position(this is especially important for the person who is coming to Washington for the first time with very little experience in a public policy position).
<P>
	January:  This is when most December college graduates and people taking the Spring Semester off from school will be in town looking for jobs and internships.
<P>
	This time of year is usually very slow in Washington because of the holidays.  For that reason, it is most difficult at this time of year to simply show up in town with you resume and find a job.  Thats why its important that you lay the groundwork for you job search before you come to Washington, and have plenty of interviews set up and confirmed in advance.  Remember that this time of year is especially hard for the first time job-seeker just after a national election.  Thats because campaign workers and hill staffers are changing jobs.
<P>	
	September:  August college graduates and student seeking Fall internships will be your main competition for entry-level jobs at this time of year.  One of the good thing about job-hunting in Washington at this time of year is that its a very busy time, theres much work to be done, and there isnt the usual glut of free interns to fill the entry-level positions.

<P>	
	It is not the purpose of this handbook to teach you how to prepare a resume.  Hopefully, you have been instructed how to do this by your schools placement office.  If not, many fine books on this topic are available at your library.  However, as your resume relates to your ultimate success in finding a job in Washington, D.C., a few points are worth mentioning.
	Prepare you resume and have it printed in advance to coming to Washington.  Have it typeset and proofread it carefully  -- you must make a professional impression!  Keep it to one page.
	Highlight your grassroots political experience, even if its volunteer work, as this is the best way to demonstrate your conservative movement credentials.  Also highlight positions of responsibility you have held, including supervising other employees,  handling cash, etc., even if these positions are not in the public policy field.
<P>	
	Have a separate list of references, which includes addresses and phone numbers, which you can give to prospective employers if they request it.  Most employers will call your references, so clear this in advance with anyone you list.  Former supervisors are the best references.
<P>	
	Have a writing sample ready to give out at an interview.  Academic papers you wrote for college classes may look impressive, but they are usually not the best writing samples.  Use something you wrote which advocates a conservative position on a public policy issue, like a letter-to-the-editor, an op-ed piece, or an article for your school newspaper or a conservative publication.

	This is the most important, most valuable section of this handbook.
<P>	
	Start by contacting all the conservative job banks.  You can use The Washington Conservative Placement Network to help you do this.  From there all you have to do is follow the bouncing ball and take the steps listed below in order.
	<UL>	
	1) Contact every prospective employer you learn about from the job banks or any other source and ask them for an interview to discuss your job search even if they say no position is available.<P>
	2)  At the conclusion of every interview, ask for the names and phone numbers of one to three other prospective employers you can contact as part of your job search.. Most of the people you meet with will be happy to make this referral.
	</UL>
<P>
	You should make a NETWORK CHART which shows the personal relationship between the contacts you develop.  This will not only chart your progress, but it will remind you to check back with your primary sources from time-to-time to see if theyve heard of any new openings.  In addition, your chart can remind you of which contacts may be helpful in trying to persuade a prospective employer to hire you.
<P>	
	You should also keep a set of note cards, or a Rolodex, which lists each contact you develop.  Make a careful note each time you speak to someone in your network.  This will help you remember what you discussed, referrals which were made, and action you should take in your job search.
	<UL>
	3)  Call all the people to whom you are referred and ask for an interview.  One way to get your foot in the door is to say, I was referred to you by.. -- however, be careful not to imply that they are recommending you for a particular position.  Rather, use the referral to let the person know youre not calling out of the blue, but  that  you were sent to them by a fellow conservative.  A referral is five times more valuable than a cold call.
	<P>
	4)  Prepare for each interview as if it is a job interview, even if your contact has told you no position is available.  Be sure to ask the new prospect for job referrals and continue to thus build your network exponentially.
	<P>
	5)  Send a typed thank you letter to each person who meets with you.  Send it on the day of the interview, and for hot job prospects, include another copy of your resume with your thank you letter.  Its good to include specific thanks for the referrals they gave you by name to again remind them of the contacts they gave you.
	<P>
	6) Attend conservative events where prospective employers and others who may become part of your network are gathered.  The most useful meetings for the conservative job seeker are listed here.  Call the numbers given below for more information.

<P>	
	Budget carefully and be prepared for the fact that Washington, D.C., is a very expensive town to live in. Take a temporary job, if necessary, to earn money until you secure a full-time position.  Ideally, it should be something related to public policy and the conservative movement, but, as Morton Blackwell of the Leadership Institute likes to say, You cant save the world if you cant pay the rent.  Dont go bankrupt in pursuit of the perfect job.
<P>	
	You can take an unpaid public policy internship during the day to build your network and credentials, but work a part-time job at night, even if its non-political, to earn extra money.  For example, you can open mail and make xerox copies for a conservative Congressman for free by day, and work at a conservative phone bank operation for $6.00 an hour at night.  Many people have done exactly this.
<P>	
	Keep enough money in reserve to return home if things dont work out.  Some people keep a bought and paid for plane, train, or bus ticket in reserve to return home if needed, which can be cashed in if you decide to stay.  But by all means, make provisions to get yourself back home.

	In all likelihood, you will not find a job overnight.  You will almost certainly spend several weeks working the phone, pounding the pavement, and flogging your resume.
<P>	Dont become discouraged, many others have followed this route including the author and (almost) all  his friends.  We havent lost anybody yet.
<P>	
	Nothing can take the place of persistence in a successful job search.
<P>	
	You can make a difference.  You can have an effect on public policy.  You can advance the conservative philosophy you believe in.  Just keep trying, keep smiling, and keep you chin up!

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>5. What does FRC think about China having &quot;most 
favored nation&quot; trade status?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the United States should take a strong stand
against China's human rights violations and revoke their &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Revoke &quot;most favored nation&quot;
trade status for China.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> China's atrocious record on human
rights is indisputable.  Its blatant disregard for the sanctity
of human life has led to such abuses as the massacre of democracy-seekers
at Tiananmen Square, the exploitation of prisoners as slave laborers,
women being forcibly aborted or sterilized, female infanticide,
and the systematic intimidation, torture, and imprisonment of
Christians.

<p>

For the last 15 years, the United States has extended &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status to China.  Some have argued
that, by opening up our economic doors to China, the United States
will wield greater influence in reversing China's horrific human
rights record.  However, in the last 15 years, not even one of
these human rights abuses has been halted or abated.  Indeed,
China's human rights abuses have only worsened over that time,
and the Chinese government has grown more stubborn in its control-by-force
and intimidation tactics.

<p>

In addition to the myriad human rights abuses which alone should
disqualify China from receiving MFN status, in the last year alone
China has also threatened war with Taiwan, risking a military
confrontation with the United States; sold missiles and nuclear
technology to rogue nations (some of whom fund terrorists); and
balked at talks with the U.S. and South Korea.  Furthermore, because
the United States is currently running a $33.8 billion trade deficit
with China, there is reason to believe that revoking China's MFN
status may help to make an impact on China's leaders.

<p>

The Clinton administration has recently signaled that it will
extend MFN to China again this year.  Since the president will
not stand up to China, it will be up to Congress to pass legislation 
with a two-thirds majority in both Houses to overturn the president's 
decision by the end of August.  The oppressive nature of this Chinese 
government regime is well-known.  If the United States has not succeeded
in using the &quot;carrot&quot; of economic markets to encourage
China to meet a humane standard, then the &quot;stick&quot; should
be the revoking of China's trade privileges.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Revoking China's MFN trade status is a modest,
but significant step that the United States must take in order
to demonstrate tangibly that it will not tolerate the large-scale
human rights abuses taking place in China.

<title>Don Devine "PREPARING FOR THE TRAIN WRECK" -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<h2>Preparing For The Train Wreck</h2>
<a href="/townhall/ACU/devine.html">Don Devine</a><br>
The Washington Times -- August 20, 1995
<hr>
</center>
<p>
All Washington is talking about the Fall "train wreck," when
government borrowing authority ends, and the Republican Congress
refuses to pay the bills unless their spending cuts and tax
decreases survive the President's veto. Readers of this space over
the past few months already know that President Bill Clinton has
long been playing the shrewder traffic-management game.
<p>
Top GOP engineer Newt Gingrich now concedes that two key
Contract With America priorities are dead for the year--the line
item veto for the president, and product-liability reforms to limit
the litigation explosion. Of the 21 Contract promises, only three
have become law and most others are in trouble or worse. Senate
Leader Bob Dole, too, has been forced to delay regulatory reform
after three attempts to force moderate Republicans into line. Each
of the 13 appropriations bills has tripped upon major fissures
between moderates and conservatives which, in turn, is exploited by
President Clinton saying this or that is "unfair."
<p>
On most bills, the GOP itself was enough to drive the 1994
revolution off track. Six hundred million additional dollars were
added to House housing appropriations, and a modest loosening of
environmental regulations survived only by a tie vote. The Senate
committee voted to add $815 million more. The House refused to cut
$1.6 billion from the space station. The WIC nutrition program was
increased $260 million. Senator Ted Stevens saved the expensive
helium-cooled graphite reactor. Even an appropriations rider to
eliminate a regulation that only unionized transit could receive
government subsidies--surely a no-brainer for a Republican House--lost 288 to 
186.
<p>
It was all foreseeable. For those interested in the future,
they only need to consult the Rescissions Bill. It was the first
appropriations law entirely the product of the GOP. It claimed $16
billion in cuts, all of which received due attacks in Congress and
from the President for unfairness to some group or other. Now,
seven weeks after President Clinton's veto, $733 million more in
spending demanded by him for education and training allowed him to
sign. But $7 billion was also added for new projects, so total
spending was reduced only $9 billion.
<p>
The Republicans could claim credit for cutting spending. Bill
Clinton could crow: "This is how we should work together. We agree
we should balance the budget. We disagree on how. But this shows we
can work together." The GOP took months of criticism for being
unfair to children, the poor, the ill, infirm, old, women and the
environment, among others. Then the President restored the "unfair"
cuts and it all turned out ok. It is no coincidence the President's
standing in the polls improved. As predicted here, his strategy is
to concede the Republican agenda to balance the budget, even the
necessity for spending cuts; but to argue that a Democratic
president is necessary to assure the cuts are not too extreme.
<p>
Each chamber of Congress has thirteen appropriations bills
scheduled to pass through the same process before the train wreck
of the Reconciliation Bill. The president or his representatives
have already threatened to veto seven. At this rate, presidential
approval may hit the 60 percent mark. It already hit 50 percent,
and showed Bill Clinton defeating any Republican, even with Jesse
Jackson in the race. It is time to question whose train will wreck.
The conventional wisdom is that Mr. Clinton does not have Ronald
Reagan's stomach for a fight that would shut down the government.
The rescissions example suggests he does not have to have much
intestinal fortitude to claim he made things "better."
<p>
The other possibility is for the GOP to stop playing Snively
Whiplash to Mr. Clinton's Dudley DoRight. The first thing that
needs to be done is to stop the appropriations locomotives in their
tracks. The Democrats did the last time. Why take multiple hits for
every small change over the next few months? Why focus the media on
each appropriations bill in sequence as each reaches the floor for
its own vote and own time on nightly TV, "unfairness" horror
stories and all? Better the confusion of 26 bills moving at the
same time and not converging until the Reconciliation Bill itself.
Then throw Medicaid and Medicare into the mix too, with only modest
changes before 1997. Take the heat and glory together. If there is
going to be a train wreck, why not make it a big one?
<p>
What should the Republicans in Congress be doing in the
meantime? They should raise a "fairness" issue of their own. Before
his major policy speech on affirmative action, White House
officials told the Washington Times that President Clinton would
"insist, as have a generation of politicians, that quotas are not
the same as setting 'goals and timetables' to assist minorities in
hiring and promotion." The "goal" is to make "as few changes as
possible." As the speech showed, Mr. Clinton says "mend it, don't
end it," but retains the same goals and timetables--and still
insists they are not quotas. In other words, the same unfairness of
quotas remains national policy. The Republicans should accept the
challenge. These programs exist in enough different forms and in so
many agencies that hearings could be held in almost every committee
of Congress, to discuss the issue of fairness fully, in a manner
the media could not ignore.
<p>
Jesse Jackson could do his part to lead the national debate on
fairness in employment. There is a project sponsored by the U.S.
Conference of Mayors called CityVote that will be an informal
"primary" for presidential candidates to give "disenfranchised
urban dwellers a real voice in the process," according to Mayor
Larry Agran. It will be held November 7, a full 100 days before the
New Hampshire primary. What better forum for Mr. Jackson to debate
the issue with Mr. Clinton, and have the possibility of winning the
following test vote? With a poll showing the President could win
with Mr. Jackson in the race as a third party candidate, this turns
from a partisan to a classic issues debate. Rather than speculate
about train wrecks, we could have a real national debate on the
very fundamental issue, what is fairness in employment?

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>1. Why does FRC exist and what do they stand 
for?</h2></center>

<p>

The Family Research Council's primary reason for existence is
to reaffirm and promote nationally and particularly in Washington,
DC, the traditional family unit and the Judeo-Christian principles
upon which it is built.  To accomplish this task we will:

<p><ul>

<li>Promote and defend the family in the media.
<li>Develop and advocate legislative and public policy initiatives
which strengthen and fortify the family and promote traditional
values.
<li>Establish and maintain an accurate source of statistical and
research information which reaffirms the importance of the family
in our civilization.
<li>Inform and educate citizens on how they can promote biblical
principles in our culture.

</ul><p>

<h3>FRC stands for:</h3>

<p><ol>

<b>The American Family</b>

<p>

<li>To ease growing economic pressures on families, federal and
state tax policy should allow parents raising children to keep
more of the money they earn.

<li>Fathers play an irreplaceable role in the upbringing of their
children.   They should take these responsibilities seriously.

<li>The natural, married-couple family is the best environment
to bear and raise children.  Public policy should protect the
two-parent family.

<li>America's child protection policies should be reformed to
be more sensitive to the rights of the parents.

<li>The best child care program is one a child receives in his
or her own home, from his or her own parents.  Congress and employers
should therefore adopt policies which make it easier for parents
to care for their own children.

<li>Adults should make every effort toward reconciliation before
considering divorce.  Congress and the state should encourage
this by limiting or repealing current &quot;no fault&quot; divorce
policies.

<p>

<b>The Preservation and Sanctity of Human Life</b>

<p>

<li>Human life is sacred and should be protected -- from conception
until natural death.

<li>Adoption should be strongly advocated, particularly as an
alternative to abortion.

<li>Taking organs from aborted children for experimental purposes
is morally repugnant.  The medial community should find alternatives
to this practice.

<p>

<b>Making our Schools Great Again</b>

<p>

<li>Parents should be free to direct their children's education;
government should respect the right of parents to choose safe and effective
schools for their children.

<li>A child's performance in school should be judged by academic
achievement, not whether the child becomes &quot;politically correct.&quot;

<li>Voluntary student-initiated prayer should be allowed in public
schools.

<li>Schools should teach abstinence before marriage and fidelity
within marriage, keeping in mind that parents bear the primary
responsibility for their children's sex education.

<p>

<b>Pro-Family Health Care Reform</b>

<p>

<li>America's health care system should be flexible enough to
meet each individual family's needs and should also respect the
right of each family to make its own health care choices.

<li>The best method for controlling the spread of AIDS is for
people to change their behavior, avoiding activities which would
put them at risk of acquiring the HIV virus.

<p>

<b>The Family and Society</b>

<p>

<li>Homosexual activity is immoral, unhealthy, and destructive
to individuals, families and societies.  Homosexuals should not
be granted special rights based on their sexual preference.  &quot;Gay
rights&quot; should not be equated with civil rights.

<li>Homosexuals should be treated with compassion, not bigotry.
We should provide support and healing for homosexuals who want
to change their way of life.

<li>It is destructive for military morale, readiness, and effectiveness
to permit homosexuals into the armed forces.

<p>

<b>Family</b>

<p>

<li>Tax dollars should not be used to fund obscene or indecent
art.

<li>It is essential that concerned citizens take part in the
political process, not just be passive observers.

character vs. the politics of style</FONT><P> <HR WIDTH=50%>By Suzanne
Fields<BR>The Washington Times<HR width = 30%>
</CENTER><BLOCKQUOTE><B><I><P>&quot;Character is the most effective means of
persuasion.&quot;<BR>-- Aristotle's
&quot;Rhetoric.&quot;</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><P>No one studies rhetoric for the sake
of rhetoric any more. It's a politically incorrect discipline better left to those
funny men in togas in ancient Athens.<P>So why shouldn't Bill Clinton's State of
the Union speech and Bob Dole's response lack rhetorical flights of inspiration
and persuasion?<P>Most of the pop commentators gave Bill Clinton the usual edge,
but Bob Dole's remarks - not the unaccountably awkward delivery - actually had
more to say to the collective consciousness of a nation that is just now beginning
to listen to the men who want to be president in 1996.<P>Bob Dole was more clearly
focused, sharper with the points of criticism of Mr. Clinton's failed liberal
policies after the president had recited his new conservative agenda. But he
talked too fast from an empty room. He should have insisted on speaking from a
school or a courthouse in a small town in Kansas, or even Iowa or New Hampshire.
The contrast with the pomp and bombast of Washington would have been
exquisite.<P>We can take Aristotle's word for it. &quot;Persuasion,&quot; he wrote
2,500 years ago, &quot;is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the
speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible. His character may almost be
called the most effective means of persuasion.&quot;<P>Bill Clinton lacks that
most effective means of persuasion, credibility and character. He's the
quick-change artist, constantly challenging himself on the tight rope. He knows
how to talk the talk of conservatives when he's in the campaign mode, how to walk
the walk with veto pen in hand when he's with his fellow liberals.<P>Now in the
campaign mode, the president echoes Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich and his merry band
of followers in the House, as well as Bob Dole, and his considerably less-merry
campers in the Senate. The president now seeks a welfare program that supports
families, unlike the present one which undermines families (and a lot like the one
he vetoed last month). He calls for smaller government, accepting the voters'
message in the 1994 elections, but thwarts attempts to cut the government we've
got down to size.<P>He pleads with the pop culture creators to produce movies,
television shows and CDs that &quot;you would want your own children and
grandchildren to enjoy.&quot; He could tell that to his Hollywood cronies, since
they're the ones who produce many of the very shows he affects to criticize.
They're also the ones who have contributed a significant portion of his $30
million campaign chest, and pols rarely want to offend big contributors. He
affected graciousness to Bob Dole, drawing attention to his service in World War
II, which also drew attention to Mr. Dole's age, like Mark Antony affecting praise
of Brutus at Caesar's funeral.<P>And Bob Dole is, as we all know, an honorable
man. He had the better lines but he didn't deliver them well. He hadn't quite
mastered the teleprompter and demonstrated a need for lessons in emphasis. By far
the most powerful sentence in his whole speech fused rhythm, thought and
conviction: &quot;Every political movement, and every public official, must locate
a place in his heart where compromise ends, a core of conviction where we keep our
conscience.&quot;<P>He tossed that sentence to the right wing of his party to let
them know he is more than the Washington deal-cutter, reinforcing the larger theme
that he intends to mock Bill Clinton on the issues of character and an authentic
political point of view.<P>The senator must find a way to turn wisdom, experience
and age to his advantage. It won't be easy. A young TV comedienne says Bob Dole
reminds her of her father, and why on earth would she vote for him. (But why would
she want to vote for her bumpkin uncle?) Bob Dole's not the kind of guy whose
briefs or boxers fascinate the MTV generation.<P>Despite his age, Bob Dole was hip
enough last month to board a flashy MTV bus in New Hampshire for a taped political
interview. He also talked to members at the Alpha Delta fraternity at Dartmouth
College, which was the model for the movie &quot;Animal House.&quot; He competed
with James Brown's shouting from boom boxes, amiably recalling his college days at
the University of Kansas, where pranksters at Kappa Sigma fraternity once carried
a brother's motorcycle to the third floor of the frat house.<P>&quot;Every
generation has its own set of problems, its own temptations,&quot; Mr. Dole told
them. &quot;We're not an old America, we're not a young America. We're one
America.&quot;<P>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is

This provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was passed in 1958. It bans any additive in any detectable levels in processed food if the additive has been shown to cause cancer in humans or laboratory animals.</P><P>       The law seems to make sense. Who wants a cancer-causing substance added to their food? But its broadly stated mandate does not reflect today's scientific knowledge and our growing awareness of health risks.</P><P>     The Delaney Clause is subject to a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council. NRDC charged, accurately, that the EPA was failing to enforce the Delaney Clause. It was, because EPA realized that it was an unworkable law that does more to threaten our nation's health than help it. However, a California judge ordered EPA to follow the law.</P><P>     The EPA's response to the decision was twofold: It began to list the chemicals that would be banned if it were forced to follow the letter of the law and it asked Congress to amend the law to reflect current scientific understanding.</P><P>     The scientific problems are many. Dr. Bruce Ames of the University of California at Berkeley helped pioneer our modern techniques of testing substances for cancer effects. He is now among the methods' chief critics. He cites two concerns.</P><P>     The first has to do with the testing method of feeding populations of animals the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of a chemical, the dose just below that which causes death. After exposure the animals are examined for cancerous growths.</P><P>     The problem is that the &quot;dose-response&quot; curve is unlikely to be linear, that is, continuous high exposures are likely to be more dangerous than long-term low exposures. A substance's ability to cause cancer at 50 or 5000 times the average daily intake level may tell us nothing about its effect upon cancer risk at smaller, more likely doses. As a government scientific panel announced in the Federal Register, &quot;the implicit assumptions underlying extrapolations from the MTD . . . do not appear to be valid.&quot;</P><P>       The second problem is transferring lab results on mice to human populations. Mice and rats are more closely related to one another than to humans. However, one will often test negative while the other will test positive for the same chemical.</P><P>     Dr. Ames also points out that it is not only man-made substances that cause cancer. Using the same disputed techniques, he found a variety of other naturally occurring chemicals, present in substances from peanut butter to broccoli, that also cause cancer in test animals.</P><P>     In contrast to what was believed when Delaney was passed, experts today believe that, aside from workers who are exposed to massive doses, not more than 1-3 percent of cancer cases can be attributed to man-made chemicals. The vast majority are due to genetics and lifestyle choices such as smoking, alcohol consumption, or fatty foods.</P><P>     Of course, to those who campaign for public health, 3 percent is still too much. But they lose sight of the fact that relative, not absolute, risk is the important measure. Most chemicals are present for a reason. They help to control pests and bacteria. They lengthen shelf life. All act in ways that reduce the price of food and often the real danger associated with eating it. The result of strict enforcement of Delaney would likely be greater scarcity of some foods, price increases, and increased likelihood of contamination.</P><P>     The environment might also suffer as more harmful substances are used. In Wisconsin, for example, farmers would likely switch to copper- or tin-based compounds to protect their potato crops from blight. Ultimately, this practice would poison their soils with the accumulation of heavy metals.</P><P>     So by banning pesticides, we may increase other risks, shifting dangers elsewhere. But we cannot eliminate all risks, only choose intelligently among them. This requires a careful analysis of relative risks, not legislation where emotions trump science.</P><P>     EPA's suggestion to relax Delaney is likely to face a tough battle in Congress. Few senators and representatives want to be portrayed as voting for cancer. Cancer is complex, emotional, and scary. And certainly we should seek to lower cancer risks when reasonable. But it is relative risks, what happens on the margins, that matter. To promote a safe and affordable food supply, lets be alert to environmental hyperbole and posturing while respecting medical science and the economics of risk reduction. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

<title>Reporters Ignore Education Inflation</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Reporters Ignore Education Inflation</center></h2>
<p>
With Congress trying to scale back the Clinton Administration's direct lending program for college students, the media have focused on partisan bickering over the issue. This has obscured the larger question: Why are tuitions rising so fast in the first place?
<p>
On the September 10 World News Tonight ABC's Michele Norris said, "The battle over federal funding for education is turning into an all-out political war. Republican lawmakers are proposing deep cuts in education. President Clinton has said that one of his top priorities is not only maintaining but increasing education spending, particularly for needy college students."
<p>
This politics-centered coverage continued with Rita Braver's report on the September 11 CBS Evening News: "President Clinton took his education crusade to Southern Illinois....He told college students that Republicans in Congress are trying to cut their financial assistance." Braver's story, like Norris's, was relatively balanced; Braver noted "Republicans suggest the President is perpetrating a big lie on campus, engaging in scare tactics to make families believe that student aid is in jeopardy." 
<p>
But neither report took the opportunity to discuss why college costs have risen and how growing federal education spending may be the culprit. Heritage Foundation scholar John Hood points this out in the May issue of Reason: "College administrators, waxing sympathetic, beg for more aid from Congress and state legislatures. Interestingly, those same administrators, along with policy makers and the media, rarely try to explain why college costs are rising." 
<p>
Hood points out that average tuitions rose by a third between 1984 and 1994 because "governments, both federal and state, subsidize colleges and universities -- even private ones -- so heavily that tuition and fees have only the murkiest relationship to the costs of providing higher education."
<p>
Hood shows that the recent rise in federal spending on higher education closely corresponds with the hike in tuition: "During the 1970s, the real-dollar value of government assistance to higher education, adjusted for the number of full-time students, fell slightly. So did real tuition, room, and board charges for both public and private colleges."
<p>
"Throughout the 1980s, however, government assistance per full-time student rose significantly (10 percent, not including loans), accompanied by a 27 percent real rise in public college charges and a staggering 50 percent real rise in private college charges. College and University revenue from Pell Grants rose by more than 25 percent from 1985-86 to 1991-92; revenue from state-level need-based grants rose by about 15 percent."
<p>
If prices in private industry ever rose so fast, reporters would be quick to ask why. They should hold educators to the same standard.

<center><h2>4. What does FRC think about child care?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that federal child care policies must respect a range
of private choices without undermining intact families or placing
an undue tax burden on middle-class parents.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Resistance to calls for the creation of
a new federal child care entitlement; protection of the voucher
provisions in the existing child care and child development block
grant (with the proviso that vouchers may be used at sectarian
institutions); passage of tax credits that do not discriminate
against either non-commercial care or one-career families.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Federally-funded child care programs
are a staple of the liberal agenda to replace the nuclear family
with the total state.  It is no coincidence that the opening shot
in the political battle over the family was the passage in 1971
of Senator Walter Mondale's Comprehensive Child Development bill.
An archetype of liberal social engineering, the Mondale bill
sought to place as many children as possible under the care of
federally-funded child advocates and day care centers.  In his
veto message, President Nixon wrote that &quot;good public policy
requires that we enhance rather than diminish both parental authority
and parental involvement with children -- particularly in those
decisive early years when social attitudes and a conscience are
formed, and religious and moral principles are first inculcated.&quot;

<p>

While acknowledging that not all mothers can choose to stay at
home with children, contemporary child care policy must preserve
as many choices as possible -- including at-home care, church-based
care, and other informal arrangements.  Any expansion of federal
oversight, by definition, will limit options and pose regulatory
entanglements.  New federal funding will inflate the tax burden
on two-parent families and force many parents to spend more time
at the job site -- less time with the children.

<p>

Welfare reform that imposes stiff work requirements on mothers
of preschool children threatens to distort child care policy by
creating new sympathy for greater federal intrusion.  To reduce
the need for day care services -- and to assimilate welfare recipients
into the labor force more successfully -- welfare reform must
focus first on the mothers with older children in school.  Research
studies on various &quot;workfare&quot; experiments show a low
success rate for sustained employment by unmarried mothers with
preschool children, who face much greater role strain and task
overload than mothers with school-aged children.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> While decentralization ensures flexibility and
greater responsiveness to individual needs, vouchers ensure that
parents themselves retain maximum say in determining what is best
for their children.  Advocates of greater federal involvement
operate instead on the assumption that bureaucrats and licensed
&quot;experts&quot; know best.  Policymakers must acknowledge
that no paid worker can be an adequate substitute for a loving
parent -- and work to eliminate both the tax burden and the culture
of poverty that restrict families' economic freedom to care for
their own children.

<P>
<P>
The Media Research Center has produced a new landmark study of how news and 
entertainment television treat religion. Faith in a Box, 1994 builds on the 
1993 study of the same name, which found that religion received poor treatment 
in both the news and on prime time.
In the 1994 study, the MRC found marked improvement in Hollywood's depiction of 
religion, but network news continued to trivialize or downplay religious 
themes.
<P>
As was the case with its 1993 predecessor, Faith in a Box, 1994 was recently 
released to the media in Hollywood and Washington, and distributed to 
conservative and religious activists nationwide.
<P>
Leaders in the entertainment industry, including network executives, have been 
briefed on the MRC's findings as well, and given the MRC's recommendations on 
improving religious portrayals on their television shows.
<P>
To obtain a copy of Faith in a Box, 1994, please call 1-800-MRC-1423 or write 
to us at: Media Research Center, 113 S. West Street, Suite 200, Alexandria, VA 
22314.
<P>
MediaNomics readers still have a chance to obtain Out of Focus: Network 
Television and the American Economy by MediaNomics editor Burton Yale Pines, as 
well.
<P>
Out of Focus takes an in-depth look at an entire year's network reporting on 
such as issues as health care reform, environmental policy, taxes, government 
spending, business, and consumer affairs. The book also looks into the impact 
of prime-time entertainment television on the culture of free enterprise and 
business.
<P>
According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, "Out of Focus is a major blast at 
American network television. It deserves the attention of thinking Americans."
National Review agreed: "Out of Focus does for TV viewers what Consumer Reports 
does for car buyers, exposing the recurring flaws in the reports of Ray Brady, 
Irving R. Levine, most of the CNN staff, and the like."
<P>
To obtain a copy of Out of Focus: Network Television and the American Economy, 
call 1-800-243-BIAS.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>7. What does FRC think about defunding public arts and 
humanities that support cultural decay?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that most of America's troubles stem more from moral
decline than from economic problems.  Part of FRC's goal is to
spark a cultural renewal that will be evident in music, arts,
literature, film, television, and other parts of our culture.
FRC believes there should be an end to taxpayer funding of public
arts and humanities and broadcast programs that attack the family,
religion and traditional values, and/or promote an ideological
agenda.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b>  Defunding the National Endowment for the
Arts (NEA), the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The National Endowment for the
Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities began in 1965
with budgets of $2.5 million.  The two agencies' budgets reached
more than $175 million each per year in the 1990s.  NEA was cut
to just under $100 million in fiscal 1996,  to be phased out after
1997.  NEH was cut to $110 million in fiscal 1996, with a planned
phaseout after 1998.

<p>

Unlike any other arts sponsor, the federal government has unique
authority and responsibility.  A federal grant instantly conveys
the stamp of approval of the federal government and the American
people.

<p>

Federal arts funding, an unconstitutional expansion of government 
power, has skewed the art market toward questionable projects.
NEA continues to fund such venues as the Franklin Furnace Archive
theater in New York, where artists engage in scatological, sexually-explicit,
anti-religious and anti-family &quot;performance&quot; works.
NEA Chairwoman Jane Alexander told the pro-gay <I>Advocate</I> magazine
that she intended to use the NEA to &quot;introduce people gently
to gay themes all across the country.  And I mean gently, because
if you start with a very overt thing, people get scared.&quot;
Alexander also defended a performance at an NEA-funded art center
in which an HIV-positive man sliced another man's back with a
knife, mopped up blood and sent it over the audience on clotheslines.

<p>

At the NEH,  money has been wasted on politically correct projects
such as the promotion of &quot;cultural diversity&quot; and the
&quot;National Conversation on American Pluralism and Identity.&quot;
When one activist used the latter forum to state that, &quot;There
is nothing about me that is American.  I don't want to be an American,&quot;
NEH Director Sheldon Hackney exulted, &quot;What an American thing
to say -- squarely in the great tradition of American dissent.&quot;

<p>

In 1967, Congress created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
overseer of the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public
Radio.  CPB's budget grew to nearly $285 million by fiscal 1996.
In fiscal 1997, CPB is to receive $260 million, with a request
for $296.4 million for 1998.  No phaseout has been enacted.

<p>

America has more than 11,700 radio stations, 3,100 television
licensees, 109 cable networks and another 6,963 translators and
boosters, plus the Internet. There is no reason to tax hardworking
American families to subsidize PBS or NPR shows.  Although PBS
and NPR have some worthy fare, there is a drumbeat of anti-family
and anti-religious programming.  Political bias is rampant.

<p>

CPB subsidies are not needed.  <I>Sesame Street</I> can make it
on its own, while bad programs would and should fail in an open
market.  Some congressmen have talked about creating a $1 billion
trust fund for PBS without any congressional oversight.  More
money and <I>less</I> oversight?  It's time to defund the NEA,
NEH and CPB.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The saving of hundreds of millions of dollars
annually and an end to tax-subsidized attacks on family, religion,
sexual morality and free enterprise.

the great railroad job</FONT></CENTER><P>When Bill Clinton says he &quot;feels
your pain,&quot; he means it. He wants to spread the pain around so that he can
feel everybody's.<P>Last week he made a good start.<P>You could ask Billy Dale.
You could ask David Kendall, his lawyer for financial felonies, now in the toils
of a grand jury himself. You could ask Bob Bennett, his lawyer for bimbo
misdemeanors. You could ask Mike McCurry, his press agent.<P>You could even ask
Hillary, but she's still taking pills for her amnesia.<P>Mr. Dale is entitled to
laugh last, if he feels like laughing through his pain. Never has a railroad job
failed so deliciously.<P>Mr. Dale is going to get back a lot of the money he was
forced to borrow to pay for the lawyers to help him defend himself against
Hillary's false witness. (Miss Hillary, who wants us to believe that she went to
Sunday school between the beatings she got at the hands of the roving gangs of
5-year-olds then terrorizing her Republican neighborhood, might spend a few hours
between grand jury appearances to reflect on what the Bible says about bearing
false witness. She could start with the 20th chapter of the Book of Exodus and
look in on Proverbs 19:05 and 21:28.)<P>Mike McCurry is not laughing, but neither
is Bob Bennett. Mr. Bennett was assigned by the president to get on TV to trash
Billy Dale, to ruin his reputation in retaliation for his having humiliated the
Clintons in court, and in his zest for the assignment poor Uncle Bob revealed
himself to be not only a great pleader - he's a member of that mighty fraternity
of Blackstones whom the innocent cannot afford - but almost as factually
challenged as his famous client.<P>He said, OK, Mr. Dale might have beaten the
rap, but it was not a knockout, only a TKO: Mr. Dale had offered to plead guilty
to embezzlement in return for a four-month prison sentence. This was great
breakfast theater, suggesting that just because Billy Dale was not a felon that
didn't mean he wasn't a bum. But it wasn't so. He never agreed to say he had done
something he hadn't. When he was called on it, Mr. Bennett was revealed to have
gotten his facts, such as they were, all wrong. (He also violated the confidence
that parties to plea-negotiating have a right to expect, if the ethics committee -
please do not laugh - of the bar association is listening.) What also was not
clear was why anyone would believe anything any mouthpiece, $500 an hour or not,
would say in such a situation. A lawyer's declamation in defense of his client is
about as useful as calling your mother as a character witness.<P>At the next press
briefing, a reporter started to ask Mike McCurry a perfectly reasonable question
about Uncle Bob and Billy Dale, but before the reporter could get to his question,
Mr. McCurry cut him off: &quot;People have said some things and, frankly, the
president finds some statements that have been made objectionable. I am referring
specifically to comments on plea bargaining. ... We didn't put Bennett out to say
anything bad about Billy Dale, that's the bottom line. We made it pretty clear
after that happened that we didn't appreciate that type of
commentary.&quot;<P>Nothing ambiguous about who and what Mike was talking about.
Bob Bennett read it that way, too, and he used up a pocketful of a luckless
client's quarters calling the White House until he finally got to the president,
who felt his pain at once. The president told him that he had done &quot;a great
job&quot; on Billy Dale.<P>By the end of the next day, Mike was feeling pain. He
was sent out to retract all the honorable stuff he had said about Mr. Bennett's
treatment of Billy Dale. &quot;It is not objectionable for the president's
attorney to defend the president once he is under attack during some of these
television talk-show programs. ... And it is not objectionable for Mr. Bennett
simply to repeat something that has been published. ... There was a notion ...
that the White House has a campaign out there to tar and feather Billy Dale. I'm
satisfied that's not true. I'm satisfied that the president would find that
objectionable if that were true.&quot;<P>This is now all so familiar. Depending on
who Mr. Clinton was talking to, he thought that (a) Bob Bennett had done &quot;a
great job&quot; trashing Billy Dale; (b) Mike McCurry had done &quot;a great
job&quot; telling Bob Bennett what a jerk he was for trashing Billy Dale; and (c)
Billy Dale had done &quot;a great job,&quot; too.<P>Attorney General Janet Reno
also did &quot;a great job,&quot; putting out a Justice Department report saying
that the White House did not pressure the FBI to investigate the travel-office
employees. This has infuriated some people at the FBI who understand that the only
people who did &quot;a great job&quot; were the railroad men: The director of the
FBI works for Janet Reno, who works for President Clinton, who works for the first
lady.<P>The job Hillary did, however, was not so great.<P>Copyright &#169 1996,

<P>	The epicenter of Ecotopia lies somewhere in the area encircled by Bellingham, Eugene, and Bozeman.  Four colleges of forestry, dozens of environmental groups, and busloads of environmental writers are based there.  Hence, the federal land management agencies are under intense scrutiny.  But even here, the institutional arrangements are so perverse that often management is grossly pathological, ecologically insensitive and economically wasteful   Many analysts now question the justification for federal management of commercial timber land.</P>

<P> 	The woeful performance of agencies like the Forest Service is not due to incompetent or evil people within those bureaucracies.  Rather, bad institutions generate incentives and information which lead smart, well-intentioned people to do harmful things.  The real need is for better economic and legal arrangements, not better people.</P>

<P> 	The Forest Service came from progressive era fantasies a century ago.  In <CITE>Public Lands and Private Rights</CITE>, Robert Nelson of the University of Maryland describes the progressive's religion.  Their philosophy requires centralized management by scientifically trained professionals.  They believed that good management can only come from the government, from trained professionals in the Forest Service.  In their view the private sector was incapable of responsible forest management.  Increasingly, evidence mounts that the progressives had it exactly backwards.</P>

<P> 	Professor Nelson points out that, despite this conviction, &quot;the history of the public lands is filled with laws that had lofty purposes and achieve dismal results&quot;.  Bureaucratic politics trumps ecology, economics, and ethics.  Recent events in our Ecotopia illustrate the general problem. </P>

<P> 	275 acres of scorched or burned trees were sold in a remote pocket of the Thunder Mountains in the Okanogan National Forest, Washington.  The salvage logging rider to the 1995 Recissions Bill keeps the public from appeal the timber sale.  Politics exempted salvage sales from environmental regulations.  Logging this area imperils rare lynx habitat and salmon runs.</P>

<P> 	The Forest Service spent over $200,000 to plan the Thunder Mountain timber sale.  Its first offering in October yielded no bids from industry.  The Forest Service re-offered that sale two months later, after lowering environmental standards.  This time Omak Wood Products, Vaagen Brothers, and Acord placed bids.  However, they were outbid by the <A HREF="http://www.pacificrim.net/~nwea">Northwest Ecosystem Alliance</A> (NWEA), an environmental group.  Their $29,000 bid marks the first time an environmental group has outbid timber companies for logging rights.  This is a milestone in the co-evolution of environmentalism and economics.  </P>

<P> 	The USFS is likely to reject NWEA's high bid because they vow to let the trees stand.According to Mitch Friedman, NWEA's Executive Director, &quot;The best result for all concerned would be for the Forest Service to take our money.... and allow us to protect the trees for the length of a rotation - maybe 100 years.&quot;  Unfortunately, federal regulations mandate that purchasers be &quot;responsible for&quot; cutting the trees.  The Forest Service says it will disqualify purchasers who lack such &quot;integrity&quot; and &quot;ethics&quot;.</P>

<P> 	Throughout time and across cultures, wealth, education, and environmental concerns are positively correlated.  As education and prosperity levels rise, so do environmental sensitivities and interests.  But environmental amenities have long been thought of as luxury goods.  Gifford Pinchot, the first Forest Service chief, argued with John Muir that material considerations must trump all others.  The national forests were to be federally run as an efficient and responsible business.  </P>

<P> 	While resource extraction drove the American West's economy in 1897, diverse environmental values are helping drive the &quot;new&quot; West's emerging economy in 1997.  Recreation, biodiversity and scenic vistas, along with traditional commodities, represent vital economic resources.  Wildlands surrounding cities contribute to the high quality of life and attract businesses to Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies communities.  And, contrary to expectations of progressive era zealots, private timberland owners have proven far more efficient, innovative, and progressive than federal agencies.</P>

<P> 	Here's how the amenity economy evolves.  Public, non-governmental entrepreneurs identify the interests of those valuing the non-commodity features of forests.  But when environmental entrepreneurs aggregate these interests, they are often stymied by the bureaucratic politics of federal caretakers.  NWEA's high bid on Forest Service lands exemplifies this.  Professor Nelson, a U.S. Department of Interior economist for over 20 years, finds that, &quot;it is most of all the old scientific management theories of the progressive era that stand as a barrier to the development of new institutions for the public lands&quot;. </P>

<P> 	The Forest Service effectively blocks the evolutionary path of the forest economy.  The centralized planning imposed last century has failed to keep pace with the success of private forestry and with the complex and changing values of our modern economy.  Politics and the budgetary process systematically reward federal 'scientific managers' for losing money on environmentally destructive activities.  The Thunder Mountain salvage sale will cost the U.S. Treasury at least $171,000.  The costs of environmental amelioration will follow.  And the non-financial costs to lynx, salmon, lovers of these natural systems, and fiscal conservatives will be even higher.</P>

<P>	As we approach the centennial of the national forest system, it's time to ask if the federal government should even be involved in managing commercial timber.  Central planning fails in the Forest Service as it did in the Soviet Union.  It's time for second thoughts about sylvan socialism.</P>

Baden</P><P>TWICE I've cried in a movie. The first time I was 4 years old and saw Bambi. The second was in 1970, when I saw a tear-provoking &quot;documentary&quot; of a polar bear hunt.</P><P>       The few polar bears I've seen in the wild inspired awe and admiration. But during this film, a faux-sportsman was flown onto an ice flow where he killed, with a long range shot, a she bear. She had two young cubs who presumably would die of starvation and neglect. This was a repulsive act, one contrived to make sensitive people feel embarrassed to be hunters. It worked for me.</P><P>     People who share my interest and concern have no easy way to channel their feelings into effective action. As Adam Smith explained, when its hard to organize people, many worthwhile things aren't done. That's why we use government to protect endangered species - to reduce the difficulties of achieving group goals.</P><P>     But all institutions have imperfections. For-profit firms discount or ignore values lacking market prices. No-profit organizations have serious problems with recruitment and motivation. And when tasks are given to political organizations, decisions are made by political calculus where ecology, economics and equity are trumped by politics.</P><P>     So we have problems dealing with endangered species, especially those without commercial value. Corporations have weak incentives to preserve their habitat. No-profits find it difficult to mobilize support for species lacking romantic appeal. What about government?</P><P>       Don Coursey, a University of Chicago economist, considered endangered species for a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He identified the key issue: &quot;At a practical level of analysis, the country must decide how much to spend on protecting endangered species and how to distribute this amount among each endangered plant and animal.&quot;</P><P>       He went on to study the actual amount and distribution of spending on endangered species.</P><P>     Coursey observed that expenditures are determined by a competitive, complicated political process.</P><P>     Data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service showed total state and federal expenditures on 247 endangered species totaled $84,894,000 in 1990. This excludes hidden regulatory costs imposed on people in the private sector.</P><P>     The 20 animals that receive the most attention and money tend to be &quot;charismatic megafauna,&quot; big romantic creatures such as the grizzly bear, woodland caribou, eastern cougar and large birds of prey.</P><P>     In contrast, the bottom 20 are obscure rodents, insects or snails. In a national survey, Coursey found that those animals that are highly rated by the public receive more money - a beauty pageant of endangered species.</P><P>     Professional ecologists and wildlife biologists differ from the general public. They weigh ecosystem balance, interdependencies, and genetic information more heavily and advocate systems that enable every species to exist and adapt.  They want ecological analogs to Noah's Ark.</P><P>     But we can't have it all. Choices will and must be  made. Noah's Ark is on a budget. And when these choices are made in the political arena, it is the public  rather than the scientists' values that drive policy.</P><P>     Popular versus elite preferences is a classic democratic problem. This creates ecological problems when the public's values conflict with the long term health of most species and ecosystems.</P><P>     Even when scientists have their technical facts straight and understand ecological cause and effect, they often exhibit naivete when considering political economy. Many advocate keeping species protection a primarily public enterprise.</P><P>     But as long as it remains with public, political institutions, it is dominated by the general public's  values and superficial understandings. Healthy ecosystems require we shield management from misinformation and ill-informed democratic opinions.</P><P>     Clearly, national and international governments must deal with large scale issues such as atmospheric pollution and migratory wildlife. However, many of the minor ecological treasures neglected by the public, the non-charismatic minifauna, have relatively modest requirements for their preservation.</P><P>     These are best handled by community-based voluntary groups which include scientists. Private sector, not-for-profit organizations can respond to local interests just as museums and schools cater to specialized tastes. Such organizations can avoid the problems created when profits or  political advantages are paramount.</P><P>     Some scientists have a strong antipathy to property rights and the market process. They ignore private sector innovations and cling to the mirage of benevolent, environmentally sensitive federal government.</P><P>       Following the Progressive Era myth of &quot;scientific management&quot; the government will someday empower them as philosopher kings of the ecological domain. Finally, they hope, after a 100 years of trying we may have finally got it right with Jack Ward Thomas running the U.S. Forest Service and Bruce Babbitt (temporarily) our Secretary of Interior.</P><P>     Both experience and theory tell us they are surely wrong. It is no accident that political spending and ecological integrity don't easily mix. In the political calculus, scientific opinion counts less than popular enthusiasm. Non-popular but scientifically well-founded views are more likely to prevail in the voluntary sector. This is where environmentalists should focus their efforts as we seek preservation and sustainable future.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           IT is easy to be an enthusiastic supporter of recycling, especially in Seattle. Recycling requires little effort from consumers and appears to eliminate waste and alleviate pressures on the environment. Recycling is an easy choice for those who believe it will always save money and resources. They have little problem equating it with conservation and making it a litmus test for green values.</P><P>       But recycling is not always a wise idea. Like many good things it entails tradeoffs, tradeoffs that make its environmental effects ambiguous and dependent on local circumstances. Recycling consumes valuable labor, capital, time and urban space. It imposes environmental and economic costs through transportation, sorting, processing and remanufacturing and sometimes these costs outweigh the gains of reusing a resource. Without knowledge of the tradeoffs, a knowledge usually communicated through prices, it is difficult to make responsible decisions.</P><P>      Lynn Scarlett of the Reason Foundation is someone who has studied the tradeoffs inherent to recycling. She analyzed seven of the best curbside recycling programs in the United States and found that the net cost was $110 per ton after subtracting an average salvage value of $35 per ton. These were the best cases. The average net cost for curbside recycling is about $150 to $200 per ton. Much of the gap between costs and value is a deadweight loss, a needless waste of resources.</P><P>      However, Scarlett's results should not be taken to indicate that all recycling is inefficient and environmentally unfriendly. Some early losses in recycling can be investments in experiments that may ultimately pay off. The problem is that it is difficult to determine whether recycling a specific object, such as plastic soft drink bottles (Polyethylene Terephthalate, or P.E.T.), makes environmental sense. Like so many things in life, it depends.</P><P>      One of the things on which it depends is our position on the recycling learning curve (i.e., how much we know about recycling an object). When producing any good, the first units are often quite expensive. For example, computing power used to be very expensive. The first computer, ENIAC, cost the U.S. government $3 million and delivered less computing power than a modern calculator. Today, the same computing power is available for roughly $30. This is the learning curve at its best - producing vastly better products at much lower prices. Though less dramatic, the same logic applies to recycling; the longer we recycle, the more efficient and effective we become.</P><P>      Now this rule only applies when recycling programs generate incentives to innovate and learn. Plans that do not, like Germany's &quot;green dot&quot; program, are extremely wasteful. The German system mandates that firms must recycle a certain percentage of their products. Like many government plans, it makes recycling a burden rather than an opportunity and thereby discourages innovation. We can expect far better results from recycling efforts designed by producers and supported by consumers.</P><P>      There are some attractive recycled products coming onto the market as firms ascend the learning curve. Patagonia, for example, has recently introduced a new Synchilla fleece. This fabric is 80 percent recycled fiber made from (P.E.T.) soda-pop bottles and 20 percent virgin polyester. It is slightly more expensive than the fabric it replaced and is not quite as soft. Nevertheless, people love the fleece and the idea behind it. Wholesalers have already sold out their fall stocks.</P><P>      BMW presents another example with the planned introduction of the first 100 percent recyclable car and auto-recycling facility. Both firms are using profits from sales of existing products to subsidize the development of recyclable products. In doing so they are pushing the market up the recycling learning curve.</P><P>      Efforts to recycle among firms producing luxury or high-end products offer an interesting dilemma. Although &quot;Beamers&quot; are often derided as yuppie toys and Patagonia satirized as &quot;Patagucci,&quot; the customers and stockholders of these firms are subsidizing movement up the learning curve. Their efforts to commercialize recycling provide a significant public good.</P><P>      As the technology pioneered by &quot;luxury&quot; firms advances and less-workable ideas are filtered out, the cost of producing recycled products decrease. (Today, P.E.T. is actually less expensive than virgin material for carpet fiber). This encourages wider use of recycled material. Firms serving larger markets, like WalMart and Costco, will ultimately feature recycled products as the most successful processes are refined.</P><P>      Recycling can be environmentally harmful and economically wasteful. Unfortunately, these problems are most likely when politics intervenes and obscures the existence of tradeoffs. Politics can push recycling too hard by mandating trendy but harmful and inefficient programs, like recycled content mandates. These approaches stifle innovation and creativity. Although the market is by no means perfect, when prices approximate full costs, it provides the best path toward socially and environmentally responsible products.</P><P>________ </P><P> John A.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>6. What does FRC think about crime prevention?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC supports and encourages efforts to combat crime at all levels
to ensure that law-abiding Americans feel safe in our streets.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> (1) Sentencing and prison reform. (2) Reforms
in criminal procedure. (3) More aggressive enforcement.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b>

<p>

(1) <I>Sentencing and prison reform</I>:

<p>

Serious repeat violent felons must be put away permanently.  Recidivism
figures show clearly that many criminals, once released, return
to a life of crime.

<p>

Government must protect the public by keeping violent criminals
behind bars for their entire sentences and eliminating bail for
suspects.

<p>

Adolescents who commit &quot;adult&quot; crimes should be tried
as adults and subjected to adult penalties.

<p>

Criminals must be punished, not pampered.  Recidivism is high
among violent offenders partly because the price they pay for
crime is too low.

<p>

Other means of punishment, such as restitution, might be used
for less-serious offenses.  This could help relieve an overburdened
prison system.

<p>

No one advocates cruelty or harsh, meaningless labor such as the
old &quot;making little rocks out of big ones.&quot;  But prisons
should be places of punishment, not weight-lifting and entertainment
centers.

<p>

(2) <I>Reforms in criminal procedure</I>.

<p>

The death penalty, affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1976, must
be used where it is justified if it is to deter crime.

<p>

Habeas corpus loopholes that permit criminals to exploit the courts
must be closed.  The impact of the Comprehensive Terrorism Act
of 1995 must be carefully monitored to ensure that the loopholes
have been closed.

<p>

The exclusionary rule should be changed.  The exclusionary rule
was created by the courts to implement the Fourth Amendment (all
persons have the right to be secure from unreasonable searches
and seizures) thus protecting the public from police abuses. 
But the rule has been used to unfairly favor criminals.  It must
be modified to deny freedom to the guilty, give incentives for
police professionalism and protect civil liberties.

<p>

Jury reform is long overdue.  Jury members ought to be able to
ask questions that trial attorneys and prosecutors may miss. 
They should also be informed of the defendant's past criminal
history, especially during sentencing considerations where either
mitigating circumstances or a track record of incorrigible behavior
is significant.

<p>

(3) <I>More aggressive enforcement</I>.

<p>

Increase the prison population to reduce crime.  Statistics show
that most crime is committed by a core of chronic criminals. 
Keeping these criminals in jail for longer periods will make society
safer.

<p>

More local police -- to guard our schools, neighborhoods and commerce
-- are necessary to free our citizens to go about their daily
lives without fear.

<p>

Government must protect law-abiding citizens from recidivist sex
felons.  An example of this is the recently-passed &quot;Megan's
Law.&quot;*   It requires state governments to disclose information
and notify communities about convicted sex offenders who are released
from prison.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Crime costs America half-a-trillion dollars every
year.  It leaves thousands of killed and injured people in its
wake.  In order to prevent the next decade's much-anticipated
youth crime explosion, major anti-crime reform is desperately
needed.

<p>

* &quot;Megan's Law&quot; amends the Violent Crime Control and
Law Enforcement Act of 1994.

<CENTER><H3> End Federally Funded Abortion</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  There are 13 appropriations bills that fund U.S. government agencies and pro-grams.  These bills are voted on annually, and they originate in the House of Representatives.  During the Clinton administration, federal money has been used directly or indirectly for abortion through various appropriations.  The 104th Congress, however, has the opportunity to delete this funding or restore previous restrictions on tax dollars paying for abortion.  Also, the House Leadership has instructed the appropriations subcommittees to cut funding for programs that have not been "reauthorized" or approved by separate legislative committees.  For example, the Title X family planning program has not been reauthorized since 1985, but it continues to receive funding through the appropriations process.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee is Rep. Bob Livingston (R-LA).  However, legislative action takes place first in various Appropriations subcommittees that have jurisdiction over the particular department or programs.  The sub-committee chairman plays a key role and can include the desired language in the subcommittee "mark", or bill.  A subcommittee version goes to the full committee for consideration and then to the House floor.  The key subcommittees and chairmen are:  Labor/HHS/Education (Rep. John Porter [R-Ill.]); Treasury, Postal Service, General Government (Rep. Jim Lightfoot [R-Iowa]); and District of Columbia (Rep. Jim Walsh [R-N.Y.]).
	<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Since the government's new fiscal year begins on October 1, these bills will be in the forefront during the next few months.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  
<P>
<UL> 
<LI>The current Hyde amendment applies only to programs under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services, such as Medicaid.  The Hyde language was "expanded" in 1993 to include payment for abortions in the case of rape and incest.  The fiscal year 1995 Labor/HHS bill contained this language.
<P>
<LI>A key issue to be decided will be language introduced by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) that blocks the Clinton administration's interpretation of the "expanded" Hyde language.  Under that interpretation, the state pays for poor women's abortions whenever the abortionist claims the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.  Many states have stricter policies, allowing payment only in the case where the mother's life is endangered.  Rep. Istook tried to offer this corrective amendment during the "first 100 days" of Congress, but was persuaded not to and was promised a vote later in the year.
<P>
<LI>Also, attempts will be made to cut funding via the National Institutes for Health for human fetal tissue research, human embryo research, and RU-486 research.  Furthermore, Rep. Tom DeLay may offer an amendment to eliminate Title X family planning, which funds Planned Parenthood and distributes contraceptives to teens without parental permission.   The Senate Budget Resolution recommended defunding the Office of Surgeon General.  If the Appropriations Committee follows through, Dr. Henry Foster will have no job as Surgeon General, whether or not he is confirmed by the Senate. 
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 appropriations for Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government did not contain language prohibiting participating health plans from paying for Federal employees' abortions through the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHBP) program.  FEHBP provides health care benefits for 9 million federal employees.  The government (taxpayers) pays about 60 percent of the cost and the employee pays the rest.  In previous years, the Smith/Ashbrook amendment had been attached which restricted FEHBP-participating health plans from funding abortion.  This language should be reinstated.
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 District of Columbia appropriations contains a prohibition on the use of  "federal" funds to pay for abortions, which is meaningless, since DC can use "local"  funds.  These funds are commingled with federal funds since DC's funds are appropriated by the U.S. Congress.  Language is needed to ban all congressionally appropriated funds, both "federal" and "local," for abortion on demand in the nation's capital, a city where the number of abortions is comparable to the number of live births.
</UL><P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Majority support should be there for these appropriations bills in the House, but that will not be the case in the Senate.  In the first test vote on abortion in the House on May 24, the pro-life position (an amendment offered to the foreign aid bill by Rep. Chris Smith) prevailed by 59 votes.  President Clinton must sign the appropriations bills if he wants the money to run the government for fiscal year 1996.  

<P>
<LI><B> Prohibit D & X Abortions</B>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To ban a particularly heinous method used to perform late-term "partial birth" abortions carried out on unborn children as early as 20 weeks of gestation and as late as 32 weeks.   
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, along with Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will introduce legislation in early June to ban "partial birth" abortions, or as they are more commonly known, "dilation and extraction" or "D & X" abortions.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on June 15 which focused on the D & X abortion procedure, fetal pain, and a constitutional analysis of the legislation.   
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  American Medical News, (July 5, 1993) devoted a front-page article to the gruesome D & X abortion procedure.  The article explained the step-by-step procedure.  First, the unborn baby's legs are pulled into the birth canal.  Next, the abortionist delivers the baby's entire body, except for the head.  The abortionist jams scissors into the baby's head, inserts a catheter and sucks the brains out.  The dead baby is then "evacuated."  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  As a starting point, this legislation seeks to build public support for further prohibitions and an ultimate ban on all elective (non-life-of-the-mother) abortions.  While specifically intending to prohibit late-term abortions, this legislation and corresponding Congressional hearings will educate the public about the humanity of the unborn child and the horror of abortion.  Sadly, this basic public education is still greatly needed.  There should be widespread support for this measure, although some will argue that abortion is legal and that this is not a common procedure because late-term abortions are "rare."
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Retain Forced-Abortion Asylum Policy </H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Language included in the pending foreign aid and State Department reauthorization bill (H.R. 1561) would reinstate a Reagan-Bush policy that provided asylum to those who can prove a well-founded fear of persecution for resisting the People's Republic of China's grotesque and coercive population control program. 
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) added this language to the foreign aid bill when it was before the International Operations and Human Rights Subcommittee in May.  Rep. Smith is the subcommittee chairman.  The provision remained intact throughout the full committee's deliberations and became part of the foreign aid bill, known as the American Overseas Interests Act (H.R. 1561), to be considered by the House of Representatives. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Col.) will likely seek to delete this key provision on the House floor when the House resumes consideration of H.R. 1561.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Despite fears by some anti-immigration groups that the number of immigrants entering this country will soar, it is important to note that from 1987 through 1993, when the forced-abortion asylum policy was in effect, less than 200 people per year were granted asylum on these grounds.  This is a humanitarian policy and should be reinstated.  President Clinton revoked this pro-life policy soon after he took office.  This policy has real implications for Chinese families living in the U.S. who face imminent deportation and persecution, if it is not adopted quickly.  On Good Friday (April 14), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) moved 13 Chinese women to a deportation holding center in Bakersfield, Calif.  Five of these women had fled China after being forced to have abortions.  Others had been forcibly sterilized, or had escaped after being ordered to undergo abortions and/or sterilization.  It appears that their deportation is imminent unless Congress passes H.R. 1561 with the forced-abortion asylum provision intact.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The anti-immigration lobbyists are stirring up some fears, but the fact that a militantly "pro-choice" Member of Congress (Rep. Patricia Schroeder) is their champion undercuts their ability to appeal to the pro-life majority in the House.  Rep. Schroeder will be hard-pressed to explain why she isn't more sensitive to the fact that Chinese women don't have any "choice" about abortion.  However, President Clinton has threatened to veto H.R. 1561 for other reasons, mainly because it significantly cuts foreign aid.  If the House cannot override the veto, Rep. Smith would have to find another vehicle to enact the forced-abortion asylum policy.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $5,000 Adoption Tax Credit </H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to reduce some of the financial obstacles associated with adopting a child.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit was a primary component of the House GOP's Contract with America.  The provision -- adapted from Rep. Chris Smith's (R-N.J.) Omnibus Adoption Act, H.R. 1066 -- was passed by the House as part of H.R. 1215, the tax cuts package sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and unveiled before an FRC audience.
<P>
<B> BUDGET RESOLUTIONS</B>:  In order to make the $5,000 adoption tax credit a reality, the provision must be included in the budget for each fiscal year.  The first step in that process is the budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for the appropriating of funds in the final budget.  The House recently passed an historic budget resolution for fiscal year 1996, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio).  The resolution balances the budget by the year 2002, and includes the $5,000 adoption tax credit in its proposed tax cuts.
<P>
In contrast, the Senate's budget resolution would balance the budget by 2002 but failed to include the adoption tax credit (or any other tax cuts).  Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) tax relief amendment (which included the adoption tax credit) was defeated by a vote of 69-31.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House and Senate versions of the budget resolutions will now be melded together to produce one budget known as reconciliation.  It remains to be seen whether the $5,000-per-child adoption tax credit will be maintained in the final version.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  This provision would make adoption a more affordable choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing them to receive a tax credit of up to $5,000 for quali-fied adoption expenses, including adoption fees, court costs, and attorney fees, among others.  This provision is important because it reduces the financial obstacles that might otherwise hinder middle- and low-income families from adopting.  [The average cost of an adoption is between $10,000 and $15,000.]  It is also an important step in encouraging the adoption choice -- a choice which benefits the birth mother, the adopted child, and the adoptive parents.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Much depends upon the reconciliation of the two budget resolution versions.  If the Senate and, most especially, the members of the House-Senate conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for the passage of the $5,000 adoption tax credit.
<CENTER><H3> Coercive Abortion Training Threatens Accreditation of Hospitals </H3></CENTER>
<P>
On February 14, 1995 the 23-member Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new regulations mandating that all medical residents specializing in obstetrics and gynecology be trained to perform elective abortions.  Individual residents expressing moral and/or religious objections to abortion would, presumably, be able to opt out of the abortion training, but common sense suggests that they will face strong pressure to undergo the new "standard" training.  Medical schools with a religious affiliation that oppose abortion would not be required to provide abortion training directly, but they would be required to arrange for such training for those students who do not object.  Many religious medical schools currently reject any affiliation whatsoever with abortion providers.  
<P>
Programs which fail to comply with the new regulations risk losing their accreditation.   However, over the last 20 years, the number of medical schools offering elective abortion training to their residents has declined.  In 1976, 92.5 percent of U.S. medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training, either on a routine or optional basis.  In 1991, 68.8 percent of medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training.  About one third of medical schools refuse to provide abortion training due to moral and/or legal reasons. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) plans to offer legislation in June that would reverse this coercive directive.  The legislation would "protect individuals, entities and programs from discrimination on the basis of their refusal to be trained, to train, or to arrange for training in the performance of induced abortion."  Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.) is prepared to introduce similar legislation in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Economic and Educational Opportunities Oversight and Investigations subcommittee examined this issue during a hearing on June 14.  Witnesses included several medical directors of OB/GYN departments at public universities or hospitals who oppose the new requirement and a representative from ACGME.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Congressional action is necessary to reverse this coercive policy.  Accreditation status qualifies teaching hospitals to receive federal reimbursement (from Medicare and Medicaid) for services which medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover, doctors must ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs to get certified as competent in their specialties.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Rep. Hoekstra's legislation may be attached as an amendment to health care legislation, such as the Health Professions Education Consolidation and Reauthorization Act.

</CENTER><P><CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Disestablishing the U.S. Education Department</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Education has been traditionally -- and constitutionally -- a responsibility of states and localities.  But since the U.S. Education Department was founded in 1979, it has followed the iron law of bureaucracies, seeking to expand its range and influence.  Legislation is needed to take educational decisions from the hands of federal bureaucrats and return them to parents, teachers, and communities.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 24, 1995, the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill was introduced.  This bill's main sponsors are Joe Scarborough (R-Fla.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), 
and John Boehner (R-Ohio).  Members of the House Education Task Force are among the cosponsors.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Within one year of passage, this bill would shut down the U.S. Education Department.  Many programs, including Goals 2000, would be repealed, while general funding for elementary/secondary and higher education would be converted to two block grants for the states.  The only stipulation is that 98 percent of a state's block grant be passed on to the local level.  Authorization for the block grants would last just three years, at which time the bill proposes that a tax cut for families replace the block grants.  A few functions of the Department would be transferred to more appropriate agencies:  Impact Aid to the Department of Defense, Indian Education to the Department of the Interior, Civil Rights to the Department of Justice, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and student loan programs to the Department of Health and Human Services.  The proposal goes beyond talk of shuffling offices and putting a new sign on the door; it takes a serious step towards removing the federal government from our schools.  The proposed tax cut would further reduce the government's influence over education.  Increased revenue for parents would empower them to make more decisions about their children's education.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  President Bill Clinton has already promised the National Education Association (NEA) that he would "remember who put me here."  He will clearly veto legislation that eliminates the NEA's primary representative in the federal government, the Education Department.  However, the executive office cannot authorize expenditures which have not been appropriated by the House.  The House Republican Budget Resolution zeroes out funding for the U.S. Education Department by 2002.  That improves the prospects for the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill.
<P>


<P>
<CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Repealing Goals 2000</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Ignoring parental pleas for education to get "back to the basics," the 103rd Congress adopted Goals 2000, a program which further centralized education, increased bureau-cracy, and added a host of new non-academic programs.  It was described by supporters as a new pattern for local-state-federal partnership in education.  The debate has now shifted to limiting the federal role in education.  Goals 2000, representing the height of federal intrusiveness into schools, should be the first program to be dismantled.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 10, Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) offered an amendment in 
the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee to repeal Goals 2000.  The committee did not vote on the motion at that time, but Rep. Graham plans to raise the issue again later this year.  That same day, the committee voted in favor of H.R. 1045, a bill to abolish the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), which was created by 
Goals 2000.  Opportunities Committee chairman Bill Goodling (R-Penn.) is sponsoring the bill. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  H.R. 1045 was introduced on February 24, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House passed H.R. 1045 soon after the bill was reported out of committee.  Legislation to remove the opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards from the law may be introduced later this summer.  A bill to repeal the whole law should appear later this year.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  NESIC would have functioned much like a national school board by reviewing and certifying state and national standards.  There is a general consensus that this is an inappropriate function for the federal government.  OTL standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing inputs into education, which requires increased spending.  We know that spending does not drive academic performance.  OTL standards should be removed from the law.  However, the Goals 2000 agenda will carry on as long as block grants to states continue.  Education reform at this historic moment calls for a reduction in the role of the federal government in American schools and a return to the traditional role of school:  teaching students the basics like reading, writing, and arithmetic.  A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals 2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation and spending.     
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  H.R. 1045 should see minimal opposition, but the U.S. Education Department will fight fiercely to maintain its new conduit for imposing policy on the local school:  Goals 2000.  But the department is on the defensive.  Gov. George Allen of Virginia has announced that he will not accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  Across the nation, parents are outraged by the implentation of Goals 2000 in their local schools.  The U.S. Education Department's new partnership has turned against them:  it is being attacked from all sides -- federal, state, and local.

<CENTER><H3> Promote Parental Choice in Education </H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  As evidence of the academic failure of our monopoly public school system mounts, legislation is needed to help parents choose a safe, academically successful public, private, religious or home school for their children. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) have introduced S. 618, a bill to spend $30 million on 10-20 demonstration projects.  It would allow low-income parents of students in inner-city schools to choose among public, private, and religious schools.  In addition, FRC is considering alternative legislation to grant a tax credit to parents who choose private, religious or home schools or who select a public school different from the one to which their children have been assigned. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  March 24, 1995 (Coats-Lieberman).
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Coats-Lieberman is in committee. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Sens. Coats and Lieberman offered this legislation in the 103rd Congress.  It was narrowly defeated in the Senate last year (52-41).  Their proposal has since gained the interest and support of prominent columnists, such as neoconservative Ben Wattenberg and E.J. Dionne, writer for the liberal Washington Post.  The purpose of the bill is to fund what are called demonstration projects.  Sponsors believe that when poor parents choose schools, the evidence we gain from this experiment will be so positive and so compelling as to clinch the argument for parental choice in education.  Because this bill would benefit low-income, inner-city students, who are disproportionately minority children, its backers believe that the idea will overwhelm the usual liberal case against parental choice.  Advocates of the public school monopoly generally argue that parental choice in education is elitist, that it will "re-segregate" the public schools, that private and religious schools merely "skim off" the best students.  Some pro-family advocates, however, argue that the Coats-Lieberman bill would expand the federal role in education at a time when the goal of dis-establishing the U.S. Education Department is a higher priority.  A better solution at the federal level may be tuition tax credits.  FRC is considering legislation which would allow all parents to retain a portion of their earnings for the purpose of selecting safe, excellent schools for their children.  This legislation would enable parents to select among public, private, religious or home schools.  It would protect the integrity of independent schools since there would be no cash transfer from the government to the schools. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Despite arranging for quality private schools for their own children, Bill Clinton and Al Gore will vigorously oppose parental choice legislation which includes non-public schools.  Coats-Lieberman therefore faces a veto threat.  Tuition tax credit legislation would face a gauntlet of liberal opposition and senators who stubbornly regard any family tax relief as a "giveaway,"  but it could benefit by being referred to a more friendly committee.

<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $500 Per-Child Tax Credit</H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to relieve some of the tax burden on parents.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit was an integral part of the American Dream Restoration Act, the "crown jewel" of the Contract with America, which passed as part of H.R. 1215 (sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer [R-Tex.]).  The credit is non-refundable (meaning that it only reduces taxes; it does not provide cash welfare to those with no tax liability).  This serves to target the bulk of the tax savings to middle-income families in the 15 percent tax bracket.
<P>
The House recently passed its fiscal year 1996 resolution, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), to balance the budget by the year 2002, and it includes the $500 per-child credit in its proposed tax cuts.  The Senate's resolution, though it also balances the budget by 2002, included no tax cuts, as Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) amendment to add the per-child tax credit to the budget resolution was rejected in the Senate.  It remains to be seen whether or not the $500 per-child tax credit will survive once these budget resolutions are melded into one budget by the two houses.   
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The fate of the $500 per-child tax credit is uncertain.  While Sen. Gramm's amendment to the budget resolution was defeated, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has indicated that he intends to secure a significant per-child tax credit in the budget resolution conference committee meeting with the House.  In addition, Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) have pledged to offer amendments on the Senate floor calling for the $500 per-child tax credit if the Senate Finance Committee, headed by Sen. Robert Packwood (R-Oreg.), continues to balk at offering pro-family tax relief.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  FRC has been calling on Congress to adopt pro-family tax relief for many years.  Today, the average family of four contributes 25 cents on every dollar in income taxes and payroll taxes to the U.S. government, compared to 2 cents on every dollar in 1950.  In light of this, the per-child tax credit is designed to help offset the extraordinary erosion in per-child income tax benefits over the last half-century.  Passage of significant pro-child tax relief should be a top priority in the ensuing months of Congress.  
<P>
Streamlining government spending and permitting families to keep more of their own income -- for things like dental appointments and clothing purchases and electric bills -- benefits both the national economy and the personal economy of families.  Immediate pro-family tax relief should be a part of any government plan to balance the budget and make government more efficient.  In the months to come, it will be interesting to see if the Congress as a whole and the Senate in particular heard Americans last November and will give American families the opportunity to keep more of their own money.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  At this point, the fate of the per-child tax credit is uncertain.  However, if the Senate and, most especially, the members of the conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for passage of the $500 per-child tax credit.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Broaden IRA Eligibility to Non-Employed Spouses</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To help alleviate the financial burden on families in which one spouse stays at home.  Legislation to allow expansion of IRA benefits to non-employed spouses would help provide relief for families who choose to have one spouse stay at home and would recognize the important contribution that non-employed spouses make to the income production of employed spouses -- an acknowledgment commonly made in divorce settlements.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Family Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1040), introduced by Rep. Bill Baker (R-Calif.), allows full-time homemakers and wage-earning spouses a deductible IRA contribution 
of up to $2,500 each; this was passed in the House as part of the Contract with America.  (Furthermore, this legislation permits families to borrow from their IRA for education expenses or to buy a home, with the provision that the funds be paid back to the family with interest.)  Similar legislation, the IRA Equity Bill (S. 287), has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex) and allows deductible contributions of up to $2,000 by non-employed spouses.  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  It is important that the Senate pass legislation to help relieve the tax burden on families.  The House bill was passed as part of the Contract with America.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Along with the attractive idea of expanding the uses of IRAs to help free-up family finances (e.g., penalty-free withdrawals to cover major housing, education, and health expenses) is the proposal to broaden the eligibility of IRA's to include non-employed spouses.  While broadening the eligibility of IRA's in general would primarily benefit upper-middle- and upper-income taxpayers, a more targeted broadening of the eligibility to non-employed spouses would provide relief primarily to middle-income families with children -- those most in need of pro-family tax relief.  Currently, two-earner couples can claim almost twice the benefits as single-earner couples, penalizing those families who choose to stay home with their children and ignoring the significant contribution the full-time homemaker makes to the income production of the employed spouse.  Passage of legislation to help level the playing field for single-earner families is a key step to providing relief to American families.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle for IRA benefits for non-employed spouses must be won in the Senate, as pro-family House legislation has been passed already.  It is crucial that the Senate give priority to measures that promote pro-family tax relief. 
Support Medical Savings Accounts
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In the ongoing effort to reform health care, it is important to support any positive measures which would make health care more cost-effective for families.  Medical savings accounts, or Medical IRAs, are one such measure.  Making the option of medical savings accounts available to employees and unemployed individuals would encourage more prudent use of health care dollars and promote greater family autonomy in health care decisions.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Reps. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.) have formulated legislation promoting medical savings accounts.  The proposal would amend the existing tax laws to create cost-effective incentives for employers to offer, and for employees to choose, medical savings accounts.  Rep. Archer expects to introduce his bill in mid-June and has said that many of his colleagues in the House have expressed great interest in cosponsoring such legislation.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The bill is currently being "scored" by the Congressional Budget Office to see what impact, if any, the reform will have on the overall budget, e.g., whether it is budget-neutral,  whether it will save money, or whether it will require the allocation of additional federal funds.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Medical savings accounts (MSAs) are similar to individual retirement accounts (IRAs) in that pre-tax dollars up to a certain limit may be set aside for lower-level medical expenses to be controlled by and used by families.  MSAs usually supplement catastrophic health insurance coverage, helping to cover medical expenses before the insurance deductible is reached.  Because individuals are directly responsible for the use of their health care dollars, MSAs guard against the overutilization of health care services, thereby helping to curb skyrocketing health care costs.  Moreover, individuals reap the rewards of managing their health care dollars wisely and of practicing good habits, for any monies not spent by the end of the year may be kept by the individual as taxable income, or kept in the account for future health care needs.
<P>
MSAs also promote greater autonomy in health care choices.  Because MSA funds may be used toward any medical expenses, including those not expressly covered within the insurance deductible, an individual has more flexibility to choose health services and providers and more portability of coverage (i.e., ability to keep coverage even when changing jobs).
<P>
Furthermore, evidence indicates that MSAs work well.  Golden Rule Insurance company recently conducted a survey of their employees who are covered under MSA plans.  The results show that (1) MSA enrollees saved money and reduced overall health care spending, and that (2) MSA enrollees were highly satisfied with their plan -- fully 88 percent prefer the MSA plan to other health insurance plans they had in the past.
<P> 
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The idea of MSAs is not new; therefore, many members of Congress are already familiar with and support the concept.  MSAs should have a good chance of passage in the 104th Congress, especially considering the fact that MSAs were a key component in many Republicans' health care reform proposals last year.

<CENTER><H3> Implement the Gay Ban</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved with the passage of a law.  Wrong.  The Clinton Administration ignored the law when it wrote the implementing policies and lifted the ban anyway.  Now, the Administration is using the courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a case that will lose in the Supreme Court.  That's why new legislation is imperative.
<P>
Pentagon and Justice Department officials have told FRC that what we thought was an exclusion policy is really an accommodation policy which permits homosexuals to serve.   So far, Congress has ignored this swindle by failing to exercise its constitutional responsibility to enforce military regulations.
<P>
The Pentagon policy that took effect February 28, 1994 differs in several ways from the law it purportedly implements:
<P>
<UL><LI>The law carries the statement, "homosexuality is incompatible with military service."  The Clinton regulations omit it. 
<P>
<LI>The law forbids service by homosexuals.  The Clinton regulations permit service by homosexuals.  At least 15 avowed homosexuals are now serving openly.
<P>
<LI>The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.  But the Clinton regulations create a "criminal-like" standard.  According to Secretary of Defense William Perry, if soldiers attend gay pride parades, frequent gay bars, and possess gay materials, this does not constitute "credible" evidence to initiate an inquiry.
<P>
<LI>Contrary to 200 years of military experience and practice, Clinton's Defense Department no longer acknowledges homosexual behavior as a marker for increased security risk.  Information discovered during a security investigation cannot be used without high-level political permission.
<P>
<LI>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and orientation at the point of admission and whenever appropriate, the Clinton Administration refuses to do so.</UL>
<P>
In the first court test of the new law, the Clinton Justice Department failed to use key arguments and called no witnesses.  
<P>
On March 30, 1995, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District of New York ignored volumes of case law precedents and struck down the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.  The case is<I> Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able, et al. v. United States of America</I>.
<P>
The Justice Department did not bother to:
<P>
<UL><LI>Dispute biased research and testimony by "expert" pro-homosexual witnesses.
<P>
<LI>Present well-documented physical and psychological problems with homosexuality.
<P>
<LI>Show that homosexual "lifestyles" and "values" jeopardize morale and unit cohesion.
</UL><P>
FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP), with senior advisors former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas M. Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert H. Barrow, is lobbying Congress to amend the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.  Should the <I> Able </I>case be heard by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals before the law is changed, irreparable damage may be done.
<P>
FRC's MRP wants the following changes included in the 1996 Act:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to ask all potential recruits whether they are a homosexual or have engaged or intend to engage in homosexual acts.
<P>
<LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to revoke current policy and issue regulations consistent with the law.
</UL><P>
TheDefense Authorization Act will come to a final vote in early August.  Some members want to avoid another debate over homosexuals in the military and will try to torpedo any amend-ments.  However, without legislation the courts will have the final say on an issue which  constitutionally belongs to the Congress.  And the Clinton Administration will continue to keep more homosexuals in the military, thus undermining combat readiness, legal defense of the ban, and the moral fabric of the nation.  The stakes are extremely high.  If the military falls, federal power will be used to validate the rest of the homosexual agenda, including gay "marriage" and adoption of children.
<P>
Senators Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and Dan Coats (R-Ind.) have both expressed concern and may take legislative action.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Cable Porn</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Some cable TV operators include channels featuring pornographic material in their basic cable subscriptions.  This increases access to pornography, particularly by young people.    
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) introduced the Family Viewing Cable Television Act of 1995 (H.R. 1540) on May 2, 1995.  The bill forbids cable operators from including pornography in basic cable packages.  
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> H.R. 1540 is currently pending before the House Judiciary Committee but no hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Currently, many consumers are forced to accept channels featuring pornography as part of their basic cable package.  This makes it more difficult for them to protect their children.  The bill would secure the right of parents to keep their television safe for family viewing.  It would not outlaw pornographic material on cable television.  Rather, the bill would merely prohibit operators from automatically including it in basic cable packages.  Consumers wishing to have pornographic channels on their cable systems would be free to do so, but they would simply have to request them from their cable company.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The bill is facing opposition from industry lobbyists and advocates of unrestricted free speech.  Supporters may offer it as an amendment to another bill if hearings are not scheduled soon.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Promote Porn-Free Technology</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The growth of technology has created many exciting opportunities.  Unfortunately, it is also being used to expand access to pornography.  Many on-line computer networks such as the Internet operate largely unregulated and are a virtual no-man's land where material is exchanged without regard to laws on obscenity and indecency.  Legislation is needed to bring computer networks into compliance with obscenity and pornography laws.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S. 314) introduced by Sen. Jim Exon (D-Neb.)  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  February 1, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The bill has been incorporated as an amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 (S. 652).  The telecommunications bill has been reported out of committee and is awaiting floor action. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Communications Decency Act amends current dial-a-porn laws regulating obscenity and indecency to include computer technology.  Without questioning Sen. Exon's intentions, many pro-family groups, including the Family Research Council, fear that the bill in its present form might actually create more problems than it solves.  Computer industry lobbyists have hit Sen. Exon hard, resulting in significant weakening of S. 314 since February.  FRC and other groups are working with Sen. Exon and other senators to develop a strong law that incorporates the original goals of  S. 314.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  FRC will continue to work with Sen. Exon to try to restore S. 314.  Meanwhile, several alternative proposals are in the works.  Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) intends to add an amendment to the telecommunications bill which would instruct Attorney General Janet Reno to "study" the problem of computer porn.  Sen. Leahy's approach is a do-nothing approach which pro-family groups will oppose.  If Sen. Exon's bill does not improve, parents might see help from Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) or Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) who are working on solutions that are more in line with pro-family concerns.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Military Profits from Pornography</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition for "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of Miller v. California.  At present, the services oppose removing so-called "soft" pornography from exchange shelves because of  the perceived threat of legal action from the American Civil Liberties Union.  
<P>
Obscenity was legally defined by the Supreme Court in the Miller v. California decision.  According to this ruling, something is obscene and therefore unprotected by the First Amendment when it satisfies the following criteria:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Taken as a whole, appeals to a prurient interest in sex.
<P>
<LI>Depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner.
<P>
<LI>Taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value.
</UL><P>
These criteria were written to protect freedom of speech and expression.  But there are kinds of speech and expression not protected by the Constitution: slander, libel, perjury, false advertising, conspiracy, yelling "fire" in a crowded theater, copyright violations and child pornography.  The military has determined that certain "soft" pornographic material is protected (not obscene) and should be sold to uniformed patrons in government stores.
<P>
Pornography is sexually explicit material intended to arouse the consumer.  It is addictive and very often leads men to sexual crime.  This fact should persuade military leaders to judge wisely between two competing outcomes: the damage attributable to addictive pornographic material versus an ACLU lawsuit.  For now, the government is more fearful of an ACLU lawsuit.  
<P>
The government has much experience selling addictive merchandise to military patrons.  For example, it has sold alcohol, a potentially addictive substance, to servicemembers for most of the military's 200-year history.  Admittedly, most alcohol users avoid addiction, but enough do become addicts and they cost the services dearly -- productivity losses, personal injury, judicial expenses and property damage.
<P>
Pornographic material is much like alcohol; it is a very powerful stimulant.  The consumer begins with limited exposure -- "soft" pornography sold in military stores.  In some cases a  desire for sexually explicit material grows to require more explicit, more deviant images for the consumer to reach a previous level of sexual stimulation.  Gradually the addict is desensitized to the more explicit material.  Finally, he may act out sexually his pornographic fantasies prompted by the material.  These activities may include compulsive promiscuity, exhibitionism, group sex, voyeurism, having sex with children, rape, or sadism.
<P>
Serial killer Ted Bundy stated just before his execution for the sexual assault and murder of many women, "You are going to kill me, and that will protect society from me.  But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that."  Bundy blames his addiction to pornography for his mental state that led to his murdering as many as 31 women.
<P>
No pending legislation mandates the removal of pornographic materials from military exchange shelves, but President Clinton has the unilateral authority to do so.  Military consumers can purchase the material without the government's help.

<CENTER><H3> Combat Illegitimacy in Welfare Policy</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE:  </B> The current welfare system promotes family breakdown by guaranteeing a right to cash benefits even if one engages in irresponsible conduct.  Moreover, the bureaucratic arrangements that spring up to administer those benefits supplant voluntary organizations that offer real help -- the kind of help that changes lives.  Any legislation that attempts to reform welfare must end the entitlement status of numerous welfare programs, including AFDC cash benefits, and afford states the maximum flexibility to experiment with anti-poverty efforts that impose behavioral requirements (charitable alternatives, in particular).
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  House bill, H.R. 4, "The Personal Responsibility Act."  Senate floor action is expected.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  In March, the House passed The Personal Responsibility Act as part of its Contract with America.  The welfare reform bill will reach the Senate floor later this summer.  While the Senate Finance Committee did vote to eliminate the federal guarantee of cash assistance in favor of a strategy that "block grants" money to the states, the committee bill fails to ensure that illegitimacy remains a prominent focus of the debate on the floor.  The House bill, H.R. 4, included three essential provisions to strengthen families:  a prohibition on cash payments to mothers under age 18 who bear children out of wedlock; a freeze on benefits for mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and incentive bonus payments to states that reduce illegitimacy rates -- without increasing the number of abortions.  While the Senate bill does not include any of the essential provisions that were incorporated in the House bill, at least four senators have indicated that they will fight to restore the focus on family breakdown.  Family groups expect either Senator Bob Dole (R-Kans.) or Senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) to lead the  initiative.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot be regarded as a morally neutral act.  Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to promote such activity by subsidizing it.
<P>
"The task," Charles Murray concludes, is to "neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings to form families. . . .  A major change in the behavior of young women and the adults in their lives will occur only when the prospect of having a child out of wedlock is once again so immediately, tangibly punishing that it overrides everything else."  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage mothers will be necessary, though not sufficient, to restore the integrity of the family unit.  
<P>
Frances Perkins, chief architect of Franklin Roosevelt's welfare policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal member of the Roosevelt Administration, because they rejected that intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  While Congress is almost certain to pass a welfare bill this session, the fate of the illegitimacy provisions is uncertain.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Zero Out Title X</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act was enacted in 1970 as a grant program to fund family planning projects throughout the country.  The program helped to spawn the proliferation of family planning clinics within states, granting federal sanction to the distribution of contraception to unmarried women and to minors without parental consent.  Having received over $193 million from taxpayers last year, funding for this unauthorized and failed program should be eliminated altogether.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act receives its funding through the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill which comes before Congress for a vote every year.  Neither the House nor Senate budget resolutions included a proposal to zero out Title X funding.  However, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) has promised to bring an amendment to the House floor to defund Title X if funding is not eliminated in committee.  Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and his state's Congressional colleagues, Reps. Ernest Istook and Steve Largent, are also working to zero out Title X funding.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> Efforts to defund Title X are in progress. The Labor/HHS Appropriations bill will be considered by Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The reasons to defund Title X are numerous.  First of all, Title X should not continue to receive funding because it is an unauthorized program.  Its authorization expired in 1985.  Secondly, Title X is duplicative.  Several other programs such as Medicaid and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provide family planning to low-income and other targeted populations.  There is no clear basis for the federal government to run a categorical family planning program when state governments have the capability to set health care priorities within the parameters of an alternative block grant.  Finally and most importantly, Title X is a failed program.  Since the inception of Title X, out-of-wedlock births, abortions, and sexually-transmitted diseases have all risen dramatically, especially in the populations Title X is supposed to have targeted.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Expect a huge fight pitting pro-abortion, pro-contraception groups intent on saving Title X against pro-family, pro-life groups working to defund the program.  Because Planned Parenthood receives a good portion of Title X monies, expect them to launch a campaign to save the program.  Outcome of a floor fight is uncertain.
<P>
Another approach, which may or may not prevent a floor battle, could be far more effective.  Overall grant reform may eliminate Title X funding without targeting any specific program.  For example, Congress could pass a law saying that no funds shall be appropriated to any program unless that program is currently authorized.  This is a justifiable reform in light of the efforts to balance the budget and the recently passed law eliminating unfunded federal mandates to states.  Thus, Title X funding might be eliminated on the basis of its unauthorized status.  However, if such grant reform passes, it is probable that pro-abortion members of Congress may try to bring Title X up for reauthorization.  Prospects to successfully reauthorize Title X are slim.  However, without such grant reform, funds could still be appropriated to unauthorized programs.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Derail the AIDS Gravy Train</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The federal government, all told, is spending $7.1 billion on AIDS through several government agencies in fiscal 1995.  The Public Health Service alone spends about $2.9 billion yearly ($91,355 per AIDS death contrasted with $1,060 for every cancer death).  Other federal expenditures come from HUD, Social Security, Veterans Affairs, and the Agency for International Development.  Legislation is needed to bring AIDS spending in line with money spent on other terminal diseases such as cancer.  And AIDS funds should not go toward the promotion of homosexuality in the guise of  "AIDS education."  Time-tested epidemiological responses such as early diagnosis and partner tracing should be employed.
 <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Congress seems prepared to take a business-as-usual approach to AIDS.  On April 3, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's (R-Kans.) Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act (S. 641) provides $4.3 billion over the next five years, beginning in fiscal 1996, and allows for "such sums as may be necessary," a budget-busting possibility.  Other sponsors include Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kans.).  A House version was introduced by Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) on January 4, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Senate bill was passed out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has put a legislative hold on the bill.  No hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Much AIDS money goes to legitimate activities, such as HIV research and care for AIDS victims.  A significant amount, however, goes to politically active groups that promote the radical homosexual agenda.  Congress needs to hold hearings to examine how the money has been used so far.  All funding to groups that promote homosexuality should be cut, leaving more money for groups that deal with AIDS in a medically responsible fashion.  Current AIDS education funding should be terminated, since the money is going toward promotion of condoms and the myth of  "safe sex" instead of documentably successful abstinence education.  And spending formulas should be changed:
<P><OL> 
<LI>Only those infected with HIV or AIDS who need care should receive benefits.  Formulas based on "AIDS prevalence" distort funding needs, because they count the dead along with the living.  More of the money should go to under-served minority communities.
<P>
<LI>People with HIV or AIDS should qualify where they currently live, not where they were diagnosed.  Someone might be diagnosed in a large city but return home elsewhere for care.
<P>
<LI>Means testing for AIDS dollars should be introduced.  Those with adequate insurance should not be in the same pool with those who truly have no other means of payment.</OL>
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Fifty-five senators have signed on as sponsors, but hearings could result in positive changes.  Sen. Dole's role is pivotal if the bill's abuses are to be addressed.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Defund Federal Promotion of Homosexuality</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Clinton Administration mandated AIDS/Awareness Training for all Federal employees.  Some of this training is used to promote homosexuality.  Legislation is needed to defund this training.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS: </B>  S. 25 -- To stop the waste of taxpayer funds on activities by government agencies to encourage their employees or officials to accept homosexuality as a legitimate or normal lifestyle.  Sponsor: Senator Jesse A. Helms (R-N.C.)
<P>
H.R. 862 -- To prohibit the use of Federal funds to promote homosexuality.  Sponsor: Represent-ative Robert K. Dornan (R-Calif.)
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  H.R. 862 -- was introduced February 8, 1995, and was assigned to the Subcommittee for Human Resources and Intergovernmental Affairs of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. 
<P>
S. 25 --  was introduced January 4, 1995, but is unlikely to be voted on until late summer or 
early fall.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Congressman Dornan's strategy is to amend all appropriations bills to include this language.  H.R. 862 will not likely be passed as a stand-alone bill, and thus, the Senate strategy is likely to be similar.
<P>
<B> OVERVIEW</B>:  President Clinton directed all federal departments to provide HIV/AIDS training.   According to many federal employees, the mandatory training promotes homosexuality and includes unnecessarily graphic explanations.  A Defense Department worker complained that her training included a slide show of  "sex toys" and flavored condoms.  Other workers were lectured that their grandmothers probably had engaged in sodomy as a form of birth control.
<P>
Two supervisors and 41 employees in the Federal Communication Commission's audio services division chose not to attend mandatory "AIDS Awareness Training."  An FCC employee stated, "The classes are basically an adult version of high school sex ed., with the modern-day sensitivity training thrown in."
<P>
Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary created "Walkin' the Talk" AIDS training materials for three-hour, mandatory training sessions.  A memo from the Department's Federal Workplace HIV/AIDS Education Coordinator states, "All employees are required to complete this training."
<P>
The training includes a brief history of HIV and a discussion of symptoms, prevention, and risk reduction.  There also is a discussion of needle-sharing and sexual contact.  Federal employees are told to reduce their HIV contraction risk by practicing "safer sex" by using barriers like condoms, dental dams, plastic wrap, and latex gloves.  The manual states, "A dental dam 
(a small, square piece of latex) or plastic wrap may be used for any oral-vaginal or oral-anal contact.  All types of barriers (condoms, dental dams, and plastic wrap) are effective against HIV transmission only if they are used correctly and consistently from start to finish."
<P>
The Energy Department makes a disclaimer: "HIV is transmitted without regard to gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, or identification with any group.  For this reason, we avoid referring to high risk groups."  Not identifying "high risk groups" is irresponsible.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report shows that at least 87 percent of AIDS victims either contracted the virus from homosexual encounters or by sharing needles.
<P>
Probably the most outrageous example of government-sponsored AIDS training was done for the Forest Service.  It took place in the Forest Service's Tahoe Region on May 6, 1994 and was conducted by a local health official with degrees in sexology, a self-described homosexual phlebotomist (individual who draws blood), and an HIV-positive woman from the community.
<P>
The phlebotomist was an ex-convict who tried to debunk "homophobic" misconceptions.  He speculated that many husbands were involved in homosexual affairs.  He showed a variety of condoms and how to apply them to a life-size replica of erect male genitalia.  He even explained a technique for using one's mouth to apply the condom.  He also explained the proper cleaning techniques when sharing hypodermic needles.
<P>
The Forest Service also has a training booklet entitled, "Valuing Diversity."  Inside the booklet are statements such as: "Fact: Psychological and social influences alone cannot cause homosexuality....Fact: A biological (genetic, hormonal, neurological, other) predisposition toward homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual orientation is present at birth in all boys and girls."  No source for these "facts" is provided, nor could there be.  So-called genetic studies on homosexuality are flawed and typically conducted by homosexual activists.
<P>
AIDS/HIV awareness training and diversity training have become vehicles for promoting homosexuality in the federal government.

<CENTER><H3> Restore Combat Exemptions for Women</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Clinton administration has removed 250,000 combat exemptions for women.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The Administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness. 
<P>
Secretary of Defense William Perry promises, "Our over-arching goal is to maintain a high-quality, ready and effective force.  By increasing the numbers of units and positions to which women can be assigned, the military services gain greater flexibility in the development and use of human resources."
<P>
The Clinton Administration has not explained how liberalization of the female assignment policy will accomplish the goal of maintaining "a high-quality, ready and effective force."  According to Mr. Perry, these changes are intended to expand "the opportunities for women in the military."
<P>
The Administration's decisions to end more exemptions for women have no justification in military necessity and will hurt readiness:
<P><UL>
<LI>There is a sufficient number of male recruits, especially now that the military is downsizing.  
<P>
<LI>No new scientific studies refute the findings of the 1992 Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which recommended that "military readiness should be the driving concern regarding assignment policies."
<P>
<LI>The American people still support a go-slow approach to expanding military roles for women.
<P>
<LI>America's likely adversaries still assign only men to their militaries because they know that national security interests cannot be sacrificed to social experimentation.</UL>
<P>
On October 6, 1994,  Representative Ike Skelton (D-Missouri) of the House Armed Service Committee's Subcommittee on Military Forces and Personnel hosted the only hearing since 1991 to consider assignment policies for women.  Although Mr. Skelton began the hearing by stating, "Women should not serve in direct ground combat," and, "I'm of the opinion that second place does not count on the battlefield," he limited the two-hour hearing to one three-member panel which supported the Administration's changes.  Rep. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) had asked to hear dissenting views from a panel of commissioners from the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces.  His request was denied.
<P>
Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives the Congress the responsibility to "raise and support armies" and to "provide and maintain a navy."  Congress also must make the rules and regulations that govern the military, and that includes the number of women in the military and their assignments.
<P>
The 104th Congress should conduct a thorough review of Pentagon policies and seek to reverse the Clinton administration's current course.  No hearings or bills are pending.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Off The Dole: No Taxpayer Support for Special Interests</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In Washington, DC some of the most intensive lobbying is done by recipients of taxpayers' money.  Using the funds received from awards, grants and contracts, these government-created special interests lobby Congress for continued, and often increased, taxpayer support.  Moreover, many of the programs created are hostile to the values of the citizens whose money is used to fund them.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On March 3, 1995, Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.) introduced the Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), which would prohibit recipients of taxpayer money from lobbying for continuation of their funding.  The bill is currently cosponsored by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Rep. Mel Hancock (R-Missouri).  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Integrity in Government Act is currently before the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The bill is designed to keep taxpayer money out of lobbyists' hands.  It is carefully worded so that it applies only to lobbying for continued support of various programs and agencies.  It does not apply to recipients of entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare.   Nothing in the legislation restricts or interferes with individual citizens' ability to communicate with their elected representatives.  
<P>
The Integrity in Government Act does not have many friends among the special interest groups that are so prevalent in Washington.  Many Members of Congress do not want to support the bill for fear of the money and power of these groups or because they like the idea of taxpayer money being used to lobby Congress for causes they favor.  
 <P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Although no hearings have been scheduled for the bill, supporters say they want to move forward with plans to attach similar legislation to each appropriation and authorization bill that comes up in Congress.  It is believed that attaching such an amendment to each appropriation and authorization will make it more difficult for special interests to oppose efforts at reform.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Stem the Resurgence of Drug Abuse</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to the culture's pro-drug influence, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The Administration's national drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" --  treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress may cut drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership. 
<P>
A nationwide survey by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) in 1994 found that annual marijuana use among 8th graders rose from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  The trend is also evident among 10th (16.5 percent to 30.4 percent) and 12th (36.7 percent to 38.2 percent) graders.  And cocaine, crack, heroin, and LSD use among teenagers is also rising and may soon rival the high rates of the 1970s.
<P>
The largest rise is in marijuana abuse, possibly because it is perceived differently from the "hard" drugs.  Although some young people don't even consider marijuana a "drug,"  Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, "There is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana] does."
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, "Young people must understand that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous effects."  Over 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana damages brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.
<P>
Shalala calls for "strong and comprehensive solutions....Young people must grow up knowing unambiguously that drug use -- including smoking marijuana -- is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.  They must hear this from everyone in their communities -- their parents, their teachers, their employers, their peers, the media -- all of us.  We need anti-drug messages that are every bit as pervasive and strong as the pop culture images that tell our youth drugs are o.k."
<P>
These strong words are not echoed by other Administration officials.  President Clinton has been virtually silent on the topic.  And his national drug strategy focuses on a new philosophy entitled "harm reduction," which provides and supports programs to reduce the danger of drug use-related risks, like HIV infection.  Needle exchange is a key component.  The strategy is geared at changing but not eliminating drug-using behavior, in order to reduce the threat of disease due to drug use.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Administration has cut drug interdiction efforts and increased efforts to treat chronic abusers.  The hope is that having more abusers in treatment will reduce demand -- a step toward ending the plague.
<P>
Unfortunately, the pop culture glamorizes drugs, and there are few alternative cultural icons warning teenagers to "just say no."  Additionally, there is no sign that drug production and distribution are declining.  In fact, there continues to be an ample supply.
<P>
The 104th Congress may cut school-based drug prevention programs believing they don't work.  There are some ineffective programs, but others have good track records and should be kept.  
<P>
The House rescissions bill (H.R. 1158) cut most of the FY 95 drug prevention money.  Pending legislation in the Senate may recover some of the funds.   
<P>
The national drug crisis requires committed parents and community leaders to join forces.  At the national level, leadership such as that provided by President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan is needed to curb the drug glamorization messages and boost effective prevention programs.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Free Public Broadcasting</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created in 1967 during Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society" to meet a perceived need for taxpayer-financed alternative programming not provided by commercial networks.  Congressional authorization for CPB is due to expire at the end of 1996.  The 104th Congress should let authorization expire and decline to appropriate any more taxpayer money for CPB.  Instead of giving more taxpayer support to CPB, Congress should let it thrive on its own, as it has shown it can do.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) takes the first steps by providing a three-year phase out of funding for CPB.  The resolution passed the House on May 18 by a vote of 238 to 193.  A weaker Senate budget resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) was passed on May 25 by a vote of 57 to 42.  It includes a provision sponsored by Sen. Hank Brown (R-Col.) to bring commercial sponsors to CPB in order to offset possible reductions in taxpayer subsidies.  The Senate resolution includes no explicit cuts in funding and falls short of the goal of privatization.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Budget resolutions in both houses of Congress provide a starting point for privatizing CPB, but more action is needed.  Budget resolutions are only suggestions for how to spend taxpayers' money.  Bills dealing with the appropriation of CPB funds will be making their way through the Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The CPB should be privatized for several reasons.  First, the federal government should not be in the broadcasting business.  The basis for CPB's existence is the assumption that for good television programming to exist, the government must provide it.  This $285.6 million a year, anti-free market philosophy insults the intelligence of the viewing/listening public because it assumes that they won't support good programming.
<P>
Second, CPB has been a regular launching pad for attacks on the family.  Independent Television Service's Television Families, Dottie Gets Spanked, and Terminal USA ridicule traditional families and glorify non-traditional households.  A PBS documentary What Kids Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up contains graphic sexual information, aimed at children as young as 8 years old.  The role of parents in the education of their children as well as the moral and familial ramifications of sexuality are almost invisible.  PBS's Tales of the City and Tongues Untied are offensive and graphic promotions of the homosexual lifestyle.  Both programs contain gratuitous nudity, lewdness and foul language.  Religious bigotry is also common in CPB programming. National Public Radio's The Politics of Bigotry was billed as an "in-depth investigation of the Christian Right."  It was actually an ugly smear of Christians which violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free exercise of religion.
<P>
Finally, in a time of massive federal deficits, it makes no sense to require taxpayers to shell out their hard-earned dollars so that the government can run a television network that could survive on its own anyway.  As any family knows, serious budget cutting must start with non-essentials. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Defunding CPB is a priority for conservatives.  But these efforts are being met with stiff opposition from CPB supporters in both parties who argue that opponents are trying to kill "Big Bird."  It is hoped that the merits of privatization will drown out such scare tactics.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Free the Arts and Humanities: Defund the NEA and NEH</H3></CENTER>
<P>

<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Over the years, a total of more than $5 billion in taxpayer money has gone toward the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  These federal agencies disburse millions of dollars each year in grants to institutions and individuals, most of which are not controversial.  But continued revelations of wasteful spending, public sponsorship of blatantly anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-business, pro-feminist and pro-homosexual "scholarly" projects and "art works" may finally motivate Congress to defund the endowments. 
  <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House Budget Resolution (H. Con.Res. 67), which passed 238 to 193 on May 18, provides no funds to either of the endowments.  A separate reauthorization bill, however, sponsored by Rep. Bill Goodling (R-Penn.), passed the Education and Economic Opportunities Committee on May 10.  That bill would phase out NEA and NEH by 1999 and is awaiting floor action.  In the Senate, the budget resolution sponsored by Sen. Pete Domenici (R-Ariz.) would cut the endowments but not phase them out.  Senators Jeffords, Kassebaum, Kennedy, et al. have introduced S. 856, the Arts, Humanities, and Museum Services Act of 1995.  This bill would reauthorize both endowments.  Introduced on May 25, it was referred to the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Most legislation on the NEA and NEH seeks to trim funding.  But merely reducing the budgets for the endowments would be breaking faith with American voters who want government to cut back on non-essentials now.  And leaving the endowments bleeding but still very much alive guarantees several years of shrill politicking by subsidy-seeking arts and campus groups.  It also ensures an easier renewal of spending if Congress falls back into 
liberal hands.
<P>
The NEA is budgeted $162.5 million in fiscal 1995 (down $4.5 million from $167 million because of an earlier rescission bill).  NEH is budgeted $172 million (also trimmed by $5 million from $177 million).  The House bill would also place a 5 percent cap on administrative expenses, thus gutting the Washington operations of the endowments, and send 80 percent of the grant money to the state arts councils in block grants.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  An attempt to zero out funds for NEA and NEH failed in the House Education and Economic Opportunities Committee, which settled for the phase-out.  But the House Budget Resolution calls for no funding.  House negotiators will have to choose whether to do the right thing (zero out the agencies) or succumb to pressure from liberal colleagues and the more liberal Senate to retain the agencies in some fashion.  The latter course will earn budget cutters no love from the arts and humanities crowd, and will only ensure more conflict in the years ahead.   
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Religious Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Although the First Amendment to the United States Constitution includes the right to freely exercise religion, the ultra-broad interpretation of the provision prohibiting government from establishing a religion has nearly nullified the free exercise right.  A restorative amendment is needed to return to citizens their full First Amendment rights.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a coalition of congressmen and pro-family groups in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) may cosponsor the amendment.  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The amendment has not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Before any proposed language is introduced, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution will hold hearings around the country on the topic of  "Religious Liberties and the Bill of Rights."  The first hearing was scheduled to take place in Washington, DC on June 8, 1995, followed by hearings in Harrisonburg, Va., Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, New York City, and Philadelphia.
  <P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The starting point for this legislation was H. J. Res. 424, introduced October 7, 1993, which contained the language discussed in the Senate during the Reagan Administration.  The premises upon which this effort is based include the following:  that a constitutional amendment approach is necessary due to existing court decisions on constitutional grounds; that participation in prayer should not be compelled; and that neither a moment of silence nor government-mandated language is acceptable.  While the language of the amendment is not yet final, it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other religious expression where non-religious expression is permitted, and from discriminating against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  This amendment will see heavy opposition from the ACLU and like-minded groups.  It is unclear whether the "super-majority" (two-thirds) needed for the amendment to pass is possible. 
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Parental Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Increasingly, parents' efforts to teach their children morals, values, and discipline are frustrated by government bureaucrats who claim a superior role in the development of the child.  A law is needed to restore to parents the right to direct the upbringing of their minor children without governmental interference.

<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) are each drafting legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The bills have not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:   Both bills are on hold while the Family Research Council and other pro-family groups hammer out appropriate language.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Parental Rights Act is designed primarily as a response to parents' inability to control important aspects of their children's education.  The Act would, for example, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.   However, the Act not only protects parents' rights vis a vis education, but also prohibits government interference with regard to medical decisions for their children, reasonable corporal punishment of their children, and the direction of, or provision for, religious teaching for their children.   Some pro-life groups have some concern that the medical decision provision of the Act would prohibit governmental intervention in cases where parents attempt to coerce a daughter into having an abortion.  Similarly, there is currently some doubt as to whether the Act would indeed provide a counterbalance to privacy arguments against parental consent statutes, as it was originally envisioned.  The concept of statutorily restoring parents' rights is a good one, and, once the wording issues have been resolved, the Act will need support from pro-family citizens.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:	The bills will likely be introduced and debated this term.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism</H3></CENTER>

<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation is a federally-funded program created in 1974 to provide poor people with access to expensive legal services.  In actuality, LSC serves as a deep well for anti-family litigation.  Each year hundreds of millions of dollars in legal services are donated to the poor from the private sector.  This $415 million a year pot of gold for the anti-family movement is not needed and should be abolished.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  There is no pending legislation dealing narrowly with Legal Services Corporation, but the House and Senate budget resolutions each call for rolling back LSC funding.  Thus, legislation which at least reduces funding of LSC is likely to come out of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees later this year.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Although there is no current legislation on LSC, pro-family groups, including FRC, are working on strategies for abolishing it.  These efforts include a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole calling for the defunding of LSC.  In mid-May, Sen. Phil Gramm's Appropriations Subcommittee on Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies held hearings on LSC.  Sen. Gramm pledged to fight the appropriation of money for LSC in the upcoming appropriations bill.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation has operated for 15 years without Congressional authorization.  Yet it continues to be one of the most powerful weapons in the anti-family arsenal.  LSC has played a major role in expanding abortion, divorce and the homosexual agenda.  It has spent $5 billion since 1974 on outrageous litigation ranging from providing cable TV for prisoners to forcing states to fund sex-change operations.  LSC has been a major combatant against welfare reform.  Supporters of LSC claim that it balances the scales in a system where poor people are at a disadvantage because of the high cost of legal services.  But state and local governments as well as bar associations and individual lawyers already provide a great deal of legal aid to the poor.  Instead of helping poor people, LSC often joins the efforts of well-funded anti-family groups such as the ACLU and the National Organization for Women.  Moreover, LSC lacks oversight.  According to Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) oversight has dropped significantly during the Clinton Administration.  Two years ago over 150 on-site audits took place, compared with fewer than 10 this past year.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle to defund the Legal Services Corporation will be a hard one.  Like many expensive government programs, LSC has appeal because it appears to help people in need.  Supporters will try to play to the public's sympathy for the poor, portraying those who want to cut the program as cruel.  But LSC's 21-year track record of radical anti-family activism will be brought to light during the debate.  Also, the deficit-conscious 104th Congress is more
likely to take a serious look at whether such programs are really necessary.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>3. What does FRC think about adoption?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC encourages and promotes the adoption of children by two-parent
families as a superior alternative to abortion, out-of-wedlock
parenting, and foster care.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> (1) Passage of a $5,000 adoption tax credit
for couples who choose to adopt a child.  (2) Removal of policy
barriers which discourage interracial adoptions.  (3) Amendment
of the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act so that Indian tribes would
no longer be able to retroactively overturn an adoption which
was approved by the child's biological parents.  (4) Encouragement
of crisis pregnancy centers, maternity homes, and family planning
clinics to provide adoption counseling for their unmarried pregnant
clients. (5) Shortening the time frame for biological parents
to make custodial claims so that children do not languish for
years in foster care, but are eligible for adoption sooner.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Adoption typically provides children
with a permanent, stable, and loving home.  It helps to break
the cycles of illegitimacy, single parenthood, abortion, and welfare
dependency.  And for foster care children, adoption also acts
as a preventative measure against being involved in crime, being
incarcerated, or becoming welfare-dependent.

<p>

Public opinion polls show that the American people consistently
support the choice of adoption.  For example, the Family Research
Council's &quot;1995 Family Issues Survey&quot; found that, when
presented with four options to resolve out-of-wedlock pregnancies
(adoption, marriage to the birthfather, single parenthood, or
abortion), more respondents chose adoption as the best option
than any of the others.  In reality, however, 46 percent of all
nonmarital pregnancies in 1991 ended in induced abortion, 10 percent
ended in miscarriage, and 44 percent were carried to term, of
which only 2 percent were placed for adoption.  So while the number
of potentially adoptable children is theoretically large due to
the high number of out-of-wedlock births and crisis pregnancies,
there remains a relatively small number of adoptable children.
Consequently, an estimated one to two million prospective parents
are still waiting to adopt a child.

<p>

Currently, there are 500,000 children in foster care, only a portion
of whom are legally adoptable at any one time.  Of these foster
children, 50,000 who are &quot;free&quot; to be adopted remain
in foster care for months or years.  Furthermore, every year,
15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot; from the foster care system
by turning 18 with no permanent family.  That these children languish
in foster care year after year is primarily attributable to two
reasons:  (1) The overriding emphasis on race-matching the child
with his/her adoptive parents has often led to major delays or
denials of adoptions, even when transracial adoptive homes are
available; and (2) The foster care system places an undue, and
often misguided, emphasis on returning children to their biological
parents, even when there are clear indications that the biological
parents have forfeited their custodial claims by abusing or neglecting
their children.  Thus, these children languish in foster care
even when adoptive homes are available.  If they are finally released
for adoption, many of them are much harder to place because they
are older and have generally acquired more behavioral problems.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Adoption benefits everyone.  It benefits the young,
unmarried birthmother and her life chances to finish school and
escape the welfare-dependency cycle.  It meets the child's needs
for stability and has a positive effect on the child's physical,
emotional, and psychological health.  It benefits the adoptive
parents who desire to have a family.  It benefits American society
because the children are reared in solid, two-parent homes without
cost to the American taxpayer.  It also provides a superior alternative
to out-of-wedlock parenting and abortion.  By promoting and enabling
adoptions to occur more easily, more children will have the opportunity
to be raised in loving, two-parent homes rather than to suffer
the vagaries that come with being wards of the state through
foster care or welfare-dependency.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>9. What national drug abuse policies does FRC 
support?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that:

<p><ol>

<li>The President must give the drug war a high priority.
<li>Congress must hold federal drug spending at current levels
until there is strict accountability, and then consider increasing
budget authority.
<li>The drug czar must be made subordinate to the attorney general
to coordinate all drug interdiction.
<li>Local communities must be allowed to tailor treatment and
prevention programs to local needs.

</ol><p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> America has successfully cut drug
abuse in half since 1979, but now it is rising again and emboldened
drug legalization proponents are calling for a surrender in the
drug war.  The drug war needs leadership, a unified national interdiction
effort, and a local prevention and treatment focus.

<p>

The absence of committed Presidential leadership has contributed
to the problem. President Clinton has been virtually silent about
drug abuse.  He has mentioned drugs in less than three percent
of the public speeches made during the first three years of his
administration.

<p>

The lack of Presidential attention to this issue tracks with a
growing view that illegal drugs are less dangerous and more acceptable.
This shift can be attributed to fewer news stories about the
risks of drugs, more pro-drug information, more legalization discussions,
and glamorization of drugs by pop culture.  In fact, last year,
the major television networks ran only 40 drug stories compared
to nearly 400 per year during the Reagan administration.

<p>

Drug abuse costs the nation perhaps half-a-trillion dollars annually.
The federal government will spend $13 billion fighting the drug
war this year, but much of this money will be spent without close
accountability.  This must change.

<p>

The federal drug effort is complicated by too many programs. 
There are 140 federal programs each with its own bureaucracy and
tangled set of procedures.  This scattershot approach isn't working.
The federal part of the war must focus on interdiction and turn
the rest over to local communities.

<p>

The drug czar should be subordinate to the attorney general just
as the surgeon general falls under the Secretary of Health and
Human Services.  That would eliminate redundancies and improve
the use of taxpayer dollars.  The drug czar should coordinate
the U.S. drug interdiction effort and speak out against abuse.

<p>

Other than the President providing the vision for a drug-free
America, drug treatment and prevention are issues the federal
government is poorly equipped to handle.  Consolidate federal
drug bureaucracies, streamline procedures and send authority and
resources to the local level.  Local communities working with
citizen-run groups can do a far better job than the federal government
at tailoring programs to meet local needs.

<p>

Include faith-based programs in the local solution and take steps
to ensure that government does not interfere in their religious
mission.  They have a proven record of long-term drug abuse recovery
and prevention effectiveness.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Drug abuse ruins lives, acts as a drag on our
economy, damages every American's quality of life via drug-related
crime, and robs America of its intellectual edge in a competitive
world.  This is a national crisis and deserves top priority.

<title>Republican Outrage -- ACU</title>

Liberal Republicans in the Senate are at it again, doing their best to derail the conservative
revolution -- and if you don't call or write today, they'll get away with it!<p>

Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, has introduced and passed an appropriations
bill for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services that reverses the hard-fought
gains we made during House consideration of the measure last month.  <p>

The bill as it came out of the House was the single most dramatic example of the conservative
revolution at work.  Among other things, the House version of the Labor-HHS appropriations
bill:<p>
<ul>
     <li>Ended welfare for lobbyists by placing new restrictions on taxpayer funding for political
     advocacy groups;<br>
    <li> Terminated funding for the Office of the Surgeon General;<br>
     <li>Ended taxpayer financing of abortions through Medicaid;<br>
     <li>Abolished the liberal Goals 2000 Program;<br>
    <li> Overturned President Clinton's executive order barring the use of striker replacements by
     federal contractors;<br>
    <li> Established tough new restrictions on the regulatory authority of OSHA and the NLRB.<br>
</ul>
But Senator Specter stopped the train in its tracks!<p>

Senator Specter -- who has a lifetime ACU rating of just 39, making him the 4th most liberal
Republican in the Senate -- decided to sabotage the work of his party's members in the House,
and refused to even consider any of these tough legislative riders.<p>

As you read this, the Specter version of the appropriations measure may already have passed the
full Senate -- but it's not over yet, because the two competing versions will still have to be
reconciled in a House-Senate Conference Committee.<p>

Call,  write or fax Senator Specter today, and let him know what you think of his arbitrary and
capricious decision to abandon his party's principles and support higher spending, more
regulation, and other failed liberal policies.<p>

You can reach him at:<br><br>

     SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER<br>
     530 Hart Senate Office Building<br>
     Washington, D.C.  20510-Concord, N.H. 03301<br>
     Phone:  (202) 224-4254   FAX (202) 224-1893<br><br>

Or, if you'd like, email your thoughts directly to the Senator at <a href="mailto:Specter@bizserve.com">Specter@bizserve.com</a>
<p>

Remember, it's not too late to act -- but to have an impact on this debate, you must call or write
Senator Specter today!<p>

Tell him you want him to support the original House-passed language in the Labor-HHS
appropriations bill.  Demand that he do his part to further the progress of the conservative
revolution, and overturn four decades' worth of failed liberal policies.<p>

Call or write Senator Specter TODAY and let him know just you think about his decision to
become a turncoat Republican.<p>

Together, we can fight Senator Specter's plan to let business as usual reign on in Washington. 
We'll keep putting the pressure on him here in Washington, but we need the help of good
conservatives like you to make it work at the grass-roots level.  <p>

So contact Senator Specter TODAY, and we'll be able to get a good, tough Labor-HHS
appropriations bill, like the one they originally passed in the House.<p>


Remember -- Senator Specter is running for President. If he has a campaign office in your state,
call there, too.<p>

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>2. What does FRC think about AIDS funding?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that funding and AIDS prevention should be redirected
in ways commensurate with the threat to the entire population.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> AIDS is a serious threat that has already
claimed a quarter million lives.  However, it enjoys a much higher
share of available prevention, research and treatment dollars
than other equally devastating diseases, and this must change.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In Fiscal Year 1996, the Department
of Health and Human Services will spend $5.35 billion directly
on AIDS, the highest per-victim expenditure for any of the nation's
10 most lethal diseases.

<p>

AIDS ranks near the bottom of the list of the top 10 mortal diseases
and last year accounted for about 42,000 deaths.  Meanwhile, heart
disease claimed 730,000 lives, and cancer killed 520,000.  Yet
this year, HHS will spend more on research for each AIDS death
($33,333) than for each death from heart disease ($1,201) or cancer
($4,615).

<p>

The point is not that AIDS should cease receiving serious attention.
HIV is a contagious and uniformly fatal disease, and its victims
deserve compassion and help.  Funding should continue for treatment,
prevention and care.  However, AIDS funding must be brought into
line with expenditures for other life-threatening diseases, and
the money must be redirected toward more effective approaches.

<p>

For many years, AIDS policy has been driven by the demands of
HIV-infected people who dominate AIDS organizations.  Their situations
are tragic, and their focus on finding a cure is understandable.
But because of their considerable influence, the lion's share
of AIDS funding has been spent for treatment of end-stage HIV
(AIDS) and not on the full spectrum of HIV disease.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Far more Americans die each year from cancer or
heart disease than AIDS.  Government should allocate resources
in proportion to the need.  To defeat the AIDS epidemic, government
must focus a larger share of AIDS funding on prevention.

BADEN</P><P>           JAMES Watt, Ronald Reagan's first Secretary of the Interior, was an environmental paradox. To environmentalists, he personified an obsolete view of nature, a view seeing only commercial value in natural resources. But for the Greens, Watt was a useful icon of rapacious industrial exploitation. As such, he deserves much of the credit for the rise of professional environmentalism. He was the enemy that united their followers. He fueled massive fund-raising campaigns to thwart the Reagan Administration's policy directives.</P><P>       As an unapologetic voice for industry, Vice President Dan Quayle is a pale incarnation of James Watt. Quayle, who runs the White House Council on Competitiveness, is the focal point of environmental groups for his deregulatory fervor and pro-business attitude; he supported efforts to allow logging in the Northwest's old-growth forests while dismissing concerns about the spotted owl. His message: the environment costs jobs.</P><P>       The Council's goal is to boost the economy by reducing the burdens of environmental regulations. For example, they proposed reclassifying hazardous waste, allowing the least toxic types to be buried at low cost in municipal landfills. But, independent of the merits of this proposal, it was withdrawn because of election-year environmental sensitivities.</P><P>       Environmental groups strongly favor Democratic vice presidential candidate  Al Gore over Quayle.</P><P>     Sen. Gore has been an environmental advocate for many years and has recently published &quot;Earth in the Balance,&quot; a personal treatise describing his eco-philosophy and prescriptions for change. He advertises his compassion and commitment to environmental issues and speaks constantly of &quot;the dangerous dilemma that our civilization now faces,&quot; and how he has renewed his commitment to ecology.</P><P>     And Gore's prescriptions are radical. One example from his book is &quot;the strategic goal of completely eliminating the internal combustion engine over, say, a 25-year period.&quot; This is a worrisome proposal because Gore considers only the benefits of this idea and not the concurrent costs. He fails to ask the question that good ecologists must ask when confronting a proposed change, &quot;And then what?&quot; What are the likely direct and indirect consequences of his proposals, such as an increased number of power plants to power the presumed electric cars?</P><P>        When considering the greenhouse effect, Gore asserts that skeptics' theories &quot;should not be given equal weight,&quot; because such consideration, &quot;undermines the effort to build a solid base of public support for the difficult actions we must soon take.&quot; He ignores a recent Greenpeace poll showing that nearly half of the atmospheric scientists polled agreed that we have experienced no warming due to the Greenhouse effect, and that another quarter or so don't feel sufficiently informed to take a position.</P><P>     Most disturbingly, Gore wants an elite to make decisions for a public he seems not to trust. His conscious rejection of open scientific debate and blind advocacy for governmental policies that will drastically affect every American are the marks of zealotry, not understanding.</P><P>     People who &quot;know&quot; the truth often seek coercive government action to enforce their visions. As America's founders so well understood, this approach is seldom the answer to our problems. Gore's unswerving, and uncritical, environmental ideology deserves the same skepticism as Dan Quayle's single-minded and shortsighted protection of business interests.</P><P>       Gore is right, however, when he sees a false dichotomy between jobs and the environment. We can have a clean environment and economic progress. In the long run they are mutually dependent. That is something which Vice President Quayle does not seem to acknowledge.</P><P>     But creating institutions that foster these real benefits is not easy. Converting rhetoric into reality is tough.</P><P>     Both Gore and Quayle could learn that the solutions to environmental problems lie with the cooperation of responsible decision-makers. Solutions must involve knowledge of actions affecting the environment, identification of those decision-makers who influence such actions, and creation of incentives for those decision-makers to act responsibly. The key step is the creation of new legal and economic arrangements that employ property rights and market incentives to achieve environmental ends. This is the environmental leadership America needs.</P><P>     Several environmental groups, such as The Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund, understand and apply this logic. Neither vice presidential contender, talking in absolutes about the apocalypse, whether it be environmental or economic, has yet articulated this understanding. Each promotes his own brand of environmental demagoguery.</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

<a name="quote">QUOTE</a> OF THE DAY<p>

<i>"This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did that
applause, the way you've been treated here, the way people have
been reacting to you, kind of make it all go away?" <p>
-- NBC's Maria Shriver in an exclusive interview with Hillary Clinton
after her August 27 speech </i>><p>

<center><h2><a name="networks">Networks</a> Concede It was a Liberal Night, But...
Hillary Asked to Respond to "Bitter Attacks"<p></center></h2>

    On Tuesday night the networks declared that speakers Mario
Cuomo, Jesse Jackson, and Hillary Clinton were liberals, but
instead of castigating Cuomo and Jackson for their negative
speeches, as they did with speakers in San Diego, they praised
their eloquence.  Like Monday night,
the Democrats again escaped any scrutiny of their intolerance on
abortion as the three broadcast networks each aired stories on
the disastrous impact of welfare reform.<p>

    -- Hillary portrayed as the victim of unwarranted Republican
attacks and given plenty of opportunities to fire back. Just
after she left the podium, NBC's Maria Shriver asked her nine
softball questions. See quote of the day below. For instance,
"You are credited with really redefining the role of First Lady
and for doing that, you've taken a lot of heat, a lot of
criticism. As you look back, do you wished you'd redefined it a
little less?" On CBS, Bob Schieffer asked her: "Weren't you a
little offended when he [Bob Dole] made the reference he did [to
your book]?" CNN's Wolf Blitzer inquired of her: "What goes
through your mind when you hear some of these bitter attacks
against you?"<p>

    -- The three big speakers were tagged liberal by all but CBS.
Peter Jennings called Cuomo and Jackson the "senior liberals in
the party," and ABC's Jeff Greenfield described Hillary Clinton's
speech as "liberalism lite." Tom Brokaw referred to Cuomo's
"traditional liberal litany." CNN's Bill Schneider noted Hillary
Clinton's "liberal policy agenda." Whitewater was mentioned twice
by NBC last night; CNN's Judy Woodruff mentioned it Monday night.<p>

    -- The wealth of Democratic delegates and the quota system
that selected them have gone unmentioned in prime time so far. A
graphic on last night's NBC Nightly News reported 35 percent earn
over $100,000. In San Diego, 38 percent fell in that category,
prompting CBS, CNN and NBC to ask if the GOP delegates were out
of touch. Some reporters have noted that Democrats are split
50-50 male-female, but none has wondered if the quota system
might contradict party rhetoric about opposing quotas.<p>

    -- Abortion, the focus of the networks in San Diego, has been
blown aside in Chicago. Kate Michelman, head of the National
Abortion Rights Action League and a supporter of partial birth
abortion, addressed the convention. But her early evening speech
failed to spur any talk about extremism. The Democrats at the
last minute also allowed pro-life Rep. Tony Hall to speak, but
that action didn't generate any media interest in why the
Democrats felt compelled to make the move. Abortion came up only
on CNN, but before prime time, as Judy Woodruff interviewed
former Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey on the 7pm ET Inside
Politics.<p>

    -- Welfare reform reported from the viewpoint of potential
victims on ABC, CBS and NBC without any voices in favor of the
new law. <p>



<center><h2><a name="Kay">Slashing</a> Attacks on GOP Never Scorned As Negative
Reporters Swoon Over Cuomo, Jackson</center></h2><p>

    On Tuesday night in San Diego, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and
Rep. Susan Molinari made jokey remarks about President Clinton
and were tagged as "attack dogs." Last night, Jesse Jackson
declared: "President Clinton has been our first line of defense
against the Newt Gingrich contract, America's right-wing assault
on our elderly, our students, and our civil rights." Mario Cuomo
announced: "The Republicans are the real threat. They are the
real threat to our women. They are the real threat to our
children. They are the real threat to clean air, clean water, and
the rich landscape of America...in the end, Bill Clinton spells
hope and Republicans spell disaster." Did the media see "slashing
partisan attacks"? Hardly. Note each network's contrast: <p>

    -- CNN's Ken Bode oozed: "Convention rhetoric has not been
much better than it was tonight, particularly with Jesse Jackson.
And of course, no one's going to forget for some time the First
Lady's speech, which was also terrific."  Farai Chideya gushed:
"Jesse Jackson's speech was extraordinary in its sense of hope,
purpose, and vision." Bob Franken asked Andrew Cuomo: "It was
quite a scene watching as they listened to the speech. You really
are a fan of his speaking style. It's amazing, isn't it?"
In San Diego, CNN's Judy Woodruff declared: "Well, they said it
was going to be a Clinton-bashing night at the Republican
convention, Bernie, and I think that is just what we heard from
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison." Bernard Shaw replied: "And the
bashing will continue when the keynote speaker, Susan Molinari,
steps up there."<p>

    -- Last night, ABC's Peter Jennings asserted: "Just a little
earlier this evening going out of their way, the Democrats were,
to show they embrace the differences among them or between them,
they put forward to speak two of the senior liberals in the party
who did more than anything else on this day to energize this
crowd."<p>
    In San Diego, Jennings began: "Expect tonight to see very
much the attacks on President Clinton ratcheted up to a much
greater degree than they have been so far." Sam Donaldson added:
"Tonight, as you say, Peter, they are expecting red
meat...Tonight they want to hear President Clinton bashed." <p>

    -- Last night, Dan Rather suggested on CBS: "Mrs. Clinton
received a ringing defense during what was clearly the most
stirring speech of the convention so far." Bob Schieffer added:
"The man who made that speech was Jesse Jackson, who can make a
speech when he sets his mind to it. But his biggest applause line
came when he said that Democrats must set up a line of defense to
protect the old and the young from the Republican assault, and
then he said, and to set up a line of defense against their
vicious attacks on the First Lady. The place just went wild when
he said that."<p>
    In San Diego, Rather said Hutchison "is expected to hit
President Clinton rhetorically with everything short of a tire
tube." Schieffer asked the Senator: "I must say it's Attack Dog
Hutchison tonight. How do you feel in this new role?" <p>

    -- Last night, Tom Brokaw noted: "The old lion has not lost
its roar. There are very few speakers left in America who can
switch on a hall like Jesse Jackson. He has done it so many times
in the past. He began tonight in more muted tones, but of course,it's almost irresistible for him, and it grows out of a very deep
passion." Tim Russert added: "The crowd is letting loose a little
bit because the passion and the philosophy of Jesse Jackson is
something they very much ascribe to, and by him bridging the gap
and endorsing Bill Clinton so wholeheartedly, it's a plus for
Bill Clinton."<p>
    In San Diego, Brokaw told NBC viewers: "The party knows
better than anyone else it has to lower the threshhold of
perceived meanness on the part of the country." Russert
underlined the point: "Key words: mean-spirited and extremist.
They want to avoid those labels...I think the speech by Senator
Hutchison is dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be
interpreted by some people as mean."<p>



<center><h2><a name="most">"Most Economists"</a> Blame Spending, Not Tax Cuts for Deficit
New Survey Proves Dole Tax Cut News Wrong</center></h2><p>
    A just released survey of 700 economists found that "52
percent blame the growth of the federal deficit in the 1980s on
increased government spending more than on the Reagan tax cut,"
which was blamed by 48 percent. The fact that economists are
about evenly split contradicts many recent media reports.<p>

    "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the
budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan," announced
reporter David Bloom on the August 5 NBC Nightly News. Colleague
Mike Jensen insisted a few minutes later that "most analysts say
it's not good economics."<p>

    The next morning a headline over a Washington Post news story
declared: "Economists Question Dole's Plan." The headline over a
Boston Globe news story asserted: "Economists Cool to Dole's
Tax-Cut Plan: Candidate Speaks of Growth, but Analysts See No Big
Payoff."  <p>

    The poll of 700 members of the American Economics Association
discovered that 81 percent agreed that the Reagan tax cuts
increased economic growth. A plurality of 42 percent "want to see
the next Congress put a high priority on both restraining
government spending and cutting taxes," matching the Dole-Kemp
promise.<p>

    William Adams, a public administration professor at George
Washington University, directed the poll conducted August 19-21.
Though reported in this week's Weekly Standard and in Tuesday's
Washington Times, none of the above-mentioned outlets have yet
bothered to revise their claims.<p>


<center><h2><a name="voices">Voices</a> In Favor of Welfare Reform Vetoed by Networks
Welfare-State Television Sells the Liberal Line</center></h2><p>

    All three networks featured stories last night critical of
the new welfare reform law:<p>

    -- On NBC Nightly News, Tom Brokaw presented his view: "There
are serious questions about what happens to these people after
they're taken off the welfare rolls. Andrea Mitchell went to
Indiana to look at the conflict between fixing the system and
doing the right thing by people." Mitchell featured no welfare
reform proponents, just social workers, Jesse Jackson, and
impending victims: "Kimberly Gilbert will get benefits for two
years. After that, she's cut off, whether or not she finds a job.
That deadline is near for Charla Milton. Unable to find work, she
is terrified."<p>

    -- On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings suggested:
"Maybe if he is reelected, Mr. Clinton will do something to
reverse himself on welfare reform. Many of these delegates hope
so." Reporter Erin Hayes asked where the jobs would come from to
support welfare recipients: "An Urban League study found in
Chicago there are six times as many people who need work as there
are entry-level jobs available." Hayes aired no voices favoring
welfare reform, and concluded: "There is another concern as well:
the young children. When their mothers are made to go to work,
who will take care of them? Right now, no one really has an
answer. With so much still uncertain about welfare reform, it is
no wonder there is fear out there."<p>

    -- On the CBS Evening News, reporter Harry Smith also ignored
taxpayers and focused on victims: "We talked to four welfare moms
from across Chicago. They feel like they are this year's
political target...President Clinton seemed deaf to protests last
week when he signed the new welfare cuts into law. Cuts many
Americans support, but cuts these women think go too far." Smith
concluded: "Neighborhoods like Cabrini-Green have more than their
share of misery. Folks around here think misery is only going to
grow. Their long faith in the Democratic Party has been shaken,
and the actions of President Clinton confirm their fear that the
poor just do not count."<p>

<h3>Jack E. White Hot</h3><p>

    Time's Jack E. White exemplified the media's left-wing anger
against welfare reform in the September 2 issue: "Did anyone else
find it unnerving that only days before Bill Clinton signed a
welfare-reform law that will plunge more than a million children
into official poverty, he marked his 50th birthday with glitzy
celebrations in New York City that added $10 million to his
party's bulging campaign war chest? Shades of Marie Antoinette,
Newt Gingrich, and Jesse Helms." White complained: "As Jesse
Jackson has repeatedly and unavailingly pointed out, it makes
little sense to elect a Democrat if he governs like a
conservative Republican."<p>


<h3>Harshly Negative Attack</h3><p>

    In the same issue, Time columnist Margaret Carlson lit into 
the marriage of Bob and Elizabeth Dole: "Any time the Doles play
the family-values card, they are betting that divorce and
remarriage wipe the slate clean and stop the questions -- that
suddenly leaving your marriage and asking for an `emergency
divorce,' as Dole did from his first wife (when his daughter was
17), is morally equivalent if not superior to sticking out the
pain in your marriage and keeping a family together, as the
Clintons did...Now being divorced gives you a political pass, and
staying married gets you an inquisition."<p>


<h3>No Liberal Bias</h3><p>

    CBS News reporter Bob Schieffer told freelance newsman Marc
Morano in Chicago on Tuesday that the media don't tilt left: "I
think the media pretty well reflect American society. You know,
it's like when we had a draft army. You'd find one example of
everything there."<p>


<h3>Bayh vs. Molinari</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw put GOP keynoter Susan Molinari on the defensive
when he interviewed her two weeks ago on the NBC Nightly News,
but last night he took a more deferential approach in
interviewing Democratic keynote speaker Gov. Evan Bayh.
Molinari faced seven straight questions about abortion and women:
"So they look at the platform. It's pretty rigid in its language
on abortion. Then people like Susan Molinari and Jack Kemp and
Bob Dole say don't pay attention to the platform, pay attention
to what we do."<p>

    Brokaw also pressed Bayh from the left, but only made him
answer one hostile question: "If there is a debate in the party
at the moment, it is about welfare reform. A lot of Democrats, in
Congress especially, think we have gone too far, too fast, that a
lot of children, more than a million, could be put below the
poverty line." <p>

    Unlike with Molinari, Brokaw played up Bayh's rising star
status: "When you walk out tonight to deliver that keynote
speech, all over this hall and in the television booths and in
the print section, people are going to be saying `Evan Bayh,
future candidate for President of the United States. This is a
big moment for him.' You can't completely erase that from your
thinking?"<p>


<h3>Calling J.C. Watts</h3><p>

    Two weeks ago, ABC, CBS, and NBC carried none of Rep. J.C.
Watts' speech, which occurred during their live 10pm ET hour,
though GOP delegates loved it. Last night, ABC ran excerpts of
the pre-10pm ET addresses of Jesse Jackson and Mario Cuomo (and
on Nightline). CBS showed some Jackson clips.<p>

<center><h2><a name="women">Women</a> Naturally Scared by Republican Policies</h2> 
<h3>Morning Lectures on Tolerance</h3> </center><p>
 
Supposed GOP intolerance and how Republican policies scare women  
dominated interviews on Tuesday's Today and Good Morning  
America.<p> 
 
Talking to Susan Molinari, Christine Todd Whittman and  Kay  
Bailey Hutchison, GMA's Charlie Gibson laid out why women are  
turned off by Republicans: "It was the Republican Party that did  
take the lead on ending federal welfare payments as they have  
been traditionally paid over the last 50 to 60 years and the  
prime beneficiaries of that are women. It is the Republican Party  
that took the lead on reducing the rate of growth in Medicare and  
Medicaid. It is the Republican Party now that is trying to make  
an issue of denying education and benefits to the children of  
illegal immigrants. It is the Republican Party that has rejected  
in the last week or so, tolerance language on abortion in the  
platform."<p> 
 
Then he asked: "There was an attempt by some in the platform  
hearings to get language included in the platform that simply  
asked for toleration of dissenting views particularly on  
abortion. It was language that Bob Dole wanted in the platform.  
The party rejected him, it rejected your views, all three of you  
in this, is this a tolerant party, do you feel comfortable in it  
with its position on tolerance?"<p> 
 
Quizzing Colin Powell on Today, Katie Couric queried: "Does the  
party platform trouble you? Does the fact that that some of these  
governors opted not to speak because they were told they could  
not discuss their views on abortion, do all those things make you  
basically doubt that this is a big tent here?"<p> 
 
Tom Brokaw wondered: "Gen. Powell, the difference between having  
a position in your heart and campaigning on something as Jack  
Kemp now is going to be forced to do, is going to say to a lot of  
black Americans and a lot of people who feel that they are denied  
full access to the privilege of being a citizen in this country,  
`thats just utter hypocrisy. What is there in this platform or  
in this party tonight that says to the rest of the African- 
Americans out there, come on in, theres a place for you?"<p> 

<center><h2><a name="reporters">Reporters</a> Stick to "Extremist" Labels on Republicans  
</h2> 
<h3>Media Echoes of Clinton Consultants</h3></center> <p>
 
Using the description extreme to tar the Republican party did  
not begin in the convention aisles of San Diego, but in the  
sullen liberal reaction to the Republicans electoral sweep in  
1994. Clinton consultant Dick Morris advised his White House  
clients to tag their opponents as extremist while at the same  
time stealing many of their positions. The media echoed the  
Morris strategy. MediaWatch analysts used the Nexis news data  
retrieval system to search for the word extreme within 25 words  
of "Republican" or "Democrat" in the three news magazines (Time,  
Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report) and USA Today from  
January 1, 1993 to May 31, 1996. <p> 
 
Analysts discovered reporters did not use many extremist labels  
in 1993 and 1994  41  but 26 of those were applied to  
Republicans, compared to ten mentions of dual extremes and only  
five for the Democrats who ruled both ends of Pennsylvania  
Avenue. Liberal moves to insure abortion on demand, gays in the  
military, nationalized health care, and massive tax increases  
werent beyond the media pale.  <p> 
 
But in the first 17 months of GOP control, Republicans were  
described as "extreme" in 123 stories, while only 15 found  
"extremes" on both sides. Just two mentioned "extreme" Democrats.  
In total, these six print outlets employed 149 extreme labels for  
Republicans to just seven for the Democrats.<p> 
 
USA Todays Richard Benedetto exemplified reporting on Republican  
extremism on June 16, 1995: "Democrats are trying to keep a stiff  
upper lip as they continue to oppose `extreme GOP cuts." Many of  
these were attributed to Democrats, but more than 20 came  
directly from reporters, such as Gloria Borgers March 11, 1996  
U.S. News suggestion that "taking on Buchananism would be good  
for Gingrich. Recall that until Buchanan surged, Gingrich was  
Washingtons resident extremist."<p> 
 
U.S. News & World Report reporter Kenneth Walsh claimed on March  
25, 1996: "Clintons feuds with some allies will make it harder  
to label him a liberal extremist, George Bush in 1988 caricatured  
Michael Dukakis." On October 27, 1995, Walsh happily noted:  
"President Clinton, playing Horatius at the bridge against the  
Republican hordes, is finally winning some favorable reviews.  
Democrats are rallying to his side as he defends the poor and  
elderly against GOP `extremism."<p> 
 
The "extreme" pattern also occurred in television coverage of the  
1996 presidential primaries. MediaWatch analysts studied the  
application of labels in primary stories from a week before the  
New Hampshire primary (February 13) to the South Carolina primary  
(March 2). Republicans and their supporters were labeled on 73  
occasions  45 of those extreme labels, almost all applied to  
Pat Buchanan. On February 25, 1996, CBS weekend anchor John  
Roberts asked consultant Joe Klein: "Some call Buchanan an  
extremist. Others call him American as apple pie. What is this  
fellows appeal?" Answered Klein: "He is both. He is an extremist  
and as American as apple pie." Using the same research parameters  
for a similar three-week period during the 1992 Democratic  
primaries, featuring ultraliberals like Tom Harkin and Jerry  
Brown, reporters used no extremist labels and only four  
applications of "liberal," all in the first two days of the study  
period.<p> 
 
In 1995, the networks introduced GOP presidential candidates by  
noting their "extremism." In 40 network stories introducing  
potential Republican challengers to Clinton, network reporters  
used 54 labels, 49 of which were "conservative" or more extreme.  
In fact, 19 labels, or 35 percent of the total, were labels such  
as "right," "far right," "hard right," "hard-line," "extremist,"  
'Republican fringe," and "ultraconservative fringe." On the  
February 24, 1995 CBS Evening News, reporter Linda Douglass  
alleged: "For years, critics have called [Sen. Phil] Gramm an  
extremist. But he argues these days his ideas are in the  
mainstream." In 27 stories introducing the Democratic candidates  
in 1991, none ever used an extreme term like "far left" or  
"ultraliberal."<p> 

<center><h2><a name="bryant">Bryant</a> Gumbel Scolds Delegates for Lack of Inclusion
But NBC Calls GOP-TV Unfair</h2></center> 

To keep "out what officials call the biased liberal media, NBCs 
Bob Faw reported Tuesday morning the RNC launched GOP-TV to 
provide complete convention coverage. Faw asserted: "What GOP TV 
calls unfiltered, doesnt even begin to pay lip service to 
balance or fairness." NBC should know.<p> 

Heres how Bryant Gumbel opened the Tuesday Today: "Good morning. 
Retired general Colin Powell, a new recruit to the GOP cause, 
addressed the delegates in San Diego last night, drawing cheers 
with accounts of why he became a Republican and why hell vote 
for Bob Dole. But although his speech was generally well-
received, the reception was restrained, and there were boos 
whenever Powell steered away from the right. Though they booed 
and also heckled dissent, Republicans claimed the mantle of 
inclusion throughout the first night of their convention. We can 
expect more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996."
Guess which network scares journalists? Faw reported that 
"Jonathan Alter of Newsweek thinks GOP TV has started something 
deceptive and unwholesome." Alter explained: "It is political 
propaganda, masquarading as news, and thats a problem."<p>

Political propaganda masquerading as news? Sounds like Bryant 
Gumbel.<p>

<center><h2>Republican Officials Grilled by Network Reporters
A <a name="Tax">Tax</a> on Credibility</h2></center>

The credibility of Bob Doles tax cut proposal arose as a topic 
for skeptical questions Tuesday night.<p> 

On PBS, referring to a Concord Coalition official, Margaret 
	Warner inquired of Dole economist John Taylor: "Does Martha 
Phillips have a point that its hard to credibly make the case 
that you can both cut taxes and balance the budget?"<p>

NBCs Maria Shriver asked New Jersey Governor Christie Todd 
Whitman: "Bill Clinton has said that Bob Doles proposal for the 
economy would end up crippling the economy, balloon the deficit. 
Why is he wrong?"<p>

Early in the evening, Tom Brokaw demanded of Virginias George 
Allen: "Governor, are you not at all concerned about what happens 
to the federal deficit, which is a major, major concern for most 
of the delegates at this convention, based on the polling that 
weve done, if Bob Dole is able to put into effect his 15 percent 
tax cut?"<p>

And: "But if you say to your constituents in the state of 
Virginia, Listen, were going to cut it by 15 percent, taxes, but 
I cant touch 60 percent of the budget that were dealing with 
here, and thats the reality thats facing Bob Dole because of 
Medicare and defense spending and other things, do you think that 
we can get home-free here in seven years and balance the 
budget?"<p> 

<center><h2><a name="Hutchison">Hutchison</a> Speech Tagged "Dangerous" by NBC: Republicans Pummeled from the Left </h2></center>

"Tonight they're ready to take on the Clinton record and try to convince 
a lot of undecided voters that this party is more inclusive than its 
reputation," Peter Jennings announced at the start of ABC's convention 
coverage Tuesday night. But the networks wouldn't let the Republicans 
succeed. NBC Nightly News on Tuesday night devoted its "In 
Depth" segment to "a major problem for the GOP, the gender gap, moderate 
women feeling left out."<p>

A few hours later NBC's Tim Russert relayed as accurate the Democratic 
analysis of the address by Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. He 
charged: "Key words: Mean-spirited and extremist. They want to avoid 
those labels. They have thus far after two days and that's why you're 
not going to see Newt Gingrich in prime time tonight. I think the 
speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is dangerous, Tom, because she 
uses words that could be interpreted by some people as mean."<p>

Before the speech, Dan Rather offered a classic Ratherism: "Senator 
Kay Bailey Hutchison has now come out to the podium. She's expected 
to hit President Clinton, rhetorically, with everything short of a 
tire tube." But for the second night in a row Republicans were 
bombarded with questions and analysis that portrayed them as extreme 
and intolerant of anything outside their "rigid" views.<p>

The networks peppered the Republicans with questions from the liberal agenda. 
While the majority of questions dwelled on poll numbers and tactical gambits, 
interviews in the first two nights of prime-time network coverage 
featured 35 questions and statements from the left, to only four from 
the right. The evening newscasts contained eight liberal questions 
to zero conservative inquiries. One observation from the right last 
night: CNN's Judy Woodruff noting that "as a pro-life delegate said 
to me this morning..'I was interested in what Colin Powell had to 
say last night but I'm wondering when we're going to hear from a pro-liife 
point of view at the podium?'" For liberal questions, see pages 2 
and 3. <p>

Coverage focused on gender gap and intolerance on abortion as 
reporters suggested it's rational for women to not back the GOP. 

<center><h2><a name="Speechless">Speechless</a> Networks</h2></center>

In their "coverage" of the convention last night, none of the 
three broadcast networks gave any live airtime to prime time 
speeches by Reps. John Kasich and J.C. Watts and Gov. Christie 
Whitman. While ABC and CBS did show Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchisons 
speech in its entirety, NBC aired less than 2.5 minutes of it. 
While Hutchison was still speaking, NBC cut to Tim Russert, who 
gave the Democratic "rapid response" to it  even before it was 
over.<p>

Russert quoted the Democrats press release: "Once again the 
Republicans have showed the face of Bob Dole and Newt Gingrichs 
Republican Party through Sen. Hutchisons speech. It is nasty, 
gratuitous attacks against the President of the United States and 
mean-spirited." According to Russert, Hutchison gave the 
Democrats "what they wanted in order to respond in this way. 
Viewers just had to take his word for it.<p>

<h3>Summary or Pillory?</h3>

Tuesdays New York Times "convention summary" trashed the GOP 
platform: "The one adopted yesterday is extremely conservative, 
careening to the right on social issues like immigration, 
welfare, and homosexual rights, and omitting the word 'tolerance 
in an unbending abortion plank that fueled weeks of bitter 
intraparty debate."<p>

<h3>Two CBS Spins on Powell</h3>

Monday night Dan Rather said: "General Colin Powell was generally 
applauded by most of the delegates. There was a point, however, 
when he was clearly booed by many of the delegates in this hall. 
It wasnt just a case of scattered boos when Colin Powell said `I 
support a womans right to choose on abortion, and `Im a 
supporter of affirmative action. Thats the point when the boos 
came."<p>

On Tuesdays CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart delivered 
a different take: "General Colin Powell was the four-star hero of 
the evening, moving the crowd to numerous standing ovations and 
even cheers for his most controversial comments."<p>

<h3>Attention Bill Paxon</h3>

Keynote speaker Susan Molinari isnt married? During Tuesdays 
World News Tonight anchor Peter Jennings posed this question to 
an ABC reporter: "I want to go down to the floor for a moment to 
ask a fairly important question of Michel McQueen. Susan 
Molinari: single, white professional woman is going to be up 
there. You could argue that shes going to look out of place in 
some respects at this convention, couldnt you?" A few minutes 
later Jennings admitted he had `goofed.'<p>

<h3>A Bit of Media Intolerance?</h3>

As three MRC employees were leaving the Horton Grand Hotel in San 
Diego on Tuesday, they were approached by a woman wearing a 
Dateline NBC hat, traveling with three credentialed NBC 
cameramen. She inquired if their `Team Clinton' T-shirts were 
pro-Clinton, to which one MRC employee replied, "No, you have to 
read the whole thing." After she read the `pro-Clinton press 
corps' caption on the shirt featuring a drawing of three TV 
anchors, she quipped, "Oh, theyre anti-media. I guess the term 
`extremist still fits, huh?"<p>

<center><h2>Republicans Called Unconcerned About <a name="rape">Rape</a> Victims:
Another Round of Media Intolerance</h2></center>

Prime time and the evening news shows again emphasized how the 
Republican Party is shutting out pro-choicers and on how women 
are turned off by the party's stands. See page one for a tally on 
the agenda of questions.<p>

Keynoter Susan Molinari got grilled from the left by Tom 
	Brokaw on NBC Nightly News: After asking about how women can 
relate to a platform  that's "pretty rigid in its language on 
abortion," he posed this question: "In the convention hall itself 
tonight, as you try to reach out to American women across all 
spectrums of American life, you have here a delegates [sic] by a 
factor of two to one, white males, many of whom are making more 
than $100,000 a year. Doesnt that make it difficult for a lot of 
American women to identify with...."<p>

Just after rape victim Jan Licence's speech on victims rights 
last night, NBC's Maria Shriver seemed baffled: "But why [speak 
out] at a Republican convention? So many people have said that 
they dont think this ticket, or perhaps this party, is 
supportive of womens issues. Why make this stand here?" Tom 
Brokaw interviewed Licence later and asked: "Do you think -- this 
is a party that is dominated by men and this convention is 
dominated by men as well...Do you think before tonight they 
thought very much about what happens in America with rape?"<p>

ABC's Peter Jennings endorsed the "rights" spin of women who 
oppose the GOP's abortion plank: "Polls commissioned by the 
Republican party show they have lost nearly ten percent of women 
since they have voted the Republican majority into the 104th 
Congress in 1994. The right to abortion has never been an over-
whelming issue for women at election time. But this fight within 
the Republican party has many Republican women questioning how 
far this party is willing to go to limit their rights."<p>

Michel McQueen of ABC found the Democratic quota system to be 
better: "When you go to the Democratic convention in Chicago in 
two weeks youll see that half the delegates on the floor are 
women. And thats a powerful message when half the voters are 
women. But dramatically its also true that women have not 
responded well to a message that at times been considered too 
harsh, too mean."<p>

<b>Top Ten & Dan on Castro's Health</b>
<p>
Two bits of humor today:
<p>
    1) David Letterman's Top Ten list from Friday night: "Top Ten
Revelations In The New Tell-All Book About The White House."
<p>
    2) Dan Rather asks Fidel Castro the question on everyone's
mind -- about a certain organ.
<p>
    > 1) Downloaded from CompuServe's E-Drive, here's the June 28
Late Show with David Letterman Top Ten List, copyrighted I should
note by Wide World Pants Inc. 
<p>
<b>Top Ten Revelations In The New Tell-All Book About The White
House:</b>
<p>
10. Hillary recently signed up for MCI's "Dead Friends and
Family" plan
<p>
9. Sometimes Bill skips the fries and just starts chugging the
Wesson Oil
<p>
8. Mattress in Lincoln bedroom is stuffed with shredded
Whitewater documents
<p>
7. In secret seances, Roger Clinton seeks advice from the spirit
of Billy Carter
<p>
6. If re-elected, Bill plans to open a "Hooters" in the west wing
<p>
5. Al Gore had to talk Bill out of awarding Medal of Freedom to
creator of the Arch Deluxe
<p>
4. Days before "Playboy" hits the stands, FBI informs President
of Playmate-Of-The-Month turn-ons
<p>
3. Clintons once paid a cable guy $50 to "juice them up"
<p>
2. With help of psychic advisor, Bill slept with ghost of Eleanor
Roosevelt
<p>
1. Bill's original choice for drug czar: Robert Downey, Jr.
<p>
     > 2) CBS Reports: The Last Revolutionary, a documentary on
Fidel Castro narrated by Dan Rather, will air July 18. In
Monday's (July 1) New York Post Michele Greppi reported that
Rather and two producers "gave a sneak peek at Victor's Cuban
Cafe last week." So, during the two days Rather spent with Castro
in April what kind of questions did the CBS anchor pose?
<p>
    Greppi reported: "Rather said that for 'men of a certain age'a common topic is prostate cancer. 'I grant you, this may not
have been a proper question,' Rather told reporters.
Nevertheless, the newsman asked the dictator, whose 37 years in
power ranks second only to Jordan's King Hussein: 'Prostate OK?'
<p>
    'OK,' replied Castro, who turns 70 in August."
<p>    
     30 years of oppressing and killing his people and Dan
Rather's first concern is whether his health is OK. Just when you
thought Rather couldn't get any wackier. -- Brent Baker

<center>
<H2>Find a job, or offer a job to conservatives through the Employment Placement Service</H2>
</center>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>By Jay Hopkins</B>
<P>
	<I>All that conservatives must do to win is elect those who share their values, right?<BR>
	Unfortunately, no.<BR> </I>
<P>	
<DD>	Elected officials come and go.  But staff may stay a lifetime.  Agency bureaucrats, Capitol Hill staffers and Gucci-shod lobbyists are the permanent ruling class of Washington. Some of them have more influence on legislation than many individual congressmen.    
<DD>	It's no secret that most Washington staff are liberal.  Or that they've grown comfortable with their power and perks.  Since they know full well that conservative government reform would end many of their careers in power, they use every trick in the book to resist real reform. 
<DD>	Morton Blackwell, president of the Leadership Institute, prescribes a treatment for Washington's plague of liberal staff:  replace them with conservatives.	
<DD>	That's why the Leadership Institute's Employment Placement Service (EPS) works to place committed and skilled conservatives in positions of influence on Capitol Hill, in government agencies, in think tanks and in the media. 
<DD>	The Employment Placement Service literally changes the culture of Washington.  Each year, EPS places scores of sound conservatives.  And thanks to generous Institute donors, EPS provides this vital service free of charge to both employer and job-seeker.
<DD>	"The Employment Placement Service is head and shoulders above other job placement programs in its quality of service.  It provides reliable and clear information about excellent candidates," said Mark Mix, vice-president for legislation at the National Right to Work Committee.  "I go to EPS whenever I have a position to fill."
<DD>	The placement service has earned a strong reputation among job-seekers, as well.  Heather Farish, who recently found a job through EPS, wrote,  "I had been told by three separate individuals the Leadership Institute is a good place to go to find a job.  But I never expected to see results in just two days."
<DD>	"All I did was fill out the application and have an interview with the placement director.  The next thing I knew, my phone started ringing.  I lined up a few interviews and was hired the next day.  Thanks for all your hard work," Farish said. 
<DD>	While EPS can't find every conservative job-seeker a public policy position in two days, the staff do go out of their way to assist in any way they can.   For example, staff help to fine-tune resumes to better market them to public policy employers.
<DD>	One person who benefited from the advice wrote,  "In just a few minutes over the telephone, I believe we improved my resume ten-fold.  I appreciate the helping hand."
<DD>	In addition to directly placing conservatives in public policy jobs, EPS also helps job-seekers to improve their chances to find a job through their own efforts.  Following a personal interview, one job-seeker wrote, "Wow! You really helped me focus my job-hunting strategy."
<DD>	Mark Montini, Leadership Institute vice-president for programs, said,  "EPS staff know what it's like to be out there looking for a job.  In order to help as many qualified people as possible, they work tirelessly to find new and more creative ways of getting employers' attention." 
<DD>	A new and innovative monthly fax newsletter aimed at employers is a case in point.  The newsletter highlights the qualifications of several individuals.  Employers are encouraged to contact EPS for more information on those and other job-seekers.
<DD>	Increasingly, EPS succeeds with its creative outreach.  Busy employers appreciate the fact that a simple phone call to EPS can get them carefully targeted resumes, usually within 24 hours.  And some employers even have EPS conduct reference and background checks on resumes they have on hand.
<DD>	Already, more than a few Capitol Hill offices and conservative organizations rely exclusively on EPS's free service to fill job openings.  Through EPS placements, conservative influence in public policy grows each day.
<DD>	Thanks to the many Leadership Institute supporters who share Morton's vision of principled conservatives in public policy, the time is nigh when government once again is the servant rather than the master of the people.

<h3>Chapter 2 footnotes</h3>
<P>



<P><B><A HREF="chpt2.html">Return to Chapter 2</A></B></P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="1">1</A></B></TT>	The 2.9 percent Medicare tax, as
explained above, applies to all income. The 12.4  percent Social Security tax,
however, applies only  to the first $61,600 of income (the reason being that
Social Security is somewhat akin to  an insurance premium; taxing additional
income would have the effect of boosting the  retirement benefits of those who
had higher  incomes during their working years).
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="2">2</A></B></TT>	This section is derived largely 
(though updated) from Robert Rector, &quot;How to  Strengthen America's
Crumbling Families,&quot; Heritage  Foundation <CITE><U>Backgrounder</U></CITE>
No. 894, April 28, 1992.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="3">3</A></B></TT>	Liberal and conservative economists 
agree that both shares of the Social Security tax  are in fact taxes on workers'
wages. See Joseph A. Pechman and Benjamin A. Okner, 
<U><CITE>Who Bears the Tax Burden?</CITE></U>  (Washington, D.C.: The 
Brookings Institution, 1974), pp. 2543.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="4">4</A></B></TT>	Data from the U.S. Bureau of the 
Census. Total pretax income includes the employer  share of Social Security tax
deducted from the  worker's wages. In this case, the median income for  a family
of four in 1994 is $47,012. Adding $3,596 from the employer's share of payroll 
taxes brings the gross family income to $56,608. 
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="5">5</A></B></TT>	<U><CITE>1994 Annual Report of the
Board of  Trustees of the Federal OldAge and Survivors Insurance and Disability
Insurance Trust  Funds</CITE></U>, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  April 12, 1994.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="6">6</A></B></TT>	This is not to suggest that 
politicians should be given power to invest the funds.  Such a policy inevitably
would result in political manipulation, as surplus funds would be  steered to
politically wellconnected industries  and used to bail out businesses in the
states and districts of senior lawmakers.  A governmentcontrolled retirement
system, by definition, must be operated on a  payasyougo basis.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="7">7</A></B></TT> The chart shows a decline in tax 
collections in the early 1980s, but this occurred  as a result of the 19811982
recession (which started, incidentally, before Reagan's  first fiscal year
began). Moreover, this decline  in revenue also took place before there was a
tax cut. The Reagan economic package was  approved in the summer of 1981, but
the tax cut  was phased in over several years and not fully implemented until
1985. The tax burden  actually rose in Reagan's first year in office, as the
minor tax cut in 1981 was overwhelmed  by previously legislated payroll tax
increases and inflationinduced bracket creep  (indexing to protect taxpayers
from inflation did not  go into effect until 1985). The 1982 portion of the tax
cut was more significant, but it  was roughly canceled out by bracket creep and
payroll tax changes.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="8">8</A></B></TT>	The Administration's $300perchild 
credit begins phasing out for families with  incomes above $60,000 and reaches
zero at $75,000  in family income. The credit increases in value to $500 per
child after 1998.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="9">9</A></B></TT>	For taxpayers filing jointly with 
incomes above $110,000, the credit phases out at a  rate of $25 for each $1,000
above the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out  at $130,000 in
income. For families with two children, the two credits are phased out fully  at
$150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000
in  income.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="10">10</A></B></TT>	Clinton's 1997 budget has modified 
this provision, thus making more families eligible for his $300 tax credit.

the Laurence H. Meyer and Associates macroeconomic model of the United States
economy.
</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="14">14</A></TT></B>	This also means that income should 
be defined properly. Provisions which force taxpayers to overstate their income,
such as  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  alternative minimum tax, would be
repealed. Nor should taxpayers be forced to  undercount business expenses. As a
result,  &quot;depreciation&quot; would be replaced by expensing.
</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="15">15</A></TT></B>	Taxation is not the only government 
activity that inflates the cost of hiring workers and reduces takehome pay.
Myriad  regulations, mandated benefits, unemployment  compensation, liability
costs, and labor laws  drive up the cost of employment and shrink  workers' pay.
</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="16">16</A></TT></B>	This process usually works by 
delaying, reducing, or canceling wage increases. In  most years, additional
investment and training increase worker productivity, making  employees more
valuable and allowing businesses to  increases wages. When these productivity
increases are accompanied by higher taxes, however,  it is government, not the
workers, that captures all the benefits.

</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="20">20</A></TT></B>	In its analysis of the Armey 
proposal, the Treasury Department admitted that &quot;no  attempt is made to
estimate the taxinduced behavioral responses of either individuals  or
corporations. Following the standard revenue estimating conventions used by both
the  Office of Tax Analysis and the Joint Committee on Taxation, the
macroeconomic aggregates,  such as the level of compensation, prices,
employment, and gross domestic product, have  been assumed to be unchanged by
the proposal.&quot;

</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="22">22</A></TT></B>	Assuming taxes would take only 15 
percent of the added output. Since taxes currently consume about 19 percent of

<center><h2><a name="ignoring">Networks Forget 1988 Tobacco-Growing Boast 
Ignoring Al Gore's Inaccuracy, Nastiness</a></h2></center><p>

    The networks delivered praise for Al Gore's speech last
night, ignoring his factual inaccuracies and failing to note how
he had boasted of growing tobacco as recently as 1988, four years
after the death of his sister from lung cancer. After Gore's
talk, in which he explained that his sister's death motivated his
anti-tobacco views, the networks did talk to tobacco-state
delegates. NBC's David Bloom spoke to a Tennessee delegate who
"does not agree with this demonization of this industry."<p>

    "Well, Dan, in a word it was a barnburner," gushed Bob
Schieffer on CBS last night. Though Gore said Republicans wish to
allow "more poison in our air and drinking water," Schieffer
didn't find him nasty: "This was an old-fashioned poli- tical
speech, the kind of speech that politicians used to give before
politics turned so nasty with all those commercials on
television." Though Peter Jennings noted the "attack dog" role of
a VP, no one  mentioned how Gore falsely accused the GOP of
"cutting" Medicare, of wanting it to "wither on the vine," or his
claim of 100,000 new cops on the street. Last Sunday
Scripps-Howard pegged the number at 12,000.<p>

    The New York Times reported July 3 that in 1988, Al Gore told
an audience of tobacco farmers: "Throughout most of my life, I
raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my own hands, all of
my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred it. I've hoed
it. I've dug in it. I've sprayed it, I've chopped it, I've
shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped it and
sold it." No network mentioned this boast, but ABC, NBC and CNN
did suggest hypocrisy. Jennings noted that "tobacco companies are
here in Chicago wining and dining the hierarchy of the Democratic
Party." NBC's Tom Brokaw recalled that "the Gore family were
tobacco farmers." On CNN, Judy Woodruff suggested that Gore "was
responding to what was said in San Diego," where his tobacco
roots were highlighted.<p>

    -- Clinton's week of new spending promises hasn't generated
a flurry of questions about how his plans will be paid for, but
Dole's tax cut plan led to concern in San Diego about its impact
on the deficit. One exception: Early in prime time last night
CNN's Charles Bierbauer reviewed Clinton's spending plans and
noted "Republicans say that is the road back to big government."<p>

    -- In stark contrast to San Diego, the networks failed to
describe Tuesday speeches as harsh or mean attacks. The morning
shows didn't raise the idea in interviews with Democratic guests.<p>


    -- The power of unions within the Democratic Party finally
gets highlighted as ABC's World News Tonight and CNN in prime
time examine their role. See page 3. But for CBS the problem
isn't union influence moving the party left, but how President
Clinton is too conservative for the rank and file. <p>

<center><h2><a name="no">More Raves for Jackson & Cuomo, Citations of GOP "Sniping"
No Snarling Partisan Negativity in Chicago?</p></center></h2></a>

    Wednesday marked Day Two of ignoring negativity from the
podium in Chicago:<p>

    -- On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings argued: "There
was a rather personal attack on President Clinton by Mr. Dole."
In the ABC clip, Dole said: "Tonight they'll bash Republicans.
Tomorrow night the President will sound to everybody 'If you're
for it, I'm for it. If Bob Dole's for it, I'm for it. If Jesse
Helms is for it, I'm for it. Whoever is for it, I'm for it, and
that's why you should re-elect me, because I don't have any
philosophy, I don't have any beliefs, I don't have any
commitments." Sounds a lot like network complaints about welfare
reform.<p>

    Jim Wooten raved over Jackson and Cuomo: "For a quick moment,
deja vu...That old-fashioned voice, full-throated, fierce,
raising the rafters worth of Chicago conventions...This was a
glimpse of conventions past, when liberals were still the lions
of the party and rhetoric roared....And the delegates, most of
them much more liberal than their convention projects of their
party, celebrated this little touch of yesterday." Wooten said
Hillary "answered Republican sniping at her book on raising
children."<p>

    -- CBS Evening News correspondent Bob Schieffer echoed
Wooten: "During the Republican convention, the Doles disparaged
Mrs. Clinton's book It Takes A Village, saying instead it takes a
family to properly raise a child."<p>

    -- NBC's Tom Brokaw called Jesse Jackson "The father who
began on the outside looking in, the fiery liberal voice of
protest and change...The old lion still has his roar."
The Wednesday morning shows took the same approach to negativity:<p>

    -- CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart suggested: "Mrs.
Clinton, you know, has been the target of a lot of attacks by the
Republican Party. She decided not to answer them, although she
did say it takes a village."<p>

    -- On NBC's Today, Jim Miklaszewski proclaimed: "This was the
night for the liberals. Jesse Jackson electrified the delegates,
exhorting them not to abandon Democratic liberal traditions."
Bryant Gumbel asked: "Would it be fair to say she wasn't as
strident, as hard-edged last night as usual?" Miklaszewski
dissented from the media's party line: "If you listen closely, I
thought she was just as hard-edged as ever."<p>

    -- ABC's Good Morning America co-host Charles Gibson
explained: "Mrs. Clinton expressed the core idea of the evening,
that government ought to be a proactive positive force, that idea
given forceful voice by two liberal icons who opposed President
Clinton's signing of welfare reform...the First Lady relied not
on her legal experience -- there would be no harsh edges on this
night -- but on her experience as a mother to push for new
legislation."<p>

    ABC interviewed Leon Panetta, and NBC interviewed the First
Lady, but asked no questions about negativity. Two weeks ago, the
morning shows all decried "bashing":<p>

   -- CBS This Morning co-host Jane Robelot reported August 14:
"It was unofficially Bash Bill Night last night in San
Diego...Speaker after Republican speaker went after the man with
a vengeance, including the keynoter, Susan Molinari."<p>

   -- "Congresswoman Susan Molinari took on the role of attack
dog last night, using her keynote address to attack the
President," Bryant Gumbel led off NBC's Today.<p>

    -- Good Morning America anchor Elizabeth Vargas asserted:
"Some of the harshest words were from Kay Bailey Hutchison, who
tried to paint the President as a tax-and-spend liberal." Charles
Gibson added: "Polls will tell you these days that people do not
want much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the
Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President
Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating habits."<p>


<center><h2><a name="where">Broder</a> Sounds A Rare Skeptical Note on Clinton, Welfare Fixer
Where Are Welfare Questions from the Right?</center></h2><p>

    Clinton officials assured conventioneers that he will "fix"
welfare reform after the election. That prompted The Washington
Post's David Broder, on CNN Tuesday night, to explain that
Democrats will be "the slickest sales people in the country" if
they cast Clinton as welfare's savior: "That's as logical as
saying that the guy who fumbled the ball on the two-yard line
ought to be put back in because he's the one who might carry it
through the next time." The networks have yet to suggest that his
welfare fix assurance might mean he really hasn't moved right on
the issue. Instead, liberal questions on welfare reform continued
on Wednesday night: <p>

    -- CBS reporter Ed Bradley asked Rep. John Lewis: "It's going
to be difficult, given the positions he's taken, particularly on
welfare, to get some people out?"<p>

    -- CNN's Gene Randall inquired of NAACP leader Kweisi Mfume:
"Do you think the President's signature on the welfare rights
bill will do him any harm politically in the African-American
community?"<p>

   -- On CNN Bob Franken asked Sen. Daniel Moynihan: "You of
course are very angry about the President signing the  welfare
legislation. But you haven't talked about it here. Why?" She
followed up: "Can the President, as many people suggest, fix the
welfare legislation in a second term?"<p>

    -- At the top of Tuesday's Nightline on the plight of
Chicago's poor, Ted Koppel warned: "They live literally in the
shadow of the convention in Chicago, but with their benefits now
in doubt, many feel betrayed by the President and the Democrats,
and look forward only to uncertainty."<p>



<center><h2><a name="labor">Labor's</a> Political Intolerance, Mob Ties Surface on TV
ABC, CNN Touch on Unions' Peculiar Politics</center></h2><p>

    While the labor unions have yet to receive the sort of Darth
Vader treatment reserved for Republican interest groups like the
Christian Coalition or the NRA, some reporters have presented
critical looks at the exercise of union power.<p>

    -- Last night, CNN became the first network to address the
issue of the unions' political intolerance, taking dues money
from Republican union members to elect Democrats. Reporter Wolf
Blitzer asked AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney: "Many of your members
are Republicans. How do you explain to them that you're using, in
effect, their dues to help elect Democrats?"<p>

    -- CNN campaign finance reporter Brooks Jackson delivered a
story last night on the unions' political campaign in which he
observed: "So Bill Clinton says the era of big government is
over? Not at the Democratic convention, where unionized
government workers are suiting up for battle against
Republicans."<p>

    -- On Tuesday's World News Tonight, ABC's Brian Ross
reported: "In the world of big money and Democratic politics on
public display this week in Chicago, this man holds a special
place. His name is Arthur Coia, who despite being president of a
labor union the FBI says has long been controlled by the Mafia,
the Laborers International has become one of the Democrats' top
money people, raising millions and gaining him special access to
the Clinton White House....In the last two years, the Clinton
administration has gone all out to court Coia and his union money
with invitations to the White House and an appearance by the
First Lady at a big union conference."<p>

    Ross added detail: "In an abrupt change of plans that raised
questions about whether the union's money to the Democrats had
bought it some kind of sweetheart deal, prosecutors dropped the
allegations and instead quietly negotiated a deal with Coia that
let him keep his job and put him in charge of cleaning up the
union."<p>


<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></center></h2><p>

<h3>Base Bias</h3><p>

    CBS Evening News is taking two different approaches to the
passionate poles that create each party's base. The day before
the Republican convention, CBS reporter John Roberts suggested
"hard-line anti-abortionists" controlled the Republican Party:
"Delegates are pursuing their own agendas and forcing party
leaders, including Dole, to fall into line behind them...so far
he rogue elephants seem to be calling the shots." <p>

    But on last night's broadcast, reporter Harry Smith's piece
on unions didn't talk about ideologically extreme unions pushing
around the party, but how Bill Clinton has failed to be liberal
enough for them:<p>

    "It still takes steel to make America's cars. It still takes
labor to get a Democrat elected President. But talk to the union
rank and file, and you'll find that their enthusiasm is less than
red hot.... We talked with United Auto Workers in Dearborn,
Michigan this week. Their biggest gripe: Bill Clinton's support
of the North American Free Trade Agreement...Organized labor will
invest millions of dollars to get Bill Clinton elected this fall.
These dues-paying members wonder if they are still getting their
money's worth."<p>


<h3>Poor Ann</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw didn't ask about harsh negativity during a Tuesday
night interview with former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, who
"delivered that rollicking keynote speech against George Bush not
so long ago." Brokaw asked about strong women: "You paid the
price to some degree. You lost the governorship of Texas because
this country still is a little bit schizoid, isn't it, about the
role of women in American politics?" <p>


<h3>Brokaw: Right is Wrong</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw was hit Tuesday with an anti-GOP comment he made
in San Diego. Freelance newsman Marc Morano showed him a quote,
cited in Media Reality Check '96, in which Brokaw asked rape
victim Jan Licence after her speech: "Do you think this is a
party that is dominated by men and this convention is dominated
by men as well...Do you think before tonight they thought very
much about what happens in America with rape?" <p>

    Brokaw read the quote, admitted "I did ask her that, which I
think is a fair question," then walked away. Earlier, Morano
asked why GOP delegates distrusted the media but Democrats don't.
Brokaw asserted that it's just because conservatives don't like
change: "I think a lot of reporters in fact, come from working
class, activist backgrounds. But I don't think that it really
colors the way that they report things and the conservatives
generally stand for the status quo and news is about change."<p>


<h3>Here's My Room Key!</h3><p>

    Great publicity isn't the only thing Bill Clinton picked up
on his train trip. Reporting on crowd reaction to Clinton's stop
at Michigan State University, NBC Nightly News on Wednesday found
one very giving student. Answering what she could give the
President, she yelled, "I'll give him my room key!" <p>


<h3>Used to Double Standard</h3><p>

    Reporters complained about the lack of hard news in San
Diego, but aren't doing so in Chicago. Radio host Don Imus asked
CBS's Bob Schieffer Wednesday morning why. Talk Daily reported
his response: "I guess we kind of got used to it."<p>

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>24. Does FRC support Title X of the Public Health Service
Act?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that defunding Title X is the first step in removing
the federal government's imprimatur on out-of-wedlock sex and
to halt its role in distributing contraception to minors without
parental consent.  Defunding Title X is justifiable and necessary
because the program has failed to achieve the goals of reducing
out-of-wedlock pregnancy and abortion.  Indeed, since the inception
of Title X, both the out-of-wedlock pregnancy and abortion rates
have increased dramatically.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b>  Zero out funding of Title X of the Public
Health Service Act.  If complete defunding is unsuccessful, support
efforts which cut funding of the program and/or insert &quot;strings&quot;
such as requiring parental notification or consent for any contraception
given to minors, or requiring outcome evaluations of clinics which
receive Title X funds to show their impact on pregnancy, STD,
and abortion rates among clinic &quot;clients.&quot;

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Title X of the Public Health Service
Act was enacted in 1970 as a grant program to fund family planning
projects throughout the country.  It has been funded by Congress
every year through the Labor/HHS Appropriations bills which Congress
considers and passes every summer as part of the federal budget.
The program helped to spawn the proliferation of family planning
clinics within states, granting federal sanction to the distribution
of contraception to unmarried women and to minors without parental
consent.  Title X received more than $193 million last year and should
be defunded altogether.

<p>

The reasons to defund Title X are numerous.  First of all, Title
X is a failed program.  Since the inception of Title X, out-of-wedlock
births, pregnancies, and abortions have all risen dramatically,
particularly in the populations Title X is supposed to have targeted.
Consider the teenage population alone.  Since 1970, the teenage
out-of-wedlock pregnancy and birth rates have doubled, the teenage
abortion rate has more than doubled, and many sexually-transmitted
diseases among teenagers have increased dramatically.  While not
all of this can be directly tied to Title X funding, it is certain
that the federal government's sanction for such programs has led
to an undermining of moral standards by accepting premarital sex
among teenagers as a cultural norm.

<p>

Secondly, Title X should not continue to receive federal funding
because it is an unauthorized program.  Its authorization expired
in 1985.

<p>

Third, Title X is duplicative.  Several other programs such as
Medicaid and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provide
family planning to low-income and other targeted populations.
There is no clear basis for the federal government to run a categorical
family planning program when state governments have the capability
to set health care priorities within the parameters of an alternative
block grant.

<p>

Finally, Title X's contraceptive approach leaves many vulnerable
girls open to abuse.  New studies show that most teenage mothers
are not &quot;sexually active&quot; ingenues, but rather victims
of sexual exploitation by much older men.  Title X's contraceptive
approach does not protect these young girls, it only &quot;equips&quot;
them for continued abuse.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Defunding Title X will help to uphold the first
principle of the Hippocratic Oath to &quot;do no harm.&quot; 
It will place limits on the wrongheaded attempts of the government
to redefine family life and the social parameters regarding out-of-wedlock
sex.  It will also help to lessen the large monetary advantage
that so-called family planning programs have over abstinence programs,
which have demonstrated superior ability to promote healthy attitudes
and behaviors in the young.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>23. What is FRC's position on spousal benefits?</h2></center>

<p>

In an effort to help alleviate the financial burden on families
in which one spouse stays at home, and to recognize the important
contribution that non-employed spouses make to the income production
of employed spouses (an acknowledgment commonly made in divorce
settlements), FRC fully supports spousal benefits.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Legislation allowing expansion of IRA benefits
to non-employed spouses.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Complementing the attractive idea
of expanding the uses of IRAs to help free up family finances
(e.g., penalty-free withdrawals to cover major housing, education,
and health expenses) is the proposal to broaden the eligibility
of IRAs to include non-employed spouses.  While broadening the
eligibility of IRAs in general would primarily benefit upper-middle-
and upper-income taxpayers, a more targeted broadening of the
eligibility to non-employed spouses would provide relief primarily
to middle-income families with children -- those most in need
of pro-family tax relief.  Currently, two-earner couples can claim
almost twice the benefits of single-earner couples, penalizing
those families who choose to stay at home with their children
and ignoring the significant contribution the full-time homemaker
makes to the income production of the employed spouse.

<p>

The acknowledgment of the non-employed spouse as a contributor
to the income production of the employed spouse is one already
made in divorce settlements, and is an important principle for
Congress to reinforce.  For families with children, current IRA
benefits financially reinforce families where both parents work
outside the home, while penalizing those families who choose to
have one spouse stay at home to care for the children.

<p>

Legislation broadening IRA eligibility was passed in both the
House and Senate, but vetoed by President Clinton in the proposed
budget for 1996.  Passage of legislation to help level the playing
field for single-earner families is a key step to providing relief
to American families.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The passage of legislation increasing pro-family
spousal benefits is key to underscoring the importance of the
family and to providing tangible aid to middle-class American
families.  Broadening IRA benefits to non-employed spouses would
give hard-working middle-class families help, by providing savings
and income options for families where one parent stays home to
raise children.

<title>Repeating NIH Press Releases</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<h2><center>Repeating NIH Press Releases</center></h2>
<p>
A widely circulated Washington Fax, published and edited by Bradie Metheny, confirms what many suspected: reporters often frame government spending stories along the lines of the press releases of the agencies affected. The fax noted that representatives of and those associated with the National Institutes of Health admit openly they manipulated media coverage to save funding for their agency. 
<p>
"Between May 7 and May 25," the fax reported, "biomedical research was featured in seven network news shows. ABC's Prime Time Live did a story on why funding for seemingly esoteric basic research is key to future advances in medicine. And on PBS, talk show host Charlie Rose interviewed researcher Paul Marks about the implications of the proposed cuts at NIH."
<p>
This same type of "if government doesn't do it who will" mentality was also prevalent in print media. According to the fax: "The New York Times editorial and Op-Ed pages both featured commentaries supporting a strong federal investment in biomedical research and science in general and condemning Republican budget proposals in this area. The Times also had a front-page story May 22 that said basic research was at risk in the battle over balancing the budget."
<p>
How did NIH manage such favorable coverage? "Much of the media activity was due to the efforts of the scientific community to focus attention on the budget cuts threatening NIH," reported the authors of the fax. "The New York Times coverage, for example, was in no small measure due to a lengthy phone call made from Washington state to the Times' board of editors by Jordan Cohen, president of the Association of American Medical Colleges."
<p>
The moral of the story: Public relations departments drive the news. Those wanting to cut government spending need to start working the phones.

> 1) The now famous Today exchange about smoking took place
in part two of a three part interview. On the first day, July 1,
Katie Couric displayed the conventional media wisdom about tax
cuts and balancing the budget: you can have one but not the
other. Here are her challenges to Bob Dole as he tries to explain
how he'll achieve both:<br>
    -- "So you don't support across the board tax cuts?"<br>
    -- "What's more important to you, tax cuts or balancing the
budget, if you had to choose?"<br>
    -- "If you had to pick one?"
<p>
     > 2) Margaret Carlson opened her July 15 Time column on
attention to the Gary Aldrich book by charging that "the press
has caught Mad Lie disease, marked by a loss of appetite for the
truth and projectile regurgitation of anything fed to it." In her
last paragraph, she wrote: "There was a time when by common
agreement a book like Aldrich's would die for lack of oxygen. Now
the mainstream media strive to get every sensational rumor 'in
play.'"
<p>    
Well, as MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham reminded me,
let's flip through Carlson's clip book. The July 1989 MediaWatch
quoted this paragraph from Carlson's November 1985 article in
Esquire magazine previewing the 1988 Republican contenders:
<p>
"What one does in Washington behind closed doors generally
stays out of the paper. But the persistent rumor that one of the
potential 1988 presidential candidates has a homosexual past is
testing the unacknowledged code of silence among reporters."
<p>
   > 3) On Tuesday night (July 9), the day the Senate passed a
minimum wage increase bill, Tom Brokaw announced that "the Labor
Department has discovered that millions of American workers are
being shortchanged on another front: overtime. They're working it, but they're not getting the dividend." As transcribed by MRC
intern Jessica Anderson, here are some excerpts from the story
that should have generated little sympathy from those with
salaried jobs.
<p>   
Reporter Mike Jensen began by talking with Becky Perkins who
"raises two children and works long hours as a parole officer in
Texas." She explained: "There's no way you can leave at 5:00. I
mean, you're staying there 'til six, seven, eight, doing just
paperwork alone, not to mention going out into the field to make
home visits."
<p>   
But, Jensen reported, "In spite of the long hours, the state
refused to pay Becky overtime, but the U.S. Labor Department
investigated. It said money was owed, that Becky had been
shortchanged....Workers like Becky are gypped out of an estimated
$20 billion a year in unpaid overtime. The worst offenders?
Construction companies, garment factories, toy makers, auto
repair shops, and food stores. Hundreds of thousands of victims
and very few complaints, says attorney Joan Keyok" [spelling
approximated].
<p>    
Following a soundbite from her, Jensen returned to the
"victim" theme: "Many of the victims are minimum wage workers
afraid of being fired, or immigrants who don't know their rights,
or older workers concerned about downsizing. They never see the
time and a half pay that's legally theirs."
<p>
    > 4) On a 0-10 scale of media bias from right wing to left
wing bias where does Eleanor Clift place the media? Here's her
answer from McLaughlin Group last weekend: "The press is right in
the middle. It's a five. The bias is for bad news."
<p>
    Another sign of progress: Not even a committed liberal like
Clift dares to say anymore that the media are biased to the
right. -- Brent Baker

BADEN</P><P>            I HAVE long held a vision of what a good society would include. Its most important elements are liberty, environmental quality and communities of people who value both. But only certain institutional arrangements foster these ends. History is unlikely to show that yesterday's election moved us toward these goals.</P><P>       But elections do cause thoughtful people to carefully separate their hopes from their expectations. We hope that people will weigh the public interest more heavily than their narrow self interest. However, elections usually teach us to expect concentrated interests to prevail and government to grow.</P><P>     Organized interests solidify their gains by creating institutions and agencies. With these in place, even modest reforms become difficult to enact. We see this in the protracted efforts to increase the price of grazing federal lands. For grazing on our family's Montana ranch we charge more than $10 per cow and calf per month. On federal land near ours, permit holders such as Metropolitan Life Insurance pay $1.85 for their Forest Service and BLM grass.</P><P>     This is a predictable consequence of political allocation. We would surely be far better off if the grazing rights recognized the value of wildlife habitat and were freely exchangeable on the open market. But today's political incentives work against such rational outcomes. This is just one example of a program that violates reasonable standards of economic efficiency, ecological sensitivity and social equity.</P><P>     America's founders understood that when governments control large sectors of an economy, governance becomes an exercise in relatively peaceful, although involuntary, wealth transfers. Stealth and duplicity are great assets in this game. It often takes great skill and dedication to discover these transfers.</P><P>     But the benefits of reform are widely diffused. No individual has an economic incentive to advocate reform as strongly as the beneficiaries do to preserve existing institutions. Large permit holders such as Metropolitan Life have more to gain from their subsidies than any single one of us will gain by fighting them. Today, only the congenital do-gooder has incentives to expose the waste and inequities of political mischief. I propose a modest reform: Let's create a Predatory Bureaucracy.</P><P>     The logic is simple and straightforward. It is part of the convergence developing between ecological and economic theory. Essentially, the predatory bureau would receive a small percentage of any budgetary proposal offered by an agency. Here's an outline of the process I initially envisioned.</P><P>     For most of us the term &quot;bureaucracy&quot; carries a crust of derision. Rigidity, inflexibility, insensitivity and persistence are their defining characteristics. However good our intentions in creating an agency, its budgetary imperatives ultimately lead it to stray from these goals. Over the long haul, bureaucracies are usually run for the convenience of its leaders and the clientele on whom they depend for political support. For those of us wanting reform, our design problem is to link this persistent tendency with the public interest. The predatory bureaucracy does so.</P><P>     We can learn a lot from a relatively successful example. The U.S. Post Office is closely and consistently monitored and faces increasing competition from Federal Express, fax, etc. Despite our complaining, the Post Office actually does quite well because it faces the kind of feedback we expect in the market. What can we do about agencies that do not have these checks on their performance? Here is where our &quot;predatory bureau&quot; can help advance the public interest.</P><P>     A predatory bureaucracy survives only by preying upon other bureaucracies' budgets. Like coyotes to rabbits and wolves to elk, it will eliminate many vulnerable programs.</P><P>     The basic idea is simple enough to write into a state initiative. We should create an agency whose income will only come preying upon the specific program budgets of other agencies. Suppose an agency proposes a new program, or seeks to continue an obsolete one. Our predatory agency may challenge this proposal. It will use the press, interest groups and other political avenues.</P><P>     Unlike most of us, this agency has a vital interest in defeating a wasteful idea because (unlike most agencies) it only gets funding from its successes. If the other agency's proposal loses, it receives 1 percent of the defeated agency's budget proposal. And the defeated agency loses that 1 percent and gets a proportional amount taken from its operating budget.</P><P>     After an initial two-years' funding, this agency will cost taxpayers nothing. Its income comes only from other agencies. Because all agencies will begin to act more wisely, on pain of being attacked by our predator, enormous amounts of tax money will be saved due to weak programs not being proposed.</P><P>     Incorporating a predatory bureaucracy into government may do more than elections to control government waste. It's a way to harmonize the public interest with the self-interest of experts in the political process. Let's consider this idea while waiting for next November.</P><P>_________ </P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.</P><P> </P><!--FOOT--><HR>

<h2> ***MRC CyberAlert: From San Diego***</h2></center><p>
 <center><h3>One item today:</h3></center><p>
    A Republican Party platform subcommittee passed a plank stating:
"We also recognize that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes 
differing views. We view this diversity of views as a source of strength."<p>
    Nonetheless, the very networks which barely touched in 1992 the refusal
of the Democratic Party to allow Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey to make a 
pro-life speech at their convention, pounced on the GOP Tuesday night for 
intolerance.<p>
    --  Here's how Peter Jennings opened the August 6 World News Tonight: 
"Good evening. We begin tonight with what you could certainly call zero 
tolerance. As much as Bob Dole would like to have the nation focus on his
very sweeping tax cutting proposals of yesterday, the men and woman who
will join him at his party's political convention in a few days are once 
again involved in a power struggle about abortion. Today by the time Mr. 
Dole spoke by satellite to his party's delegates, who were already gathered
in San Diego, all notions of tolerance on the subject of abortion had 
disappeared from the party's platform."<p>

    -- On the NBC Nightly News reporter Gwen Ifill's piece ended by showing 
Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld saying in a soundbite: "I don't want to 
drum the pro-lifers out of the party. I just want there to be room for me 
and them within the same description of the party."<p>
    Ifill then concluded: "But there's not enough room for the words abortion 
and tolerance to co-exist in this party's platform. Dole is gambling that 
voters care more about the economy and taxes than they do abortion. But he 
has undercut moderate Republicans at a time when he needs every vote he can 
get. Gwen Ifill, NBC News, San Diego."<p>

     It just shows that it pays to suppress any dissent. When you allow debate
and what reporters consider the wrong side wins they call you intolerant. <p>

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>19. How does FRC view the rights and responsibilities 
of parents?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the rights of parents to direct the upbringing
and education of their children without unwarranted interference
from the government should be protected.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Statutory recognition of the fundamental
right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their
children.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The past century has witnessed
a subtle shift in the role of child rearing from a private matter
to a matter of increasingly public concern.  At the turn of the
century, courts began to examine and uphold state compulsory education
laws; today, government bureaucrats display an arrogant &quot;we
know best&quot; attitude that manifests itself in such ways as
compulsory-attendance, value-free sex education classes for elementary
school children.

<p>

While the Constitution does not explicitly address the parent-child
relationship, the Supreme Court has historically regarded the
right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their
children as a fundamental right under the Fourteenth Amendment.
In the 1920s, the Supreme Court affirmed its high regard for
the integrity of the parent-child relationship in two landmark
cases:  <I>Meyer v. Nebraska</I> and <I>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</I>.
In <I>Meyer</I>, the Court stated that the liberty guaranteed
by the Fourteenth Amendment denotes &quot;the right of the individual
to marry, establish a home and bring up children.&quot;  The Court
declared in <I>Pierce</I> that the child is not a mere creature
of the state, and that &quot;those who nurture him and direct
his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize
and prepare him for additional obligations.&quot;

<p>

A new law is needed because although the Supreme Court's intent
to protect parental rights is unquestionable, lower courts have
not always followed the Supreme Court's strong mandate for the
parent-child relationship.  For example, parents from Falmouth,
Massachusetts recently lost a case in which they challenged their
school board's installation of condom machines in high school
bathrooms and school-nurse distribution of condoms to junior high
schoolers. Many public schools conduct psychological testing of
children under the guise of standardized &quot;tests&quot; and
&quot;surveys&quot; without parental consent.  Court challenges
to these policies have been met with mixed results.  Parents in Georgia
are fighting a legal battle against school administrators who
drove their daughters to a health clinic for gynecological tests
and birth control prescriptions without notification or consent.

<p>

The legal recognition of parental rights is also a children's
rights issue, because a child's first and most important right
is to have a parent who is in charge of raising him or her with
love and direction.  To say that parents have the primary role
in raising children is to say that parents are irreplaceable.
Stable, intact families rearing children with both love and direction
have never been in shorter supply or more desperately needed.
Parents need the legal standing to defend their fundamental right
to direct the upbringing and education of their children.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Statutory recognition of the fundamental right
of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children
would ensure that, when parents and government fight for the right
to make important decisions about child rearing, parents' preeminent
and unambiguous rights will prevail.

<title>Minimum Scrutiny at the New York Times</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Minimum Scrutiny at the New York Times</h2></center>
<p>
In 1994 Princeton economists David Card and Alan Krueger released the "New Jersey Study," a research paper which claimed that a hike in the minimum wage would increase employment. The Card-Krueger study received considerable press attention, and very little scrutiny, even though it provided the intellectual argument for the Clinton administration's proposal to increase the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour in February of this year.   
<p>
The New York Times, for example, touted the study and its call for a hike in the minimum wage in several stories. The Times' Louis Uchitelle wrote in the January 12 Business section: "Two Princeton University economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, contend there is little evidence of any job loss at all from increasing the minimum wage." 
<p>
Since the initial reports of the Card-Krueger study, however, the Employment Policies Institute (EPI) has found that the study is based on flawed data. In a March 29 Wall Street Journal column, EPI Executive Director Richard Berman contends that "the Card-Krueger data are worse than flawed -- they are grossly inaccurate." Berman continues: "How do I know? My organization took the time to check the actual payroll records [studied by Card and Krueger]...The payroll records do not match the Card-Krueger data. Only a handful come anywhere close."
<p>
Several newspapers across the country, including the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, have published EPI's findings. But despite several attempts by EPI to point out the flaws of the Card-Krueger study to the Times, America's newspaper of record has not yet acknowledged the Institute's findings.
<p>
John Doyle of EPI tells MediaNomics that "it was a real surprise when -- after the study was proven to be based on flawed data, and as a result, worthless -- the New York Times ignored our repeated efforts to publicize the study's flaws. This was not a critique of just another economic study. We pulled the underpinning from the administration's efforts to hike the minimum wage."
Perhaps the Times is just waiting for the right news peg.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we will take you to the Stand for
Children rally, which took place just last week.

<p>

The rally's name exemplifies what we all hold 
dear, America's children, but although those sponsoring the 
event claimed to encompass all viewpoints, all groups, and 
all individuals, we found out differently.  So we are going 
to show you another event involving pro-family and pro-
children groups who were deliberately excluded from the 
Stand for Children events, because the important issue is 
not just that we stand for children but what we stand for 
and who is standing, government or parents.

<p>

But first, let's hear from the Family Research 
Council's Director of Cultural Studies, Robert Knight.  Bob 
discusses another controversy which the media for the most 
part has ignored, the Whitewater land and loan scandal 
involving President and Mrs. Clinton.  Yet recent events and 
convictions can no longer keep the scandal out of the news. 
Let's hear Bob's unique insight as a former newsie on what 
happens to scandal Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  As a journalist with 
such prestigious publications such as the <i>L.A. Times</i>, you 
have seen a lot of things happen when it comes to
politicians and scandal.

<p>

I think in terms of Whitewater, which is the 
current business scandal affecting a Presidency to date, we 
haven't seen anything quite like it since Nixon and his Vice 
President, Spiro Agnew.  And yet we are talking about 
misdealings allegedly related to money, and the coverage on 
Whitewater has been a bit slim.  How has the coverage on 
Whitewater reflected the potential for scandal that is 
there?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, for years following revelations 
of various things Clinton had been accused of during the 
primaries when he was running for President, the press gave 
a cursory examination of the charges and then pretended that 
they had covered it, and so that was old news and they 
didn't have to look at it anymore.  And meanwhile, 
Whitewater was unfolding; witnesses were coming forward.

<p>

Certainly Troopergate, which is kind of connected 
to Whitewater, with the state troopers giving affidavits 
about all sorts of odd behavior on the part of the governor, 
was ignored.  You could find out about these things only by 
reading the <i>London Sunday Telegraph</i>; the <i>American 
Spectator</i>, the conservative magazine; and the <i>Washington 
Times</i>.

<p>

Everybody else was ignoring it, and the <i>Washington
Post</i> even ordered one reporter off the story.  He had
composed a story relating the troopers' accounts, and his
story was spiked, and he came forward and said that.  It was
a rare breach in journalistic etiquette, and he had to leave
the <i>Post</i> eventually.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There have been a lot of alleged 
misdealings by Republicans when they are in office.  We see 
Ronald Reagan and Iran Contra, where he is completely 
cleared, and in the news conference in which he is cleared, 
the prosecutor says, "I found no evidence, but I believe it, 
anyway."  You see people like Ed Meese, who was cleared.  
You see a lot of figures that were under scandal, and yet 
investigators found nothing.

<p>

And then you look at what we are seeing today in 
Whitewater.  How do you compare the treatment that Democrats 
and Republicans have received when it comes to scandal?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Like night and day.  If it's a 
Republican scandal, it's front page; if it's a Democratic 
scandal, it may not even make the pages.  You're talking 
about a failed S&L that has cost the taxpayers $50 million. 
You're talking about convictions of the governor of 
Arkansas and, at the time, Governor Clinton's two closest 
business associates.  You are talking about Hillary Clinton 
as the attorney of record for the Madison Guaranty Trust 
through Rose Law Firm.  You are talking about destruction of 
records, billing records, the mysterious reappearance of 
other billing records.  These people, if they had been 
Republicans, frankly, would have been run out of office by 
now.  I have no doubt.  There is so much that is wrong here. 
And yet the media either bury the stories, wave them away 
as meaningless and not interesting to the public because 
they are so complex, and basically have played down 
Whitewater.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  This is the way the media has really 
contrasted the Whitewater debate.  On the one hand, they 
will say Democrats are claiming it's a Republican witch hunt 
into an insignificant business dealing.  On the Republican 
side, Republicans have said it is important to look into 
Whitewater because it involves allegedly using almost 
worthless land as collateral to get loan money from 
struggling savings and loans, that loan money going either 
to Clinton's campaign or Clinton's friends -- at his 
request, allegedly -- and then all these loans are defaulted 
on and repaid by the taxpayers.

<p>

Now, that is just -- you know, it is interesting 
that these two sides are contrasted as being equally 
interesting when the media pitches it.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  That is right, and the tip of the 
iceberg in Whitewater is bigger during the iceberg during 
the Reagan years, just the tip, because they are ignoring 
things like the President's connection with Dan Lassiter, a 
convicted cocaine smuggler and a guy who peddled influence 
within the Clinton Administration and worked the state 
government, the Arkansas development authorities.  That kind 
of stuff cries out for examination.  But the press is 
(yawning), "It's just not interesting enough for us."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think it is interesting to 
contrast what is happening today with Whitewater with what 
happened in 1994 in the Texas race for governor, where the 
son of the former President, George W. Bush, is accused in 
this campaign of being involved with a savings and loan, 
merely on the board, not allegations of wrongdoing but just 
that he had been there.

<p>

You contrast that today with what is happening in
Whitewater and actual allegations of taxpayers being bilked.
Why do you think that contrast is there?  How do you explain
that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: I can only conclude from years in
journalism that it is because Bush is a Republican and
Whitewater involves Democrats.  It's that simple.

<p>

I watched it at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> when I was a 
news editor.  I was amazed at how the two parties would be 
handled in routine news stories.  Here's how it works:  You 
might have a balance in a story, because they might mention 
and quote Democrats and Republicans in terms of equal amount 
of ink.  The Democrats would make heartfelt pleas that would 
pull your heartstrings about some welfare program or 
something, and the Republicans would be quoted as to 
strategy, not about why they opposed it, because they might 
have thought it hurt people, just that, "Well, we're going 
to make this an issue in the election."  It was all 
tactical; it was bloodless.  Wouldn't move anyone.

<p>

So you would think you would have the white hats 
here and the black hats over here, and they would say, 
"Well, the story is balanced.  We quoted both sides."  I saw 
this all the time, and it is because the media 
overwhelmingly are composed of liberal Democrats.  It is 
almost uniformly.  I have worked on both coasts.  I have 
worked at the <i>Miami Herald</i>, <i>Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel</i>,
the <i>Annapolis Evening Capital</i>, the <i>L.A. Times</i>. It's the 
same everywhere.  It is a liberal journalistic elite, and it
is not a conspiracy; they just hire their own.  They hire
people who think like they do, and they tend to muster out
people who don't.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Kenneth Starr, the independent 
prosecutor for Whitewater, had come under a lot of 
controversy and scandal himself.  He was accused of being 
the tool of a Republican witch hunt.  He was accused of 
being incompetent.  And yet he has earned three Whitewater 
convictions, two of Bill Clinton's former best friends and 
the former governor of Arkansas, who was appointed as Bill 
Clinton left for Washington.  Frankly, how is that going to 
change anything?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Oh, that should change a lot, because 
at first the press were praising Starr because they thought 
he was ineffective, frankly.  They thought, Oh, good, he's a 
nonpartisan type of guy and he is not going to delve too 
deeply.

<p>

And then as he became more serious about the case, 
they began attacking him as a political instrument of the 
Republican Party.  But his conviction in Arkansas with a 
jury of ordinary men and women in the midst of a very 
corrupt system is a stunning blow to the Clinton 
Administration, and it is a stunning blow to the people who 
say that it is merely a politically driven issue.  I mean, 
something has got to be there, and he has proved there is 
something there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now that we have three convictions 
in Whitewater, three people very close to the President, we 
are preparing for two more cases coming up in the next 
couple of weeks.  There is a lot of speculation in the media 
that someone will cut a deal.  As a journalist, do you think 
that is possible?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, I do; in fact, David Hale would
be the guy who could actually bring down the President. He
said that he was pressured into giving a $300,000 loan to
the Clinton campaign, and he pressured the McDougals into
doing it.  They have denied it, the President has denied it.
But if he is given immunity and testifies and he is 
believed, that could be big trouble for the President.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: After the convictions of two of Bill 
Clinton's closest former friends and then Governor Jim Guy 
Tucker, now formerly governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton came 
out and said, "Look, it's not that the jury disbelieved what 
I had to say; they thought I was okay, and they released 
seven pages of statements from the jury where the jury was 
saying things like, 'Well, yeah, I believe the President.'" 
But how do you interpret that kind of action?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, none of them wanted to accuse 
the President of the United States of being a liar.  But by 
their action, they basically said we don't believe him, even 
though some of them said, "Well, we found him quite 
believable," and then they did the opposite of what the 
President said.  So I think actions do speak louder than 
words.  That was an incredible repudiation of a sitting 
President and his sense of honor and his word.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that the Whitewater 
story has legs, that it can carry itself through the 
election cycle?  Because now, interestingly enough, a lot of 
the journalistic pundits over the weekend were saying, "Oh, 
sure, there's another court case coming up, but after that 
it's definitely a dead story."  You know, how dead is it?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  You know, it is kind of fun, because 
the Media Research Center releases statements by journalists 
when they are in unguarded moments, and they reveal the 
agenda, and a lot of them have said for weeks, months, "Oh, 
this is a dead story.  Nobody is interested in it.  Nothing 
is really going to happen."

<p>

They were stunned by the verdict.  But some of 
them are still saying, "Well, so what?"  The big so what.  
Well, so what, indeed?  The President's closest associates 
convicted, plus an Arkansas governor.  This is huge, and it 
has got to have legs now, and in fact, if the journalists 
aren't going to embarrass themselves further, they'll take 
it up full force.

<p>

I still don't expect them to do so, though, 
because I think the partisan politics of the press is so 
rigidly liberal Democrat that they still won't give it the 
coverage it deserves.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Over the weekend I watched a lot of 
the news analysis shows, and once again the reporters 
continue to assert that Whitewater is probably going to be a 
dead story even though we have three convictions and two 
trials coming up.

<p>

One of the scandals that they thought would have 
more impact was Travelgate, the firing of White House 
employees then being accused of misconduct in the course of 
their job, then being acquitted of misconduct, even though 
the FBI was brought in, and frankly, the lesser reported 
fact that these employees worked with the journalists' 
travel plans, so a lot of journalists knew them and knew 
their character.

<p>

Scandals like Travelgate, the firing of a lot of 
attorneys across the country, all kinds of issues like that 
might have potential in this election.  What scandals do you 
think will have legs?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, Travelgate is a scandal with 
legs, because it is ordinary people doing their jobs and 
then being accused of horrible things unjustly.  The FBI 
being used improperly by the White House to falsely portray 
these people as crooked, I mean, that is outrageous.  That 
is a breach of not only ethics; that is criminal behavior.

<p>

I think if that story is really played to what it 
deserves, that alone could bring down a President.  I am not 
sure it will, though.  Again, it hasn't been played very 
heavily.  Most people don't understand what occurred.  And, 
also, Hillary is at the core of that one.  It is not so much 
Bill Clinton as Hillary, because an aide of Hillary's has 
said that he felt pressure to do the firings from above.  He 
didn't name Mrs. Clinton, but it was clear where that was 
coming from.

<p>

So she is up to her neck in that.  She is up to 
her neck in the Madison Savings and Loan failure.  And never 
forget the cattle futures in which she made $100,000 in a 
week, unlike anybody else who invests like that.  I mean, 
there was clearly skullduggery going on and the insider 
trading.  That sort of has been forgotten, too, by the 
press.

<p>

I think we are getting to the point where there is 
so much there that people want to turn away and say, "It 
can't be true.  This is just so crooked, it's so extreme, 
that these people can't be guilty of all the things they've 
been accused of."  It's almost an overload, sensory 
overload, of scandal.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, as you evaluate Whitewater and 
Travelgate and some of the scandals and all the media that 
has surrounded it, what do you think the big picture is for 
our <i>Straight Talk</i> viewers?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, I think there is a political 
danger that the Republicans will say, "You know what?  We 
don't have to address the core issues that our constituents 
care about:  the family tax break, the $500 tax credit, 
reestablishing the moral fabric of this country, maybe 
judicial reform, certainly all the economic reforms that are 
needed, cutting down big government, because we've got 
Whitewater."  You know, there is a complacency that may well 
set in, and I think if the Republicans fall for that, and 
the press acts characteristically to keep burying 
Whitewater, they could be very surprised in November and 
find out that the American people still weren't fully aware 
of it and just didn't care.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  We really 
appreciated your journalistic insight.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Thanks for having me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> takes you to the June 1 Stand for Children and 
to a special stand for parents by leading pro-family groups.
Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segments from Children's Defense Fund's Stand for Children rally 
follow.]

<p>

CHILD: This is the day the Lord has made.  Let us 
rejoice and be glad in it.

<p>

[Song: This Little Light of Mine.]

<p>

ROSIE O'DONNELL: Fifty religious leaders, each 
with a child from his or her congregation, share the stage 
with me today.  They are here to stand for children.  It is 
time for us to make children and their rights our first 
priority.

<p>

EDWARD JAMES OLMAS:  As individuals, they, like 
all of us, have been touched by violence or by the crisis in 
health care, or by how difficult it is to obtain quality, 
affordable child care, or by the decline of our public 
school system.

<p>

IMAN: We stand for a government and a society 
that support families and their needs, not just with words 
but with actions.

<p>

MS. EDELMAN:  This is a day about unity and 
community and not about controversy.  This is a day about 
rekindling our children's hope and renewing our faith in 
each other and in our great nation's future.  It is about 
America's ideals and not about any group's ideology.  We do 
not stand here advocating big government; we stand here 
advocating just government --

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

-- government that does not give more to those who 
have and less to those who have not.  We advocate cost-
effective government that invests more to prevent than to 
punish our children's problems.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We believe that jobs and not jail should be the 
rite of passage to adulthood, and we question the family 
values of anybody that is willing to spend $20,000 to lock 
our children up but is unwilling to spend $3,500 to give 
them a head start.  We can do better.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We do not believe that government is <i>the</i> answer to
the breakdown of family, community, and moral values all 
over America, any more than we believe that hungry and 
homeless children are responsible for all of America's ills, 
as some of our leaders seem to think.  They say that we are 
too poor to invest another penny a day, each of us, to see 
that every one of our mothers has prenatal care and that we 
are too poor to invest, each of us, another nickel a day to 
give every one of our children health care, 10 million 
uninsured children; but that we are not too poor to give new 
tax breaks to the non-needy and to give the Pentagon weapons 
systems it did not even request.  We can do better than 
that.

<p>

[SONG LYRICS]:

<blockquote>

We are pieces of the puzzles.<br>
We are soldiers in the fight.<br>
Kids saving kids for our future.<br>
Come follow me into the light.<br>

[End of Stand for Children segment.]

<p>

[Segments from Family Research Council Stand for
Children press conference follow:]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What we are doing is adding and even 
clarifying some of what it means to stand for children.  In 
the Children's Defense Fund's comments about this particular 
rally, it has been a bit slanted.  There has been a great 
big government viewpoint; there has been a viewpoint that 
would say, frankly, standing for children means standing 
with government and standing with government programs.

<p>

But I am standing today with some of the leading 
pro-family organizations in the nation, groups that work 
every day on family issues and actually were not invited to 
Stand for Children.  As a matter of fact, Family Research 
Council, when we read in a newspaper account that we had 
been invited, addressed Marian Wright Edelman saying, "We 
would be glad to stand for children, we would be glad to 
address the issues that we think are important for the 
family.  However, we weren't invited.  Perhaps you would 
like to change that."  And that actually hasn't happened.

<p>

When more than 100 organizations that get a lot of 
tax money to have a welfare approach to children's issues 
say that they are going to stand for children, it is treated 
as though the name of the event equals what actually will 
happen.  The reality is that big government doesn't stand 
best for children; parents do.

<p>

In 30 years of excessive taxes, in 30 years of 
giant welfare programs and 30 years of greater and greater 
overbearing government control in our schools, what we have 
found is that parents have been squeezed out of their family 
cars, and Big Brother is driving, and frankly, he is headed 
in the wrong direction.

<p>

We need a $500-per-child tax credit.  We need 
parents to be empowered in education.  We need adoption tax 
credits, and we need them now.  We applaud the current 
Congress for their efforts on tax relief and for dealing 
with the burden of the overbearing budget that is going to 
come to our children.  

<p>

Unfortunately, liberal activists like the 
Children's Defense Fund prevailed upon President Bill 
Clinton to veto very important legislation.  The Children's 
Defense Fund has embraced an attitude that liberal elites do 
know better than parents, and, unfortunately for the 
children who get caught up in the welfare state, that just 
isn't true, and in particular, one of the shameful programs 
going on today is what is happening in foster care.

<p>

Foster care becomes a quasi-parent for more than 
600,000 abused and neglected children.  Ten percent wait 
more than seven years to get into adopted families.  We have 
made adoption very difficult, and children are caught in the 
crossfire.

<p>

Frankly, we need to make adoption easier.  When 
the family breaks down, we need to step in with limits so 
that these children could be set free for future families.  
We need to understand that what children need most is 
families, not government.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN:  If you look at the list of the 426 
national organizations that have endorsed this march, at 
least 102 of them received federal grants in fiscal year 
1993-1994.  These grants totaled about $400 million to these 
groups, and on top of these groups, you have lobbying arms 
of federal programs worth about $7 billion, whether it be 
the National Head Start Association, the Association of 
Women, Infants and Children's Supplemental Nutrition 
Administrators, groups like this are involved, and the 
reason why they are involved is very simple:  This Stand for 
Children march is the latest attempt by the welfare rights 
lobby to slickly package its message.  It realizes that you 
can't talk about poor people, you can't talk about the 
welfare state, because the American public knows very well 
that the welfare state breeds dependency, breeds 
illegitimacy.

<p>

MS. NANCE [Concerned Women for America]:  If the 
choice for American women would be they would prefer to stay 
home and rear their own children, then why aren't the 
Children's Defense Fund and the National Organization for 
Women out working for women's choice?

<p>

MS. FLAHERTY [American Family Association]:
Computer technology has made pornography more accessible 
than ever before, especially to children, who in most cases 
know better how to work a computer than their parents.  Kids 
can't walk into a porn shop, but today they don't need to 
when the equivalent of an adult bookstore can be brought to 
their fingertips via the Internet.

<p>

How can we stand for children in today's world?
Parental love, caring, and involvement are vital, of course.
But it is also imperative to enact strong pornography laws
that will keep sexually explicit materials out of the hands
of children.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  While the march is carefully timed 
to influence the 1996 elections, it may not even be accurate 
to call this march partisan.  Its chief organizers are to 
the left of Clinton.  The march may well be the last gasp of 
1960s-style paleo-liberals.  Look who is absent from the 
list.  The U.S. Catholic Conference, the national body for 
the Roman Catholic Church, and the Christian Life Commission 
of the Southern Baptist Convention, the two largest 
Christian bodies in the United States, are not sponsoring 
this event.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: As we stand, let us stand up for the 
use of instructional materials that help parents and 
children establish lasting meaningful relationships, 
instructional materials such as <i>You Are Special</i> that really
will result in developing self-esteem and self-reliance in 
children, the kind that they need in order to survive and 
meet the challenges of today.

<p>

[End of FRC Stand for Children segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We now have the privilege of 
introducing some of those whom you just saw and who stood
with the Family Research Council's own Stand for Children.
I would like to welcome Dr. Mary Johnson, principal of the
D.C. Public Schools Ballou Mathematics Science Technology
Academy and author of <i>You Are Special: A Child's Guide for
Successful Living</i>.

<p>

Also joining us is Ken Weinstein, Director of the 
Government Reform Project at the Heritage Foundation; and 
Diane Knippers, president of the Institute on Religion and 
Democracy. 

<p>

Welcome. A lot of impressive organizations and 
people. I appreciate you all joining me.

<p>

In the short amount of time -- because we have so 
much to cover in our discussion of Stand for Children -- 
each of you had a special concern, and we saw just a little 
bit of that.

<p>

Dr. Johnson, let's start with you.  Why were you 
concerned when the Stand for Children rally started to 
become publicized?

<p>

DR. JOHNSON:  Well, our organization and my book, 
<i>You Are Special</i>, are very special to all of us, and 
we are very excited about getting parents involved, having 
seminars, and letting people know about the book, <i>You Are
Special</i>, because we have gotten so many positive comments 
from parents about the value of it.

<p>

So we are constantly in the public's eye talking 
about it, sharing, giving the books to mentors, and that 
kind of thing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  The book itself is attempting to 
build self-esteem and values through Biblical principles.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Right. So we were excited about it 
at first, and so we wrote and said we would be happy to be 
there and we would bring materials and share literature and 
whatever, and we were kind of surprised.  We got a letter 
back saying, "Well, we'll have to let you know."

<p>

So we were a little surprised at that, but we said 
okay, but we are busy telling everybody about it and passing 
out buttons, because we support anything for children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Absolutely.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON:  Stand for Children, work for 
children, do whatever we can to help our children.

<p>

And then later, near the end of the time frame 
just before the march, we received a letter saying that they 
were sorry, that they had decided not to include us and the 
distribution of our materials.  So we were a little miffed 
at what happened.  Then we said, "Well, I'm pretty sure 
there must be some good reasons."  And then later we found 
out about other groups.  Then we really didn't know what to 
think.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is ironic that a book that Marian 
Wright Edelman gives a quote for on the back, which talks 
about the Bible, was kept out, while the Gay and Lesbian 
Victory Fund was welcome to Stand for Children.

<p>

Ken, you took a look at some of the groups that 
were there.  What made you interested in Stand for Children?

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Dr. Johnson's concerns were high 
and spiritual; mine were sort of low and corporeal.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I noticed the list of national sponsors of the 
Stand for Children rally, and I noticed that a lot of them 
were feeding at the federal trough, and I did a database 
search of the groups at the Heritage Foundation, looking at 
how much in federal grants they received.

<p>

I was quite astonished to see actually how much in 
federal grants were actually represented last Saturday on 
the Mall here in Washington.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And you, as a matter of fact, were 
characterizing it widely, not as a Stand for Children but --

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Well, as both the last stand for 
big government and also the stand of the social service 
administrators, since, really, they were standing for their 
own programs, particularly because they fear that the 
actions of the 104th Congress are going to change the 
welfare delivery system and take power and resources away 
from them and return it instead to citizens and the 
institutions they control.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

Diane, you were interested in some of the 
community things.  We have about less than a minute left.  
What did you notice about the community side of the event?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  Well, we were particularly 
concerned about the religious angle, because there were a 
lot of religious organizations that gave more legitimacy to 
this march.  But our concern was that it really represented 
the left wing of the religious establishment, and many 
mainstream religious groups were not involved.  It gave a 
very distorted picture of this march.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to hear more 
about all of this.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> comes back, we will 
bring you more after the commercial break. Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing the 
pro-family movement's Stand for Children with those who were 
excluded from the Children's Defense Fund recent Stand for 
Children rally.  Here tonight are Dr. Mary Johnson, Ken 
Weinstein, and Diane Knippers.

<p>

I would like to just start out -- you know, we 
briefly kind of gave an overview of the things that had 
concerned us.  What could have made the rally better --  
Diane, let's start with you this time -- in terms of making 
it the ecumenical, nonpartisan, pro-family event it was 
advertised?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Well, I had kind of a fantasy last 
week.  What if Marian Wright Edelman, who heads the 
Children's Defense Fund, had called James Dobson and said, 
"Look, let's have a genuine bipartisan, non-ideological 
Stand for Children, which I think our country really needs, 
and let's do it together."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And Dr. Dobson?  Tell us who that is.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  The head of Focus on the Family.
And very different ideas about what kinds of solutions, 
particularly from the point of view of government solutions, 
we need for children, but both apparently with a heart for 
children.

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  Then maybe we would have had the 
kind of event -- or the U.S. Catholic Conference, the 
bishops of the Roman Catholic Church, or the Southern 
Baptists, the National Association of Evangelicals -- the 
largest Christian denominations in our country would have 
felt free and comfortable to really endorse.

<p>

Instead, on the religious side, you had huge 
representation of very small religious groups.  Sikhs and 
Buddhists and Muslims are not large groups in our country.
And among particularly the Protestants, the representation 
there were the churches with very liberal hierarchies.  In 
fact, four of them -- the United Methodists, the 
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Episcopal Church, and United 
Church of Christ -- the leaders of those denominations also 
signed a letter to uphold Clinton's veto of the partial-birth 
abortion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Astounding.  That is something that 
people of faith on the whole, Catholic and Protestant, 
abhor.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Yes, very highly -- standing for 
children in a very selective way; let's put it that way.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ken, if you could have redesigned 
the march, I guess there would have been less federal money 
involved.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN:  Yes, much less federal money 
involved.  There would have been conservatives and liberals 
standing up there.  The event also would not have been held 
on the Jewish Sabbath, so Sabbath-observing Jews from the 
more conservative Jewish denominations could have 
participated rather than simply members of the left wing or 
more liberal Jewish denominations.

<p>

I would have not tried to do what Marian Wright 
Edelman did, which was to launch sort of a stealth campaign 
for the Stand for Children by meeting with the AFL-CIO's 
executive committee back in February to sort of give them a 
tip about the importance of this rally and how important it 
was -- the same meeting, by the way, that the AFL-CIO's 
executive committee voted to spend $35 million to defeat 
conservative members of the 104th Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. That is what is so 
interesting.  I loved your report, by the way --

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN:  Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: -- and I would encourage people to
call in at the end of the show to get it.  But it was just 
very clear.  I mean, if you look at who came from a social 
perspective -- Planned Parenthood; Zero Growth Fund, 
apparently standing for fewer children; Greenpeace, I am not 
sure, standing for children who pick up trash -- and then we 
have the majority of groups being involved in federal 
monies.  I mean, what does the AFL-CIO, the labor movement, 
have to say about standing for children that Focus on the 
Family would not have to say?

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Sure, absolutely.  The AFL-CIO, 
the only way that it stands for children is by standing for 
grants to its members and for government programs that 
provide jobs for its members.

<p>

But certainly AFL-CIO, by standing for the welfare 
state and by standing for the way things have been done over 
the last 30 years that have generated the real crises that 
we see today, particularly our inner cities, you know, it is 
just sort of another failed example of the liberalism that 
we have to forget about if we are going to have a future 
that our children can enjoy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Dr. Johnson, how would you have 
redesigned the march?  How could you have made it more 
ecumenical?

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Well, I am not sure, but what I wish 
had happened is that everybody who has done things for 
children, have programs for children, would just be 
welcomed; that the letter that I got would have said, "We 
cannot assure you space to display anything, but come and 
bring your materials and share.  We know about your 
materials.  Bring them, share them with the parents and 
share them with others so they will know."  And everybody, 
other organizations, not just Focus on the Family, "Bring 
materials, come in, join us in any way that you can.  We 
don't know that we can provide space for you, but just come 
on and join us and bring whatever you can so that we can 
share all kinds of materials, programs, and whatever you 
have that we know will be helpful to children."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Were you concerned that your faith 
perspective -- I mean, ABC World News, for example, showed 
the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund at their special table in 
their booth handing out their materials, and then, in an 
open-air event, they said that there wasn't a table space 
for you, which seems hard to believe.  Are you concerned 
about that?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: I was down there. There was room.
There was plenty of room.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Yes, we were concerned, but we just 
didn't understand it, and we tried not to place a judgment 
on it, and we just tried to say, well, maybe there are some 
reasons that we just don't know.  We tried to look at it as 
objectively as we could.

<p>

But, yes, we were sort of amazed at the reaction. 
We thought the letter would come back and say, "Oh, come, 
do come, please come.  We want you there.  Bring your 
materials.  We know it has a religious slant, but it is not 
geared to any particular religion, and it is geared to all 
people.  It is written for all cultures, all nationalities 
and whatever," because we sent materials along with our 
initial letter.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, of course.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: "So, yes, bring it, and if you can 
find a little spot, you can find some space, you know, 
wonderful."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, I hope our listeners are going 
to have space for this book, and we're going to give an 800 
number, and again, people, you are going to want to hold 
fast to get this book.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to hear 
more about the kinds of things children desperately need in 
America today.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>, and we are talking to 
experts who are enlightening us on what it truly means to 
stand for children.  Welcome back to Dr. Mary Johnson, Ken 
Weinstein, and Diane Knippers.

<p>

Diane, we have been talking a little bit about
what we would have liked to have seen.  But you actually
went.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What did you see at the Stand for Children march?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  Well, I started out on Friday 
night.  I went to the ecumenical service at the National 
Cathedral here in Washington, and then I went very early 
Saturday morning to a nearby Episcopal church where all the 
Episcopalians gathered.  We got a free breakfast and tee 
shirts.  I almost wore my tee shirt but decided not to.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We also got these little preprinted cards to send 
to our Senators, Representative, and to the President urging 
that we keep high levels of federal spending for children.  
These were convenient so we could send them in.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Ken is probably going to want to borrow these.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Exactly.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  The lobbying started at the 
religious events.  There were several that different 
denominations had beforehand.  When we actually got to the 
march -- I must say that it was one of the best organized, 
perhaps slickest marches I have ever been to, and with very 
effective use of children, the 2,000-children choir, the 
10,000 children crossing the bridge.  And all of this, the 
music, it was quite a celebratory event leading up to Marian 
Wright Edelman's final speech, where the bottom line was she 
got a lot of names and a lot of press coverage for a very 
one-sided political initiative that then started here in 
Washington on Monday when they started lobbying.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As a person who evaluates daily and 
for a long time the impact of some of the liberal faith 
groups on politics, do you see this as being a direct 
connection between the intertwining of a liberal faith 
perspective and politics?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Oh, absolutely. In fact, it 
occurred to me that there was as much overt political 
activity at the religious events and as much or maybe more 
talk about spirituality and morality at the rally.  I mean, 
it was the same kind of thing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Kind of backwards, almost?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Yes. The homilies -- I mean, I 
kept looking anywhere for distinctive messages about moral 
messages.  In the entire 24 hours, I did not hear the word 
"divorce."  I did not hear the word "illegitimacy."  There 
was no mention of the problem of father absence, either at 
the religious events or the rally.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And that is astounding.  I want to 
return to the question of father absence.

<p>

But, Dr. Johnson, in your book <i>You Are Special</i> you 
take a look at the Ten Commandments, the foundation of all 
Judeo-Christian civilized societies, and you talk about how 
to teach values.  I mean, you were there.  Did you wish that 
some messages -- what did you see and what would you have 
liked to have heard a little more about?

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Well, we were there in the 
afternoon.  I would like to have seen more information and 
more focus on how to actually help our children on a day-to-
day basis.  The rally was wonderful, the march was great, 
the Stand for Children whole concept was fantastic.  But 
what comes later?  Our children need companionship with 
parents.  They need spiritual development on a day-to-day 
basis.  And our parents, because some of them are so young, 
need training themselves to help their children develop.  
And our children need time with an adult, time that has been 
set aside for them to help them.  This has to happen on a 
regular basis.

<p>

And without this kind of emphasis on helping our 
children develop and grow daily all the time, then it is 
just not going to be effective.  Nothing is going to be 
effective that does not deal with the children on a daily, 
regular basis, or regular basis, to help them develop.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So it was more of an emphasis on 
programs versus the intimate people touch that is really 
needed.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Yes, right, and that is what we are 
focusing on.  Sitting with the child with a book.  Spending 
time talking to the child.  Helping the child clarify what 
is really right and wrong, and we use the Bible as our 
basis, the Ten Commandments, other Biblical principles.  But 
parents that I have talked to say this is just so valuable, 
because it helps them to sit with their children, and they 
get a real clear understanding of what is right and what is 
wrong based on the Biblical principles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Ken, you made a very interesting 
point that for people of some faiths, you couldn't even 
participate.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: That is correct. No, orthodox 
Jews do not engage in public secular activities from sundown 
Friday till sundown Saturday, and so I spent from sundown 
Friday till -- I was in synagogue Saturday and I missed the 
rally, which I don't regret having missed, but nonetheless, 
it was -- I mean, I decided that my religion comes before my 
work, and so I didn't attend, and I know there were other 
orthodox Jews who did want to attend but couldn't because of 
the fact the rally was held on the Sabbath.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That was the nature of the event.

<p>

I want to hear more about the programs you would 
like to see when we come back.  When we return, <i>Straight
Talk</i> shares more on how you can stand for America's
children.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. In light of the recent Stand 
for Children rally, we are talking to some of those who are 
truly fighting for the rights of America's children.

<p>

Ken, I wanted to start with you.  You took a look
at the programs represented at Stand for Children. What did
you find about the people who said they were standing for
children?

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Sure. What they were standing for 
was an attempt to prevent any real significant welfare 
reform in the 104th Congress.  Also, they were standing for 
actually the more liberal elements, if you can believe that, 
in the Clinton Administration, trying to assure that their 
weight, that they had a stronger weight against the so-called 
new Democrats who actually push for some mild forms 
of welfare reform.

<p>

What they have done, in essence, is identify the 
plight of children with the welfare state and with the 
welfare state as it currently exists, and as we all know, it 
is the welfare state, more than just about anything, that 
has destroyed civil society in the inner city, in 
particular, destroyed churches, destroyed the healthy 
organizations that teach children character, and have also 
actually in many cases taken the place of fathers in the 
inner city by providing financial pay so that women can have 
children without men around.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Family Research Council 
got involved in evaluating Stand for Children for just that 
reason.  Our concern was that the best advocates for 
children are parents, and in fact we know in terms of early 
sex for teens and teen promiscuity that the best way to have 
children delay sex is to encourage them to talk about it 
with their moms and dads.

<p>

So instead of running a federally funded public 
service campaign that talks about moms and dads, talk to 
your kids; kids, talk to your parents; we run a dancing 
condom ad, and that just seems typical of the approach where 
we don't do family-building things.

<p>

Diane, what did you see?  I mean, what emphasis 
was there on family as the way to help kids?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: There was lip service to the family 
around the edges, but there was nothing really that gave 
support or particular advice or encouragement.

<p>

One of the things that disturbed me -- I am of the 
conviction that the major crisis facing our country, if you 
wanted to simplify it, you could say it in two words:  it is 
father absence.  There are just terrifying statistics about 
where we are headed with children being reared in single-parent 
families.

<p>

Now, this would have been a perfect opportunity to 
really lift up fathers as role models.  Instead, all the 
little vignettes of children that were in crisis, it was men 
that were the bad guys.  They were the abusers or the 
deserters of the family.  And the heroes, the people that 
intervened in the lives of children, were all women.  Now, 
we need to show men who are heroes to children and who will 
intervene.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You all are heroes, and I hope 
people are going to call to get more information about your 
organizations.  And we need to talk more about father 
absence.  Diane, we'll have to have you back.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on Straight Talk we are celebrating a belated 
Father's Day.  Unfortunately, fatherhood cannot claim the 
revered position it once held in our national culture.  Not 
only do many television sitcoms make a mockery of fathers, 
but the harsh reality is that thousands upon thousands of 
America's children suffer from the absence of their own 
fathers.

<p>

Our guests tonight, who are actively researching 
and attempting to change the status of fatherhood in our 
country, will discuss the fatherhood crisis and the triumphs 
and trials of being fathers themselves. 

<p>

But first, let's hear from Family Research Council 
president Gary Bauer.  As the Presidential election draws 
near, Bob Dole and Bill Clinton are raising issues and 
debating them with America's leaders. 

<p>

In the last two weeks, Gary has been in the 
forefront of those discussions as they have played out on
the front pages on the <i>New York Times</i> to the mass media.
The present controversy has involved the sanctity of life
and the politics of abortion.  Let's hear what Gary has to
say about recent events and upsets as we take you Behind the
Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

For a lot of people who watch this show and who 
follow the Family Research Council and actually you, in 
particular, they have seen over the last two weeks 
incredible media exposure from <i>Capital Gang</i> to <i>Crossfire</i> 
to the front page of the <i>New York Times</i>. The debate has been 
about Dole and abortion, the Republican Party and the right-
to-life issue.  How would you characterize the debate as it 
stands today? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think it has been actually a 
frustrating week or two in the sense that the debate has 
gotten away from 1.5 million unborn children being aborted 
every year and has now, at least it seems inside Washington, 
gotten down to dotting I's and crossing T's in the platform. 

<p>

The issue is one of the most profound issues 
facing the country, and it deserves a more noble debate than 
a debate over the machinations of a platform committee. 

<p>

The irony is that there is this tremendous 
difference between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton on the issue.  
The President, as we all know, supports abortion on demand.  
He has even vetoed a bill that tried to limit abortions in 
the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy.  Bob Dole has a 
35-year pro-life voting record. 

<p>

So my hope is that Senator Dole will just be clear 
about that so that the American people can discern what the 
differences are between the two men. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The media likes to write process 
stories, particularly about difficult issues like abortion 
and right to life.  In the last two weeks, we have seen a 
lot of coverage on the Republican platform and whether there 
should be language on tolerance or the big tent in the 
preamble or attached to the plank itself. 

<p>

But really, it is not that simple, as simple as a 
platform.  Why, in a way, is this story a big story, and 
then why is it really not as significant as they are trying 
to make the process of the platform out to be? 

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, look.  When you take a so-called 
tolerance line, which I think is a sort of bizarre way to 
say that something in your platform doesn't really mean what 
it says, but when you take that and apply it only to the 
abortion issue, the message you are sending is that you are 
really not serious about doing anything on abortion. 

<p>

The best analogy I can come up with is taxes.  The 
Republican platform will predictably say that they want 
lower taxes.  I certainly hope that they will say that.  If 
they added language to that plank that said, "However, we 
know some people disagree with us, and they are welcome in 
the party, too," the clear message the American people would 
get is, Whoops, tax aren't going down; the party is not 
serious about that issue. 

<p>

And, likewise, if you single out the abortion 
issue, which is a very profound issue, very important for 
the future of the country and who we are as a free people, 
and you add only tolerance language to that, then the 
message you are sending is that the issue really isn't that 
high on your priority list, and you are really not going to 
do anything about it. 

<p>

I think it eliminates one of the major 
vulnerabilities that Bill Clinton has.  I think he is 
extremely vulnerable in this issue if somebody will really 
take the debate to him and be clear and articulate about it. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That really is an incredible irony. 
Here we have a radically pro-abortion Democratic Party and 
the most liberal, most extreme pro-abortion President of all 
history, who embraces abortion in the seventh, eighth, and 
ninth month, even if the child is perfectly healthy, and we 
have a pro-life candidate with a 35-year voting record and a 
consistently pro-life party.  But why do you think the 
Republicans are reluctant to embrace what has been a winning 
issue?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think the main reason is the 
way this city thinks about the abortion issue.  In 
Washington, D.C., the cultural elite of the city is 
overwhelmingly pro-abortion, whether you are talking about 
the media, the political consultants that hang on and make 
their living by telling candidates what they ought to say 
and not say, the pollsters, and so forth. 

<p>

So every major politician is constantly being told 
(that) to be pro-life is an impediment.  And when you get 
out around the country and look at who gets elected, pro-
life people do extremely well.  That is one of the reasons 
we have a Republican majority in the Congress now for the 
first time since World War II.  It is one of the reasons the 
Republicans won five out of the last seven Presidential 
elections. 

<p>

You know, Kristi, the real irony here is that 
polling data out just in the last couple of days show that 
about 30 percent of the American people think that Bill 
Clinton only supports abortion in the first three months of 
the pregnancy.  This is unbelievable to me.  Here in 
Washington, we all know that President Clinton -- he is very 
about this:  he believes in abortion on demand.  There is no 
restriction on abortion in any month of the pregnancy, for 
any reason, that Bill Clinton has been willing to sign.  And 
yet because there is never a real debate on it, one-third of 
the American people think that he wants abortion fairly 
stringently restricted. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The media likes to characterize 
abortion as a women's issue, which is ironic, because in 
polling women consistently are shown to be more pro-life.  
And if we look at people who are single-issue voters, the 
abortion issue, in terms of the right-to-life position, 
pulls 2 to 1 as an advantage for a candidate who takes that 
issue.

<p>

Why do you think, though, that the media tries to 
say abortion is a gender gap issue for Dole? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, no, it is not responsible at 
all; in fact, this poll is no surprise.  There has not been 
one poll in 20 years of polling -- and I have looked for 
every one of them -- that has ever shown that it is the 
abortion issue that costs a politician or a party female 
votes, because as you just indicated, on balance it ends up 
being a net plus for whatever candidate or party takes that 
position. 

<p>

I think the gender gap has got a lot to do with 
some of the budget cuts which the Republican Party 
legitimately tried to make, but polling data for years has 
also shown that women tend to get nervous when you are 
talking about cutting budgets, particularly when the 
programs being cut have some indirect effect on women or 
children or the elderly or the sick.  And that is 
understandable.  Women tend to be more sensitive about those 
sorts of things.  So I think that the economic cuts, the 
economic agenda of the party, has a lot more to say about 
the gender gap than the social issues do.

<p>

Interestingly, the polling shows that there is one 
group in America that is overwhelmingly supportive of 
abortion on demand, and that group is men between the ages 
of 18 and 25, and I would suggest that that is nothing a 
politician should be proud about.  The reason men between 
the ages of 18 and 25 support abortion on demand is it makes 
it easier for them to run away from their responsibilities 
when they get a woman pregnant.  When that woman comes to 
them and says that she needs help or wants that man to stand 
up to do the responsible thing, he can throw his hands up 
and say, "Wait a minute.  I have nothing to do with this 
from this point on.  You have a right to abort.  Utilize 
that right.  That's the end of it." 

<p>

So it has been a real boon for young men.  It has 
been terrible for women and children, and I think 
politicians ought to be clear about who has benefitted from 
abortion on demand and who hasn't. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It has been a very fiery debate for 
you, Gary, in the last two weeks.  In fact the front page of 
the <i>New York Times</i> shows Senator Dole attacking you for your 
pro-life stance.  You have had a long history in Washington. 
It seems strange to suddenly find that objectionable.  Why 
do you think that Senator Dole did attack you personally? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Kristi, I have no idea. I have worked 
closely with Senator Dole.  It is a little unusual, I think, 
for him to attack me for defending a platform plank that he 
says he believes in.  That doesn't make any sense to me at 
all.  But I have worked with him in the past; I am sure I 
will work with him in the future.

<p>

We do have, though, a core set of issues that we 
stand for:  the sanctity of life, the importance of the 
family, traditional values, teaching children reliable 
standards of right and wrong.  And the only credibility I 
can ever have in Washington is if I am consistent in 
standing for those things, even if on any given day it might 
irritate one politician or another.  Now, usually it 
irritates liberal Democrats; in this case, it irritated a 
conservative Republican.  But I can't start fine-tuning the 
core set of values that we have to satisfy people that are 
running for office.  That would quickly end any influence 
whatsoever that I could ever have in Washington. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  For the most part, the media has 
ignored the abortion and right-to-life controversy in the 
Democratic Party. Sunday in the <i>Washington Post</i>, there was 
an article of Democratic Party leaders and office holders 
saying, "Look, we have a pro-life side as well, and we, the 
pro-life members of the Democratic Party, want to address 
our convention."

<p>

You have been advising pro-life candidates for a 
long time, Democratic and Republican and independent.  How 
would you advise someone on how to handle the sanctity-of-life 
issue?  How does someone need to play that to have 
success? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Sure. The American people are deeply 
divided over the issue, so I never want to suggest that it 
is an easy issue to handle.  But I think if you believe in 
the sanctity of human life, as I do, that you can't run from 
it.  You can't try to be all things to all people. 

<p>

I guess I go back to the man that will probably be 
my favorite President for the rest of my life, and that is 
Ronald Reagan.  Ronald Reagan was unambiguous about this.  
He was gentle in describing his position.  He wasn't harsh. 
He didn't attack women, certainly, because women have been 
exploited by this as much as anyone has.  But he was clear 
about it.  He was clear that he firmly believed that unborn 
children deserved constitutional protection, and he won one 
of the biggest landslides in American history, even though 
everyone in the country knew that was his position. 

<p>

That's the model that I would recommend to Bob 
Dole or to somebody running for the Senate or the House or 
even for a local city council race.  State your position 
clearly, do it fairly, do it with a sense of compassion.  
But don't ever run away from the defense of innocent human 
life. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you, Gary, for being with us 
today on Behind the Headlines. 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> begins our discussion of fatherhood.  What 
does it take to be a good father?  Stay tuned to hear how 
our guests answer that crucial question. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from Promise Keepers, RFK Stadium, May 25, 1996, follows:]

<p>

DR. CANALES: Whenever you are weak as a father, 
whenever you don't have what it takes as a husband, whenever 
you feel insecure, whenever you feel inadequate, whenever 
you feel like you don't have any strength, whenever you feel 
like you're not being a good enough dad, I want you to know 
that you can trust in God and He will bring you through and 
make up the difference for you and bring you out of Egypt 
into a strong and mighty situation and give you the strength 
you need to be a good dad. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Please say Amen.

<p>

MEN [Attendees]: Amen.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  Right now I want you to do something 
with me.  I want you to take out your wallet, and I'm not 
going to tell you to give your neighbor money, and I'm not 
going to take up an offering, which I know you think I am, 
but I'm not.  I just want you to look at your pictures.
Take out your wallet if you've got some pictures.  Look at 
your wife and at your kids, if you've got them right there, 
and show them to your neighbor, all right?  Would you love 
them unconditionally?  Men, would you love them 
unconditionally?

<p>

MEN: Yes.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  Do they have to perform for you to 
love them? 

<p>

MEN: No.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  No.  Everybody say no!

<p>

MEN: No.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  Say "I" --

<p>

MEN:  I -- 

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Love" --

<p>

MEN:  Love --

<p>

DR. CANALES: "Them."

<p>

MEN:  Them. 

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Unconditionally." 

<p>

MEN:  Unconditionally. 

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Not for what they do" --

<p>

MEN:  Not for what they do --

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Or don't do."

<p>

MEN:  Or don't do.

<p>

DR. CANALES: "But for who they are."

<p>

MEN:  But for who they are.

<p>

MAN [Attendee]:  A father needs to be a man of 
integrity, a man of his word, show love for his children, 
his family, his wife, real concern for the things of God. 

<p>

MAN: I think a father should be a man who follows 
after the Lord.  He ought to be somebody who understands the 
word of God and tries to live it.  He should be somebody who 
cares about his family, his wife and his children, and is 
willing to sacrifice anything to take care of them.  Most of 
all, he cares for his children to the point that he wants 
them to be raised up to be godly women and godly men. 

<p>

BOY:  I love you, Dad. 

<p>

MAN:  I love you too, buddy. 

<p>

MAN:  Special father qualities.  Love.  I mean, to 
really be able to understand love and listen to your 
children. 

<p>

MAN:  Important characteristics that a father 
should have, I believe, are very much the ones that my 
father had, and that's just a man of integrity, a man of 
honesty, a man who's really faithful to his family and also 
a loving father who really loves his kids. 

<p>

MAN:  I guess the first one would be humble and 
understanding and able to accept their children no matter 
what, just to love them for who they are.  That's really 
important. 

<p>

MAN:  I think a father needs to be real and one 
that can show affection and love. 

<p>

YOUNG MAN:  I love you and I'm sorry about all the 
problems we've had. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MAN:  Loving, warm, gentle, comforting, and more 
importantly, a listening ear for our children, and to be 
around them and caring. 

<p>

MAN: A father should be very loyal to his kids, 
love them unconditionally, be there for them no matter what, 
supporting them when things go well and when they don't go 
maybe as well as they would have liked and just know that, 
no matter what, we're always there for them. 

<p>

[End of Promise Keepers segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As we just saw, fatherhood requires 
a lot from men, and tonight's guests are here to discuss why 
many fathers have neglected that crucial role in their 
children's lives. 

<p>

I would like to welcome Terry Allen, chief of 
staff for Representative Steve Largent and father of five; 
Armstrong Williams, whom many viewers already know as a
television and radio talk show host and syndicated columnist
whose touching <i>USA Today</i> article honored his own father.

<p>

Also joining us is Bill Mattox, whom many of you 
know, FRC's Vice President for Policy, who consistently has 
made fatherhood a headlining issue and directed a national 
fatherhood campaign called Being a Dad is Important 
Business.  I would like to welcome all of you, a couple of 
days after Father's Day.

<p>

Bill, you wrote an Op-Ed not too long ago talking 
about how, on Father's Day, you get the joke cards; on 
Mother's Day you get the honoring and revering of motherhood 
and all that it is.  Why do fathers seem to get such a bad 
rap? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX: Well, you know, it's funny. There 
really is a very different quality to the types of cards 
that people give at Father's day.  I mean, you do see 
sentimental cards on both occasions, but it's rare that you 
see Mother's Day cards that have any kind of joke, or if 
there is some sort of humor involved, it quite often will 
take shots at Dad, whereas it's quite routine for fathers to 
be the butt of jokes in the Father's Day cards. 

<p>

I think some of this is probably a reflection of 
the fact that men open themselves up to that kind of abuse 
by failing to sometimes come off swiftly in their duties in 
the home.  But I think a lot of it is just a reflection of 
the fact that we expect fathers to kind of roll with the 
punches and to be able to mix it up with us. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Broad shoulders.

<p>

MR. MATTOX: Yes, and want, as you say, to kind of 
keep mothers in a revered status.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Fathers don't seem to get that.

<p>

Armstrong, your column was very revering, very 
reverent, and I am going to encourage people to call and get 
a copy of it.  But as you look at your own father and at 
fatherhood in general, why do you think that fathers don't 
often get the tribute you wrote for your own dad? 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, statistics would bear out 
that 70 percent of adolescent murderers are born into 
fatherless homes.  Sixty percent of American rapists come 
from fatherless homes.  I mean kids who don't do well in 
school and who have low self-esteem don't have a father in 
the home. 

<p>

And for me it was not a decision that I made; it 
was a decision that my parents made.  They took their 
marriage vows very seriously, for sickness or in health, for 
better or for worse, and till death do them part. 

<p>

The problem is not for me as a man.  I grew up 
with a father, so obviously, growing up with a father, all 
my adolescent life, obviously, I want to emulate that.  You 
only repeat the tape that's in the home. 

<p>

And with so many households today without fathers, 
many kids feel it's the norm, and you have it reinforced by 
television, by the movies, that, well, this is the norm.  
And a lot of mothers will say today, "I did a fine job.  I 
never missed a man."  But that is not true.  It takes two 
parents to raise a child. 

<p>

But this started 30 or 40 years ago, and unless we 
get back to teaching through the church and through other 
organizations that the best home is with a mother and a 
father, and to restore the man in his proper place, then it 
will never change; it will only get worse. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Terry, I thought it was an 
interesting contrast recently when Susan Molinari comes back 
to Congress with her child and is very welcomed.  I thought 
of all the men laboring as fathers rather unremarkedly.  You 
know, women are having children and they're coming in and 
working, and it's hardly discussed at all.  You know, you're 
in a place where there's a lot of work hours.  How is 
fatherhood viewed up on the Hill and in official Washington? 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Well, I think it is better than it 
used to be.  I think there is at least an attempt to have a 
family-friendly, or at least there's --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  More of an attempt.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  -- more of an attempt, at least an 
acknowledgement that we need to have a family-friendly 
Congress.  Whether or not we are actually there -- certainly 
in 1995 that was not the case; in 1996, the schedule is a 
little better and the hours are not as late. 

<p>

But I think, generally, it is not that different 
from where you have the attitude in corporate America or in 
society in general that, as Bill said, generally does not 
take the role of nurturer or provider as seriously; at least 
fathers are not thought of in that role as much as women 
are, and so it is a reflection of the attitude that 
individual fathers have that they are more expendable or 
they are more -- you know, if they work late, it's not that 
important, but if Mom works late, boy, the kids really feel 
it, because she is the primary care-giver.  And it's a 
reflection of the attitudes of our society and culture. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> Work and 
Family column has made a big deal in the last couple weeks, 
and the last two months in particular, about men getting on 
the daddy track; you know, CEOs resigning.

<p>

But do you think that's a real trend?  Are men 
maybe just publicly reevaluating a little more, or are they 
really getting on a daddy track? 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS: You know, it is true that you have 
a lot of households with both parents.  But you have 
absentee fathers.  I remember a story someone was telling me 
that there was this father who is a CEO, who is very busy, 
and he had planned to spend his kid's birthday with him for 
months in advance, and it was a 16th birthday. 

<p>

But then, all of a sudden, he got this speaking 
engagement that was going to pay him $1,000, but more 
importantly than the money, it would have afforded him an 
opportunity to sort of rub shoulders with the people that 
could really advance his career. 

<p>

And so, three weeks before the engagement, he met 
with his son and said, "Look, this engagement has come up.
I didn't realize it, but it's something that is very 
beneficial for me and it's going to help my career, so I'll 
cut a deal with you.  I'll give you the $1,000 and I'll go 
make the speech."

<p>

And the son said, "No, Dad, you keep the money.
It's more important that I spend the day with you." 

<p>

And that's a lot of what's going on, and I don't 
think it's that CEOs need to go back home and play nurturer; 
it's that they need to understand that they need to spend 
quality time with their children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  They need to just come home in general.

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  Right. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Rather than quit their job. 

<p>

What do you think, Bill?  Is there a daddy track? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX: I think that there is a reevaluation 
taking place among really both women and men, but I think 
particularly among men, because if you look -- especially I 
was noticing the clip on Promise Keepers -- if you go and 
talk to many of the individuals there, you'll find that 
among that kind of baby boomer cohort, there are a number of 
men who perceive that somehow they missed out and that they 
would like to devote more of their time and energy and 
attention to rearing children than perhaps their fathers 
did.

<p>

I am not altogether certain that some of the 
criticism that is often levied against the fathers of old is 
justified.  But I do think it's a healthy thing that many 
men today are taking these responsibilities more seriously 
and do appear to be willing to at least consider sacrifices 
that might not have been considered proper a generation or 
more ago. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about a minute left, and I 
wanted you all to respond quickly. <i>Newsweek</i>, I think, had a 
front-page and cover story on fathering, and they said that 
today's men universally think that they are better equipped 
to be fathers and are better dads.  Do you think we're 
raising a better generation of fathers, or has the self-esteem 
curriculum leaked into our national fatherhood debate?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  That's not politically correct. 

<p>

I don't think <i>Newsweek</i> could be further from the 
truth.  I think the dads of yesteryear were better; they 
were more disciplinarian, and plus they did not have to 
compete with the media culture of today.  I mean, parents 
have a lot to compete with, with music, with entertainment, 
and with the kids' culture, the environment that they are 
in.  So, no, I would not agree with <i>Newsweek</i> on that 
predictor.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to come back 
and hear the comments of the other two of you. 

<p>

<i>Straight Talk</i> brings you more after this 
commercial break.  Don't go away. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are celebrating 
fatherhood, and I am joined by Terry Allen, chief of staff 
for Representative Steve Largent; Armstrong Williams, who 
spans all media as a television and radio talk show host and 
syndicated columnist; and Bill Mattox, the Family Research 
Council's Vice President for Policy.  Welcome back. 

<p>

We were kind of talking about <i>Newsweek</i>'s 
assessment that today's dad is empowered to be the best dad 
that he can be.  Terry, what do you think?  I mean, have we 
invented a better father than the men of the 1940s and 1950s 
or even their ancestors?

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  I don't think so.  I hope so, but 
today's fathers are competing with a media that is openly 
hostile at times to the values that so many fathers want to 
instill in their children.  I know I run up against that.  
You know, we have a 6:30 hour where it is kind of after 
homework but before dinner and this kind of limbo time where 
the television shows that used to come on were <i>Happy Days</i>
and <i>Laverne and Shirley</i>, and now they are shows that I 
really have to watch for my children to pick up on things 
that I don't want them to hear. So it's tough. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.  Right around that hour you get 
<i>The Simpsons</i> with the inevitable buffoon father.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Yes, exactly, and <i>Married with
Children</i> and some of those.

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  [Unintelligible] the ones that you 
don't pick up on. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, right.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  So fathers are competing against a lot 
today that they didn't have to compete with 30 years ago. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. At least father knew something, even if he 
didn't always know best.

<p>

Bill, what do you think?  I mean, have we got the 
perfect genetic dad now? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX: No. I think it is very difficult to 
argue that at a time when four out of ten kids are going to 
bed every night living in a home without a father present 
that we have somehow reached an age or an era in which we 
have responsible fatherhood to the max.  We are certainly 
far short of that. 

<p>

I do think, however, that there is a subpopulation 
of fathers that, in light of all the problems around and in 
light of some of the challenges that are facing them, are 
perhaps stepping up to the plate in a new and different and 
perhaps better way than men of a previous generation, not 
that men of a previous generation wouldn't have done so, but 
that the circumstances were different, the surrounding 
culture was much more favorable.  The need for strong 
fathers and strong mothers may not have been as great. 

<p>

And so I do think that there is at least a 
subpopulation that is taking this stuff very seriously, and 
that gives us a glimmer of hope when we look at the 
magnitude of some of the problems that are caused by 
fatherlessness. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS: You know, and the other thing is, 
too, long ago you never had the kind of dysfunctional 
families that you have today, and that fathers would abandon 
their children was unheard of; nor did you have women who 
would be so boisterous about being pregnant and carrying 
somebody's child that they were not married to. 

<p>

And I would not even fool myself -- I don't know 
about Terry and everybody else here -- I would never 
convince myself that I could be a better parent, a better 
father than my father.  I would not even try to fool myself 
to say that I can achieve what my father achieved, because 
to me it is almost virtually impossible.  The course, the 
game has changed. 

<p>

You have to be more tolerant.  I mean, you have 
laws that say you cannot discipline your children.  Your 
child can file an abuse suit against you.  I mean, there are 
all kinds of things more important, which is the law.  The 
law makes it difficult for you to be a parent today, and you 
have to contend with that.

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think even what is a good father 
has lost its definition.  My own father, father of six -- I 
have to say, "Hey, Dad" -- when he would say, "How do I know 
that I love you?" in addition to all that he said, he would 
tell us, "Watch what I do.  You have food on the table, you 
have clothes on your back.  I am faithful to your mother.  
That's how you know that I love you."  And I heard him say 
that a million times, defining his love by his action. 

<p>

But today fathering can be defined as money, it 
can be defined as quality time, which I am not exactly sure 
what that is -- maybe you all do -- but how do you define 
what is a good father?  You know, our culture seems to 
picture a guy with a big credit card. 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  There's a great deal of confusion on 
this question in our culture.  I think that we are 
comfortable seeing Dad take on all kinds of new roles, if 
you would look at least at some of the women's magazines and 
that kind of thing.  But I think that there is a failure to 
appreciate some of the unique and irreplaceable 
contributions that men make to family life and the fact that 
mothers and fathers are not intended to be interchangeable. 

<p>

I think one of the things that is beginning to 
stir in some of the discussion taking place at least among 
people in this town and in other places around the country 
is a kind of renewed appreciation and recognition that 
fathers do bring something different to the table and that 
we want them to. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do they bring? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  Well, I think one of the things that 
they bring is the ability to help young children, especially 
boys, learn to develop self-control, especially over their 
kind of physical bodies and what not.  I mean, the scene of 
a dad, say, wrestling on the floor with children has, I 
think, in many ways been kind of seen as a nice little 
playful thing that doesn't really have a great deal of 
importance. 

<p>

But, instead, if you listen to some of the 
developmental psychologists, they'll tell you that, no, that 
sort of interplay, which we would never expect, really, of a 
mom, to be down on the floor wrestling, is quite important 
from the standpoint of helping boys to understand that they 
can use some of their aggressive tendencies in constructive 
ways but that there are limits and that when they cross 
lines and they kick or they bite or they punch in ways that 
are inappropriate, that there will be ramifications, there 
will be consequences. 

<p>

And if those lessons are taught in that kind of 
setting, then we don't often see boys of 14, 15, 16 out 
raping and pillaging. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's true. 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  When boys, however, are deprived of 
that kind of instruction, it's not at all surprising, then, 
that their aggressive masculine tendencies would spill over 
into all kinds of destructive social behavior. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think, Terry?  That is 
fascinating.  What's the mark of a good father?  You know, 
wrestling, playing with the children and bringing something 
different to the table. 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  I would have to say someone primarily 
who takes his responsibilities seriously.  You know, the 
technique, being a father is a relationship, and it takes 
time and it takes practice, and it is in the context of that 
relationship that you are a father. 

<p>

But, first and foremost, the commitment to be a 
father and to stay a father is primarily, I think, the most 
important thing, and that commitment over time will manifest 
itself in a myriad of different ways and forms and things 
that you as a father may not even pick up on.  But the fact 
that you're there, you're consistently there, and you're 
learning to work out your own faults and helping your 
children learn to grow and be mature and act responsibly, 
that in and of itself is profound, I think. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  You know, I think -- and I can only 
go back to my own childhood and my involvement with a lot of 
young men -- I think the most important thing that a father 
can do is teach his child that he is imperfect, that he does 
not have all the answers, and that the foundation of 
everything is in the Ten Commandments of the Bible. 

<p>

"And yet, when I'm not with you," as my father 
used to say to me, "when I'm not with you and you fall short 
and you're in a situation and you don't know what to do, you 
go to those laws and those commandments," which were etched 
in my heart.

<p>

When you teach your child that -- it is critical 
that a father teaches his child an example of discipline, 
work ethic, love for humanity, and routine.  A child, 
especially a young man, must have routine in their life.  
Especially a young man should not have idle time.  You must 
teach that child to work. 

<p>

And another thing that a father should do -- and I 
am sure these gentlemen may agree with me -- is that my 
father always taught us that no young man should ever be in 
bed past 8 a.m. in the morning.  A young man should be up. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: He rises and works.

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  If he has nothing to do, he should 
find something to do.  Those are very important lessons that 
can lead to big things. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: My father was on your team, believe me.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll hear more about 
the joys and trials of fatherhood.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[National Fatherhood Initiative PSA.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Like the National Fatherhood 
Initiative, which gave us the fatherhood public service 
announcement which we just saw, the men joining me today are 
actively working to restore respect to fatherhood.  Welcome 
back to Terry Allen, Armstrong Williams, and Bill Mattox. 

<p>

There is a tremendous love in Washington of 
government fixes for societal problems, and there are some 
things that government can do, perhaps more limited than it 
thinks.  But what can government do to help men in their 
desire to be good fathers or just to increase the profile of 
fatherhood? 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Well, there's two things we can do 
first off, right away.  First is end the penalty for intact 
families that we have in our public assistance programs.  We 
talked about the tragedy of fatherless children and broken 
homes.  We are actually, in federal policy, encouraging 
that, promoting that, and penalizing intact families through 
the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, which 
is more commonly known as welfare, and other public 
assistance programs.

<p>

And that is a tragedy.  And that has driven the 
demographic on the number of children that are in broken 
homes.  It's a tragedy.  It has to be stopped.  It was fixed 
in the welfare reform bill.  It was vetoed twice.  Enough 
said. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Not surprisingly.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  The second thing that we can do is we 
can address the family time famine, which the Family 
Research Council has talked a lot about, that basically in 
1950 the average family spent 2 percent of its income in 
federal taxes; today they spend 24 percent of its income in 
federal taxes.  That has driven the need for a second 
income, which creates all types of challenges for parents 
who struggle to raise children and spend time with their 
children.  So we have a famine of time that we are trying to 
find to spend with our kids. 

<p>

Those are two federal policies that we can fix 
right now to address that issue that are driving the 
demographics on fatherless families. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I was interested to see that the 
average second earner in a family, which is normally the 
woman, is bringing in around 30 percent of the family's 
overall budget, which is the tax burden of the average 
American family.  Astounding if you think about it. 

<p>

Anything else that government can do?  Or maybe 
the best thing it could do is stay out. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, the government should 
encourage marriage instead of rewarding promiscuity, which 
it does, and the government should also realize that the 
best department of health, education, and welfare is a two-
parent family, and the best that the government can do is 
encourage that through its policies by giving more power to 
parents over their children and over their families; by 
giving more tax breaks to families, and is something that it 
doesn't do. 

<p>

And in the name of compassion, even with a lot of 
government programs, with these programs, especially welfare 
and the Great Society programs, it has done more to 
discourage fathers from being in the home than anything 
else.  What kind of policy would say to you that unless the 
father is able to pay child support, then and only then can 
they have any kind of interaction with that child?  Whether 
that parent can afford to pay child support or not should be 
of least importance if that father wants to spend time with 
that child.  That child needs that father interacting with 
him on a daily basis so he can see that man, because women 
cannot teach boys how to be men.  Only a man can do that. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And, you know, you are never going 
to hear that in the cultural debate today.  I mean, men have 
been reduced to money.  If money comes in from the 
government, therefore, there is no need for men. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  We have talked to families and we 
have talked to kids, and we have talked to kids who have had 
fathers pay the money but yet they were absent, and the kids 
will tell you later on in life, "That's meaningless to me.
I didn't need the money.  I needed a father."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.  Can the government do 
anything, Bill, or can the government get out of the way? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  Well, I think that Armstrong is 
right, that there is a need for government policymakers to 
look for ways to strengthen and encourage marriage, and I am 
encouraged by the fact that a number of states are currently 
looking at divorce laws and seeking to make reforms that 
would make it difficult, if not impossible, for one spouse 
to unilaterally walk away from a marriage and leave the 
other spouse high and dry without any kind of legal 
recourse. 

<p>

I understand that there are a lot of families that 
have difficult times and are going through struggles and all 
of that, but I think it's important that we take seriously 
those marriage vows and that the state stand behind the 
promises that have been made from one spouse to the other 
and encourage as much as possible some type of 
reconciliation when problems do arise. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you find most encouraging in 
the national discussion of fatherhood that is taking place 
right now?  Because there are a lot more articles out there 
now.  Is there any encouraging data for people who are 
saying, you know, we've got fatherlessness as one of the 
greatest pathologies of all time facing our culture?  
Anything encouraging out there that you see? 

<p>


MR. WILLIAMS:  You know, I don't know if you 
realize this, but 80 percent of the time, when a father is 
given visitation rights with his children, he pays his money 
and he is active in the child's life.  Ninety percent of the 
time when he is given visitation rights and they both have 
legal rights to the child, they are active, and many times 
they end up maybe getting back with the mother.  But it has 
made a difference in the child's life and a difference in 
the growth.  So we need to encourage that. 

<p>

The sad thing about it -- and I don't want to 
blame this on liberalism -- we need to admit in this society 
that even though we tried policies, the whole thing to 
uplift mankind, a lot of these policies have done more harm 
than good, and we need to go back and look at these laws, 
and if these laws have not worked, if they have discouraged 
families, we need to change these laws.  We need to have the 
courage to say that we were wrong and to abandon some of 
these ideas and laws of the past.  And no one is willing to 
have the courage to step forward, because when you do, they 
will say you lack compassion.  And so people don't have the 
courage anymore to step up -- we need real men and women in 
society to stand up and say, "Hey, this does not work.  It 
doesn't matter what you call me.  Vilify me now, but the 
children will be the true winners in the future." 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We saw here in Washington, D.C., the 
Million Man March.  We saw here recently Promise Keepers, a 
national men's movement.  Do you think that the growth of 
these men's movements is going to help get men involved?  
Terry? 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Yes, I do.  I hope, and I have seen, 
and I am sure you have seen and we have all seen some of 
that on a local level around the country, Promise Keepers 
gatherings all across the country.  It is one of those 
movements that has kind of just caught on.  It is beyond the 
expectations of the founders of the organization now, and 
they are scratching where people are itching, and that is 
encouraging to know that men are starting to take their 
responsibility seriously and there is a willingness to 
discuss, Hey, what are my responsibilities as a father?  And 
even those fathers that are committed, they are willing to 
ask, Well, are there greater commitments that maybe I 
haven't really even considered?  And that is helpful. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to go around.  I am 
sorry, we are kind of coming near the end, unless, Bill, you 
want to add one other comment.  What I would like is if you 
all -- we have a couple, just about a minute and a half left 
-- would give the best piece of advice or a great piece of 
advice that your father gave you.  You know, this is our 
Father's Day tribute, so this is an opportunity for you all 
to give a tribute to your father. 

<p>

I could say that the best thing that my dad ever 
said to me is that work is good.  You know, it's not a bad 
thing; it's not a punishment.  Work is good, and so work. 

<p>

Bill, what would you say? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  I think the thing, the virtue that I 
think stands out most in what I think of my father is 
honesty.  He was incredibly -- I mean, he was an admissions 
officer at a major university and actually told one of my 
sisters, "Don't even bother to apply because I'm not going 
to cut you any special slack, and you don't make the grade." 

<p>

Well, you know, leaving aside whatever you may 
think of that, at the end of the day, he was someone who 
really did things by the book, who really believed in having 
integrity and being honest, and that is something that I 
think we don't see enough of these days. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to go quickly. 

<p>

Armstrong, your dad's best advice? 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  The best advice from my father was 
that God created us all equal, even though sometimes we may 
be treated (un)equally.  No matter what the hue of our skin 
may be, or our gender, we are all the same, and you judge 
people by their hearts, not by what they look like. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Great advice.  Terry, you're quick and last.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Well, more than the advice would be 
the example he gave of just being someone who is faithful, 
who has integrity and is consistent across the board with 
everything he did and said. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much, all of you. 

<p>

When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares more about 
the plight of America's families.  Please don't go away. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

Unfortunately, America's children suffer the loss 
of fathers primarily through divorce, a topic that was 
discussed in a Family Research Council press conference 
highlighting the Annual Family Issues Survey.  Let's hear 
more as we bring you some Homefront News. 

<p>

<p>

[Segment from FRC Family Issues Survey Press 
Conference November 21, 1995, follows:] 

<p>

COL. MAGINNIS:  Divorce.  Well, divorce is 
approaching about 50 percent of all marriages in this 
country, and it is devastating families from coast to coast. 
And we have found that divorce laws in virtually every state 
in this country give more legal right to the person seeking 
the divorce than for the spouse that wants to try to keep 
the family together. 

<p>

Now, when we asked all Americans, we found that 55 
percent of them favor legislation that would reverse this 
situation. 

<p>

Also, in divorce cases that are based on adultery 
or on abuse, we found that three out of four Americans say 
we want to favor the abused spouse by giving the abused 
spouse custody over children.  They want legislation to do 
that. 

<p>

And a majority indicate that they favor giving the 
non-philandering spouse more than half of the couple's 
property and, not surprisingly, as Bill pointed out earlier, 
we found that the divorce reform is particularly strong 
amongst those that are weekly church goers. 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  I do want to add one little footnote 
to that point that the colonel made about the divorce 
reform, and that is, not only are the religiously devout 
more likely than the average Americans to support such 
measures, divorce reform measures, but, interestingly, those 
in that 20-something generation, the generation X crowd, 
have a higher than average level of support for divorce 
reform measures.  This, I think, is quite likely a 
reflection of the fact that many of them have, themselves, 
experienced some of the negative fallout of their parents' 
divorce and are looking for ways in which to undergird 
marital stability.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are bringing you an issue which
touches the life of every mother and father.  Parental
rights have slowly diminished in our schools and our
culture, sometimes through the growth of the social worker 
state, sometimes through the courts.  Little by little, 
these rights have been placed in the hands of teachers, 
social workers, judges, and bureaucrats.  The politically 
correct mentality seems to find parents guilty until proven 
innocent.

<p>

We will show you exclusive clips from Congressman 
Steve Largent's staff briefing regarding the Parental Rights 
and Responsibilities Act.  You will hear the shocking story 
of a father of an 11-year-old girl who underwent a genital 
exam at her school without the consent or prior notification 
of her parents.

<p>

To help us understand why parents are fighting for 
their inherent rights to lovingly guide their own children, 
I had the opportunity to talk to representatives from 
several state policy councils who are increasingly hearing 
parents' cries for help. Let's take a look.

<p>

I am joined first -- let me go around, ladies 
first -- by Linda Dealy, who is on the board of directors of 
Capital Resource Institute in California; and then Joe 
Clark, who is executive director of the Illinois Family 
Institute.  We go to Steve Knudsen, who is director of state 
and local affairs for the Family Research Council and 
recently joined Family Research Council after heading a 
Texas FPC.

<p>

To my right, we have John Paulton of the South 
Dakota Family Policy Council; then Bill Brooks of the North 
Carolina Family Policy Council; and finally, last but not 
least, Paul Sienna of the Family Policy Center in Missouri.
A wonderful state, I vacation there often.

<p>

But Steve, let's go to you first.  You were at the 
local level, taking a look at parents' issues.  Now you are 
in Washington, D.C.  There are a lot of things that you 
could choose to have on your plate, but we are looking at 
parental rights and responsibilities.  Why?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  Well, it is interesting, Kristi.
Our first lady has talked a lot about it takes a village, 
and I happen to think that is taking an African proverb 
somewhat out of context.  I think what that proverb is 
trying to say was that a village should support a parent as 
it raises its child.  What she is suggesting is that the 
village should raise the child.  So we have a situation here 
where governmental entities across our country are trying to 
take more and more of the child-raising responsibilities 
away from parents.  So we really need to find a way to alter 
that and actually stem the tide.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  This week, on Sunday as a matter of 
fact, the Democratic leadership introduced its family plan, 
and what is always interesting -- I mean, we are not having 
a partisan discussion here -- but so many Democratic family 
plans involve them saying this is what I am going to do for 
your family or maybe to your family, while a lot of 
Republican approaches have been this is how we are going to 
empower parents.

<p>

The Family Rights and Responsibilities Act for 
some people is difficult to understand, but how would you 
all describe it, and in particular, how do you describe it 
to the people you are talking to?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  When we talk about this particular 
issue in California, the thing that I really try to bring 
home every time is that it is called the Family Rights and 
Responsibility Act because rights and responsibilities go 
hand in hand.  When you have a responsibility for something, 
you should also have the right to fulfill that 
responsibility.  When you have a right to something, every 
right carries with it a certain amount of responsibility, 
and that is exactly where parents need to be and should be 
and should be free to be is the ones that are directly 
responsible for the oversight and raising of their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Where in your states have you seen 
the line crossed?  You know, if we are saying in the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act that parents are 
being encroached, you know, their territory is being seized, 
where are we seeing it seized?

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Kristi, we have seen it in North 
Carolina in recent years just through giving social services 
more authority.  One of the things, of course, that goes 
along with the parental responsibility is the necessity to 
exercise that responsibility, and where we see that not 
exercised in society, there is always the tendency to step 
in and say, well, what can be done, and if you are the 
government, if you have a mindset that this is the 
government's problem, then the cure is going to be 
governmental, and we do not always think, particularly when 
it comes to basic rights of parents and children, that that 
is the appropriate response.

<p>

We have seen situations where social services has 
the ability to drive by a neighborhood and basically make a 
decision on a child being in an inappropriate situation and 
then taking action to do something about that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So you are saying they would, like, 
drive through a neighborhood and say this home looks 
inappropriate; perhaps we should check further?

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Well, or you may have a situation 
where a neighbor calls up and says, well, I saw Mr. Wood 
spank his child in the front yard, and all of a sudden 
social services shows up, takes the child into protective 
custody until they investigate the situation.  So the parent 
automatically is put on the defensive, instead of the 
presumption being that the parent was exercising what was in 
the best right of the child.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Kristi, before we go any further, I 
would like to draw a distinction between the Parental Rights 
Amendment movement, which is underway in about 28 or 29 
states right now, as well as the federal legislation, which 
is different, and that is underway here, sponsored by Steve 
Largent.

<p>

As you look at the state initiative, so far it has 
not passed in any state.  It is very difficult to pass 
amendments through general assemblies at the state level, 
and probably Colorado is further along than anyone at this 
point.  They have an initiative underway there by the voters 
of that state.  In Illinois this year, we got it through the 
executive committee of the senate, and the night before 
there was to be a vote by our full senate, in talking with 
the senate leadership decided not to call it for a vote, 
because it was very iffy, very problematic, as to whether or 
not we had that vote.

<p>

But the major distinction here that I want to make 
is that each state has slightly different language.  For 
example, ours read that the fundamental right of parents to 
direct the upbringing and education of their children shall 
not be infringed. Colorado's is different.  What is going 
on in other states is a little bit different, as well, and I 
assume we will come back and talk about the language to the 
federal legislation.

<p>

But as you look at the examples that have brought 
about the need for this, ours tend to be much more in 
education, and we have time after time seen situations 
similar to what Bill mentioned, except where educators have 
intervened in families, and probably one of the more 
flagrant ones that I recall was actually given as testimony 
at one of the hearings that was held by our legislators in 
Springfield was the Milar[?] family down in Champaign.  This 
was a family that was abiding by state law which says you 
can opt out of objectionable sex education programs.  The 
regional superintendent and the principal for that area, for 
that school, had decided to test this apparently, and so 
they refused to let them opt out.

<p>

We had to get the Rutherford Institute and some 
pro bono attorney work done, and we finally got it to the 
attorneys at the State Board of Education, and all of a 
sudden they said, okay, we will let you opt out.  So about 
four families immediately opted out of that program.

<p>

So there is a very aggressive thought process, 
very intentional process going on in the Illinois education 
system to push this, test this parental rights situation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think sometimes parental rights is 
easier to understand historically.  In Pennsylvania, where I 
am originally from, Amish people worked very hard to have a 
separate school system.  I think we are all aware that 
Christian Scientists often have worked very hard to make 
different medical choices.  But for the rest of us, the 
lines are not always clear.

<p>

Steve, we are going to come back and talk more 
about the state initiatives, but do you see this as going 
away any time soon?  I mean, are we going to resolve it in 
the near future?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  I think this is going to be a battle 
for some time to come as some people try to redefine the 
rights and responsibilities of parents for them and as 
parents fight to maintain the traditional understanding of 
their rights and responsibilities, and like many issues that 
we deal with, there are people who ideologically will push 
this and push this and push this, and as parents who believe 
in our traditional role, it is going to be an ongoing battle 
until the hearts and minds of our country come around to 
understand the time-tested and age-proven responsibilities 
of parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When we come back, we are going to 
talk more about what our parents' rights and 
responsibilities are.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape of Representative Steve Largent follows.]

<p>

MR. LARGENT:  But I will tell you that I believe 
that the long-term effect of what is taking place in our 
country -- I would describe it as opposed to being a tragic 
incident that causes Congress to act in a knee-jerk fashion, 
that in fact this is more of a slow erosion of parents'
authority and their ability to direct the upbringing of 
their children that has taken place over the last 10, 20 
years, and it has become increasingly more common across the 
country, where we are now seeing cases from literally every 
state in the country where a parent's ability to raise their 
children continues to be undermined time and time again.  So 
that is why I think that we have had more difficulty in 
getting Congress to move on the Parental Rights and 
Responsibility Act, although I will tell you that we have a 
good deal of momentum, and it is due largely to the 
tremendous support that we have gotten from the grassroots, 
from parents, from moms and dads all across the country that 
have been affected and are very concerned, in fact, worried, 
in fact I would even go so far as to say scared as to losing 
their ability to raise their own children and make decisions 
in directing their children's upbringing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I am joined by leaders at the 
state level who have been working on the Parental Rights and 
Responsibility Act and some state-based parents' rights 
issues.

<p>

Paul, before the break, we were talking about what 
are our rights and responsibilities, and you had some 
legislation in your state where that is being defined for 
us.  What is happening on that?

<p>

MR. SIENNA:  Well, actually it is the Missouri 
state Goals 2000 plan, and I think the primary issue here is 
whose children are these?  The plan itself explicitly states 
that the community takes ownership of and responsibility for 
our children, and it further goes on to state that the 
teachers know best about the health and well-being of the 
children.  In fact, this academic plan contains more 
information about the health and human services of the child 
than what it does about the academic performance and 
assessment.  So this is one of the fundamental things we 
have to ask ourselves and our government:  whose children 
are they?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And the government seems to have an 
answer.  You know, Steve, you wrote recently on an incident 
in East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania, actually a town I have 
been to many times, and it is hard to believe in a small 
community like that of several thousand this could happen, 
but what happened there in terms of the state determining 
what is best for children's health?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN: Well, several years ago in a couple 
of different instances, the state mandated that there would 
be a medical test of children within the school systems at 
the first grade, sixth grade, and eleventh grade, and in 
this particular incident, several sixth grade girls were 
taken for their medical exam to be performed by a doctor 
that the school district brought in, and what happened was 
that the doctor decided that she needed to do not only just 
the overall exam but also genital exams on the girls.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And they were how old?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  This was sixth grade.  So they were 
12-year-old girls.  When the girls said no, they did not 
want to go through with that, they were still forced to.  
One tried to get out through a window.  One tried to call 
her parents.  They would not let her call her parents.  This 
was something that had not been told to the parents ahead of 
time.  I mean, the parents knew of the medical exam, but it 
was, again, one of those opt-out scenarios.

<p>

So if the note gets lost or if somehow the parent 
does not come back with the opt-out, the kids are 
automatically included.  There was no mention of a genital 
exam being performed.  In fact, the school district admitted 
afterwards that they did not know one was going to be 
performed, but they have come out now and said that they 
were within their right to perform it and so on and so 
forth.

<p>

But the bottom line is that you have 12-year-old 
girls who are being subjected to something that the parents 
had no clue was going to happen of an incredibly intimate 
nature.  Several of the girls have talked about nightmares 
since then, and different things that are going on, because 
they felt violated.  The fact that the school district has 
come out in support of the doctor, has not admitted a 
mistake, because their lawyers think they are going to be 
taken to court, you know, all those things.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  And here is the whole thing.  Who best 
cares for the well-being of these children?  Who has those 
children's best interest at heart?  You take 12-year-old 
girls who have been traumatized, literally, for the rest of 
the lives, that the schoolteachers and the doctor are going 
to go off on their merry way after these children are gone, 
but the parents are going to have to deal with and help in 
not only the healing process but the adjustment process for 
these girls for the rest of their lives on this, and this is 
something that not only did not the school not have any 
right by any rational reasoning concept to have been 
involved in this way with the children, but then for the 
legal community to side against the parents, the parents are 
left standing all by themselves.  It really does beg to the 
heart of the question of who cares the most for those 
children? Who has those children's long-term best interests 
at heart?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  John, what are you seeing?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  Well, that is a major example, the 
East Strasbourg situation, but I think daily there are 
examples of the more common variety.  Just at the end of 
this last school year, I had a parent call me and say that 
she was upset because her daughter, her fourth grade 
daughter, was going to be going to a science fair in the 
middle part of the state, several hundred miles, staying 
overnight in a hotel, unsupervised, and she did not feel 
comfortable with that.  Understandably, she wanted to go 
along.  She wanted to take her daughter.

<p>

The school district said no.  If the daughter is 
going to go, she has to go on the bus with the other 
students; you cannot go.  There were a number of parents 
that were very upset about that, and they had to go through 
a process of several meetings, letters.  Eventually they did 
get that right back, but again, you just have to ask the 
question:  whose kids are these?

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Let me hasten to add that it varies 
very much by school district and by even school building, 
and to say that all schools are doing this is erroneous.  In 
fact, there are many teachers and some administrators that 
are very concerned about this thing that is taking place.  
So what it comes back to is each parent, each family, has to 
monitor what is going on at their school with their teachers 
and their children, because you cannot know for sure unless 
you have done the homework that you need to do as a parent.

<p>

MR. DEALY:  Which is a really good point, John, 
that yes, these are the extreme examples that we can cite 
here, but in light of that, the legal groundwork has been 
laid that this could happen anywhere, and they would be 
protected.  That is why we go back to why this legislation 
is necessary.  It is to reassert and establish once and for 
all that it is parents who have the ultimate rights and 
authority and responsibility for the rearing of their 
children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think that might be the consensus 
around this table, but I am reminded of a case out of 
Washington State where parents -- a child, an 8-year-old boy 
who was shy was given counseling by the school without 
parental knowledge or consent.  When the boy started acting 
strangely and they took him to their own counselor and were 
told this boy has obviously been treated, what happened to 
him, they tried to get those medical records and lost a 
court case, to see the records for their own son, from the 
counseling that they did not choose and still have no first-hand 
knowledge of.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  I think the issue here, too, gets 
back to we are hearing so much the mantra of the day is it 
takes a village, and it is okay if the village has the same 
values, but unfortunately the village that many times is 
spoken of is contrary to the values that we hold dearly as 
parents.  We are seeing situations in Missouri where kids 
who are struggling with same-sex identity issues are sent to 
a counselor who happens to be a homosexual, and that is like 
sending a drunk to another drunk for counseling.  I mean, it 
just does not seem to work out that way.

<p>

One of the things that just still concerns me 
greatly, as I have three children, in order for them to take 
an aspirin at school, I have to send a permission slip.  But 
in some of the same schools, kids can go off-campus, receive 
abortion counseling and abortions without the parental 
consent.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And let's remember, this is a 
surgery.  You know, abortion is a surgery.  They will not 
give you an aspirin, but they will take your child 
anonymously for surgery without telling anyone.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  Right.  Life-threatening in many cases.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Exactly.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  And then at the same time, we will go 
back to it, you cannot get your ears pierced as a minor.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is right.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  Without parental written consent, but 
not only can you be -- some of these schools will arrange 
for abortions for these young girls, but then they will also 
arrange for -- in California -- for the state welfare agency 
to pick up the cost and arrange for those medical records to 
be sealed so that the parents, even if the parents found out 
and wanted to get the medical records again, they would be 
sealed from the parents to be able to have that information.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to talk more 
about what parents are facing and struggling with across 
America.  Please stay with us for more <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

[Videotape segment of Paul Tucker's staff briefing follows.]

<p>

MR. TUCKER:  We sent our child to school one day, 
with all the expectations that she is going to be going to 
school and there will be no problem, and she was informed 
that she had to go down for a physical examination.  She 
thought, no problem, because my daughter does go to camp 
every summer.  We do have physicals every summer for our 
children, and we do have the paperwork filled out, and we 
hand that in.

<p>

My daughter decided to leave class early to go 
down to the office to explain to these nurses that she had 
the paperwork filled out, that she really did not need a 
physical.  When she informed the nurses that she had done 
so, the nurse said "we have lost your paperwork; you have to 
have the physical."

<p>

My daughter said "but I already had one." They 
said, "well, it is too bad.  You have to have one anyway."
She said, "well, let me call my mother." They said no. "It 
does not matter what your parents think, you are going to 
have this physical anyway.  It would not matter what your 
mom said." Susie said, "I do not want a physical.  I don't
want that." They had heard some rumors that there was a 
genital part of this exam, and my daughter did not want to 
have this happen to her.

<p>

They said, "it's too bad, you have to have the 
exam," and my daughter, being a real nice girl -- I mean, 
just think of your daughter.  You teach them to respect 
teachers.  You teach them to respect elders, and there are 
certain things that have to be done in life that are not 
pleasant and stuff, but this really was not one of them that 
had to be done, especially at school, and Susie knew that 
she was not of age -- she is only 11 years old -- was not of 
age to have this type of genital exam.  The girls that were 
coming out prior to this were crying and real upset.

<p>

My daughter obeyed, under the pressures of the 
school, under the pressures of people she is supposed to 
respect, and went along with this exam.

<p>

The girls were asked in a room to strip down into 
their panties and their bras and stand there with no 
covering on whatsoever, and a lot of the girls were really 
upset at this point.  They were escorted into a room one at 
a time where the female nurse and a female pediatrician was 
to examine them.  This pediatrician, we have no idea, I have 
never met her, I have never heard of her, and I do not know 
who gave the right to do this type of examination on my 
daughter.  I certainly did not.

<p>

I turned my child over to the school.  The nurses 
were in charge of my daughter at this time.  The nurses 
should have taken responsibility and stopped at that.  My 
daughter went through a gynecological exam really against 
her will, against my will, my wife's will, without our 
knowledge whatsoever, and without our written consent.  We 
had no idea this was going to happen.

<p>

We sent our child to school one day to go to 
school.  My child comes home with this story that is 
unbelievable.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. I am joined by some real 
experts in parents' rights and state-based issues, some 
grassroots leaders from across America.

<p>

Before we went to the break, we were talking about 
the things that we have seen that often abuse parents'
rights, but you know, on the other side, people would say, 
look, what we are concerned about is that there are children 
being abused, that there are children who are being 
molested, and that parents, if they are not correctly 
monitored, may be actually injuring kids.  You know, who is 
against the Parents' Rights and Responsibilities Act?

<p>

MR. CLARK: As we worked on this Parental Rights 
Amendment to the Illinois State Constitution, one afternoon 
we counted ten lobbyists working the other side of the 
issue, and at least six of them, we believe, were in the 
employ of the National Education Association or the Illinois 
Education Association.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And their interests are a little 
different than children being molested.  They are a bit more 
personal.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  They were.  They were.  In fact, 
several school administrators have come to me privately, 
Christian men all, saying that, you know, we have a concern 
about this, because it will create havoc in our schools, 
which, in fact, it will not, and we come back to that.  But 
the other groups that are leading the opposition, the 
American Civil Liberties Union and a group in Illinois 
called Voices of Illinois Children, which was funded by some 
very liberal foundations, the concern that they voice is 
that this will be the parental abuse amendment, and they say 
that this is another way for protection of parents who 
discipline, spank, or abuse physically and mentally their 
children.  Now the fact of the matter is, abuse and neglect 
are defined through some 20-some-odd pages in the Illinois 
code already, and those laws are not impacted at all, and 
once you start taking people, legislators in particular, 
through that thought process, most of them are attorneys, 
and they understand very quickly that that is absurd.  That 
is not going to take place.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That there already are laws to deal 
with the injury of children, but there is no law to deal 
with parents.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  That is right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do we think that parents are really 
going to abuse their children under cover of this bill?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  No, I do not believe so.  I think 
that, as Joe states, the laws are already written clearly.  
Where the laws are already written, we are safe.  This is 
not going to override protections in those areas that 
already exist.  What it will do is make sure that we are not 
only putting the responsibilities on parents, but we are 
giving them the proper control.

<p>

In South Dakota, we recently passed what we call 
the Grandparents' Bill for minors who have children, 
basically the parents who are the grandparents of the 
youngster that is coming along, they have the responsibility 
to provide.  It is a step in that direction.  But if we are 
putting that responsibility upon them, which I think is 
rightfully so, taking them out of the welfare system, giving 
the parents the responsibility, we ought to also be 
reaffirming their rights to raise and direct the upbringing 
of their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Absolutely.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  The point that I was going to make is 
that the unfortunate reality in the world that we live today 
is there are some parents who have abdicated the proper 
responsibility of raising healthy children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So will this bill keep them from doing that?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  This bill will not keep them from 
doing that, but this bill will -- but that is a legal and 
criminal issue, and this bill in no way affects the criminal 
justice system from going after the appropriate measures 
towards those parents.  What it does is protect the rights 
of the vast majority of the rest of us parents who do have 
the primary goal of raising happy, healthy well-adjusted 
self-reliant children from being intruded upon by that same 
social services or criminal justice system in a wrongful way.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  As a matter fact, the other thing, 
too, in following up what Joe was saying, the opposition to 
a bill such as this, the recent Stand for Children rally 
here in Washington, D.C., if you look at the list of the 
organizations that participated in that rally, it was 
anything but a place for children.  Most of the groups that 
are opposed to this are opposed to the values that made 
America great.  Yes, we need to reaffirm the values of 
parents, and to follow up what Linda said, in other words, 
with responsibility comes accountability.  We at this table 
realize that there is a greater place of accountability than 
our government, but by the same token, we do not want to 
erase the necessary laws that are there that if you have 
abusive parents, to make sure that that is dealt with within 
our society.  That has always been dealt with.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It almost seems like it is more, in 
many ways, drawing a line in the sand between the social 
worker mentality in which parents are guilty until proven 
innocent, you know, that we are assuming parents are abusive 
and are molesting and are injuring, and if we do not get in 
there to help, we are going to have problems with that.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Kristi, we had a situation in North 
Carolina where there is a particular program that I will not 
name, but basically the social workers could come into the 
home under basically the -- what they were trying to do was 
to teach parents how to parent, but while they were there, 
they had a checklist, and they would look, and they would 
observe, and there was this long list of things that was 
totally judgmental and subjective, and based on these 
checklists, they then would have the authority to go back in 
and presumably intervene in these situations.  But we have 
seen that, and we see this cropping up in North Carolina in 
little small different ways.

<p>

We have a bill, for example, this past session 
which did not pass but would take away from parents the 
right to control who had access to their children, and it 
was entitled the Grandparents' Rights Act, but it basically 
would give presumption to grandparents to be able to sue 
parents to be able to get visitation rights to children, and 
the whole thing was based on a very few isolated cases 
around the states where unfortunately we had some parents 
that maybe should have given some more rights to the 
grandparents or had better access, but there was one couple 
who said, well, what we are after is the right to have those 
children for 3 weeks unattended in the summer and every 
other weekend by ourselves.  So this was sort of an unusual 
and strange situation that led to some legislation, but you 
just never know where it is going to crop up.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There is a lot of legislation coming 
out.  Steve, we have to go quickly to the break, but do you 
think if there was -- so many of our examples are school-related. 
Would school choice help wipe out some of this 
need, or is that only a small drop in the bucket here?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  Well, school choice is a vital 
component in my belief, because it says to the parents, we 
are giving you back an opportunity to be the guardian and 
control the upbringing of your child.  It puts 
responsibility back in the parents' courts. So it gives 
them the ball to play with.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  It acknowledges that parents know best 
for their individual children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In particular, for their own school choices.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  They know the best environment in 
which that child is going to learn and flourish, because 
parents know intimately their children as individuals, 
rather than as just names on a roll or numbers in somebody's
book.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  The government has their Social 
Security Number, and they are here to help you.

<p>

When we come back, we are going to talk more about 
parents' rights and responsibilities.

<p>

[Videotape of Representative Steve Largent follows.]

<p>

MR. LARGENT:  Most of the opposition to the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act comes from the 
education bureaucracy.  Just a little interesting fact for 
you to know as to how I view or why I think the opposition 
is there from the education bureaucracy, and that manifests 
itself either through the NEA or the PTA, librarians, those 
are the folks that I guess have been in our office most 
often, is that in 1930 in this country there were 130,000 
individual school boards, school boards that were manned by 
moms and dads making decisions on the local level as to what 
their children were to be taught and how they were to be 
taught it in their schools.

<p>

In 1993, there are now not 130,000 school boards; 
there are 15,000 school boards.  So what has happened is in 
this turf battle for determining who raises our children, 
the education bureaucracy has clearly gained a lot of 
ground.  When you replace 130,000 school boards of moms and 
dads making decisions on the local level and reduce it down 
to 15,000 school boards, the education bureaucracy fills the 
vacuum very, very quickly.

<p>

So when you introduce a bill in Congress like the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, whose purpose it 
is to strengthen the ability of families, those moms and 
dads, to make decisions for their children, then you are 
going to get resistance from the people that had filled the 
vacuum, which in this case is the education bureaucracy.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, and we are talking about 
parents' rights and responsibilities, whether or not the 
government recognizes them, respects them.  What kind of 
authority do parents really have?

<p>

I am sitting here with some very leading 
individuals at the state level who have worked on this both 
at their legislative level and now are interested in what is 
happening at the federal level.

<p>

We were talking a little bit earlier about the 
Rights and Responsibilities Act, and you brought up a very 
interesting concern that the people of Illinois have.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Well, one of the first questions is 
why do we need this kind of legislation at all, and the 
point we try to make is that we are trying to reclaim some 
lost ground.  There are a couple of Supreme Court decisions 
from back in the 1920s, 1923 and 1925, that really lay out 
this concept very clearly, but state courts and some federal 
courts have ignored those as they have made decisions.

<p>

So the idea is to put this amendment at the state 
level forward to start a debate, number one, and get people 
to rethink the role of parents versus the state in who 
should be raising the kids, and then secondly, to give 
parents a whole new standing legally by amending a state 
level constitution.  Nothing happens immediately if an 
amendment is approved.  What has to happen then, as each 
school district and as each court case comes up, the judge 
or the school administrators have to rethink, now, what are 
we doing that might be in conflict with that?

<p>

I like to make the analogy of the Freedom of 
Speech in the Bill of Rights, because nobody tells you what 
that means on a day-to-day basis, yet intuitively over the 
decades we have evolved a body of law that says what that 
is, and by putting this amendment in the state constitution, 
we can see that we will get more consistent decisions out of 
state and federal courts.

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  That reclaiming of lost ground that 
Joe talks about, it is kind of like human nature is like 
water.  We pick the course of least resistance.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And what is happening here is that the government 
comes in and says let us take over.  Let us do more of this.  
We will pick where your kids are educated.  We will pick how 
to teach them sex ed.  I mean, how many parents really 
relish the idea of talking about sex with their teenage 
kids, you know, raise your hand, uh uh.  I mean, it is 
something you do not look forward to, and so the state says, 
hey, we will do that for you, and a lot of parents go, whew, 
man, right on, I'm out of here.  So what we have to do is 
come back and reaffirm the responsibilities that parents 
have, the rights that come along with those, and begin to 
reeducate parents as to their proper role, because what we 
are doing right now is we are taking that path of least 
resistance, and as long as the government continues to offer 
us more services to raise our kids, unfortunately a lot of 
parents are choosing --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To allow them to do it.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  It is too easy.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  It goes back to this whole notion 
that people are afraid that this Parental Rights and 
Responsibility Act is going to redefine what it means to be 
a parent, and in fact, it is not going to redefine what it 
means to be a parent, because that definition has never 
really changed.  Our culture has tried to change the 
definition, but we need to go back to the original 
definition of what it is to be a parent, and that is to take 
the responsibility for our own children.

<p>

I grew up in a small town where everyone knew 
everyone, and if I was in trouble, before I got home my 
mother knew that I was in trouble, because everyone knew who 
Beverly and Charlie's kids were.  As a matter of fact, I 
accused my mother of working for the CIA, and as I got 
older, I found out that she did not work for the CIA; in 
fact, they worked for her.  She was the boss.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But we need to get back to that original 
definition and the responsibilities associated with being a 
parent, and I think that is what this act tries to do is to 
bring that back.

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  Paul touched on something, I think, 
that is crucial to the debate, and that is the sense of 
community.  The key thing that he said was that when he was 
in trouble and someone saw him, who did they call?  They did 
not call social services.  They called his parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right.

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  They went to the authority, and they 
called the parents, and they said here is what is going on.  
I think we need to refoster that.  We have lost the sense of 
aunts and uncles, because we move a lot.  Someone said the 
other day garage door openers were the worst thing that 
could happen to a community, because we open the door as we 
are driving in and we close it before we get out of our car.  
We no longer wave to the people that live to one side -- we 
do not even know the people that live to one side or the 
other of us.  So we need to get back to understanding that 
sense of community, to understand that the parent has the 
authority over the kids, and that we do not call social 
services, we call the parent.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When we come back, we are going to 
hear more about the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act 
and from the state leaders who are helping make it happen.
Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. We are talking about 
parental rights and responsibilities and are we having some 
of both or neither.  Frankly, this particular issue is part 
and parcel of a lot of momentum.

<p>

What are you seeing on that?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  Well, yes, I think what we have been 
talking about here really reminds us that this bill, this 
whole parental rights movement, goes to the heart of the 
conservative movement as a whole.  That is, less government, 
more individual responsibility.  When I come back to 
Washington from South Dakota, walk around and see the 
buildings, row upon row of government buildings, I am just 
reminded of all of the work that politicians have done to 
try to solve our problems, and they have just created more.  
We need to turn more authority back to the local level, and 
the most local level of all is parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Why do you think that is, though, 
because clearly the government says the family is 
dysfunctional -- you know, that is such a yuppie word -- and 
the government needs to step in.  Why do you think some of 
this has kind of created problems?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  Well, I believe it actually has been 
kind of a self-perpetuating cycle.  The government sees a 
problem and maybe has a legitimate concern about it, perhaps 
oversteps their boundaries a bit, and you know, the welfare 
examples would be classic in that sense that problems are 
addressed, perhaps even with good intentions, and yet the 
result is people turn to government even more, rely on 
government even more.  We need to at least make that 
reminder, put that reminder out there, that individual 
responsibility, parental responsibility, is ultimate.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  You just said a key phrase:
individual responsibility.  I look at my generation and what 
was going on in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s and how many 
people made individual choices to do what is right for me as 
a person and not for the larger community or for the family, 
and one of the best responses I have heard to that "It Takes 
a Whole Village" was coined by my predecessor in this job, 
Penny Poulin[?] back in Illinois who said it takes a whole 
family, and when you understand that and you take on the 
responsibility as an individual for your role in that 
family, then a lot of these problems go away.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA: But you know, Steve brought up a 
good point earlier about the whole idea of taking the path 
of least resistance, but many times our government has 
created this situation that causes the parents to take that 
path of least resistance.  I know Linda talked about the 
necessity in many homes where it is no longer a choice for 
there to be two parents working, and so you begin to see now 
that --

<p>

MS. DEALY:  If we were not taxed at the level we 
are, there would not be a need for many mothers to be -- 

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  So the need for daycare early and 
often comes up, and the whole idea now you find parents who 
are looking for not only that before care and after care, 
but they are also becoming proponents of year-round 
schooling, because, hey, that is a lot more convenient.  The 
thing that concerns me most about that -- we have heard the 
examples given here -- is that the school has been the 
vehicle by which parental rights have been taken away the 
most.  So we need to really -- and someone talked about it 
earlier, the individual responsibility and accountability 
that comes with us as parents to be informed.

<p>

Joe, you touched on that, for people to go back 
and to know what has gone on in their local school district.  
The best way to change this is not Washington, D.C. down, 
even though this is important.  But the best way to change 
it is for people to go to their local school district where 
they know the school board members' names, the 
superintendent's name, the principal's name.  I mean, they 
live in that same community with those folks and address it 
there.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Kristi, one of the things that I 
think we forget when we are looking at public policy, and I 
am an economist, so I tend to focus in this direction more 
than maybe some others, is the old adage, follow the money.  
One of the things that we have touched on is that these 
institutions have been built by government and by 
politicians over the last 30 or 40 years, and they are 
large, and they are powerful, and they get billions of 
dollars a year, a lot of which they use back to lobby to 
keep those funds.  So as powerful organizations, they have a 
vested self-interest to protect, and we see a lot of these 
proposals coming from these organizations, and as you 
pointed out, I believe you said you had 10 people opposing 
you from the education establishment on your parental rights 
bill in Illinois.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  That is the lobbyists, yes.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Now that is an example of the power 
that they can wield.  So we have to look at that, follow the 
money.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  At taxpayer expense, the power that 
they wield against us, with our money.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Right, at taxpayer expense.  And we 
have to point that out, and we have to show that what we are 
dealing with is people who are not acting necessarily in our 
best interests or in the best interests of our children, but 
in their best interests, because they are trying to protect 
their jobs, protect their institutions that have been built 
up over the years.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right.  See, it is interesting when 
you look at it.  The average private school education costs 
about $2,000, $1,500 to $2,000, while the average public 
school education is like $5,000 to $6,000, and as a matter 
of fact, in the District of Columbia where we have metal 
detectors protecting us from ourselves, the average 
education here is around $9,000 per child.  Yet, if you look 
at the numbers at Catholic schools or private schools or 
even the homeschoolers in terms of SAT scores, blowing it 
out of the water.  Why then -- you know, and I ask this of 
you -- why then are we not more in favor of things like 
educational choice, which give power to the parents when we 
see the impact?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  Well, each of us are.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We here are.  So the question you are asking is 
why is the education establishment not more in favor?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But why is society not in favor of 
giving parents authority?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  That just highlights the reality of 
what their interest is.  Their interest is not the quality 
education of the child or the student.  Their interest is in 
the whole larger picture, which is either self-perpetuation, 
protecting their own jobs and advancement, or they have a 
larger sociological agenda, to have an impact on the -- and 
they are all in there together, and I always have to be 
careful when I talk about that, because I do not want to 
discount -- when I am making complaints against education, I 
am talking about the educational bureaucracy and the 
leadership of the teachers' unions and things like that, not 
the individual teachers who too often are so oppressed by 
their own establishment that they are in there being -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, they are the ones that are 
forced to do these things.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  They can be well-intentioned and have 
the best interests of the child but be held in a 
stranglehold to be able to be effective as they would like 
to be as teachers.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  It is not quality.  It is the 
control.  As a matter of fact, the whole issue of school 
choice, there have been situations where minorities, once 
they have been informed properly what school choice means, 
an overwhelming majority of minorities are in favor of 
school choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Oh, they are more in favor than the 
average population.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  We have a case in Los Angeles.  There 
is a private school that was started by a family in south 
central Los Angeles that there is a waiting list literally 
hundreds of children long to get into this school, because 
they can see the delineation between the education that 
these children are receiving there, and this is a school 
absolutely run on a shoestring, yet the parents are involved 
in the school; the people who are running it are so 
dedicated to making an impact and a positive difference in 
these students' lives, they are tripping over children who 
want to get into this school.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, I think it is clear that this 
is a conversation we are going to need to continue, and I 
would like to thank all my guests for being with us.  When 
we come back, we will have more from <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

[Videotape of Representative Steve Largent follows.]

<p>

MR. LARGENT:  If you want to be for children, then 
you need to be for parents, because nobody is for children 
more than their parents are, and that is why we have 
introduced the Parental Rights and Responsibility Act.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us at <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. If you would like to 
receive more information about the Family Research Council, 
tonight's guests, or the crucial issues affecting you and 
your family, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

Next week, we will alert parents to a new affront
against America's children as we discuss a recent court case 
which opened the world of pornography to our children over 
the Internet.  Are we losing the battle to protect our 
children from pornography in cyberspace?  We will find out 
when we bring you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. Thanks for watching.

entail for them. 
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b2.html">February 14</a>
<dd>This show celebrated Valentine's Day with a new slant on what many consider to 
be true romance: abstinence. Saving sex for marriage seems to be an increasing 
trend, and this show introduced some people who explained this 
not-so-old-fashioned phenomenon. 
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b3.html">February 21</a>
<dd>This show discussed one of the hottest family
issues nationwide and in Washington, D.C., parental rights.  What
are parents privy to and excluded from when it comes to their
children's lives and sometimes life-changing decisions?
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b4.html">February 28</a>
<dd>This week's episode discussed how the media influences 
society today. From television to movies to music to the Internet, 
we are surrounded by the media and its control over what we see, hear, 
and sometimes the opinions and decisions we make. Does the media take 
such a responsibility seriously?

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96c1.html">March 6</a>
<dd>This show brought you a unique discussion about the 
diverse strategies to combat our Nation's war against drugs, and the 
experts who joined in the discussion range from a former lieutenant colonel 
in the U.S. Army, a psychiatrist who specializes in the clinical and 
policy areas of drug addiction, and a former state drug czar.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96c2.html">March 13</a>
<dd>This show took a look at a sensitive, life-enhancing 
and life-changing issue for parents and children: adoption. 
If adoption is viewed as the best alternative to unwed 
pregnancy by the majority of Americans, why is it so hard for 
couples to adopt children in our own country?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96c4.html">March 27</a>
<dd>This week's show brought you clips from the 
Washington Briefing which was hosted by FRC on March 18

<center><h2>April 1996 <i>Straight Talk</i> Transcripts</h2></center>

<dl>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d1.html">April 3</a>
<dd>This show brought you more highlights from the briefing 
with more speakers and insightful discussions on our current government, 
the government to come, and how America's schools are affected.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d2.html">April 10</a>
<dd>This week's show discussed a matter which could destroy marriage
and family as we know it by redefining marriage to include gay
unions.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d3.html">April 17</a>
<dd>This show presented some insider information from those 
who attended the recent 1996 National Education Summit. Will 
the solutions that came out of it help your children?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d4.html">April 24</a>
<dd>This show discussed an issue not often seen in secular news 
coverage: religious liberty and Christian persecution around the 
world. It showed how thousands of people are sacrificing their 
lives for a faith which they refuse to deny because their government 
demands it. Could America be headed in that direction?

<dl>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g1.html">July 3</a>
<dd>In this episode, we alerted parents to a new affront
against America's children as a recent court case was discussed 
which opened the world of pornography to our children over 
the Internet.  Are we losing the battle to protect our 
children from pornography in cyberspace?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g2.html">July 10</a>
<dd>This episode shared some key information regarding 
the Defense of Marriage Act and some sound reasoning from a 
variety of experts on why marriage should not be destroyed 
and reshaped to include homosexual couples.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g3.html">July 17</a>
<dd>This show presented more experts who brought
their well-researched insights into the defense of marriage, 
and there was personal testimony from a former 
homosexual man who now helps homosexuals who wish to leave 
that lifestyle.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g4.html">July 24</a>
<dd>This episode presented a completely different 
marriage tragedy, its possible collapse, as seen by author 
Maggie Gallagher, who wrote the recent best seller, 
<i>Abolition of Marriage</i>. Has our country discarded this 
founding union?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g5.html">July 31</a>
<dd>This show discussed RU-486, the abortion pill, and how 
this abortion method could lead to severe physical, emotional, 
psychological and legal troubles if it receives FDA approval.

<center><h2>October 1996 <i>Straight Talk</i> Transcripts</h2></center>

<dl>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96j1.html">October 2</a>
<dd>This episode discussed some of the historic and controversial 
issues from the 104th Congress that caught the attention of those 
both on Capitol Hill and in homes across America.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96j3.html">October 16</a>
<dd>This show focused on a topic which
once was taboo but now is a regular part of many television
sitcoms. It's a hot point of controversy, and the topic is 
homosexuality. Former homosexuals told about their life experiences.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96j4.html">October 23</a>
<dd>This show brought you a perspective 
on election issues from the unique viewpoint of women.
Since the suffrage movement, women have fought to make their 
mark in political discussions that shape our nation.  Is the 
women's movement what it was in the sixties as women battle 
for equal rights?  Do single mothers have a voice in our 
nation?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96j5.html">October 30</a>
<dd>Pornography permeates our society in a variety of 
forms, most of which we try to keep from children. 
In this episode, FRC stood with the American Family
Association and recognized Pornography Awareness Week.

<title>Straight Talk November 1, 1995 Transcript</title>
<body>
<center><h2>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</h2>
<p>
<h4>Broadcast aired Wednesday, November 1, 1995, 8:00-9:00 P.M.</h4></center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You've never seen this show before, <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>.  You may be wondering what we're
about or why we have a television show.
<P>
 Well, the Family Research Council has been researching and influencing
government and cultural policies affecting the American family
since 1981.  Already this year, Family Research Council has appeared
on more than 50 television programs, from CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> to PBS
<i>MacNeil-Lehrer</i> to ABC's <i>Nightline</i>.  In fact, we are profiled in
the <i>New York Times</i> news feature, today.
<P>
 We've responded to what many have to say about families.  I am
your host, Kristi Hamrick, and now <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i> gives you the opportunity to hear what we have
to say, unedited.
<P>
 You watch the news and read the newspaper, but do you ever wonder
if you're getting the real story?  Gary Bauer is one source that
you can trust.  He knows what is happening behind Washington's
closed doors, from years of experience, from the Reagan White
House to grassroots America.  For a news perspective you can't
get in the newspapers, our first segment features Gary Bauer,
president of the Family Research Council, Behind the Headlines.
<P>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<P>
Gary, it has been a very historic week on Capitol Hill, and particularly
with the budget.  We've seen some real fights, almost to the finish.
 What's your perspective on the historic things we have been seeing
lately?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  I think what's so unique about this past week is
that we've had a group of people run for office last year promising
the American people they would cut the budget, they would get
a balanced budget on the books that really would be predictable
and something where there would be a deadline for that balanced
budget.  And they have come to Washington and, lo and behold,
they have actually done what they said they were going to do in
the campaign.
<P>
 There has been a lot of public cynicism, and legitimately so,
in the last few years, about politicians saying one thing and
doing another.  But this latest group of Congressmen and Senators
have fulfilled their promises, and I think the American people,
over the next year, when they begin to look at the details instead
of listening to some of the scare tactics, are going to be astonished
and quite pleased that we now have some fiscally responsible people
in Washington and are cutting back the size of government.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In this budget debate, we have seen some new heroes
as a result of the last election.  What's your perspective on
who deserves the credit for the historic things taking place on
Capitol Hill?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  There's a lot of good guys in the House and Senate,
but I think the thing that really stands out is this freshman
class, particularly in the House of Representatives.  They have
come here, and they haven't been taken in by the power structure
of Washington at all.  They really have moved to cut some programs
that even impact their own home districts.  They have been willing
to take on their own leadership on occasion, which is really extraordinary
for freshmen.
<P>
 And so I think there has been a real generational change.  If
we have a couple more cycles like this where the types of people
you get in the House and Senate from both parties are more willing
to deal with some of these tough issues, I think the country will
be a lot better off for it.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I think what strikes me about that -- and I am
interested in your perspective -- is here we see the most successful
class of recent history, maybe of all time, in terms of a real
change from the floor up, saying it's economic and social issues.
 At the same time, we see the GOP, it would appear, ready to throw
away the marriage of those issues and go with someone like perhaps
a Powell.  Colin Powell is in the news a lot lately.  What's your
perspective on what it means for the GOP or just what it means
for the current political climate?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  Well, you know, Christy, I think the important thing
here is not the Powell candidacy or Bob Dole's candidacy or Phil
Gramm's candidacy; all of that will sort itself out, I think,
in the months ahead.  But the key thing really is what kind of
party is it; what are the principles the party stands for.
<P>
 I got into politics way back in 1964 in the Barry Goldwater campaign,
which was a disaster at the polls but began the movement in the
Republican Party to becoming a predictably conservative traditional
party.  And as the party stood for those principles over the years
after that, it began to win elections.  When it violated some
of those principles, the conservative coalition got divided, and
then we would lose elections.
<P>
 I guess the most obvious example is when some of his advisors
convinced George Bush to raise taxes.  I understand the pressure
he was under, but that was a mistake, and it ended up creating
Ross Perot and costing Bush the election.
<P>
 My hope would be that whoever the nominee of the party is a year
from now, that the party remembers that it has gotten this success
because it stood for things:  low taxes, smaller government, traditional
family values, the sanctity of life, a strong foreign policy.
 Those are the things that have gotten the party where it is today.
 Those are the things, I think, that can carry it into victory
later and make it the majority party in the next century, and
those are the things that I certainly want to fight for in the
months ahead.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  One last question, Gary.  There is a lot going
on on the Hill, and I know you need to get back to the phone calls,
Congressmen and Senators lining up.  But one thing that we hear
a lot about these days is that social conservatives are willing
to give on certain points.  And yet one of the things I know that
-- some of the data that Family Research Council has been looking
at, original polling, would indicate that some of those values
aren't for sale.  What's your perspective on whether or not conservative,
pro-family Americans are willing to have victory at any cost or
whether there are some things that are going to be sticking points
as people start looking at their platforms, issues, and just the
kind of society we want?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  I think this is really important for the party establishment
to understand.  If the party walked out again on tax issues, for
example, or if for some bizarre reason it became a big-tax party,
millions of voters would walk out of the party at that point.
 These voters believe that Americans are overtaxed.  I believe
Americans are overtaxed.  So the party really needs to stay with
that issue.
<P>
 Likewise, if the party walked out on the concept of the sanctity
of human life, or if they walked out on issues involving parents
and the rights they ought to have in raising their children, if
they did that, there is a significant segment of the Republican
Party that would walk out on them.
<P>
 So I think it is a pretty basic issue.  Parties stay together
and become majorities because they deal with the issues that draw
those voters to them, and when they abandon those issues, the
voters abandon the party, and I think that is what would happen
in 1996.  I hope the party or no one in the party is so foolish
as to think that they can throw anybody in the coalition a bone
and somehow still get their votes on election day.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for being
with us, Gary.  We'll look forward to some of your insights next
week. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll ask some hard
questions about what is happening to our children's education.
 Stay tuned.
<P>
 [Commercial break.]
<P>
 ANNOUNCER:  Parents want their children to learn how to read,
to write, to do math, and to tell right from wrong.  We want schools
that teach sound curriculum and positive values, schools where
teachers are good role models.  At one time, it didn't seem like
this was too much to ask, but today our school system is not accomplishing
this essential task.
<P>
 Secretary of Education Richard Riley says that he has the answer.
 He says that he has a system that works, and it is called Goals
2000.  Those opposed to Riley believe that Goals 2000 creates
federal control over our children's education and over our rights
as parents and communities to have a say in that education.
<P>
 As a result, some states refused to cash in on the program. 
Virginia and New Hampshire never took a penny of the Goals 2000
funds, and Alabama recently sent back the $1.4 million in federal
funding they had received under Goals 2000.  If other states follow
suit, Goals 2000 may eventually go out of business.
<P>
 But for now, a growing number of parents are becoming increasing
disillusioned and distrustful of the public school system.  More
children are being enrolled in private schools, and some 400,000
families are currently homeschooling.
<P>
 The homeschool movement has become a promoter of strong family
relations and a model grassroots organization, providing a framework
for educational reform.  Yet Riley contends that Goals 2000 would
benefit all families, and he claims that there are no strings
attached.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  What are parents to believe?  Bill Mattox, Vice
President for Policy, and Jennifer A. Marshall, Education Policy
Analyst, both with the Family Research Council, are here to help
us understand why, for some, Goals 2000 is a four-letter word.
<P>
 Jennifer, you've worked quite a bit on education issues for us,
and what we have seen is that it is one of those things where
the advertising doesn't really represent the product.  What is
in Goals 2000 that gives us concern?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  It is easiest to look at Goals 2000 as an application
process, where the state is required to do certain things to get
money from the Federal Government, and the Federal Government
requires that a state would turn in its standards and its assessments
in order to get money for this.  And that is an inappropriate
role for them.  They are not to be dealing with curriculum.  Historically,
they haven't been allowed to; now they have transgressed into
that area.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  So it is kind of like all the schools have to submit
their lesson plans -- 
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Exactly.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  -- and the Federal Government is going to say,
&quot;I like it; I don't like it.&quot;
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Yes.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  But some would say national standards are a good
thing.  I mean, we are looking at inner-city schools with falling
test scores, and we are saying, How do we make it better?  Why
not national standards?  I mean, what's wrong with that?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  It's an easy answer; you're right.  But we've
seen with these national history standards exactly what can go
wrong.  They're easily captured by a political faction, and for
anybody who didn't think that the politically correct, anti-American
history standards that we saw last year were a problem, well,
what if Senator Jesse Helms or Representative Newt Gingrich had
written those?  I think we would have a different picture.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  What's kind of interesting about Goals 2000 is
it makes it out as though government is the solution to our educational
problems.  And, Bill, I know you have taken a look at children
who really do succeed.  A lot of people may have seen some of
Bill's columns country-wide, as a matter of fact, from the Detroit
News even on this topic.
<P>
 What have you seen, Bill, in terms of children who succeed? 
Why do they succeed in school?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, it's interesting.  For a long time, there
has been a great deal of inquiry into questions about why do kids
in certain schools do better than those in others, and dating
back to the mid-1960s, one of the things that has shown up consistently
in the research is that it is not so much what goes on at the
school that may be ultimately most significant; it is, instead,
what is taking place in the home and how rich a learning environment
kids have in the home.
<P>
 When kids have the benefit of growing up in a household where
their parents are actively involved in reading to them, in sharing
in mealtimes where there is a rich dinnertime discussion, in tucking
them into bed and that kind of thing, there are significant differences
that show up in terms of how well kids do in school.  How much
access kids have to home learning tools, to encyclopedias, books,
newspapers, computers, things of that nature, have a dramatic
effect on a child's learning.
<P>
 One of things that I guess concerns me a great deal about Goals
2000 is that it further marginalizes parents.  It kind of pushes
them to the periphery of the education of children and does not
recognize them as a central player.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Secretary Riley -- I have seen the news conference
where he was talking about this new partnership with parents and
how important that they are.  Does anything the government is
doing right now, or maybe the Clinton Administration, really facilitate
a greater partnership with parents?  I mean, in Goals 2000, is
one of the goals Mom and Dad showing up and helping?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  There is quite a bit of rhetoric, actually, about
parental involvement.  But we find a problem when it is the government
defining exactly what parental involvement will be.  We have seen
parents be relegated to a back seat -- just pay and be quiet about
the way schools are run -- and that is not an appropriate role
for involving parents at all.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes.  I mean, this is such an important point, because
a lot of times, you are right, there is a lot of lipservice about
parental involvement.  The Secretary just put out a report last
year saying, Boy, parents are key to education.  And yet when
you stop and really examine what they are saying, the way that
they define parental involvement is, well, if you think of a potluck
dinner, I think they seem to think that what schools and experts
like themselves provide is kind of the meat and potatoes of education,
and what parents provide is kind of the dessert.  It's a nice
frill, but it's not absolutely essential to the well-being of
children and to their educational development.  And yet the research
consistently contradicts that point of view.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  One would think, if you look at some of the Clinton
Administration rhetoric on Goals 2000, that every state is clamoring
for this money, because it all comes down to money.
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Yes.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Jennifer, what does your analysis show in terms
of how states -- are they embracing this?  Are they exciting about
it?  What's happening at the grass roots?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  You'd be surprised at how much murmuring there
is against Goals 2000, both at the federal and the state level.
 Two states flat out said, &quot;No, we will not take this money.&quot;
 They absolutely rejected the money, and that was New Hampshire
and Virginia.  And then we saw an almost unprecedented move of
Alabama to send back federal money and say, &quot;No, thank you;
we won't stoop this low to take this money.&quot;
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  That's kind of astounding.
<P>
 I know, Bill, you've been looking at different educational reforms
in the state.  What states have seen better numbers, or have we
seen better partnerships with parents anywhere?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, the key, I think, is to not think so much
in terms of systems or even in terms of states, but to really
look at how can we succeed in furthering education at the local
level, because one of the things that comes out of the research
again consistently is not just that parents are central players
in this process, but when they are surrounded by a community of
adults that are prepared to help them in that process and to support
them, then you then see the kinds of results that I think we are
all looking for.
<P>
 And so I think a lot of the key to this debate is getting the
discussion back to the local level, getting the Federal Government
-- and even in many ways the state government -- out of the action
and really putting emphasis on the local community and especially
on parents.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I have been really interested as I have been looking
at the data that small things -- whether you read to your child,
which we'll talk more about later; whether a parent even attends
a PTA meeting, or whether there is even a father in the home --
that even family structure needs to be read, rather than what
dollars per child in education.
<P>
 Bill, you headed a fathership program at Family Research Council
for a long time now, Being a Dad Is Important Business.  Just
quickly, as we are getting near the end, what do we know about
the importance of even a father in the home, or for those people
with broken family structures, the importance of having a dad
involved, or a dad figure?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, this is a very important point, because a
lot of the research tends to focus on what are sometimes defined
as process variables; that is, are families eating together, are
they reading to children, are there various processes taking place
within the family that might enhance a child's learning?
<P>
 And yet we know that families in which fathers are present are
much more likely to have these kinds of things take place.  There
are dramatic differences in the rates, say, for example, of how
many family meals a family might enjoy together between two-parent
and single-parent households, and it's not because single mothers
have any less desire to be home and to be able to sit down and
dine with their kids; it is that they are quite often facing extraordinary
odds in trying to do the work of two parents by themselves.  And
it becomes very difficult for all the different trains to run
on time and for them to have the kind of routine that is actually
quite important to a child's well-being and educational development.
<P>
 So it is important that we recognize that the contribution that
families make is one that comes from these different processes
taking place, but there are family structures -- namely, those
in which both parents are present -- that lend themselves more
to these kinds of activities than single-parent families.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Goals 2000, Jennifer, it tries to say that
if we tweak things -- numbers of books, numbers of classrooms,
teacher ratios -- that it is all the hard variables, hard-wired
things, that make a big difference.  Is that accurate?  Would
you say that Goals 2000 says, &quot;Give me enough books; I can
give you an A student&quot;?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  They focus on something called opportunity-to-learn
standards, which is just what you've described:  what goes in,
the inputs, measuring how much we've got there.  And it's all
about systems management.  It doesn't deal with the classroom
learning, the human variables, as Bill as spoken of, at all.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  And the human variables make a big difference.
<P>
 When we come back, we're going to add some more human variables.
 We're going to be talking with Mike Farris, president of the
Homeschool Legal Defense Association, and we'll find out why he's
concerned about Goals 2000 and what defense strategies he's using
to combat government control of education here in Virginia and
nationwide.
<P>
 [Commercial break.]
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  We're joined by Mike Farris, president of the Homeschool
Legal Defense Association.  Many political watchers may remember
him as the man that the entire Democratic Party ran against in
recent Virginia elections.
<P>
 Welcome, Mike.  Glad to have you here.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Thank you.  Good to be with you.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for coming.
<P>
 We were talking about some of the problems with education earlier,
and I know they drove you in a very powerful direction:  out of
the schools.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Right.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Tell me, why did your organization decide that
we need to go a completely different direction?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, let's start with my family.  I was raised
in a public school family.  Not only did I go to public schools
myself; my dad was a public school principal.  In fact, I was
being prepared to be a lawyer for school districts.  My undergraduate
honors thesis was written under the tutelage of the state school
board's attorney.
<P>
 Someplace along the line, I figured out that the philosophy that
had taken over the education system was antithetical to the Christian
values that I believe in.  So we decided, first of all, for Christian
schools for our oldest daughter in kindergarten and first grade,
and then we heard about homeschooling and we decided to try that
14 years ago, and that is kind of a similar story -- change the
facts a little bit, but the themes are the same -- and there are
about 400,000 families homeschooling their kids today.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  And Goals 2000, did that exacerbate the numbers
of people going one direction or the other?  I mean, what are
you seeing in terms of educational trends today?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, homeschooling is growing at a very rapid rate.
 Private schools are growing at a rapid rate.  Goals 2000 helps
the growth of the private school and homeschool movement.  Frankly,
the thing that helped it the most was the election of Bill Clinton.
 Within about three months after Bill Clinton's election, we saw
the most phenomenal growth rate ever in membership of the Homeschool
Legal Defense Association.
<P>
 So I think that that is -- people's uncertainty about their government
is translated to uncertainty about schools.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of the government, the Family Research
Council, under Jennifer's excellent assistance, and Bill, and
Bob Morrison, put together this brochure, Let Freedom Ring, which
took a look at the national history standards.  And it was amazing
to see what they left out, everything from Thomas Edison to the
man on the moon, as you saw earlier.
<P>
 Jennifer, you have been taking a look at what has been happening
in schools.  What kinds of voids are you seeing?  Do you agree
with the voids that Mike is describing?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Yes, and the national history standards show a
direction, a very negative direction, in which public education
is going.  We produced this document with five staff over a course
of five weeks with a couple thousand dollars.  It took the Federal
Government $2 million, over two years, and a panel of probably
hundreds of experts to come up with the anti-American product
that they put out last year.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes, I think it needs to be pointed out here that
not only did they overlook some of the folks that you mentioned,
but they did in fact find a way to include Madonna and the Simpsons.
<P>
 [Laughter.]
<P>
 So, somehow, somewhere, the priorities were out of whack.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of Mike's organization, recently I was
at a hearing where this whole piece of data came up that the larger
the family, the less intelligent the children at the end; that
somehow large families and homes break down when it gets to numbers.
<P>
 But we were talking about education earlier, Bill, and you saw
a whole different trend and in fact wrote about that recently
in an Op-Ed.  What did you see?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes, this has been a common theme in education research,
and it is confirmed by a new study that's out in just this month's
American Sociological Association Journal, which shows, just as
you said, the larger the family size, the poorer the educational
performance, supposedly.
<P>
 The key thing to remember, though, is this:  that some research
that has recently been done at the University of Michigan refutes
these findings in some very interesting ways.  What the University
of Michigan researchers did was they looked at some Vietnamese
boat children, some kids who had come over as refugees after the
events in the 1970s in Vietnam, and they saw that these kids were
doing amazingly well in the public school system.
<P>
 They began to ask, why is it that these kids are doing so much
better than many of their peers?  And they went and looked at
the dynamics taking place in the home and found that even though
these kids were coming from larger families, even though their
parents really could not speak much English, these kids were doing
exceptionally well; and part of the reason was because there was
something akin to the old one-room schoolhouse effect taking place.
 That is, after the kids would eat dinner, they would clear off
the dining room table.  The older children would tutor the younger
children, which would have the effect of reinforcing some of the
things that they were learning as well as transmitting new information
to the younger children.
<P>
 What that study showed is that if you think of children as kind
of educational consumers alone who are drawing upon their parents'
resources, one can easily imagine where this theory that the larger
the family size, the poorer the kids do in school comes from,
because they are all then in a sense competing with one another
for their parents' attention and resources.
<P>
 But if, instead, these older children end up serving in a sense
as educational producers who are contributing to the educational
environment in the home and making it a richer environment, then,
all of a sudden, everyone does better, and in a sense a rising
tide lifts all boats.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Mike, you've got to be seeing this kind of thing
if you look at homeschooling.  Just today I was reading in the
paper that we are seeing the data across the board that homeschooled
children test better.  What do you see as you are looking at homeschools,
children working together, families working together?  What does
the data show in your people?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Homeschoolers score 20 to 30 percentile points higher
than the public schools.  And so I would be happy to match any
ninth-born homeschooler with any firstborn public schooler any
day.
<P>
 [Laughter.]
<P>
 You can jimmy numbers any way you want, but the reality is my
ninth-born child is a smart little kid, and I have no doubts that
he is going to do just fine, and that he is enriched by the large
family.  And, frankly, if you control for some socioeconomic factors,
then I think that it is a complete explanation of these what I
would consider to be phony studies.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of homeschooling, you have had a tough
time, though, despite the growing prominence, sometimes getting
that even legal, and there have been a lot of attacks.  I am sure
we all remember H.R. 6.  What kinds of attacks are coming against
efforts to look at other educational options for families?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, the establishment doesn't like anybody that,
A, pulls out of the system, and, B, does a better job.  The consequential
embarrassment that comes to them causes some retribution at times.
<P>
 But the battles have changed.  We have been defending homeschoolers
for 13 years now.  Initially, it was a total ban on homeschooling.
 It's a little more sophisticated than that now, and they usually
don't try to do a total ban, but the battles are still there.
<P>
 We had a situation in Kansas within this last three or four months
where a judge held that homeschooling was illegal.  We appealed
that and got that reversed.  The more common problem is really
social services agencies that -- like a case we have in Sacramento
right now.  There were three allegations against a family.  One
was that they were very religious; secondly, that they were homeschooling;
and, third is they heard a child say, &quot;No, Daddy, no.&quot;
 And based on those three facts and those three facts alone, they
busted down the door and did a strip-search of the children.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  That is amazing.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  And so, of course, we are suing those people in
Federal District Court.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Even that your organization, Legal Defense Association,
that we have to do that.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  You know, one of the things Mike's comments reminded
me of is that even though we do see the system out there quite
often harassing homeschoolers, one of the things that was rather
interesting to me as I began pulling together some of this recent
research is that there are several very prominent school teachers
who have been in the public school system, or are currently in
the system, who are saying, &quot;You know, there's something
going on over there that we really ought to take notice of.&quot;
<P>
 I know a recent teacher who was just named Teacher of the Year
in New York City made comments of this kind, and a Seattle public
school teacher has written a book about homeschooling and talks
about how, in many ways, the homeschool environment offers what
public school teachers have for many years been advocating in
terms of teacher-student ratio and things of that nature.
<P>
 And so it may be that, at least among some school teachers, we
are seeing a change in attitude that is quite promising for years
to come.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I thought it was interesting, in Massachusetts,
before public schools, 98 percent of the children were literate;
after public schools, it has always been a 6 percent drop and
never been that high.
<P>
 What do you think?  I think the fear that people have to have,
Mike, is that I don't want my children in public schools, but
can I really be a teacher?  How do you address that kind of concern,
if I say, &quot;Look, I'm concerned about national history standards;
I don't know if I can actually do a better job&quot;?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Anyone who wants to homeschool can.  If you can
read and are basically literate yourself, you can homeschool your
kids.  Now, if you can't, you need to learn to read.  Somebody
who can't do basic math and cannot function at high-school-level
reading should not be trying to attempt this.  But for anybody
who meets those basic criteria, if you're willing to work hard,
you can do a very successful job.
<P>
 People imagine themselves trying to conduct a schoolroom.  Well,
you don't have to conduct a schoolroom.  Homeschooling is a much
different form of academic instruction, and it is easier in a
sense because you're not having group dynamics going on where
you're having to teach to the middle and trying to worry about
these; you're just teaching to one child.  It is much more efficient,
academically better, just all around is a very successful way
to produce a good education for your kids.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I think some people see the homeschoolers as people
trying to go outside of the system, maybe an Amish thing, in a
way.  Do you see that?  Because, frankly, in the terms of your
name coming up in the news, it would seem like in some ways you
get more involved in the politics of education rather than less.
<P>
 How do you talk to people who say, &quot;If I go the homeschool
route, then I'm kind of missing out on part of my culture?&quot;
 Because you're certainly here in Washington today for many reasons.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, my own belief -- and it may be a little bit
biased -- is that the most effective, most well-organized political
network in the country is the homeschoolers.  There's nothing
as good.  And people are very, very activist, and the reason is,
they've seen their freedoms directly threatened in their own life,
something that's core to their day-to-day existence; and trying
to motivate other people to get involved is much more difficult,
because it's an abstraction to them.  But homeschoolers have lived
the battles of freedom.
<P>
 What I am really excited about for the long range is the couple
of million kids that are being homeschooled that have had to personally
observe and be involved in the battles for freedom.  The leadership
potential among those kids is enormous, and I think that we're
going to see some great things.  If our generation can just hold
on by our fingernails for about another dozen years or so, my
view is that probably a quarter or a third of Congress will be
homeschool graduates within 20 years.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  That will be fascinating.
<P>
 Bill, politically speaking, in the poll -- Family Research Council
does a lot of original polling -- in the poll last year, you took
a look at who is the constituency for a pro-educational-choice
way of viewing government.  Tell me, we found some interesting,
different demographics on that.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes, we really did, because, like many others, we
were measuring the level of support for things like providing
parents opportunities outside of the public school system and
things of that nature, but -- 
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to hear more about that in
a second.  We're going to go to break.  We're going to be right
back with more on educational choice, or maybe you don't have
educational choice.  Please come back.  Thanks.
<P>
 [Commercial break.]
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  It was an exciting day on Capitol Hill today, in
fact a very historic vote.  The partial-birth abortion ban passed
in the House.  This was a long-fought and a very hard-fought bill
that we have been working on for a long time to preserve the lives
of children killed at the very end of the pregnancy, late-term
abortions beginning at five months through the moment of birth.
<P>
 Unfortunately, however, Congressman Joe Scarborough, who was
going to join us, could not be here, but we are happy to have
had his vote on the Hill.
<P>
 Mike, I know that one thing that you and the Congressman are
looking at is the elimination of the Department of Education.
 It is very exciting.  It is the kind of thing that we've been
talking about since 1980.  But why are we still talking about
it today?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, we're talking about it because the moderates
in the Republican Party convinced President
<P>
Reagan to table the idea of eliminating the Department of Education,
and frankly, they were wrong.  What has happened to education
since the Federal Government has gotten involved has been abysmal.
 Take any measure of education you want.  Academic achievement
is down.  In fact, it is so bad now that the most recent National
Assessment of Educational Progress scores are only a quarter of
the eighth graders can do math, and only a quarter of the fourth
graders can read at the level of proficiency on both of those
statistics.  And out of every new dollar that has been spent on
education since 1972, 76 cents has gone to administrative costs
and overhead, and only 24 cents has gone to teachers.
<P>
 It's nuts.  It is a crazy, centralized, drunk system.   They're
drunk with bureaucracy.  And every new reform proposal, the only
thing you can say about it is it requires a centralized bureaucracy
to run it.  Other than that, it is just a new five-year plan like
the Soviets brought out.  Every three-and-a-half years, just like
the Soviets, they know that they fail after a while,  And so it
is time to just abolish the system and go back to local control
of schools.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  The issue in some ways is how to do that.  You
know, I think some people have a fear that educational systems
are going to be abolished, or somehow property taxes will go away
and we'll have more money and no schools.
<P>
 But certainly Michigan, which decided to be revolutionary, has
done some exciting things.  What do you think about what's happening
in Michigan?  And maybe you could tell people about it.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, I don't know that much about the details of
the Michigan program.  I just am proud of Governor Engler's general
efforts.  I have a general knowledge of it, and I think that he
has done a good job in showing that you can do things in a completely
different way and make a difference.
<P>
 Now, the impact on a local school district is that about 6 percent
of an average school district's budget comes from federal funds.
 The smarter thing is just not send that money to Washington in
the first place.  So the proposal that Jennifer and I and others
have been working on for several months now is to stop spending
the $70 billion we spend at the federal level and, instead, have
a $70 billion tax cut.  Just leave the money in the locale to
begin with and let the local people figure out how to spend it.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  See, what's so ironic about that is, there was
a survey done recently that the majority of public school teachers
had their children in private school.  We have our President with
his daughter in a private religious school, our Vice President
with his children in private religious school.  And what is funny
is private options are becoming sort of the thing that wealthier
Americans have, and some people are a little intimidated by homeschoolers,
and so people, for lack of financial resources -- which are going
to Washington in taxes -- end up in the hands of the bureaucracy.
<P>
 I mean, Bill, I know that that is a thing that you have been
concerned about.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, it really does gall me as one who used to
live here in the District of Columbia and had my daughter in the
public school system here, and I can well remember those kids
that she went to school with that were part of her classroom.
<P>
 You know, when Bill Clinton came to town and walked down Georgia
Avenue and tried to identify with the people that lived there,
and yet then the next week was enrolling his child in a private
school that not one of them could possibly afford, it really did
strike me as very hypocritical.
<P>
 My hope is that we can see reform not just here in the District
of Columbia but throughout the country, so that families that
are far less fortunate than the Clintons or the Gores will enjoy
the kinds of options that they now have.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  And what was ironic about that in terms of the
dollar thing is that, as I understand it, the amount that we spend
per child in the District of Columbia is the highest of any in
the Nation.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Oh, it's extraordinary.  Its extraordinary.  I mean,
if you gave parents that kind of money to do with what Mike's
parents do, it's amazing the kinds of things that they could have
afforded or the kinds of private school options that parents could
avail themselves of.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  But, Jennifer, so you're not a homeschooler.  So
why should we care?  You know, what is it that you're finding
as an education policy analyst that would indicate that everyone
needs to really be in favor of the things that Mike is doing?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Well, at Family Research Council, we refer to
homeschoolers as pioneers of freedom, because they're defending
freedoms for us all.  We are all going to be better in America
because they are standing up and defending our freedoms.
<P>
 I would like to point out, too, about Mr. Clinton's great idea,
grand plan for local control of education, which he has called
Goals 2000, in that first year of funding, only 50 percent, less
than 50 percent, of the money makes it back down to the local
level.  That is not local control, by any stretch of the definition.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of local control, I think it is always
interesting that, annually, People for the American Way comes
out with a report, &quot;Attacks on the Freedom to Learn,&quot;
which could be as simple as a parent called a school saying, &quot;I'm
concerned about a book.&quot;  And this isn't democracy; this
is an attack on the freedom to learn.
<P>
 What kinds of ridiculous attacks are you seeing out there, Mike?
 And I know the &quot;censorship&quot; word gets thrown around
everywhere, and you're on the front lines of that.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  I just don't take the People for the American Way
very seriously.  Any group that comes into being for the sole
purpose of saying born-again Christians don't have the right to
participate in politics just doesn't deserve to be called a civil
organization, much less a civil rights organization.
<P>
 Think of it.  What would people say if they would have come into
existence to say, &quot;We don't think Jews should be involved
in politics,&quot; or, &quot;We don't think that Lutherans or
Muslims or some other group&quot; -- apparently, it is okay to
say that evangelical Christians shouldn't be involved in politics,
but nobody else.  It is a patently ridiculous organization, and
I don't think that they have much of importance to say, period.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  As we get ready to close this segment of our show,
what one last thing would you like parents to know about homeschooling
or about their concern for education today?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, I think homeschooling works very well, and
our desire simply is to be left alone, and I hope that that is
the desire of every parent, that they want to be left alone by
the Federal Government and allowed to run their schools.  Whatever
school they choose for themselves, whether it is public school
or private school or home school, they need to be left alone and
allowed to pursue excellence.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I would like to thank Mike and our guests for their
insight and for giving us the hope that parents maybe some day
will have the opportunity to influence their children's education.
<P>
 Stay tuned; there is more to come.  Thanks for watching.

 MS. HAMRICK:  The Family Research Council staff works diligently

<P>
 [From Christian Coalition &quot;Road to Victory&quot; Appearance,
September 8, 1995]:
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  I remember, a month or so ago, being in a hotel a
few blocks from here, sitting in a hotel room with Dan Rather
as we did two hours of interviews.  And during those interviews,
Dan Rather at one point leaned over to me and, I thought, in a
very real way, not just rhetorically, looked at me and said, &quot;Gary,
just what is it that you people want, anyway?&quot;
<P>
 I said, &quot;Well, you know, Dan, I would like to live in a
country where my daughters can go out on a date at night and I
don't have to worry about date rape.  Or my wife can take a walk
through the park a few blocks from our house and not feel that
she has to carry a can of mace with her.  I would like a country
where we wouldn't have to have bars on our windows, whether we
live in the inner city or live in the suburbs.
<P>
 &quot;I would like a country where women have economic opportunity.
 I've got two daughters.  Why wouldn't I want that?  But I also
want an America where, if my daughters decide to be a mother or
a homemaker, that that decision will be held up and honored as
something noble and good and decent.&quot;
<P>
 [Applause.]
<P>
 I told him I wanted a country that rejected racism, the racism
of Fuhrmann in Los Angeles and the racism of quotas and set-asides
and all those programs, a country where we actually taught all
of our children -- black, white, and Hispanic -- to judge others
by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.
<P>
 I told him I wanted a country that believed in the sanctity of
life again, that looked at drive-by shootings or 1.5 million abortions
a year and knew that those things were a tragedy.
<P>
 I want to be in a country where, when people play by the rules
and work hard and save and do the right things in their homes,
they actually win at the end of the day, and they're not treated
like suckers.
<P>
 I want a country that takes virtue seriously again, a country
where children aren't crying themselves to sleep at night because
there are no fathers there to comfort them or because their bodies
have been racked by venereal disease or exploited by pornography.
<P>
 In short, I told Dan Rather than I wanted a shining city upon
a hill, the place that our founders promised us.
<P>
 And as I said those things, I watched Dan Rather nod his head
up and down.  He was agreeing with me; the body language was clear.
 When I was finished, he looked at me, and he said, &quot;Gary,
that was an eloquent answer.  I've never heard anybody quite put
it that clearly.&quot;
<P>
 [Laughter.]
<P>
 And, of course, last night, if you watched that special, not
one second of that answer made it into the final show.
<P>
 You know, my friends, I think Dan Rather understood, and I think
the folks at CBS also understand, that if they actually ever really
tell the American people what we want, that the American people
will join with us in one voice and we will win.
<P>
 [Applause.]
<P>
 [From Testimony by Cathy Cleaver, FRC Director of Legal Policy,
before the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 25, 1995]:
<P>
 MS. CLEAVER:  Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, on behalf
of Gary Bauer and the Family Research Council, I want to express
our sincere appreciation for the opportunity to address this distinguished
committee on the critical issue of religious liberty.
<P>
 The First Amendment is not internally inconsistent.  The Establishment
Clause was designed to prevent the state from coercing our religious
belief.  The Free Exercise Clause was designed to prevent the
state from interfering with the exercise of religious beliefs.
 Thus, the religion clauses were designed to work hand in hand
to promote government neutrality with regard to religion.
<P>
 In the last several decades, however, the Supreme Court has wrongly
interpreted the clauses to be antagonistic to each other.  The
Court has created a false conflict between the religion clauses,
which must be reconciled in each case.
<P>
 I will attempt to explain our preference for a constitutional
amendment rather than a federal statute and address certain specific
concerns that have been raised in the public debate.
<P>
 The Family Research Council supports an amendment to the Constitution
clarifying the First Amendment's prohibition of discrimination
against religious expression and against persons, groups, or organizations
in access to government benefits or protections on account of
the religious character of their speech or identity.
<P>
 We do not favor changing the First Amendment in any way.  Rather,
we support an amendment which would correct the Supreme Court's
misinterpretation of the First Amendment.
<P>
 Several concerns and questions have been raised about this approach.
 Is this radical approach really necessary?  First, it is wise
to keep from confusing procedure with substance.  Amending the
Constitution is a radical procedure, to be sure.  Article V of
the Constitution ensures that it is not to be achieved without
effort and consensus.  Yet the substance of a restorative religious
liberty amendment need not be radical in nature.
<P>
 Legal experts and numerous interested groups have examined potential
approaches for months, and the Family Research Council remains
willing to continue to discuss specific language for such an amendment.
 We are especially eager to hear your specific ideas, Mr. Chairman,
and those of Congressman Hyde.
<P>
 In closing, this principle of neutrality is not new.  It is the
aim and result of our First Amendment's religion clauses, properly
understood.  A religious liberty amendment could restore the saving
principle so that our First Amendment would not be used to promote
the empty state religion of secularism but to promote true freedom
and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment in truth, to which every
American is entitled.
<P>
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
<P>
 SENATOR HATCH:  Thank you, Ms. Cleaver.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I will be right back for some closing thoughts.
 Stay tuned.

</ul><p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight
Talk</i> from the Family Research Council.  We're thrilled to have
made it through our first show last week, and we are looking forward
to an exciting season ahead.  In our many weeks to come, <i>Straight
Talk</i> will be addressing issues that are critical to today's families,
which is really what the Family Research Council is all about.
 Working hand in hand with government policies are cultural issues
that affect those policies.
<p>
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we will be
sharing an investigation into what our society views as typical
sexual behavior, based on the studies and published works of Dr.
Alfred Kinsey, his studies known worldwide as the Kinsey report.
<p>
Within our show, we will be airing an exclusive video production
in full called <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  This video asks, and
attempts to answer, some of the questions first investigated by
Dr. Judith Reisman, who examined the Kinsey data on child sexuality.
 Dr. Reisman cites clear evidence that children were either sexually
abused by adults for scientific studies or somebody lied about
the data.
<p>
This shocking revelation strikes at the core of society's
current sex ideologies, which have solely shaped sex and health
education curriculum; and the funding came even perhaps from our
own government.
<p>
So the Family Research Council decided to get
the word out, let people know that their tax dollars are funding
programs that are based on unscientific research.  Viewer discretion
and parental guidance are therefore strongly advised in viewing
tonight's show.
<p>
But, first, let's hear from Gary Bauer, president
of the Family Research Council.  Gary is quoted weekly in the
nation's newspapers, and makers from all kinds of news programs
call him.  In fact, today you may hear him talking about Colin
Powell.  This is his opportunity to share with you what you might
not hear from journalists and broadcasters.  Join me and Gary
Bauer as we talk about the stories that lie behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
It is Tuesday morning,
and I am here with Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research
Council.  Most of political America, Gary, is watching the elections,
some pivotal ones in Kentucky and Virginia.  As we watch early
returns in what some are calling a referendum on the GOP and the
conservative pro-family movement, what do you see in this election
cycle?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  You know, Kristi, our viewers have us at a
disadvantage:  We are taping this while people vote, and our viewers
will know the outcome of the elections by the time they see us
talking about them.
<p>
But my sense is that whatever happened in
these elections around the country -- in Virginia, New Jersey,
I guess Kentucky, and Mississippi -- you can't cover up what the
overall trend in the country is.
<p>
I suspect conservatives are going
to do well and that our viewers already know that.  But even if
they don't, the fact of the matter is the trend line around the
country is unbelievably in a conservative direction.  And even
in these elections, the Democrats running around the country were
running as conservatives.  They were trying to act like they were
fiscal conservatives, economic conservatives.  They were not talking
about social issues because they know those issues are hurting
them.
<p>
So the untold story is that the Democratic Party and liberalism
around the country is demoralized.  You've got people switching
parties.  I think we'll have three more House members switch before
the end of the year.  State legislatures that have never been
Republican have gone into Republican control in the last few months
as special elections have been held.
<p>
So there is a strong conservative
tide running in the country.  I hope it continued today, but even
if there were some bumps in the road, I think that tide is going
to run for a while.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Some of the different interest
groups have said that an anti-American sentiment has been moving
away from being in favor of any referendum, tax increases of any
kinds.  Do you agree with that?  Because certainly there are all
kinds of tax-increasing referenda on the ballots.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Yes.  I think people will vote for referenda when the issue is
the right issue.  The critics are right about taxes, however.
 Just about anyplace in the country that there is a tax bond measure
or referendum on the ballot, people are saying no.
<p>
I mean, here in Northern Virginia, which is, of course, peculiar to this 
one area, but it really is very similar to a lot of places in the
rest of the country.  You've got state taxes, local taxes.  The
federal tax rate went up in the beginning of the Clinton Administration.
 There is a particular gross receipts tax in Northern Virginia
that has driven a lot of small businesses literally out of business.
<p>
Americans remain deeply overtaxed, and I hope that's an issue
that the Republican Party will continue to emphasize and run with
in 1996, because I think it brings millions of voters to the banner.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When it comes to fear tactics in Washington right
now, some of the worst language is reserved for Medicare and the
Medicare vote.  Gary, you have been watching this for a while.
 Why do you think the Medicare debate needs to go forward? 
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, we believe that that program, which is a valuable
program to many elderly, has to be reformed, and it has to be
reformed to save it.  If you take the current trends in place
and let those trends continue another 20, 25 years, what you have
is a Medicare program that literally would be consuming almost
all of the revenue of the Federal Government.
<p>
Well, obviously,
we can't have that.  That's not going to work.  So we've got to
come up with a way to get costs under control, to save the program
for people like my 75-year-old mother who relies on it and many
of the other elderly who have come to rely on it.
<p>
I think it has
been disgusting to see some of the politicians use scare rhetoric
and harsh rhetoric to try to bamboozle, quite frankly, senior
citizens into thinking that their benefits are going to be taken
away and that they're going to be left without medical care. 
That's a disgusting thing to do to elderly people who already
worry about the future, and I think the politicians who engaged
in that are going to suffer for it at the polls next year. 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of the most historic things in this last week has
been the partial-birth abortion ban vote in the House and, we
think, this week in the Senate.  What do you think, Gary, has
brought us to the point where we can see this kind of historic
pro-life vote?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  The problem on the abortion issue has
always been getting facts to the American people.  If you get
them facts, then the votes tend to come out pro-life.  We saw
that in the House of Representatives.  When the Congress had to
actually focus on the facts of what a partial-birth abortion is,
most of them were so horrified by the procedure that they voted
to ban it.
<p>
I think the final vote, at least the vote in favor
of the ban, was 288 votes.  That's a bigger consensus than a lot
of the economic agenda that the Republicans are pushing.  So I
think it was a very historic vote and probably the beginning of
a number of votes in the Congress that will, I think, educate
the American people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thank you so much for
being with us, and we'll look forward to talking to you next week.
 Good night.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Thank you.  Good to be with you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>
returns, we will speak to Bob Knight, who wrote, produced, directed,
and edited the 1994 documentary, <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  Bob
will explain the importance of uncovering Dr. Alfred Kinsey's
unorthodox and unscientific study of child sexuality.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>.  Tonight we are talking to Bob
Knight, Director of Cultural Studies at the Family Research Council.
 Bob daily examines cutting-edge social issues that affect and
are affected by cultural values.  He will be introducing one of
his most recent and possibly one of the most shocking issues he
has encountered.
<p>
Bob, welcome to <i>Straight Talk</i>.  Appreciate you
being here.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Thanks for having me, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You were a journalist at the Los Angeles Times, got involved
at the Heritage Foundation on cultural issues.  You have a long
history of looking at the things that really have changed America.
<p>
What drew your attention to this particular topic?  Family Research
Council hasn't done any other videos.  You're the first.  What
caught your eye?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Well, it really began about five
years ago when I was doing research on federal funding for all
sorts of cultural projects, and I kept running into Kinsey, the
name Kinsey, the references to Kinsey.
<p>
I talked to a number of
people, including Dr. Judith Reisman, who had been investigating
Kinsey since 1981, and she revealed in a 1990 book, Kinsey, Sex
and Fraud, that some of the very basis for what we now regard
as gospel in sex education and sexology came out of experiments
on children in the 1940s under the rubric of science; and she
made the charge that it's either fraud or criminal exploitation
of children, but either way, we shouldn't be basing our idea of
normal sexuality on it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I was interested in reading
some of the literature that you had written.  I mean, in terms
of attitudes about sex that have come from Kinsey, it has been
everything from 10 percent of the population is homosexual, which
was a project that you worked on; and showing that that was not
true -- it was really 1, at most 2 percent -- but even the data
that says men mature sexually at 18 and women, at 30, that data
all comes from Kinsey as well, correct?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  It does.
 Kinsey is the motherlode of information on the sex issues.  Kinsey
formulated what he called the Kinsey scale, which is a scale from
zero to 6.  Zero is heterosexuality; 6 is homosexuality.  Notice
he puts the norm at the bottom.  And he actually said that only
4 percent of the population constitute either end of the spectrum,
and everybody else is bisexual.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's amazing.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  So he used this and, by the way, developed this before
he did 95 percent of his research -- it just came out of his head
-- and he used this to push the idea of outlet sex, which makes
all sexual acts equal morally, whether it is between husband and
wife or any other combination, in or out of marriage.
<p>
This was a moral leveling force that Hugh Hefner picked up with his 
playboy philosophy, and it became the grounding for the 
if-it-feels-good-do-it generation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, this video which we're going to
see does go into greater detail, but the thing that is compelling
-- you know, today there's a lot of stories -- oh, a priest who
molested children 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago --
there have been stories that have come from terrible sexual acts
of the past.  But what is powerful about this is that it's not
really just the past, is it, Bob?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  No, it's the guiding
force of most sex education today.  Kinsey is the only sexual
data on children we have because, after all, it's criminal to
exploit children in this fashion.
<p>
So what the Kinsey people did
was take this data from molestation of children and extrapolate
it into a philosophy that said, &quot;Hey, kids are not only viable
sexually, but they're entitled to it.&quot;  And, if you notice,
the history of sex education is to bring sex ed, graphic materials,
to children at earlier and earlier ages, because, after all, science
says they are sexual beings.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I know people have
got to be watching and saying, &quot;Are you really saying children
were molested?&quot;  And we are going to get into that in just
a little bit.
<p>
But, frankly, what has been interesting is the lack
of interest in discussing it.  Have you found that shocking as
you have tried to present this information?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  This has been a hard sell -- and, I think, for one reason:  
It strikes at the very heart of the sexual revolution, because Alfred Kinsey
is the most quoted sexologist in history.  What he said undergirds
most current if-it-feels-good philosophy.  And they sense the
danger here.  If you discredit Alfred Kinsey, a lot falls down
with him.
<p>
So we think that people instinctively who feel that
sex ought to be free and wild and there ought to be no structures
sense that this could be very bad for them if it gets out.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What is one fast thing people need to know before we
unveil <i>The Children of Table 34</i>?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Well, I wouldn't have any children in the room.  You know, some 
of the material is shocking.  We did it as tastefully as we could, and there's
really nothing obscene or anything.  But it's shocking.  It's
hard stuff to digest, and you don't want children around.
<p>
The only other thing is that we took three years to document this
and make sure everything is absolutely accurate.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: There is a lot of information there to see. When <i>Straight 
Talk</i> returns, we'll take a look at what Bob has investigated and the
revelations that he has discovered as we bring to you <i>The Children
of Table 34</i>.  Again, viewer discretion and parental guidance is
strongly advised, not because of the material you will see, but
just the ideas are very powerful.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>.  Tonight's unique show includes the extraordinary documentary,
<i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  This documentary asks key questions
of Dr. Alfred Kinsey's child sexual studies.  Was consent obtained
from parents or guardians of those children who were sexually
molested in the name of science? <i>Straight Talk</i> now presents <i>The
Children of Table 34</i>.
<p>
<center><h3>The Children of Table 34</h3></center>
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  Hello.  I'm Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.  A number of
years ago, I starred in The Chapman Report, a film about the sex
studies of Dr. Alfred Kinsey.
<p>
Like most Americans, I felt at the
time that Dr. Kinsey's work was groundbreaking, and it was.  But
since then, serious questions have been raised about the Kinsey
research methods, serious enough to warrant a closer look.
<p>
What would you think if you learned that some of the most important
scientific research of the century may have been based on fraud,
or, if not fraud, criminal experimentation on children, funded
by the taxpayer?
<p>
What if you learned that the results of this
research are exerting a profound influence on our society today,
ranging from how we deal with sex offenders to how, when, and
what our children are being taught about sex, not to mention why.
<p>
Every parent in America needs to know the facts behind Alfred
Kinsey's inclusion of children in his famous sex studies in the
late 1940s.  Recent revelations about government-sponsored radiation
experiments remind us once more of the dangers of projects that
violate informed consent and the standards of common decency.
<p>
As you watch this story unfold, you will learn how America has
unknowingly put its children at risk in the name of science. 
And you may also join me in asking, What happened to Dr. Kinsey's
smallest subjects?  Where are the children of Table 34?
<p>
NARRATOR: Children, our most precious gift and our hope for the future.
 Once upon a time, children were free to roam their neighborhoods
without worry.  Parents could count on the good intentions of
neighbors, school officials, and other adults to keep their children
safe.  But in recent years, parents have had to take special measures
to ensure that their children not come to harm.  Their fears are
not unfounded.  Many children have fallen victim to sexual abuse.
<p>
How did we go from a safe, caring environment for children to
one in which parents are terrified that their children are at
risk in just a few short years?  Part of the answer may be found
in Indiana, at the world-famous Kinsey Institute.
<p>
In 1948, a zoologist
named Alfred C. Kinsey shocked the world with his pioneering study,
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i>. Although many scientists were
critical of Kinsey's methods, the media popularized Kinsey's findings
about sex.
<p>
By 1981, Dr. Judith Reisman uncovered the role of child
sexual abuse in the Kinsey studies in a paper presented to the
Fifth World Congress of Sexology in Jerusalem.  She documented
Kinsey's reliance on the systematic molestation of more than 300
infants and children from 2 months old to 15 years of age.  Graph
tables depicting sexual activity in children use identical criteria
as those in the tables on adult subjects.
<p>
DR. REISMAN:  Then I went back and I took a look at the Kinsey report, 
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i>, and as I reviewed the tables, 
it struck me as clear as day.  How could they get this data?  Where would they
get these data?  How did they know that a 2-month-old baby did
or did not have an orgasm?  How did they get a record of 26 orgasms
in 24 hours for a 4-year-old -- a 4-year-old?
<p>
MR. TRUEMAN:  If these experiments took place, they involved acts to which 
no child could provide consent and for which no parent or guardian could
provide consent on behalf of the child.  Therefore, we are talking
about criminal activity, the criminal sexual abuse of children.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Research scientist Gordon Muir sees broad ramifications
from Kinsey's work.  According to Dr. Muir, who helped edit and
publish Judith Reisman's and Ed Eichel's 1990 book, <i>Kinsey, Sex
and Fraud</i>:
<p>
DR. MUIR:  Children as young as 2 months of age are
featured in tables, in some cases 188 children in one table, and
the legend beneath the table says, &quot;Timed with a second hand
or stopwatch.&quot;
<p>
The understanding that we have of childhood
sexuality and normal childhood sexual development as it is believed
and taught in academia today comes from the experimental evidence
documented in Kinsey's male report published in 1948, with the
child sexuality tables that we have just discussed.  It is absolutely
astonishing that this is taken as the basis for what we understand
to be normal childhood sexual development.
<p>
When I try to explain
this to colleagues in the type of science that I am involved in
and what I call the harder sciences of biology and medicine, statistics,
immunology, they frankly do not believe what I am trying to tell
them, and the only way that I can convince them of the truth of
this is to go to the library, pull off the shelf one of Alfred
Kinsey's books, and show them what in fact is inside, and it is
quite shocking.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Based on the Kinsey data, six researchers
formulated a theory of child sexuality that has influenced everything
from laws against molestation to how and when sex education is
taught.
<p>
Few professionals would disagree that Dr. Kinsey has been
the most influential figure in the study of sex, particularly
the concept of child sexuality.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  He did not openly promote
pedophilia, but he provided the &quot;scientific&quot; basis
for it.  He felt the main problem with adult-child sexual relations
was hysteria and overreaction on the part of parents and authorities.
<p>
He believed that young boys needed the help of older people to
develop effective sexual techniques, and he recorded that adult
sexual contacts with young girls were a source of pleasure to
these girls and may lead to better sociosexual development in
their later lives.
<p>
His co-author, Wardell Pomeroy, a prominent
sexologist, has written that the Kinsey research uncovered &quot;many 
beautiful and mutually satisfying relationships between fathers
and daughters&quot;.
<p>
Pomeroy also, in his sex education book, <i>Boys and
Sex</i>, refers to the possibility of &quot;loving sexual relationships&quot;
between children and animals.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Children have been increasingly portrayed sexually in 
major pornographic magazines.
<p>
DR. REISMAN:  In our study conducted for the U.S. Justice Department,
particularly juvenile justice and delinquency prevention, we came
up with some pretty surprising findings on the images of children
in <i>Playboy</i> and <i>Penthouse</i> and <i>Hustler</i>.  In particular, 
<i>Playboy</i> and <i>Penthouse</i> were surprising to us.  We were 
instructed to do the research because of the finding of these kinds of 
materials being used in sexual activities, sexual crimes, really, against
children.
<p>
Most disturbing was that 29 percent of the visuals --
that is, the photographs -- included some sort of nude or genital
display -- very, very surprising.  Twenty-one percent were visually
exposed and sexualized.  Twenty percent had some sort of genital
activity taking place of some type.  Ten percent involved force;
10 percent, killing or murder.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Before Kinsey, psychologists
had rejected the idea of children as sexually viable until the
age of puberty.  Earlier this century, Sigmund Freud paved the
way for Kinsey by asserting that children were sexual but that
their sexuality was latent; that is, not acted upon until puberty.
<p>
Kinsey's report radically altered this perception, spawning an
entire industry based on the notion that children have a right
to sexual relations at any age.  The Kinsey perception of the
&quot;right&quot; of children to have sex at any age has resulted
in challenges to laws protecting children from sexual exploitation.
<p>
MR. SHAHEEN:  In Florida recently, a state court judge threw out
several cases that had been brought under the statutory rape laws.
 Citing privacy grounds, the judge found that minors under the
age of 16 had a constitutional right to engage in sexual activity.
<p>
Several courts have recently held that parents do not have a right
to stop school districts from handing out condoms to their children.
 Again, you see in school districts, in courts, in the media,
the Kinsey philosophy that children should be free and autonomous
to decide for themselves what sort of sexual activity, what sort
of sexual behavior they should engage in, without any kind of
regulation or restriction from the state or their parents, has
begun to chip away at the protections that our legal system had
previously provided to children.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Some scientists feel that an inquiry of the Kinsey 
Institute is long overdue.
<p>
DR. MUIR: I have been in contact with perhaps the best known fraud specialist
in this country over a period of years concerning this Kinsey
research fraud allegation.  The person I am referring to, of course,
is Walter Stewart(?), who is well known in Congress and in the
scientific community for his work in the Baltimore case, particularly,
and in other cases.  Now, Stewart is firmly of the opinion that
there is something here that needs to be investigated and has
told me so many times.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Muir says that such an effort
may be mounted outside the United States and cites a letter by
Walter Stewart to the Canadian Medical Journal.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  What Stewart said was that he finds the evidence -- that is, 
for fraud and ethical violations in research -- compelling, since the evidence
comes almost entire from Kinsey's book itself.  He says, &quot;I
find it disturbing and believe it requires investigation.&quot;
<p>
NARRATOR:  Dr. Muir says he hopes that Congress will investigate
the Kinsey Institute once it is widely known that children may
have been used in sexual experimentation.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  Because there
is a mess here that has to be cleared up in the backyard of American
science, and it would indeed be tragic if it gets cleared up from
elsewhere first.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Important questions need to be answered.
 Where are the children today?  How were they procured for the
experiments?  Did their parents know they were being used in sessions
with avowed pedophiles?  Where are the children of Table 34?
<p>
DR. COURT:  I am concerned about these people, who must now be in
their fifties, that they must have had some very difficult experiences
following these experiments, and it would be good, really, if
they could be contacted even for therapeutic purposes at this
stage.
<p>
I often wonder if they will come forward when we are speaking
in lectures or speaking on radio or whatever it may be.  I have
been waiting to hear, for some of these people to remember the
experience and to come forward and say, &quot;Yes, I was one of
those.&quot;
<p>
NARRATOR:  Based on 12,000 interviews, empirical
observation, and Kinsey's own ideas about sexuality, the Kinsey
report, as it came to be known, had enormous cultural and scientific
impact.
<p>
MR. GAGNON:  You could use the findings from the survey
to counter the moral judgments of other people, and that's really
the importance of Kinsey.  As Kinsey moves the argument away from
the old kind of sterile debate about morality -- in which, of
course, there is no solution -- to a place where people can start
talking about sexuality in a different kind of way, looking to
different kinds of standards.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Kinsey concluded that
Americans' sex lives were far more varied than had been thought
and that children were sexual from birth.  But the Kinsey books
have serious flaws, as has been noted by the National Research
Council and Dr. Abraham Maslow, who warned Kinsey that sex surveys
tend to skew the data toward the sexually promiscuous and unconventional.
<p>
Because sexual manipulation of children is illegal, the Kinsey
studies have served as virtually the sole source for sex researchers.
 The Kinsey findings about children are based on interviews with
and records kept by pedophiles, which he described as &quot;adult
males who've had sexual contacts with younger boys and who, with
their adult backgrounds, are able to recognize and interpret the
boys' experiences.&quot;
<p>
DR. MUIR:  As a practitioner, a psychologist,
I cannot see that this is the way in which we collect information
about normal childhood sexuality.  To get pedophiles to go out
and do experiments on children is not how we learn about normality.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Please stay tuned to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.  Did the Kinsey Institute people pay pedophiles
to conduct their studies?  After the commercial break, we'll ask
this and other questions as we continue with more of <i>The Children
of Table 34</i>.
<p>
[Commercial break.] 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i> is back.  As we continue to put Dr.
Alfred Kinsey's scientific sexual findings under a microscope,
the Family Research Council's 1994 documentary, which we share
with you tonight, reveals the fallacies Dr. Kinsey's study created.
 Amazingly, these fallacies shape sex and health education even
today. Now, more of <i>The Children of Table 34</i>:
<p>
NARRATOR:  Kinsey acknowledges that some of the experiments involved the 
use of physical force with unwilling participants.  Kinsey describes
what he terms &quot;orgasms&quot; by the children, &quot;. . .
a gradual and sometimes prolonged buildup to orgasm which involves
still more violent convulsions of the whole body, heavy breathing,
groaning, sobbing, or more violent cries, sometimes with an abundance
of tears (especially among young children).&quot;
<p>
&quot;Some of the children exhibited extreme trembling, collapse, loss of 
color, and sometimes fainting.  The males in the present group will fight
away from the partner and may make violent attempts to avoid climax,
although they derive definite pleasure from the situation.&quot;
<p>
&quot;A fretful babe quiets down under the initial sexual stimulation,
is distracted from other activities, begins rhythmic pelvic thrusts,
becomes tense as climax approaches, is thrown into convulsive
action, often with violent arm and leg movements, sometimes with
weeping at the moment of climax.&quot;
<p>
According to Paul Gebhart(?),
a Kinsey report coauthor and former president of the Kinsey Institute,
the researchers were aware that the experiments were illegal.
 &quot;We have always insisted on maintaining confidentiality,
even at the cost of thereby becoming amoral at best and criminal
at worst,&quot; said Gebhart.  &quot;An example of criminality
is our refusal to cooperate with authorities in apprehending a
pedophile we had interviewed who was being sought for a sex murder.&quot;
<p>
DR. POMEROY:  Kinsey would have done business with the devil if
it helped the research, and this is true.  The research was absolutely
paramount.  And he was astute enough to stay out of trouble. 
He got in practically no trouble, but he worked at it.
<p>
DR. MUIR: Related to that, of course, is the question, did parents give
consent to what was being done?  Nobody has indicated to us that
consent was given.  Indeed, these coworkers seemed to indicate
to us that consent was not given, and they didn't really see it
as terribly important, because this wasn't going to be particularly
harmful to the children, anyway.
<p>
NARRATOR:  There is another possibility
regarding Kinsey's data on children:  that the experiments never
took place.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  We have the other serious implication that
the data are being used as if they were real in order to generate
a whole view of child sexuality and availability of children in
sexual encounters which is based on nothing.
<p>
NARRATOR:  If that is so, then scientific fraud may have occurred.  
In either case, the reliance on reports on sexual torture of children under 
the auspices of federally supported research cries out for examination,
especially since Kinsey's research had such a profound effect
on the entire sex research field.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  I went back to
get a degree and went into the human sexuality program at New
York University, and it was when I was in that program that I
began to learn and see the indoctrination of what has been called
the Kinsey grand scheme.
<p>
Now, that term comes from Wardell Pomeroy,
Kinsey's closest associate, but I experienced it firsthand in
an international health seminar held in Holland, organized by
my professor, Dr. Deryck Calderwood.
<p>
Calderwood initiated nude-body
workshops in which he would give quasi-medical excuses for men
to touch each other's genitals and for women to interact in different
feely-touchy situations.
<p>
NARRATOR:  The Kinsey Institute has dominated
the world of sexology through the migration of Kinsey disciples
to several key centers of sexology, including New York University,
the University of Pennsylvania, and the Institute for Advanced
Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco.  These three institutions
account for the lion's share of the academic credentialing of
sex educators in the United States.
<p>
Working with the Kinsey team
was Dr. Mary Calderone, who was medical director of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America from 1953 to 1964, before co-founding
the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States,
better known as SIECUS.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  She formed that organization
with Lester Kirkendall, another pioneering sexologist, who was
the teacher and the mentor of Deryck Calderwood, my professor.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Also involved was Kinsey's co-author, Wardell Pomeroy,
a founding member who also served as president of SIECUS as recently
as 1975.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  In terms of Lester Kirkendall, in 1985,
he made a statement in an article entitled &quot;Sex Education
in the Future&quot; that I think is worth noting.
<p>He says that
programs of the future will probe sexual expression with same-sex
partners and even across generational lines.  &quot;With a diminished
sense of guilt, these patterns will become legitimate, and the
emphasis on normality and abnormality will be much diminished
with these future trends.&quot;
<p>
NARRATOR:  The most obvious impact
of this effort is to demystify the taboos of sexuality in sex
education classes to very young children.  Many sex education
curricula now begin in kindergarten and continue through high
school, often under AIDS prevention.  The message to parents:
 If we don't begin teaching children about safe sex as early as
possible, including every variation, then they may get AIDS.
DR. REISMAN:  Mrs. Smith or Ms. Smith from somewhere in Ohio, who
goes for her three-unit training in human sexuality because she
has to teach human sexuality to the kids and she has to teach
AIDS prevention, she goes to an accredited sex educator, and she
will be trained in the Kinsey model.  That is the only model that
she can be trained in.
<p>
And as a result, then, she has to set aside
whatever value structure, whatever moral structure she has been
carrying all these years, because she has been told that the &quot;science&quot;
has proven that children are sexual from birth, that children
have orgasmic potential from birth, that this therefore can be
perfectly fine.
<p>
[From a Nickelodeon special]:
<p>
CHILD:  How can you be protected from AIDS, like when you're having sex? 
<p>
TEACHER:  Well, one of the best ways, Magic, is wear a condom,
isn't it?
<p>
MR. JOHNSON:  Yes.  The safest way is to wear a condom.
<p>
NARRATOR:  As a result, some schools, and even a documentary
presented by Nickelodeon, are instructing children as young as
8 years old in how to use a condom:
<p>
TEACHER:  You roll it
down the penis, and that protects the man when his penis is inside
the woman's vagina.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Children are also told how to perform
anal sex.  At a safe sex youth conference in New York in 1994,
children as young as 12 were given graphic brochures advising
boys to enjoy safe sex with men and encouraging girls to experiment
with lesbian sex practices that could cause sterility.
<p>
MR. EICHEL: Nowhere in the program curriculum that was developed to be the
guidelines for future sex education was there anything that suggested
sick sexual behavior, any form of sexual activity that might
be categorized, or abnormality.
<p>
NARRATOR:  The Kinsey view of
child sexuality has also been promulgated by Dr. John Money, perhaps
the most prominent sex researcher in America.  A founding board
member of SIECUS, Dr. Money has written numerous books, as well
as hundreds of papers, reviews, and textbook chapters on the subject
of sex.
<p>
In 1990, Dr. June Reinisch dedicated her book, <i>The Kinsey
Institute New Report on Sex</i>, to Dr. Money, whom she describes
as &quot;one of my mentors.&quot;
<p>
Recently, Dr. Money was interviewed
by Piedika(?), the journal of pedophilia, which is published in
The Netherlands.  The journal argues for man-boy sex and contains
advertisements for the North American Man-Boy Love Association
and other pro-pedophile groups.
<p>
Kinsey Institute associate Dr.
Vern Bulow(?) is on Piedika's editorial board, which issued this
statement of purpose:  &quot;The starting point of Piedika is
necessarily our consciousness of ourselves as pedophiles.&quot;
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  But when you look at the journal Piedika, the Dutch
journal, you will see that on the board of directors you have
people like Vern Bulow.  Vern Bulow was the president of the Society
for the Scientific Study of Sex when they formed the accrediting
committee for future university programs that give degrees to
sex educators.
<p>
Vern Bulow did the foreword for Edward Brongursma's(?)
two volumes, <i>Loving Boys</i>.  John Money of Johns Hopkins Hospital
and the mentor of June Reinisch was interviewed in Piedika, and
of course, he is one of the people saying that sex with children
can be an enriching experience and doesn't harm the child.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares with you the 
conclusion of <i>The Children of Table 34</i> and more insights from the 
documentary's producer, Robert Knight.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i> now
brings you the conclusion of our 1994 documentary, which reveals
shocking findings about Dr. Alfred Kinsey's children of Table
34.  And immediately following, we will once again speak with
Robert Knight, producer of this chilling video.  Please watch.
<p>
NARRATOR:  In Dr. Money's interview in Piedeka, he was asked about
child sexuality.  His reply:  &quot;If I were to see the case
of a boy aged ten or twelve who is intensely attracted toward
a man in his twenties or thirties, if the relationship is totally
mutual and the bonding is genuinely totally mutual, then I would
not call it pathological in any way.&quot;
<p>
This attitude mirrors
that of Dr. Kinsey, who once wrote that, &quot;It is difficult
to understand why a child, except for its cultural conditioning,
should be disturbed at having its genitalia touched.&quot;
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  In 1965, the Kinsey team published the book, <i>Sex 
Offenders</i>, which argued that sexual behavior was so varied that 
certain activities should not be singled out for harsh punishment.
<p>
During the past 10 years, reports of child abuse cases have soared to more 
than 2.5 million annually.  Although many of these cases have proved
to be false reports, it is clear that child abuse, and the perception
of child abuse, is a growing problem.  Increasingly, child abuse
experts are expressing concern about Kinsey's impact on the way
people view sexuality.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  One of the objectives of Kinsey-type
programming is to change the concept of the family, and if you
think about it, if Heather has two mommies and Daddy has a male
roommate, in a way, you are denormalizing the heterosexual nuclear
family.  And if you remember from the pedophile-type statements
in the writings, for example, of Theo Sanford, he said that if
children could be weaned away from the nuclear family, they could
then form emotional attachments with others beyond the family.
<p>
So, in a sense, the systematic destruction of the concept of a
family with a mother and father, and with the family break-ups
and divorces that are occurring, it is a very opportune time.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Attempts to uncover evidence regarding the experiments
on children have been rebuffed by the Kinsey Institute.  Former
director Dr. June Reinisch, interim director Dr. Stephanie Sanders,
and other Kinsey personnel either declined or did not respond
to interview requests.  Dr. Money also declined to be interviewed.
<p>
<i>Child</i> magazine featured an article by Dr. Reinisch urging parents
to regard their children as sexually active and to promote more
sexual activity.
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  Given its critical role in overhauling
a culture that used to value and protect children above all else,
the Kinsey report is long overdue for scientific scrutiny.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  He used data from the rape of children, as we've discussed,
some as young as 2 months, to demonstrate and prove childhood
sexual capacity.  He concealed the full nature of these experiments,
and he concealed information on who performed these experiments.
<p>
He extrapolated these data to describe normal childhood development.
 He did not follow up these abused children, as was ethically
and morally required, though the identities of many of these children
are known and known today, and they still could be followed up,
and should be.
<p>
Furthermore, he shielded criminals who were involved
in this work, including one murderer that we know of, from the
police.
<p>
If I have not said enough about the need for this research
to be investigated, then I doubt if there is really anything else
that could be said.
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  These questions need to be
answered:  How were the children procured for the experiments
recorded in Table 34?  Where are they now?  Most would be in their
fifties.
<p>
Also, many of the Kinsey associates themselves are still
around, but most of them are elderly.  It is important that they
be given the opportunity to shed light on what happened before
it's too late, before any more children are victimized.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back. Bob, you produced this video.  You've been 
working on this project for years.  As a matter of fact, you were talking
about it the day that I met you, about four years ago, three or
four years ago.  It's a very powerful video.
<p>
But what does the Kinsey Institute say when they're asked about this 
horrendous research?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  I am glad you asked that, because they
have finally broken their silence on it.  Dr. John Bancroft, the
new director of Kinsey Institute, has said that he looked into
the files -- which means they exist -- and he said that he thought
all the children had been molested by a single person, an elderly
pedophile, and that conflicts with what Dr. Kinsey wrote in the
Kinsey report.  So it has opened up a whole new realm of questioning.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And in fact, I understand that recently a woman
came forward and said that she was one of the molestation victims.
<p>
Family Research Council is looking for victims.  What are you
finding on that?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Well, we're hoping some people will
come forward because, actually, we want the identity of this so-called
lone pedophile, because if we nail that down, people will begin
to realize what may have happened to them so many years ago at
the Kinsey Institute.
<p>
This woman's story has checked out.  It
has an Indiana University tie, and we are hoping she's the first
of many who will come forward.  And, incidentally, her story probably
was research that was included in Kinsey's female volume, which
followed the male volume.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We don't have a lot of
time left, Bob, but the story doesn't end here, and I am sure
<i>Straight Talk</i> is going to bring updates.
<p>
But we are looking at
congressional action related to <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  In
fact, you may even be testifying, Bob.  Briefly, in about 20 seconds,
what can Congress do, and what is happening right now in terms
of looking into this data?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Okay.  Right now before
Congress is the Family Privacy Protection Act, which bars any
federal funding for research into using children for which parents
have not given written consent.  We're testifying to say this
is a good idea; you've got to have written consent.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Really quickly.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Okay, and we hope Congress will
absolutely open the doors of the Kinsey Institute, using subpoena
power, holding hearings, whatever it takes to shed light on this.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to look forward to that.  <i>Straight Talk</i>
continues after the break.  Stay tuned to hear how you can obtain
a copy of the video, <i>The Children of Table 34</i>, and information
about other important issues being investigated by the Family
Research Council and Robert Knight.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for watching <i>Straight Talk</i> and the Family 
Research Council exclusive video production, <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.
 If you want more information, the video or some information,
please call the Family Research Council at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Hope you can join us next week when we'll be talking to people who
are successfully paving the way for the country's welfare reform,
and we'll share with you how you, too, can get involved.
<p>
Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Our show this week will 
try to answer some hard questions. What happens to people if the 
government isn't the safety net we've come to expect?  What kind 
of help can the private sector really be?
<p>
The concept of real welfare reform can seem overwhelming. The 
government for many years has said that it can best care for people 
caught in tough circumstances.  But the problem with the welfare 
state is that it's people, not statistics, we're talking about. 
The state doesn't have time or manpower enough for one-on-one attention. 
When lives really change, something personal happens. It is 
individuals who actually reform the welfare state, one person at a 
time, one life at a time.
<p>
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> portrays examples of individuals like 
you and me who are making that reform a reality.  But first, let's take 
a look at the story on the minds of most of political Washington, 
yesterday's government shutdown in the name of a balanced budget.
<p>
I had the chance to speak with Family Research Council's Bill Mattox, 
who has been working on budget and tax policy in Washington, D.C., 
for more than 10 years. You won't find Bill's insights as to how this 
situation will affect our country and families in most news stories. 
Join me in questioning Bill on what lies behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are here with Bill Mattox, Vice President for Policy 
of the Family Research Council, and, Bill, as you and I know, the train 
has wrecked. It doesn't seem like Washington, D.C., is stopped, and yet 
a lot of people, interestingly enough, are saying that the train
wreck isn't about Medicare; it's not about whether or not we have
one tax proposal or another.
<p>
<i>The Washington Post</i> and Republican leadership are agreeing that 
the real issue here seems to be balancing the budget long term, over a 
seven-year period.  What do you think the train wreck says to pro-family 
America?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I think it is primarily about whether or not the President 
and Congress agree on getting a balanced budget in the next seven years. 
The Congress has repeatedly moved toward that target and has said,
&quot;We believe strongly in a balanced budget, and here's proof
in the pudding.  Here's our proposal, here's our plan; we want
to see this adopted.&quot;
<p>
The President, in recent months, has given some good lip service to this 
idea. He has not been a long-time supporter of a balanced budget, but 
here in recent months he has said some nice things.
<p>
Unfortunately, when putting-up time comes, you cannot get to a balanced 
budget unless you are willing to make some very hard decisions.  And what 
the President is suggesting is that some of the hard decisions that 
Congress has made in the Medicare realm, for example, where they are not 
allowing the kinds of increases that would otherwise occur, that are going 
to lead the Medicare program to bankruptcy, what the President is suggesting
is that those kinds of hard decisions he doesn't want to see made
and would rather not have a balanced budget if that is what is
required.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And isn't that ironic, because he campaigned
on a balanced budget, as the freshman class campaigned on, and
it seems now that whether or not we have a balanced budget is
the true sticking point.  Is that going to hold?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: I think it will be <b>the</b> central question.  The big issue 
will be, how quickly will this whole matter be resolved?  I mean, I do
think we are going to see some type of stopgap measure adopted
here before too long that will get those nonessential government
services running again.  It is always kind of curious that these
programs are nonessential, and it leads me to say, Well, if they're
nonessential, why do we even have them in the first place?  I
mean, I do think we are going to see some type of stopgap measure
that will keep the government running.
<p>
The question will be, will we adopt a new budget for the new fiscal year, 
or will we instead continue to operate this year on last year's spending 
levels? Because that is essentially what is being done right now, is
that they are simply saying, We'll keep the government running
at last year's levels until we can settle this issue.
<p>
There are some advisors to the President, including James Carville(?), 
who, of course, was renowned for his insistence that &quot;It's the
economy, Stupid,&quot; in the 1992 campaign.  Carville has suggested
to Clinton, &quot;Look, don't resolve this problem.  Take this
to the voters next November and let the election of 1996 center
around the question of do you want to balance the budget on the
backs of the senior citizens,&quot; or whatever sort of spin that
Carville and company would like to put to it.
<p>
Of course, the big concern that we have is that this is irresponsible. 
This is just irresponsible on the part of those who have been elected
to govern this country, and we do not want to see an interminable
playing of politics by those in the White House or, for that matter,
those in the Congress.
<p>
We do want to see those pro-family tax cuts that, here again, both the 
President campaigned on in 1992 and the Congress did in 1994 after no 
action had been taken during the President's first two years in office. 
And one of the things that is threatened in this package is those pro-family 
tax cuts. If some type of resolution isn't made here, we could see those
tax cuts disappear, and I think that would be a tragedy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But the Family Research Council has been working on tax 
relief since the early 1980s, and ironically, the per-child tax credit,
which is about $2,500, if it had kept pace with inflation, would
be about $9,500 today, and we are talking about $500, which is
incredibly ironic.  Do you think the $500-per-child tax credit
will survive?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  We hope so.  The House and Senate leaders
met yesterday to finalize their tax plan.  The details actually
have not been released quite yet, but the early indications are
that the $500 credit has survived, that it will be the central
part of this tax package; that in fact in the first year, in 1996,
come October of next year, right before the elections occur, interestingly,
taxpayers will each receive a $125 check per child, and that in
the year following, the calendar year beginning then in 1997,
the $500-per-child credit would kick in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: From your experience -- you do a lot of original polling 
for the Family Research Council, and next week, in fact, we are going 
to hear about what you are looking at for a family issues survey of 1995
-- but from your experience on the tax issue, how do you think
average Americans, pro-family Americans, are going to respond
to this kind of cat-and-mouse game we are playing?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, there are a lot of legislators who like to pose 
these two things against each other and say, well, you can either 
balance the budget or you can cut taxes.  But, surely, if you are 
going to be cutting taxes, you could be taking that money that you 
would have raised and putting it toward deficit reduction and making
it easier to balance the budget. 
<p>
These are not, however, mutually exclusive goals, and we have said from 
the outset, &quot;Look, we believe just like the American people&quot; 
-- and you're right; the polling data is ample there to show that the 
American people strongly want a balanced budget; they do want the fiscal 
house of this government brought into order.
<p>
Look, give us less government. Give us smaller government.  Cut our 
taxes. You can cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time.  That, 
I think, is something that this town really needs to hear, because quite 
often, as you say, a lot of cat-and-mouse games are played to suggest 
that you really cannot cut the taxes and balance the budget.  It isn't
so.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Bill, thank you very much for being with us,
and we look forward to seeing the poll next week.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Very good.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  After this commercial, we will be joined
by Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson, Family Research Council
analysts who devote their time to researching and developing alternatives
to America's current welfare system.  Stay tuned for this and
the chance to meet those who are making practical changes in that
system.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing welfare reform and the practical 
ways that individuals can step into the gap when the government frees 
itself from the welfare business.
<p>
Here with me now are Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson of the 
Family Research Council.  Both work diligently to investigate what 
changes need to be made within our government and our society to 
make welfare reform a reality.
<p>
Welcome, both of you.  I get to see a lot of you, and frankly, you 
guys have been involved in a big fight in the last year.
<p>
Jennifer, can government do anything right?  I mean, the secret to 
welfare reform seems to be getting the government out of welfare.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, I do agree that we need to revert from a 
government-driven system to one that is driven more by the private 
sector, by individual citizens and local communities.
<p>
In answer to your question, yes, the government can distribute some 
material assistance.  It doesn't do so efficiently.  But frankly, our 
concern is not particularly about inefficiency or about excess costs. 
Our worry is that government cannot offer material assistance and 
self-respect and human dignity at the same time.
<p>
You do rob people of something very precious. We need to allow them to 
work out problems on their own, to fend for themselves.  And you do 
damage to the human spirit when you suggest that they are not able to 
live by the same rules that the rest of us live by.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Deanna, you, interestingly enough, were a social 
worker.
<p>
MS. CARLSON: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What was government able to do?  What were you able to do?
<p>
MS. CARLSON:  Well, working for a government agency is limiting. 
There are some things I could do for my clients.  I could set
up resources for them to meet their physical needs as well as
counsel them for their emotional needs.  But there comes a time
when people are in crisis situations where I felt like I had my
hands tied, and I couldn't give things to meet their deepest needs.
 Specifically, I am talking about their spiritual needs.
<p>
I remember one client I had who was severely handicapped.  She was 
three years old, and she required suctioning every 15 minutes so she
could breathe.
<p>
I went in and met with her mother a number of times,
and at one point I just realized that there was something more
I needed to do.  And so, on my own time, the best thing I did
for that family was to sit down with them one evening and to meet
with the daughters and the mother and to pray.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Not the kind of thing that you're going to get too often 
from a government service.
<p>
In your work at the Family Research Council, 
Jennifer, what would you like to see the private sector do?  Is it 
offering prayer support?  Can it offer food support?  How do you think
welfare can really be reformed?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  I think the key is to match individuals one on one so 
that we can build a personal relationship.  I am very interested in 
encouraging church members, in particular, to work one on one with 
children at risk.
<p>I think that religious activists are precisely the 
kinds of people who have the initiative and the energy and the idealism 
that will be required to do this job, because it is a big job.  But 
building relationships is the key.
<p>
We already have a very good precedent with crisis pregnancy centers. There 
are many of our constituents who are already doing this kind of work.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is probably hard for people to believe, watching, saying, 
yes, it would be great if government would be more personal.  It would be 
great if we could build key relationships.  But how do you accomplish
a shift from a government-based care system to a private-based
care system?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, I think, first, we need to look
at reducing the size of the population in need, and one of the
ways we do that is by an illegitimacy-based approach to welfare
reform.  We know that children born out of wedlock are much more
likely to live in welfare dependency, to depend on the government
for assistance, so that instead of just putting mothers back to
work, we should be finding ways to reduce the number of children
who are born to single mothers and absent fathers.
<p>
It is true that the government will always have a dampening effect on 
the kinds of private-sector remedies that are available, and so it
will be necessary to start scaling back government benefits, because
they crowd out civil society; they crowd out the traditional arrangements,
like families and churches.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I think here in Washington,
D.C, I know I walk by -- I am a public transportation user --
walk by homeless people and see a lot of heartache every day.
 We know that there is mental illness, we know there is drug abuse
and chronic alcoholism.
<p>
Deanne, I am wondering, is there not a
certain number of people who really need help, who are not capable
of some of the self-help things that could be offered?
<p>
MS. CARLSON: Yes, there are people who are dependent through nothing 
that they have done, who are born in a state of dependency.
<p>
I think what we want to do is encourage individuals to decide what they
can help with.  Some people are professionals.  They are skilled
to deal with very severe situations.  But for those of us who
don't have that type of education, we each have something that
we can give to someone.
<p>
If we see a homeless person on the street
and we have not worked for a homeless shelter, we can still give
that person respect, and that starts with smiling and with saying
hi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  But for the people who are going to need a little
more than that -- because I think you are right -- you know, I
interviewed some people at a shelter not too long ago, and they
said the worst thing about living on the street is that no one
looks at you, and that was very powerful, to see these people
saying, We wanted just to be noticed.
<p>
But how does a government-private
sector world work, do you think?  Family Research Council is getting
ready for a welfare symposium December 13, Jennifer, that you
have been putting together that is going to look at private sector
initiative.  What is the key to private sector initiatives?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, Kristi, you love individuals one at a time; you
don't love collectivities.  And this is one of the reasons why
we are talking about person to person, one heart at a time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic!  And of some of the solutions that you have
seen, what strikes you as being some of the best and most powerful?
<p>
MS. CARLSON:  There's a church in Mississippi that was challenged
by the governor to meet the needs in their neighborhood, and they
identified the resources that they had within their church.  They
also identified the needs of their community, and they matched
people in need with people who could provide assistance.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That kind of matching is going to be key, and we are 
looking at the building of civic virtues.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will meet a former welfare 
recipient and find out how she, through determination and the support 
of an individual willing to help, overcame her welfare plight.  Please 
stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
NARRATOR:  When thinking of welfare recipients, what image
comes to mind?  Many identify welfare with nameless, faceless
statistics -- those who are beyond help, those who do not want
help.
<p>
But our current system has failed to bring the help that
lifts people from their sometimes shattering situations.  One
major flaw:  the system seems to have failed to incorporate the
key to achieving success -- personal relationships, a one-on-one
accountability.  That is how Lisa Biondo changed her circumstances,
stepped out of those statistics.
<p>
A former welfare recipient, Lisa now supports herself and her 
16-month-old son, Dillon. Combined with her own determination was the 
friendship of Megan McMullen. With her help and inspiration, Lisa began 
to achieve the success that marks her life today.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Tonight we are discussing
welfare reform and introducing you to individuals who diligently
are making a change in the current system.  Two of those people,
whom you just met in our video piece, are Lisa Biondo and Megan
McMullen.  With Megan's support, Lisa, a former welfare recipient
and single mother, has successfully overcome a difficult situation.
 I don't want to tell too much of the story.
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Thanks for having me here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks so much for coming.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN: Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What was it like for you?
 Maybe you could tell a little bit.  You were pregnant.  What
did you feel?  What were you thinking at the time?  What was your
family situation like?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  When I found out I was pregnant,
I was very scared, and I turned to my mother and my father, which
they were very unsupportive of me, so I sought help through friends.
<p>
When I was seven months pregnant, I came to the Northwest Center,
and I was receiving AFDC at the time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How did you hear about the center?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Actually, I was staying at another maternity home similar 
to the Northwest Center. It was designed for a younger group, and I 
wanted to get out, so I researched some places and I came up with 
the Northwest Center and went to interview with them, and then I was 
accepted, and I had another interview with the actual house mother.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It had to be a very traumatic time for you.  What did you 
think your future would be like?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  I had no idea.  It was very scary
when you are responsible for another life, and I didn't have my
high school diploma at the time, so I had to get my GED, and I
received that after I had the baby, and I am very confident now
that I can make it in life without the support from welfare and
things like that.  I have an excellent job, and I have great friends
who have been there for me for everything.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's what I hear.  You met Megan, and was that a turning 
point for you?  How would you describe meeting Megan that day?
<p>
MS. BIONDO: Well, when I met Megan, I was not very open to talking to 
people. I didn't share too much information on myself.  And then as I
stayed there at the maternity home, we were in conversation, and
I just mentioned that I didn't have a birth coach, and so Megan
basically said she would be my birth coach, and it was just a
great experience, you know, having -- she was like a sister to
me -- [inaudible] brothers and sisters -- so this is great having
her support.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You do that for a living, Megan? Are you a volunteer?
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  Yes.  I am a director of a crisis pregnancy center, and at 
the time I was not the director, when Lisa came to the Northwest Center; I 
was the program director.
<p>
She started coming to the pregnancy center because she wanted
to learn more about the pregnancy and about what delivery was
going to be like, and I guess we entered into a number of conversations
about that, and at one point she mentioned that she didn't have
anyone to go with her to the hospital that night, and she was
very nervous about it.
<p>
I just said at the time, &quot;Oh.  Well, I'll go with you.  Sure, no 
problem.&quot;
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  She didn't know what she was getting into.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You hadn't done that before?
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  No, I had never done it before.  I
was very interested, and so Lisa and I started going to all of
her prenatal care appointments together and then to birthing classes,
and then we -- Dillon was expected -- what day was he expected
on?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  He was expected July 8, but he didn't arrive
until July 21.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  We were waiting for a while.  But
that night, I guess, to tell the story, we were at a party at
the Northwest Center, and Lisa kept going, &quot;You know, I'm
getting the funniest feeling.  Something is going on.&quot;  And
everyone is going, &quot;Yeah, Lisa, that's all right.&quot; 
And she said, &quot;No, really, like something strange.&quot;
 Then we started timing them.  They were about five minutes apart.
 It was amazing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So, tell me, how has this changed
your life?  You have now left welfare.  Was this a decision that
you guys talked about?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Well, basically, I had it
set in my mind, even from when I began receiving AFDC, I just
knew it was a sick cycle.  You get trapped in it, and I didn't
want to get trapped.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Had you seen friends or family or people around you 
getting trapped?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Well, I know a few people that have - you know, it is just 
the way -- they give you a certain amount of money to live on, but yet if 
you get a job, you make more than what you would normally get on a
check, and you would be ineligible, and so they basically, they
say, &quot;Well, here's your medical assistance, here's your food
stamps, here's this money,&quot; and it is very comfortable for
them to stay on it without having to go out and work.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And you didn't want to get stuck?
<p>
MS. BIONDO: No, I didn't want to -- I come from a middle upper-class 
family, and I was very embarrassed and ashamed to be on welfare.  But 
it was something that -- I used it as a stepping stone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And for you, Megan, do you see in your work a lot of people 
trying to struggle to get off?  I mean, you see a lot of people coming in, 
and the temptation must be to stay on welfare.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN: Certainly. I think that quite oftentimes women are concerned 
about medical benefits, even, talking about a lot of minimum-wage jobs, you
are not getting medical benefits in order for their children and
things like that, that they feel trapped.  I think oftentimes
we are talking about young women that have second- and third-generation
welfare families, where it is everything that they have ever known.
 No one has ever talked to them about actually finishing high
school, actually going to college, working, doing things like
that.
<p>
I am seeing young women who are having their first baby
at 15, and that is not uncommon nowadays, to have four children
by 19.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What do you tell them?  You know, you have
some experience now to talk from, and you obviously work with
that every day.  What do you tell them when they come in?  What
can you say to someone in that situation?
<p>
MS. BIONDO: Well, basically, I have been through this so I know how they 
feel, and I have reached out and I have tried to help in my own way that I 
can.  I don't have much to give, but I try to give what I can.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You in fact invited a young woman to come and live with you.
<p>
MS. BIONDO: I did.  She was calling to the center, and I spoke
with her on the phone, and she finally came into the center, and
she didn't have anywhere to go.  Something inside of me just said,
Well, she can come home with me.  I have a very small apartment,
you know, but I wanted to provide for her.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  I gave her clothes, and she has a beautiful daughter
now, and she has everything, but I felt the need to help someone,
because I needed someone to help me.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sort of one on one.
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  And Megan was there for me, so it is like
a cycle, you know, keep it going.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of what you are seeing in your work, Megan, is 
that what is making the difference, one person helping one person 
helping one person?
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  I think, absolutely, the idea that someone who
is there at 12 o'clock at night when you call on the phone and
you're upset about something.  That makes the difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  I think to know that there is someone
out there who truly cares, who is starting to talk about the future,
to go, &quot;Well, what are your plans?  Where do you want to
be a year or two from now, and what are the plans and the steps
that you can take to be there?&quot;
<p>
I think specifically with Lisa, the big step was originally to get her 
GED and then to get some work experience and then to get a job of her own, 
which she has now, which is fantastic --
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Excellent.  An excellent --
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  -- affording her -- she has health benefits,
she has an apartment for herself, and she can afford to pay for
excellent day care for Dillon, which is, I think, two years ago,
when you were talking about it two years ago, you wouldn't have
thought that that was possible.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, the Northwest Center is very well known in Washington 
for doing some wonderful work.  Everyone I know raves about it.  How could 
people get involved? Is there anything that you would advise someone in 
terms of how to be a real helping hand?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Well, basically, if you know someone that has reached out 
to you and expressed that they do have a problem, I would say do what you 
think that you can do to help them.  You know, there's lots of ways.  You 
can volunteer at the center.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  Lots of practical ways.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We have very little time left.  I would love you to give the
phone number of the center before we go.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN: It is 202-483-7008.  We are located in Washington, and we 
are open to taking anyone who would like to come and help us with anything.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I have heard wonderful things.
<p>
Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Following this commercial break, we will be back and joined 
by Hannah Hawkins, a woman who took it upon herself to make a difference in 
her community. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Anacostia. Southeast Washington, D.C.  A neighborhood 
recently labeled, &quot;The shattered heart of the murder capital.&quot;
<p>
In this neighborhood of what seems to be made of broken dreams and hopelessness 
lives Hannah Hawkins.  She is making a difference.
<p>
VOLUNTEER: Did you get a cup?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  God put us here for a reason, and that
is to serve and not to be served, and in saying that, He never
wants us to look down on a man unless we're picking him up.
<p>
[Children playing games.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And those who volunteer with Hannah
are also making a difference.
<p>
VOLUNTEER:  That's the sounds he makes when he's mad.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Hold up nine fingers.  Now take away four.  Now, how many 
have you got left?
<p>
CHILD: Five.
<p>
VOLUNTEER:  It comes with volunteering:  giving it back.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Number one, I feel that you need, everybody needs to volunteer
in some organization, and the cost of real love -- and that's
our motto -- is no charge.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Hannah is beginning reform at the beginning, with children.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Because you're going to either deal with them here to you're 
going to be dealing with them somewhere later.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is easy to see why Hannah Hawkins has created a successful 
organization which helps the children of her neighborhood in Anacostia. 
Ms. Hawkins started the Children of Mine Center in her home more than nine 
years ago. Hannah and her center now serve 75 to 100 children a day in an
after-school program that provides an immeasurable amount of academic,
nutritional, emotional, and spiritual support.
<p>
Welcome so much. I am glad to have you and Deanna back again.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Glad to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Why did you choose to focus on the children?
 There are a lot of needy people out there.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, many years ago -- I am an activist; I am a native of 
this city, and there are very few of us that are left in the city -- I 
became a drug counselor.  I have three sons who are recovering addicts.
 I found that so much emphasis had been placed on the adult addicts,
and no one was paying attention to the siblings.
<p>
I would travel through the street, walking through the streets all hours of 
the night, coming from different meetings, and I would find children
who were out begging for various things.
<p>
Therefore, I felt as though that we had to do something.  We could no 
longer sit around the round table and discuss what was happening to the 
children and not do something for the children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That first day that you decided to have children come into 
your home, what was that day like?  Or was it a special child, when you said,
&quot;I'm going to open my home&quot;?  How did that happen?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, it is so ironic.  It just happened.  You know,
me and my prayer partner had started a Bible study group.  She
had it in her home, and I encouraged her to take the children
from out of her home because, by word of mouth, she had outgrown
her home, and I found her a place across the street from where
I lived, and in finding her a place, I found that children were
coming to me for counseling, and it just happened.  It is just
like when you fall in love.  You don't know when or where; it
just happens.
<p>
And so I found that the traveling into my home,
which I live in a very small, two-bedroom townhouse in Anacostia,
that I was no longer able to accommodate the many children that
wanted to come in.
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, other government agencies, people have come to you and 
offered to take this over or help, and you have said no federal funding.  
Why is that?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Well, the government agencies have not virtually come to 
offer assistance and taking it over.  They have admired me from afar,
like many people.  But I tell people that your mouth can say many
things, but your behavior don't lie, and their behavior has lied.
 They have not come forth to virtually offer me anything, and
to be honest with you, maybe it's all for the best, because some
of the services, one of the major services that we provide at
the Children of Mine Center is Bible studies, and when you are
receiving federal funding, they don't want you to discuss religion
at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As a social worker, Deanna, I know you saw
a lot of that.  What impresses you most about Ms. Hawkins' program?
<p>
MS. CARLSON:  There are so many things that impress me about your
program, but one of them is that it is in a neighborhood that
you live in and that you are meeting a need of those around you.
<p>
All of us find ourselves in different neighborhoods, with different
children around us, and I have just noticed in you a real genuineness
and wanting to reach out to whoever it is, whatever those needs
are that you have seen.
<p>
I am really impressed, too, in the fact
that you are working with children and in that investment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of the lives changed, even in a nine-year period,
what has happened to some of the kids that you have had?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Well, I have had them more than nine years in actuality; I 
have had them for over 10.  It is so ironic that you asked me that
question, because I always use a slogan, &quot;From little acorns,
big oaks grow.&quot;  The children are able to equate to this,
because they can see a little acorn, and then they know about
the big oak.
<p>
The children that have stayed under the umbrella
of the Children of Mine Center have grown.  I have taken them
from profanity to prayer, from crime to a normal way of living.
 And the problem -- and this is what I tell so many of my constituency,
and I try to tell society -- you know, we are so busy -- so many
of the Congressmen are so busy posturing themselves until they
don't understand that these children are no different than any
of us.  It is lack of nurturing that has occurred.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kind of homes do the children come from?  How would 
you describe their environment?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, they come from all over the city, all over the 
metropolitan area -- Northwest -- all four quadrants -- Northeast, 
Southwest, and Southeast. Some come from two-family homes.  Some are in 
foster care.  Some have been adopted.  We have adopted some of these 
children.  Some come --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Is there a common thread, do you think,
as you look at them -- two-parent, one-parent, rich or poor? 
What holds them together in your home and in your heart?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: In the Children of Mine or in their home?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In the children that you see coming in.  What do you see a 
common thread today?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, the main thing that I see, and the
most common denominator, is that consistency -- and this is what
society does not have anymore.  Look at today.  The government
is closed down.  You don't know what is going to happen tomorrow.
 Through the grace of God -- it is nothing that I am doing; it
is only through the grace of God that we are able to do this.
 It is consistency.
<p>
There are days when I am awfully tired, awfully
tired.  But I go in spite of my tiredness.  And the children see
a consistent pattern that we are there.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The research has been very clear that consistency and a 
stable environment is one of the key elements that children need. 
Faith is something that government often doesn't provide.
<p>
Deanna, what do you see in the research in terms of the powerful impact 
that role models and role models of faith have on kids?
<p>
MS. CARLSON: The research has shown consistently that if you have a 
faith-based program, it is more effective than the government programs, and 
that is exactly what Ms. Hawkins is doing in her center.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The children -- I know you've got to have many different things
that you give them:  food, shelter, academics.  Academics is another
long-term skill.  What do you do for the children in helping expand
their thinking?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, first of all -- and you must
understand this, and I cannot emphasize this enough -- the cost
of real love is no charge.  The children, they are very sensitive,
and I think we as adults, we underestimate the intelligence of
children.  They are just like sponges.  They will absorb anything
that you give them.
<p>
I will say to you just like I say to them
every night, &quot;Poison in, poison out.  Love in, love out.&quot;
 And that's what we try to give them:  love, consistency, understanding,
and patience.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I understand that even though there
are sometimes gang problems, crime problems in the area, that
people have been very much leaving your program alone and giving
you the space to do what you are doing.  Why do you think that
is, when so many people are talking about those kinds of gang
and crime problems in the inner cities?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Well, it's only through the grace of God, and what you 
must understand -- I will say to you just like I say to a lot of the 
volunteers that might want to come, and they say to me, which I laugh 
about it now, but it used to be very insulting, &quot;Is it safe to come
there?&quot;
<p>
And I say to them -- and I am going to say this to
you -- &quot;When you're doing God's will, He will put a hedge
of protection around you at all times.&quot;  They are more safe
there than they are sitting in their own so-called secluded living
rooms.  The community knows that we are doing God's work, and
that's why.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We have about a minute left, and I would
love to give you the opportunity to say anything you would like
to the people who are watching about your program or the work
that you are doing.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  I would just like to say to
you, my brothers and sisters, today, we have so many children
that have a hole in their hearts.  Please close that hole with
love.  Take time out to reach down and pick one of these children
up.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much, Ms. Hawkins.  It has been
an honor.  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares with you highlights
of what the Family Research Council staff is doing to ensure that
the government gives us the very best for today's families.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.
<p>
The FRC staff participates in many events to
promote America's families.  In fact, just last week, Robert Knight,
Director of Cultural Studies, testified before the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee to give his insight and influence regarding
the Family Privacy Act.
<p>
<i>Straight Talk</i> now brings you the Family Research Council's Homefront 
News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
[From testimony given on November 9, 1995, before the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee on the Family Privacy Act.]
<p>
COMMITTEE CHAIR: Mr. Knight, could we have your statement, please, sir?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Sure. I am Robert H. Knight, Director of Cultural
Studies of the Family Research Council.  I am a former journalist,
having been a news editor at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, a Media Fellow
at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and a Senior
Fellow for Cultural Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation.
<p>
We appreciate your including Family Research Council in this hearing,
and we feel we are speaking on behalf of many parents all over
the United States.
<p>
In 1986, the White House Working Group on the
Family's final report included these words:  &quot;Parental nurturing
and education of the young is our most important national investment.
 It is the fundamental task of humanity.&quot;
<p>
Those words were penned by my boss, Gary Bauer, and nothing that has 
happened since has changed the truth of what he said.  It could have been 
said at any time and any place.
<p>
We often hear from child's rights advocates
that it takes a whole village to raise a child.  But parents are
indispensable.  Not even a whole village can replicate them. 
As the people most responsible for and most equipped to discern
the needs of their children, parents must be accorded deference
in all matters of education.
<p>
Children in public and private schools
are taught by dedicated professionals, but only because the parents
consent to have these professionals participate in their education.
 No one but a parent can understand how parents feel about their
own children.  And I am talking about adoptive parents as well
as biological ones.
<p>
Mother Teresa described such devotion through
a firsthand observation at her clinic in Calcutta.  She said,
&quot;I'll never forget.  I gave a child to a Hindu family, and
after a few months, I heard the child became very, very sick,
and I sent for the family, and I told them, 'Give me back that
child.  I'll take care of the sick child, and I'll give you another
healthy child.'  The father looked at me and said, 'Mother, take
my life rather than take the child.'&quot;
<p>
Like this Indian father,
most parents would lay down their lives for their children, and
they are acutely aware of this responsibility.  So decisions about
what kind of information is conveyed to children or extracted
from them are the parents' natural prerogative.
<p>
Any research methods,
including surveys, that place a barrier between children and their
parents should be outlawed.  Increasingly, parents have found
themselves fighting for their most fundamental rights against
hostile educators and government officials who honestly believe
that they, not the parents, know what is best for the children.
<p>
Such officials work overtime to acquaint children with revisionist
history, graphic sexual materials, and relativistic notions of
morality, all in the name of research and education.
<p>
Often parents are unaware of what the children are receiving.  The 
concept of informed consent is faulty, because there are too many ways 
for it to fail, as Senator Grassley pointed out.  Parents are often
not given adequate information, and a teacher may send a child
home with an announcement about an upcoming survey, but unless
the parents signs a permission form, there is no way to determine
if the parent ever got the message.  As a parent myself, I can
tell you, those messages don't always get through.
<p>
And to those who argue that written requirements are cumbersome and 
expensive, a loss of parental freedom to determine a child's education is
a far higher cost, one that is unacceptable.
<p>
There are other ways
that information can be obtained on dangerous behaviors.  Documentation
of the numbers of cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies, sexually
transmitted diseases, suicides, drug overdoses, and the like is
readily available.
<p>
The drive to target all teens and children
because of the actions of the unfortunate few is a manifestation
of the educational dogma that information, in and of itself, with
no moral reference, can make a difference.
<p>
But two decades of
research have shown that giving youngsters more value-free information
about sex, for instance, has not resulted in any behavioral change
at all except perhaps earlier experimentation leading to more
problems.
<p>
With the advent of Goals 2000 and its emphasis on national
standards and accountability, the role of testing is becoming
paramount.  Outcome-based education as implemented by Goals 2000
moves schools away from the strictly academic and toward the production
of certain attitudes.  Consequently, the line is becoming blurred
between what is educational and what is therapeutic.
<p>
Parents are worried about surveys for two reasons. Some questionnaires 
reveal information that is nobody's business but that of the families,
and some questionnaires convey information to the children that
the parents would rather their children were not exposed to. 
<p>
The issue has been driven primarily by sex, suicide, and drug surveys
among young teens, some of which have been politically motivated
and manipulated.  A few years ago, a national youth survey on
sexuality contained questions that were so graphic that many parents
felt they were pornographic.
<p>
Concern over research on hapless
children has been driven by revelations of abuses by federally
funded researchers going as far back as the famous studies of
Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s.  It was under grants from the National
Research Council that Dr. Kinsey collected material for his famous
Kinsey report.
<p>
In that report, 317 children were reported to have
been subjected to sexual molestation and their responses recorded
in a graph table.  Nowhere is there evidence that parental consent
was given.  In fact, no one, not even parents, could give consent
for such acts.  But that didn't stop the Kinsey scientists.
<p>
Further documentation of this shameful episode of scientific abuse can
be found in the Family Research Council's new documentary, <i>The
Children of Table 34</i>, which I am donating and submitting for the
record.  It can also be found in <i>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud:  The Indoctrination
of a People</i> by Dr. Judith Reisman, Edward Eichel, with Drs. J.
Gordon Muir and John Court as editors.
<p>
Now, I am not suggesting
that the mere taking of a survey is equivalent to the kind of
abuse that Kinsey recorded, just that there is a temptation to
gather information because it can be done without asking whether
it should be done.
<p>
Surveys that ask questions about suicide or
drug use can plant the idea of either activity as an option, when
a teen may never have entertained this option.  For sheer repetition
of reference, harmful activities can lose their power to inspire
natural resistance.  After all, if a teen hears about this stuff,
a teen could conclude, &quot;If we're talking about it so much,
everybody must be doing it.  What's wrong with me?&quot;
<p>
Sex surveys, in and of themselves, are objectionable when directed toward 
children, and they are notoriously unreliable.  They are slanted towards
the unconventional.  People who indulge in unconventional sexuality
or precocious sexuality are far more interested in talking about
it.
<p>
Here's the dilemma for little Susie.  She responds to a question
that asks if she's a virgin.  If she answers yes, then she is
supposed to skip through several detailed questions about sexual
activities, such as how many partners she had had.  After an exercise
like that, she may feel like a sexual underachiever for having
kept herself chaste.
<p>
Teens are very peer conscious and can feel
left out and stigmatized for having to exempt themselves from
a battery of questions.
<p>
Likewise, if the onus is on the parent
to opt a child out of intrusive experiences, the possibility for
stigma is greater than if all parents have to opt their children
in with written consent.  Those who administer surveys are more
interested in high compliance than parental input, so they tend
to be opposed to such safeguards.  But parental rights have to
come first.
<p>
Family Research Council supports efforts like H.R.
1271 to safeguard the rights of parents to direct their children's
education and welfare, and that includes how, where, and when
children are included in research.  Parents are assigned that
task by no less an authority than God Himself.  It would be the
epitome of hubris to tamper with that bond because some educational
experts feel they are smarter than everybody else. Thank you.
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council.</i> I'm Kristi Hamrick, and we are here to present issues that 
affect your family, all American families, and the impact government
and social policies have on families today.
<p>
In fact, this week's show provides new scientific data on what Americans 
want for themselves, their families, and our country as a whole.  Tonight 
you will hear the exclusive results of the Family Research Council's 1995
Family Issues Survey, which delves into things like our current
welfare program, crime, divorce, and pop culture's influence on
you.
<p>
In fact, just yesterday, Family Research Council held a news
conference to release scientifically conducted poll data.  Although
major media from ABC, NBC, and PBS attended, these stories that
appeared couldn't cover all of what is the most pertinent about
this original work.  So, before we divulge into our findings,
let's take a look at what the newspapers and networks got to see
of our news conference as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind the 
Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">

<p><center><h4>Excerpt from News Conference</h4></center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I'm Kristi Hamrick, the Director
of Communications for the Family Research Council.  This is the
fourth annual Family Issues Poll.  Family Research Council, which
has had an interest in examining research of all kinds, likes
to participate in it as well, and sometimes I think we all know
that a number can say almost anything that you want it to say.
<p>
So we like to do our own numbers, take a look for ourselves at
where the people are in terms of their attitudes and values and
how do they see some of the reforms, from welfare reform to some
of the choices on abortion to some of the things about our culture
that really concern us.
<p>
So we have been doing polling under the
leadership of Bill Mattox, who is the Vice President for Policy,
who has been here in Washington quite a while and at FRC, I think,
10 years, and has been directing these polls.  So I would like
to invite him up to let you know where the country is today on
some really key family issues.  Bill, if you would come on up.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Thank you, Kristi. Today I am pleased to join Bob
Maginnis of our staff in releasing the findings of the Family
Research Council's 1995 Family Issues Survey.
<p>
Like other FRC polls that have preceded it, this year's survey addresses 
a wide range of questions that have cultural, public policy, and electoral
implications.  Indeed, the clear message of our 1995 survey is
that the catch phrase for the 1996 election year is unlikely to
be, &quot;It's the economy, Stupid.&quot;
<p>
Instead, many Americans perceive that our nation's most daunting problems 
stem from the fact that our nation's ship has lost its moral compass. This
is, I think, quite evident in a number of the findings of the
Family Research Council.
<p>
Kristi mentioned there was a significant
section of our poll that dealt with questions surrounding the
current welfare reform debate and, indeed, questions that I think
will become increasingly important as we see the budget battle
continue and as we see Congress increasingly move toward relimiting
government.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  We gave the statement and asked
for a comment.  The statement is:  &quot;The values promoted in
today's movies, on television, and in music lyrics do not represent
my views.&quot;  Seventy-five percent of all Americans agree with
that statement.
<p>
Now, possibly they agree -- and this is when we
asked even further about what would you do -- we found that clear
majorities of Americans would block out offensive material --
violence and sexually explicit material -- on cable television
and on computer networks.  As well, when we talk about cyberspace,
we also found, interestingly, that young women and older women
agree:  they don't want this sort of trash on our computer networks.
<p>
You know, we ask Americans -- and they are divided about this,
interestingly -- whether or not they can protect their kids from
the offensive nature of what's going on in our pop culture and
are they doing a good job.  Now, what we found is that 49 percent
said, &quot;Yes, we can protect our kids from the ravages of the
pop culture.&quot;  Forty-nine percent said, &quot;No, we can't.&quot;
 Forty-nine percent -- maybe the same first 49 percent -- said,
&quot;We're doing a good job.  We're monitoring the shows, we're
monitoring the music lyrics, and we're protecting our kids.&quot;
 But 49 percent said, &quot;We aren't.&quot;
<p>
We found that one-third
of all single moms and one-third of all divorcees say that they
can do the job.  But 61 percent, almost two-thirds, said, &quot;We
need help.  We cannot do this by ourselves.  We need possibly
government, possibly community activities, possibly even the industry,
to jump in and do the right thing.&quot;
<p>
We found that more than nine out of ten parents oppose public libraries 
giving objectionable materials such as <i>Playboy</i> magazine to young children 
without parental consent.  Then we found about nine out of ten Americans wanted
parents to have a veto power over the materials that any child
-- their child -- would take out of library, specifically because
parents are concerned about the moral guidance of their children,
and also, quite frankly, they are liable for the materials that
their child might check out of the local library.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: With that, we'll throw it open for any questions anyone may 
have. Yes?
<p>
QUESTION:  Is there a reason why you didn't focus on education
and the role of school?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, actually, we have done
a lot of education research in the past.  Last year's survey --
and this did not get the kind of pickup that it should have --
last year's survey found that younger parents -- that is, parents
of preschoolers and of early elementary school-aged kids -- tend
to support school choice to a significantly larger degree than
do parents of older children.
<p>
I think there are all kinds of reasons
why this might be so.  They may be less subtle in neighborhoods
that are -- and may have yet to even buy a house -- and since
we know that housing is quite often closely tied to school districts,
that could be part of the reason.
<p>
I think in many ways younger parents may perceive that the school can more 
likely have a positive effect on a potentially troubled child than that the 
potentially troubled child might have a negative effect on the school culture;
whereas, with older children, the opposite may be true, that many
perceive that a troubled teenager is more likely to be a corrupting
influence in a school than to benefit from some type of school
environment, having a positive effect on it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we'll be joined by Bill Mattox 
and Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis, the two FRC staff members who spearheaded
the development and analysis of this year's poll, to bring you
the results.  Stayed tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are presenting the 1995 Family Issues Survey results
and FRC's top 10 list of findings, as detailed by our guests,
Family Research Council Vice President for Policy Bill Mattox
and Policy Analyst Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis.  Welcome,
gentlemen.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  This was a very impressive product.  How long did it take 
to put together?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, we started the process back in the summer,
identifying some different questions that we wanted to ask, including
some that we have asked before in previous years.  We then put
together the questionnaire during the course of September and
worked then with our pollster in kind of fine-tuning that.
<p>
He went to the field in October, and we then spent really much of
the month since then analyzing the results, writing up the report,
getting graphics coordinated with Valerie Stambaugh of our staff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, a product like this -- we have heard of Gallup
polls, we have heard of Worthland(?) polls.  Any difference between
the poll that Family Research Council did and anything you might
see on the evening news?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: No.  We, much like they,
surveyed 1,000 Americans, randomly selected by telephone, and
asked them a series of questions that they then responded to.
 So it was very, very similar to the kind of thing that you would
see on an evening newscast.
<p>
In fact, some of the CNN polls or other polls that you might see that some 
of the networks do quite often only surveyed 500 Americans and so, therefore, 
don't actually have the same accuracy that ours would.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the things I know people look at is, is this the kind of 
thing I can depend on?  We're going to talk to people later about getting
a copy of this.  But when they look at this, they could depend
on this as well as they can depend on any other numbers that they
might find?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I would say so.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Yes, I would think so.  You know, we look at polls all 
the time in writing the papers that we write, and the numbers here really
corroborate what we have seen on virtually every other national
poll.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to talk about what we've seen.
 Let's begin to count down Family Research Council's top 10 findings
in the 1995 Family Issues Survey.  Number 10:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER: Family breakdown and moral decline are fueling perceptions 
America is on the &quot;wrong track.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Family breakdown. So, tell me, we're talking about being right 
track, wrong track. Why do people think that?  What kind of went into the 
development of that number?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, the first question in every
single poll we have ever done is, &quot;Do you think that America
is on the right track or on the wrong track?  Are we moving in
the right direction or not?&quot;  And what we found this year
is that a significant proportion of the American public -- roughly
two-thirds -- say things are headed in the wrong direction.
<p>
What was really interesting is we followed this question up with a
second question that says, &quot;Why?&quot;  Because, typically,
that right track/wrong track question, the answer to it has closely
tracked the economy, and if the economy was going in the right
direction, Americans said the country was going in the right direction.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Kind of a guaranteed connection, wasn't it?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Exactly.  This year what we found is that when we asked
people, &quot;Why are things off on the wrong track?&quot; it
is not, they think, because of economic problems -- 18 percent
said that that was the primary reason -- but the vast majority
said, instead, that the primary reason why they think things are
going in the wrong direction is because of the breakdown of the
family and the decline in values in our society.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Did you find that surprising, given the relative stability 
of the economy?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Yes, I think it really is interesting
that you have this divergence between these two questions that
had always in the past gone hand-in-glove.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In terms of what you are seeing, Bob, your area takes a look 
at a lot of crime and cultural issues.  Do you think that that underscores
the need to continue to look at those kinds of areas?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, clearly, you know, the last Presidential election
was about &quot;the economy, Stupid,&quot; and now it is really
what is happening in the cities and in the suburbs of our country.
 And if we don't do something to turn around the violent crime
epidemic, especially amongst the youth, then we are going to find
that no telling where this country is going to go.
<p>
So we have to turn that around.  That is why I think parents or single 
people throughout this country understand that we are indeed on the wrong
track.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to keep looking at what track
we are on.  To continue our countdown, let's look at finding number
9:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER: Adoption is viewed as the best response.
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER: And abortion is viewed as the worst response to an unwed
pregnancy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Very surprising findings when it comes
to the issue of abortion.  We hear all the time that Americans
worldwide are clamoring for more abortion, people worldwide, but
our finding found that abortion was not the knee-jerk response
of people to an unexpected pregnancy.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Oh, no. In fact, our polling suggests that the majority of the 
American public are clearly anti-abortion.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kinds of numbers did you get on that, though?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, we asked people, we said, &quot;Look, imagine a young girl 
who is unmarried, teenager. She's pregnant out of wedlock.  What do you think 
she should do? Should she abort the child, put it up for adoption, marry
the child's father, or should she bear the child and keep it herself?&quot;
<p>
What we found is that the American public generally said adoption
is the best option.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: And that, closely following that, marrying the child's father is 
the second-best option.  And interestingly there, there were a lot
of men, both married and single, who regarded marrying the child's
father as the best option.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Many people think that men think abortion is the best option.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Oh, yes. I mean, that, I think -- I would have expected most 
men to say marriage is the last thing we want considered here.  But instead,
we found just the opposite.
<p>
When we asked, &quot;What would be the best thing that she could do?&quot; 
abortion ranked at the bottom.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  When we turned the question around and said, &quot;What do you 
think would be the worst thing that she could do?&quot; a clear majority said
abortion is the worst thing that she could do in that kind of
situation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Did you see breakdowns in ages or by
race or anything like that, or was it primarily a break between
male and female?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, most of this kind of standard
rank order held true across virtually every demographic group
that you could find.  There were some notable differences on the
basis of gender, with men being more likely to support marriage,
women more likely to support adoption, and their second choice
-- at least the choice of single women -- their second choice
was for single motherhood.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: And then third was marrying the child's father.  But abortion,
on everybody's scorecard, ranked last.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So, ladies, there is hope for you.  Marriage was at the top of 
the men's list. Okay, let's see now finding number 8:
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER: Most Americans, including rank-and-file pro-lifers, strongly 
oppose subsidizing illegitimate births.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Strongly oppose. That's interesting, because the budget debate 
now, you would think, listening to the President and some of the Democratic 
members of the House and Senate, that people are out there saying, &quot;I 
want welfare just as it is.&quot;  But you do not find it?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: No. In fact, I think it is a reflection of some of the 
resistance to single motherhood and the perception that many people have
that government programs help to encourage illegitimacy; that
they do not want to see increases in the size of one's welfare
check if they have additional children out of wedlock.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's interesting.  Do you think that, in terms of 
compassion -- you saw people saying basically, &quot;I am concerned about
subsidizing the lifestyle,&quot; or, &quot;I think there are better
ways to be compassionate.&quot;  What did you see in the numbers?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: I think one of the things that we saw throughout
this was that there is a compassionate impulse on the part of
many Americans, but there is also, I think, a recognition that
government programs quite often undercut that compassionate impulse
and encourage the kind of behavior that actually causes people
to find it that much more difficult to lead healthy, productive
lives.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Does this surprise you?  Bob, you watch the
Hill, as well as all of us.  As we are watching the whole welfare
reform debate, were you surprised to see the direction that Americans
were tilting?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  No, not really.  I think most
Americans are disenchanted with the current welfare system.  But
I was surprised that the numbers are absolutely high in regard
to especially the most religious part of our culture.  They were
saying, you know, fathers need to take more responsibility.  We
don't need to subsidize more illegitimate children.  What we need,
obviously, is to reinforce the family and reinforce marriage in
this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right, which is sort of an interesting
Family Research Council theme.  It is nice to hear that we are
consistently right on that.
<p>
We have a lot of other findings to come, but one last thing.  Do you 
think that this will be helpful in FRC's work on the Hill?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: I do, especially on the
question about the family cap, because, as you know, there has
been a debate between pro-lifers.  A lot of our friends have said,
&quot;You know, we really ought not to limit these welfare checks,
because we might encourage abortion.&quot;
<p>
Others have said, &quot;No. We've got to tackle unwed pregnancy, because 
those are the girls that are quite often having the abortions.&quot; I 
think this polling data, especially since pro-lifers --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It kinds of pulls it together.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: -- were supportive, I think, may help us to break that impasse.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Great. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to hear 
more of this impressive kind of data.  We are going to continue with our 
top-10 countdown and bring you more details.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. We are in the middle of looking at Family Research Council's
scientific and original Family Issues Poll.  We are ready for
finding number 7.
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER:  Most believe that preventative
strategies aimed at curbing out-of-wedlock pregnancies are better
than those strategies aimed at promoting workfare.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So work is supposed to be better, in the eyes of most 
Americans, according to the White House, according to a lot of congressional
things.  But what you have found out was that in fact that whole
saving-sex concept ranks higher.  I found that a little surprising.
 Were you all?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I think this one really did surprise
me, because it is clear that Americans do believe that welfare
recipients, all things being equal, ought to work for their benefits.
 But when we asked them, &quot;Do you think that is the best strategy,
a remedial strategy after people are already on welfare, that
we ought to focus our attention on trying to get them off, or
should we be focusing perhaps more of our attention on trying
to prevent the need in the first place by discouraging out-of-wedlock
pregnancy and seeing if we can't keep people off welfare?&quot;
<p>
And, lo and behold, folks said, &quot;Yes, we really think this
is where our energy ought to go, in part because we think that
this problem may actually be easier to solve than the problem
of getting people off welfare once they are on.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.  It seems to be a conclusion they have come to 
without a lot of support from the media.  Certainly the workfare kinds
of ideas, from Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin to other states, get
a lot of attention, while marriage alternatives don't.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Yes, and I think it is important that people understand, we 
are not suggesting that we don't think workfare is a good idea.  We
obviously think that the welfare reform package on the Hill, which
includes a significant workfare package, makes sense.
<p>
All we are suggesting here is that maybe the question here is a little 
bit more complicated or a little bit bigger than many would like to
kind of limit the debate only to this safe territory over here,
talking about work, without getting into some of these thorny
issues about how do we discourage out-of-wedlock sex.  And yet
what our finding suggests is that the American people really want
a focus on encouraging abstinence and encouraging people to avoid
out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, what is interesting
about this number is it almost has implications into the title
X, which is the government's abstinence, saving sex, proposals,
versus title -- well, actually it is title X, which is the bad
side of the coin, the condom distribution, compared to title XX,
which is saving sex.
<p>
We spend one dollar in ten on saving sex
and do a lot on condom distribution, and yet this is a whole study
saying we think we need to focus our whole welfare reform even
more on saving sex.
<p>
Do you think this is a message the Hill is ready to hear?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  I doubt they are ready to hear
yet, but we clearly need to be sending a very clear message that
children, whether they are 12 -- and in some cases we have children
12 years old having children in this country, unfortunately --
or they are 28, and if they are not married, they shouldn't be
engaging in activities that are going to lead, obviously, to more
children, because children raising children is not a good idea.
<p>
But whether it is title X or title XX, our government needs to,
in my opinion, back out of the business of promoting sex and get
into the business of promoting abstinence.  You know, there was
an interesting profile --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That kind of promotion is going to be key, I think, in 
what the Family Research Council does.  But let's move on with our poll 
just a second.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of promoting sex, we are going to get back to that 
later, but right now, finding number 6:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER:  The religiously devout are more apt to give
and volunteer and say they would do more if government welfare
programs were dramatically cut or abolished.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In some ways, the sex number and the religiously devout number 
tie together, do they not?  People saying attitudes and the kinds
of people that we raise our children to be are really significant,
and they see the religiously devout as being good citizens.  What
did you find to be interesting about that finding?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, I think the thing that is hopeful here is that if we do
see a cutback in welfare programs, or perhaps even the abolition
of the government welfare state, we have religiously devout Americans
saying, &quot;We are prepared to pick up the slack.&quot;
<p>
What is impressive, I think, about that sort of offer, if you will,
is the fact that if you look at what individuals who are attending
church weekly are already doing, they are already giving to charities
at a higher level and volunteering in various charitable endeavors
at a higher level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is interesting, isn't it? By what amount are you finding 
the people of faith to be more involved in their community?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, what we found is that if you look, for example, at 
giving to charitable organizations, that nearly 100 percent of those 
who attend church weekly say that they made more than one gift at some point 
during the last 12 months.  For the general population, the number was in the
mid-80s.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  So the difference is not that substantial, though I suspect that 
if you were to ask the question in terms of dollar amounts or percentage of 
income or things of that nature, some of these differences would prove
to be even greater.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And it is interesting, too, isn't it, because there is a lot of 
media information out there that would indicate that people of faith aren't 
the best citizens. You certainly get that from movies like <i>Cape Fear</i> 
to whatever: when faith comes up, it's negative.
<p>
We are going to come back in a moment with finding number 5.  We are going 
to look forward to telling you that in just a second.  Please join us in 
looking at finding number 5:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER:  Even members of Generation X believe today's popular culture 
encourages teen sex, violence, and drug use.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Why did you find that to be -- well,
Bill, you are laughing.  You will have to tell us a little bit
about that.  But that was a very quirky number, wasn't it?  Where
did all that came into that come from?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, I will let him answer why first, because he was 
laughing more than I was.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I am just tickled with some of our staff members who are helping 
to tell the story today.
<p>
But, no, here I think what is interesting is this:  When we asked
people, &quot;Do you think that the popular cultural influences
are positive or negative?  Do they encourage out-of-wedlock sex?
 Do they encourage drug use?  Do they encourage violence?&quot;
 I don't know that it is altogether that surprising that the general
public -- parents, especially -- say, &quot;Hey, this is harmful
stuff.&quot;
<p>
But I think it is rather interesting that those in
that 20-something generation -- 18- to 29-year-olds -- say, &quot;Hey,
we agree.&quot;  The levels of agreement are not quite as large,
but there is, nevertheless, a strong majority that are prepared
to say that we believe that these kinds of influences are negative;
that they do encourage these types of behavior; and that the values
in pop culture really don't reflect our own.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But for kids to say that, though, that seems even more 
startling, I mean that they would acknowledge, &quot;You're right. I 
watch this stuff.  I am more likely to have sex, do drugs, you know,
check out whatever the song is talking about.&quot;
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: But even when we asked the 18- to 30-year-olds, they 
came back and they told us in large  majorities that what they are seeing
on the pop culture is not reflective of who they are, of what
their family is all about.  And they are upset about that.  And
I think that that sends a clear message to our Congress that maybe
we need to consider the types of violence, the type of drug promotion,
the type of teen sexuality that is being pushed into the living
rooms of every American home today and start to rein some of that
in.
<p>
You know, what happened with Time Warner this past summer
with regard to rap music -- you know, we start to recognize that
those messages are not promoting the sorts of things that we want
healthy Americans to be all about.
<p>
So we need to be involved, not only as a government but as a people, showing 
that our pocketbook can influence large corporations that are promoting this 
stuff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Helping people make good decisions.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Hopefully.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now it is time for us to see finding number 4. Please watch.
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER: Single parents say families need help shielding their kids 
from harmful cultural influences.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is an very interesting number, and it kind
of ties into some earlier poll data from the Family Research Council
in terms of single parents seem to be the most pro-family in some
ways.  What are you finding as we are tracking single parents
over the years?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, if you look at this question,
it begins to make sense when you consider that a lot of single
parents are trying to do the work of two and cannot be there to
monitor their children's behavior at every moment.  And so when
the kids come home in the afternoons to an empty house, yes, the
chances of their getting involved in some type of incident in
the neighborhood or something are probably greater.  The chances
of possibly getting hold of some pornographic video to pop in
the VCR or something like that are greater.
<p>
So I think in many ways the lack of adult supervision is something that 
many single parents feel very acutely, and they say, &quot;Hey, look. 
We don't think that the job that we are being asked to do is one
that we can do alone.  We do need societal community support.
 We need, for example, public libraries to respect&quot; --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Be a little more discreet.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: -- &quot;yes, and respect our wishes; that we don't want 
pro-homosexual or <i>Playboy</i> or other types of materials available 
to our kids without some type of shield.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What is interesting about that is the knee-jerk ACLU 
reaction to parents saying, &quot;I'm concerned,&quot; is, &quot;Look, 
it's your problem. Deal with it. You need to be the monitor.&quot;  
But with single parents, they've got all that they can do to handle.
<p>
Bob, you have been working with a lot of single-parent issues.  What do 
you see on that?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, clearly, the single-parent issue
is dynamite, given the illegitimacy rate, given the whole welfare
 debate that we have today, and the out-of-wedlock birth issue.
<p>
But when we looked at the entire population, America is split
in half on can we deal with this; and parents are saying, well
-- half of them say yes and half of them say no.  And then when
we ask the question, &quot;Are you monitoring your children?&quot;
half say, &quot;Yes, well, we are watching the same television,
we are watching the music videos, and so forth.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: They are trying.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  But the other half say no, they aren't doing a very 
good job. And so we have a country that apparently is just divided down the 
middle in regard to this whole issue, and we need to pay close attention to 
it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And it is incredibly stressful for the people in that 
situation. That is the saddest thing. Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Following this commercial
break, we will be back and counting down to the number one Family
Issues Survey finding.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>, and we are rolling down to FRC's number one
finding in our top-10 list resulting from analysis of the 1994
or 1995 Family Issues Survey.  The survey experts, Bill Mattox
and Bob Maginnis, are here helping me count down.  So let's see
what our next result is as we count down to number 3:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER: Most Americans strongly support increasing tax benefits 
for families raising children and want this relief to remain permanent.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I am not so surprised that people want tax benefits.
 I am a little surprised maybe by the budget debate where that
seems to be the one thing everyone is suggesting we get rid of.
 How do you think these two things come together in the budget
debate?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, the encouraging news here is that people
don't just want tax relief, but they see the need for tax relief
for families with children, and of course, we have been talking,
really, till we're blue in the face, saying, &quot;Hey, look at
the way in which the tax code, over the last 40 or 50 years, has
dramatically increased the tax burden on parents.  Shouldn't we
do something with that?&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kind of numbers did you get?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, what we found is that when you put
this to the American people, roughly 8 in 10 say yes, you know,
this really ought to be done.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Wow!
<p>
MR. MATTOX: What is impressive about that is that support for pro-family 
tax relief is even higher than that for the flat tax, which is something
else that we polled here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What did you find on the flat tax?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  The flat tax generally had numbers in the
mid-50s range for the entire population.  Now, among, say, Republicans,
it was in the 70 percent range.  But this number here on pro-family
tax relief was consistent in the high 70s across the board, and
again, the point there that we want to have this tax relief made
permanent, not simply some sort of gimmick that you get this year
but you don't get the following year, but instead, something that
is in the tax code permanently that solves this problem once and
for all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I think what is interesting about that
is the <i>Washington Post</i> on Sunday and other esteemed members of
the media have been indicating that we should get rid of this
tax relief; if just -- if it wasn't for that tax relief, everything
would be great with the budget.  But 80 percent of Americans say
that they want that, and they want it permanently.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: That's right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How do you think that some of the
people who are discussing this could better connect with the public
on that?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Listen to the polls.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But, clearly, you know, as Bill points out, they favor permanent
tax relief.  They don't want a temporary tax cut right now if
they are going to get something permanent long range, because
we recognize we have a deficit in this country that has to be
serviced, and if we don't take care of that now, we are going
to be in trouble a few years from now.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, and I think the key message here for those who are 
trying to cut the size of government is to link those cuts in government 
spending to tax cuts and to say, Look, instead of going out and spending
money for all these programs that really aren't doing a good job,
we are going to instead give the money back to the people who
earned it and let them use it to buy their kids braces or to fund
a family vacation or to put food on the table.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is what is kind of interesting about this, isn't it? 
Families in America are really taxed.  You are taxed a higher rate when
you have small children than if you had no children, and then
later you are taxed for a marriage penalty if you are married.
 And then, frankly, your children are going to pay for the things
that somebody else chose to spend.
<p>
I mean, do you think that these kinds of numbers could indicate a stronger 
stand is possible here in Washington on this issue?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, you are right in saying that these are extremely important 
issues, because even though they don't perhaps directly influence behavior, 
they certainly do indirectly.
<p>
I don't know too many people who sit down and say,
well, &quot;Let's have us another kid, because that will give
us a tax break of X amount or whatever.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's right.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  But when people see that, gosh, you know,
it really is difficult to make ends meet, it quite often does
cause them to say, &quot;I'm not sure that we can afford to send
our kid to private school.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It's a concern.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're almost there, but let's hear first finding number 2:
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER:  Most believe that divorce laws should protect the spouse 
that wants to save the marriage.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Divorce reform is getting a lot of interest
at the state level.  Family Research Council does not favor a
federal policy; we would like to keep the government out of that.
 But there is a lot of empathy out there for people trying to
keep a marriage together, despite all the different movie evidence
to the contrary.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Yes, well, we are approaching a 50 percent divorce 
rate in this country with every new marriage, and it is devastating what 
is going on.  As you indicate, every state in this country, or most states, 
have laws that protect the spouse that is seeking the divorce and not the 
spouse that wants to salvage the marriage.  We asked and found out that more
than half of Americans want to change that, want to turn that
around.
<p>
We also found, interestingly, that in cases where adultery
is involved, or abuse, that more than three out of four Americans
say that the spouse that is not guilty of that offense should
get the custody of the children; and, also, more than half of
Americans say that for the non-philandering spouse, that person
should get more than half of whatever is left of the couple's
property.
<p>
So they are sending a very clear message that we want
to protect people that want to keep together and keep their marriage
going, because they understand how devastating this can be to
children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In America, it would seem that the marriage
contract is the only thing that can be unilaterally exited from.
 Everything else, we have to at least sit down and have a discussion.
<p>
Very quickly, Bill, what are one or two divorce reforms that Family
Research Council favors?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, the State of Michigan is doing the very kind of thing 
that we were polling about here, which is to say that they have a piece 
of legislation before the state legislature there that says, in cases 
where a spouse wants to work things out, instead of the law tilting in 
favor of the one who wants to leave, the law will instead tilt in the 
other's favor and will require fault to be shown on their part in order
for the one who wants to leave to leave.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We could see some changes in the law.
<p>
And now, our number one Family Issues Survey finding:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER:  Like other Americans, blacks support get-tough 
measures to combat crime.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Every poll -- Family Research Council's included -- 
would indicate that crime is at the top of the things that people are 
concerned about. And yet you all found this number interesting because of 
some of the rhetoric that came out of the O.J. Simpson trial.  What
did you find interesting about this number?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, in the aftermath of the O.J., the message was 
that black citizens are not concerned about crime in this country, and that
is completely wrong.  We found in great numbers that black Americans
are very, very concerned about crime.
<p>
Specifically, they want restitution paid to the victims of these heinous 
crimes. We also found that they want criminals who are incarcerated to work.
They aren't out there to enjoy being in a health spa or watch
TV; they are there to work.
<p>
Now, part of the problem has been -- and we need maybe some legislation 
here -- is that only 9 percent of the incarcerated people in this country now 
have gainful employment where they could possibly earn money so they could 
pay restitution to the victims.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Nine percent, you say?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Nine percent.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A very low number.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, there are some reasons.  You know, after
all, most Americans who are law-abiding don't want to give up
good jobs, their good jobs, so that somebody that is a felon in
jail, so that they can earn money to pay their victims.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: But at the same time, there
should be some way in which we can find alternatives.  And there
are some that are out there today.
<p>
We also found that black Americans want drug testing of criminals before 
they are released.  Why? Because a third of all people going into prison 
committed their crimes while they were either intoxicated with alcohol or 
they were using a now-illicit drug.
<p>
So we don't want people that are inebriated or potentially drunks, and so 
forth, to get back on the streets and to just ravage our communities. 
And black Americans, after all, are the most victimized people in this 
country. Their sons and daughters are the ones that are going to jail the 
most. But yet they understand.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is interesting; I mean, the numbers would indicate that 
they have a very clear understanding of the cost of crime in their communities. 
<p>
We have about 15 seconds left, Bill. When you take a look at Family Research 
Council's crime proposals, what do you see from this poll that can help
people have a more crime-free America?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, one of the other items that we included on the poll 
questionnaire was, &quot;What do you think of the legalization of drugs?&quot;
and found that the overwhelming majority of Americans, including
once again black Americans, say we don't want drugs legalized; we want,
instead, for illicit drugs to remain off limits to young people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Very timely, especially given our past surgeon general's
exit.  And I am afraid we are going to have to exit shortly, too.
<p>
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> presents Gary Bauer, president of
the Family Research Council, as he shares his views today with
the American press corps.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. FRC staff every week is involved in events to promote
strong families and inform people about the status of real Americans.
<p>
Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, recently
held a foreign press briefing to share his views with an international
audience. <i>Straight Talk</i> now brings you Gary Bauer in the Family
Research Council's Home Front News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
MR. BAUER:  First of all, I would like to thank everybody
for coming here today.  There's a lot of news breaking in Washington,
D.C., so I fully expected to come over here and perhaps chat with
one of you.  So I am pleased that some of you could fit this into
your schedules.
<p>
I would like to just make a couple of brief comments
about American politics and about America at the end of this century
and then find out what is on your mind about things going on in
Washington.
<p>
This is sort of an ironic time for the United States.
 My oldest daughter just went off to college a few months ago,
and she spent the summer reading and re-reading some of the old
classics that she thought that she would have to be familiar with
in an American university.
<p>
One of the books she re-read was <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> by Charles 
Dickens. You may remember that at the beginning of the book, there is 
this wonderful line: &quot;It was the best of times and it was the worst 
of times.&quot;
<p>
I found myself thinking as I saw the book that that is a great 
description of the United States in 1995, even though it was written 
about Great Britain and France many years ago.
<p>
There are a lot of reasons that Americans can be very happy in 1995. It 
has been a very successful century for the United States.  We have 
prevailed in several major world conflicts.  I think it is not an 
exaggeration to say that we have won the Cold War, at great sacrifice to 
the American people, both financially and also with the blood of their
sons in places over the years.
<p>
The American economy goes through all the cycles economies always go 
through. There are ups and downs, and so forth.  But if I would have 
brought my Ross Perot charts with me today, I could show you an economy 
that, since 1900, has produced more jobs for more people and more opportunity
than any system in the world.
<p>
There are great medical breakthroughs, technological breakthroughs. There 
are a lot of reasons for Americans to feel good about themselves and about 
their country.
<p>
But, ironically, for about 10 years now, when the pollsters ask 
the American people how they feel, two-thirds of them say that America 
is headed in the wrong direction.  They said that when George Bush was in the
White House, and they are saying it when Bill Clinton is in the
White House.  They said it when the Democrats controlled the Congress,
and they are saying it now that my friends, the Republicans, are
controlling the Congress.
<p>
I don't believe, when they say that we are headed in the wrong direction, 
that they are thinking about the economy or about the military or about other 
issues that tend to grab the headlines.  I think Americans are making a 
comment about the heart and soul of their country, about its culture.
<p>
I think that most experts, when they try to measure a great nation,
look at the obvious things:  the size of its economy, the strength
of its military, the gleam of its cities.  That is one way to
measure a great country, and certainly by those measurements I
think the United States would have to be judged a great world
power.
<p>
But you can also measure a country by the strength of its
families, by what its culture -- the values its culture passes
on.  You can measure a nation by how many of its children cry
themselves to sleep at night.  And I think that in the United
States in 1995, today, too many children will cry themselves to
sleep because they have been abandoned by fathers who aren't there,
because they have been exploited in a number of ways.  And I think
by those measurements my country is in danger of being something
less than a great nation.
<p>
Now, politicians are notoriously uncomfortable talking about 
these kinds of issues.  They would much rather talk
about marginal tax rates and whether the food stamp program ought
to have $1 billion or $1.2 billion.
<p>
But my feeling is that these are much grander issues and much more 
important issues than the others I just mentioned, and that even though 
politicians don't talk about these issues a great deal, I believe the 
American voter is deeply worried about these things and has in recent years 
been indirectly voting on these issues.
<p>
Now, I think that fact has benefitted my party. I obviously am a Republican. 
I served with Ronald Reagan for eight years and have been active in the 
Republican Party for a long time, and I think that, generally speaking, many
voters, particularly evangelicals in the southern United States
and Catholics in the Midwest, have tended to identify these issues
of values and culture with the Republican Party and have tended,
rightly or wrongly, to identify hostility to traditional values
with the Democratic Party.  And I think, as a result of that,
the Democrats have had a very difficult time keeping otherwise
historically loyal voting blocs in their camp.
<p>
I believe that, on through 1996 and into the next century, this is going 
to be the great debate in America.  It is going to be a debate about
liberty and how you use it, the relationship of liberty to virtue,
and it is going to be a debate about the simple question of how
it is that free men and women live their lives; and that this
is perhaps one of the most important debates that any country
and any nation can possibly have.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break. Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us here at <i>Straight Talk</i>. If
you would like to receive a copy of Family Research Council's

<p>
I hope you will be with us next week when we summarize what Congress,
as they enter their break, has been doing over the past few months
with your money.  See you then when we return with more <i>Straight

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm Kristi Hamrick, your host.  And you might say we're going 
to have a board report today on whether the business of government, which
runs on your money, has been working for the American family.
<p>
The Family Research Council works closely with Members of Congress
working to influence key decisions that affect the family, which
is that foundational unit bound by marriage, blood, and adoption.
<p>
Today we will discuss vital issues brought before the House and
Senate, such as pro-family tax relief and the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act.  We will also be looking ahead toward issues in 1996
that could adversely or positively affect the American family's
future.
<p>
First, though, let's see what Gary Bauer, president of
the Family Research Council, has to say about the monumental issues
facing us this week, both nationally and internationally.  This
is his perspective, brought to you without a journalist's bias
as a filter.  Gary Bauer instead takes you straight Behind the
Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Gary, we just saw the great &quot;train wreck&quot; here 
in Washington, D.C., over the budget, and frankly, it doesn't seem like it 
was that bad.  What is your perspective on what just happened in the
budget debate?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Kristi, this is really the great untold
story.  We had all the build-up to this incredible emergency the
country was supposed to face if Washington closed down.  Washington
did close down, and I think most Americans went about their lives
pretty much uninterrupted.
<p>
Now, there was some inconvenience. If you were a tourist here, the major 
tourist attractions were closed. I saw in the paper that the Grand Canyon 
was closed. That raised some questions in my mind:  How do you close the
Grand Canyon?
<p>
But at any rate, I think most Americans still got
their social security checks, their Veterans Affairs checks, and
so forth, and I think it actually was a lesson that there is a
lot of waste in Washington that we can do without, and most of
the world and most of America really won't notice if we make those
cuts.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It has been very interesting in the budget
debate how so many people, liberal Democrats and the <i>Washington
Post</i>, are saying, really, the Republicans and the Democrats are
so close.  If we could just be reasonable over some things like
pro-family tax relief, let's just get that off the table.  What
is your perspective on whether it is reasonable to get rid of
pro-family tax relief?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  No, that is outrageous.  I mean, when you look at the last 30 
or 35 years, the average American family has had stagnant income.  Literally, 
income growth has barely kept up with inflation.  So the average family today 
is at the same place that family was 25 years ago.
<p>
But if you look at government and their growth in resources, their growth 
has been through the roof.  They've gotten more and more money from
more and more American citizens in the form of taxes each year
than they have had the year before.
<p>
The whole country is tightening their belt; Washington is on a consumption 
spree. That is exactly backwards.  The tax cut is the one thing that ought 
to stay, and the budget cuts have to be implemented.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: This Friday, Gary, you are scheduled to be on <i>Larry King Live</i>, 
talking about a political roundup, and James Carville(?), the President's 
advisor, is going to be one of the guests.  In the <i>Washington Post</i> 
this week, he was saying that this budget debate is good for Democrats.
 Do you agree with Mr. Carville?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I don't agree with Carville on much, but I understand why he is 
taking that position. Unfortunately, the polling data is showing that the 
majority of Americans, probably because of what they have been told in
the media, have sided with President Clinton's handling of this
budget crisis.
<p>
Now, Kristi, keep in mind, these are the same Americans
that, one year ago, voted overwhelmingly for fiscal responsibility,
cutting down the size of Washington, for less government, less
bureaucracy, less regulations.  And now, one year later, they
seem to be saying the exact opposite in these polls.
<p>
I don't know how all that is going to play out, but I think Carville, 
unfortunately, has some reasons to crow right now that he and the other 
handlers of President Clinton have managed to position the President to
look good in all of this; but in fact all Clinton is doing is
supporting more spending, higher taxes, and all the things that
I think most Americans are against.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Obviously, Gary, the top news story this week is Bosnia.  A 
lot of the news commentators over the weekend said that Clinton can't go to 
the Congress with budget demands and Bosnia demands and expect both to be 
met. Do you think that the budget battle puts Clinton over the barrel?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I see the argument, but I don't agree with it.  The
President has made it clear he is going to send the troops to
Bosnia regardless of what the Congress does.  So it really doesn't
make any difference what Bob Dole or Newt Gingrich say about this.
<p>
Now, it is true that the Congress could cut off funds for the
troops in Bosnia.  I quite frankly think that would be a mistake
politically as well as a mistake for those men whose lives are
on the line.  Anything you do to try to get at Clinton on this
issue will be interpreted by the President and the press as cutting
out the ground from underneath the young men and women that are
going to be put in harm's way.
<p>
So I think we need to keep being critical of the President's program on 
Bosnia. I think we need to ask hard questions.  But I also think we have to 
make it absolutely clear that once American soldiers are committed that we 
will stand behind them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What pitfalls do you see for the President
and the nation in the Bosnia conflict?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Well, you know, Harry Truman said a long time ago, 
&quot;The buck stops here,&quot; meaning the Presidency.  Bill Clinton 
ought to be aware of the fact that it is very easy, as Commander-in-Chief, 
to commit American soldiers in all sorts of places.  It is very hard to 
extricate them with honor once you've gotten them in a fix.
<p>
If you put 20,000 or 30,000 men on the ground in Bosnia, and a year from 
now there isn't peace, then getting out of Bosnia while maintaining the
credibility of the United States is going to be very tough, and
at that point the American people, I believe, and public opinion
generally will turn on the President.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: At the end of the Bosnia debate, do you think that Americans 
will be more in favor or less in favor of women in combat?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I think, long term, Americans are going to be in favor of the 
ability of women to join the military and serve in support positions. But
I think once Americans see young women, their daughters, coming
home in body bags, I believe at that point public opinion will
turn against this idea of complete equality in combat of women
and men.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you very much for being with us,
Gary.  We look forward to seeing you next week.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we will be joined 
by Marty Dannenfelser, who knows just about all there is to know 
about congressional happenings in Washington, and he will share that 
insight with us.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As the year comes to a close, we are that
much closer to April 15, taxes, a word that can send chills down
the spine especially for lower and middle-class families, who
often bear the brunt of our country's current tax system.
<p>
Forty years ago, the average family paid one dollar in 50 in taxes;
today, it is an average of one dollar in four, and rising.  For
that reason, advancing pro-family tax relief has been an FRC goal
since its creation in 1981.
<p>
In early 1995, the House finally passed a tax relief package containing 
key elements which benefit American families.
<p>
[Scene from the floor of the House of Representatives]
<p>
CONGRESSMAN:  When we wrote the Contract with America, we said
we agree with the American people that the Federal Government
is too big and takes too much of their hard-earned money.
<p>
The average family today pays more in taxes than it does in food,
shelter, and clothing combined.  Most households have a second
wage earner, not to support the family but to support the government.
 And, Mr. Chairman, starting today, relief is on the way.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
[Conclusion of House floor scene.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The package included:
<p><ul>
<li>The $500-per-child tax credit
<li>An adoption tax credit
<li>Marriage penalty relief
<li>A credit for the care of an elderly parent
<li>Expanded individual retirement accounts
</ul><p>
With the package, the seven-year budget resolution also passed, providing 
$353 billion in overall tax relief.  It seemed that families were on the 
road to victory.
<p>
Yet the Senate soon thwarted the House attempts and
refused to pass a tax relief package until it had been amended.
<p>
One positive element remained:  The Senate did hold onto the $500-per-child
tax credit, along with several other pro-family provisions.
<p>
It was just a few weeks ago that both houses passed the long-awaited
Balanced Budget Act of 1995.  But President Clinton chose to veto
the act, which contained much-needed family tax relief.
<p>
The train wreck happened.
<p>
The country waited to see what this conflict would
produce, and on November 19, both sides eventually committed to
enacting a seven-year balanced budget plan by the end of this
year.  But the details have yet to be announced.
<p>
Congressional Republicans consider the $500-per-child tax credit a vital 
element for providing family tax relief.  Therefore, the upcoming 
negotiations, as we count down to 1996, are crucial to the future tax relief
of American families.
<p>
With us tonight is Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's 
Assistant to the President for Government
Relations, and Marie Wheat, Legislative Director for Congressman
Steve Largent; and Rick Dearborn, Senate Liaison for the Heritage
Foundation.  They are here to discuss why we need change to our
current tax system, pro-family tax relief.
<p>
Marty has been following this closely. Frankly, why is tax relief so 
controversial?  You all have been working on it.  I know, Marie, you were 
on the Budget Committee.  What is so controversial about a little tax relief?
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  I think it is about the size and scope of government.
 We want families to keep more of their money, and that is what
it is all about.  We want the government to spend less and families
to be able to keep their own money and spend it the way they like.
 Parents are better than bureaucrats at raising their own children.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  I agree.  I think it just comes down to a classic
difference between conservatives and liberals, and liberals believing
in big government and the ability to spend your money, and conservatives
and families believing in the fact that, look, it's our money
to begin with, and we would like a little bit of it back.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I have been in Washington for a long time; I know you
all have been, too.  I remember when a $500-per-child tax credit
was a pipe dream. Recently the <i>Washington Post</i> said, you know,
we could really get along if we could just get rid of that $500-per-child
tax credit.
<p>
Is it in trouble?  What kind of fight is going on on behalf of tax credits?
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  I would just offer up that I think that there is a chance that 
it could be in trouble. There is always the potential that it could be in 
trouble. I am glad to see that Dole recently came out saying that he is going
to fight for $245 billion.  Armey was asked recently, well, shouldn't
we lower the family tax relief?
<p>
His answer, I thought, was kind of classic, which is, &quot;Look, I already 
gave at the Senate.&quot; I mean, these are folks that had a $345 billion 
tax package with the Contract With America and already came down $100 billion.
 So there are problems with making sure to shore up everyone else
to keep family tax relief.
<p>
But I think with folks like Phil Gramm, in a way, because of the Presidential 
context, pushing Dole more to the right, to be conservative and hold his 
ground on this, I think that should help at least guarantee some form of 
family tax relief.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Marty, you were on the Hill so
recently before joining Family Research Council.  Do you think
from your long experience that Presidential politics are making
tax relief possible?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, I think it helped. Certainly there is a certain 
competition for the pro-family vote, which we feel is very healthy, and in Iowa, 
for instance, the first state, the pro-family forces are very strong, and I 
think that does give incentive to all of the candidates to be strong
advocates.
<p>
But I think, as Marie and Rick have stated, this is
a philosophical divide where these people do genuinely believe
that families are better equipped to spend that money than the
government and that families can provide for family members better
than the government.  So that is really what is driving the issue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And from all of you, is that a tough case to make,
that families are better at providing?  I saw a thing on CNN this
morning where two liberals were laughing as though government
day care wasn't a good idea.  What kind of a fight are you having
to make to support the family in that context?
<p>
MS. WHEAT: What you see is that it plays well outside the beltway. It 
is the CNN pundits and the people that are on the media talk shows that
think a $500-a-child tax credit is a pipe dream or something that
they want to get off the table.
<p>
But out in real America, in our district, Steve Largent's district in 
Oklahoma, it resonates. People understand that a $500-a-child tax credit 
would let them keep more of their money and help them be able to raise their
children more effectively.
<p>
And so it is playing well.  The calls we get are in support of it 
overwhelmingly. So I think it's an inside-the-beltway versus 
outside-the-beltway, and the real people know that it's a good thing.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Do the Members of Congress feel that if they give the 
administration $200 billion of this, that it is going to go to reduce the 
deficit, or do they feel that it is going to go to spend more on various 
social programs?
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  We believe absolutely that it must go -- it has to
go to cut spending.  There has to be more deficit reduction; that
there is not an offset that you can make; that we have to get
the deficit under control.  And if they want to talk about tax
cuts, if they do want to talk that way, we pay for our tax cuts
-- quote, unquote.  Any of the cuts that we made, we cut spending,
if you want to get into that lingo.  I hate to digress into that.
 But if Clinton wants to spend more, let him cut more.  That's
the bottom line.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  Right.  Yes, we would say the same thing.  I would also 
piggyback on what Marie had said about family tax relief and how it resonates, 
I think, around the country. At the Heritage Foundation, we broke it down, 
family tax relief, as far as a $500-per-child tax credit by congressional 
district and also by county, and the one thing that we noticed is when
we gave that information to the press, all the local papers across
the country would literally just rewrite all of it in their columns
saying that Kenosha County receives X million in family tax relief,
and folks would write in and say, &quot;I had no idea that that
is what this family tax relief meant.&quot;
<p>
So, I mean, people outside the beltway -- you know, I agree with Marie -- I 
think understand what $1,000 more in their pocket per year means.  It
is when we get inside the beltway and everyone up here decides
that they know how better to spend everyone else's money that
we start having the problems.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you see -- some people are trying to say the freshman class 
is going to change America.  Some people are saying they're already becoming 
inside-the-beltway types.  What is your perspective?  I mean, pro-family tax 
relief seems to indicate that they are fighting strong.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN: I would say -- I do the Senate side, so I have kind of -- I 
can stand back and look and see what the House has done and compare
it to what the Senate has done.  A lot of people are saying that
the Senate is kind of the black hole for the House of Representatives,
and to a certain degree, I think they are absolutely right.  I
mean, there are some solid, good freshmen on the Senate side,
but when I see what the House does, I am just astounded that,
first of all, they are doing so much in such a short period of
time that is so revolutionary, I don't think they have a chance
to, first of all, catch their breath to become institutionalized;
and secondly, when they do start catching their breath, there
is something that happens on the Senate side that monkeys up what
they have already done on the House side, so they have to come
back and try to fix it again.
<p>
And I am not trying to be down on the Senate because, day in and day out, 
that's what I work with, are the folks on the Senate side, and there are 
some great warriors over there.  But for the most part, I think these House 
guys have just been phenomenal and really fighting hard for their 
constituents.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  So many of them came here because they were
genuinely committed to change something.  They didn't come here
to be career politicians.  They came here to get a job done, and
then they are ready to go back home to their families.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN: Yes.  I mean, look how many of them have already said, 
&quot;Look, I'm doing the term limits things.  I'm a citizen legislator.
I'm going to serve my couple of terms up here and then I'm going
to go back, because I have a business back home, or I plan on
doing X back home.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That does seem to me a big change in the practical side.
<p>
We have about a minute left in our show.  What would you like people to 
understand about what has been happening here in this sausage-making process 
of tax reform, in the last minute?
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  I would say call your Congressman and call your Senator and tell 
them that you want tax cuts and that it is vital and it is important.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN: I would agree, and just say we should not be spending a dime
more on any of these programs.  You are talking $12 trillion over
the next seven years.  If anything, we should be putting that
money back in folks' pockets, and I would urge people to call.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And you think we can save the $500-per-child tax
credit, as much as it is under attack by the media, perhaps, more
than -- 
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  When Members hear, they listen.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: I guess the other thing I would point out -- Marie alluded 
to it a moment ago -- is that the $500-per-child tax credit and the
other family relief has nothing to do with Medicare.  Those tax
cuts were paid for early on with some of the other discretionary
spending cuts.  Medicare is a separate issue.  That is something
that needs to be dealt with but has nothing to do with the family
tax relief.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  No connection whatsoever.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is controversial, but I appreciate your all's help on that.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we discuss another
pivotal and historic issue, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.
 Stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Since the Supreme Court made the historic <i>Roe v. Wade</i> 
abortion decision in 1973, few congressional sessions have been so momentous. 
But it was a tough fight for life.
<p>
Within days of coming to office in 1992, Bill Clinton signed executive orders 
liberalizing abortion as never before.  Despite his extremely pro-abortion 
policies, the pendulum has swung back a few degrees on some key abortion 
issues.
<p>
Earlier this year, Family Research Council was a leader in the
nomination fight involving Dr. Henry Foster.  On the heels of
the controversial Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders, Clinton nominated
another radical, a Tennessee gynecologist who had worked with
and on behalf of Planned Parenthood during most of his career
and was involved in a teen sex eduction project that had resulted
in even higher teen pregnancy rates.
<p>
The Foster fight came down to the wire, and only a few Senate votes held 
off the nomination. Still, Congress had had enough of the Surgeon General's 
office. After much rancorous debate, the House voted to defund the office,
saying it was too political and unnecessary.
<p>
Also at play in the budget debate, on the House side, tremendous pro-life 
gains were made in the spending bills under consideration.  Pro-family 
leaders were able to pass more than 10 pro-life-related measures, mostly
dealing with ending or restricting federal funding for abortion.
<p>
However, the biggest pro-life loss came from a Planned Parenthood
gold mine.  Title X of the Public Health Service Act is supposed
to work on reducing teen pregnancy and promoting family planning.
 But the program enacted, favoring condom giveaways and sex advice,
has instead been connected to increases in every teen reproductive
health category, from AIDS to sexually transmitted diseases of
all kinds, to pregnancy rates.
<p>
Although the GOP-headed House Appropriations Committee was able to defund the 
failed title X program and transfer the money to another program for needy 
women and children, a floor fight led to a narrow pro-life defeat, 207-221. 
The Senate also supported the controversial title X program.  And so it 
continues.
<p>
But the biggest victories this year have been in a battle that
isn't over yet.  On November 1, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly
passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Act, H.R. 1833, by a vote of
288-139.  The historic vote was the first time since abortion
on demand was legalized in 1973 that Congress voted to ban a particular
procedure.
<p>
Doctors use the partial-birth abortion procedure beginning
at 20 weeks and all the way through full term, nine months of
pregnancy.  The baby is delivered all but the head.  If the head
came all the way out, it would be considered a human being.  A
scissors is jammed into the base of the child's skull, and living
brain matter is suctioned out.
<p>
This horrific procedure is still under consideration by the Senate, with a 
vote expected at any time.  Although the outcome is hopeful, the real 
victories have come from informing the American people about what goes on 
behind the closed doors of an abortion clinic.
<p>
Abortion has always been an extremely controversial issue, and joining me 
to discuss current changes taking place in the pro-life battle is Cathy Deeds, 
Deputy Director of Government Relations for the Family Research Council;
and Congressman-doctor Tom Coburn from Oklahoma, who, along with
other pro-life Congressmen, positively impacted the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act vote.
<p>
Thank you so much for joining us. That's a little hard to say ten times fast.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  It is.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I was at the news conference when you unveiled
this piece of legislation, and at the time, I thought I would
love to see it pass; I don't know if it could.  And here we are
today.  What prompted you to bring this to where it is?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Well, first of all, I shouldn't take credit. I just
supported the effort.  I think some very thoughtful people came
up with the idea, how do we really show the American public what
abortion is?  And this particular, the worst case of abortion
-- it is all bad, but this worst-case issue is one where we can
actually show -- you can no longer deny what is happening to human
beings and human life with this procedure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, you are, as well as being a Congressman, an 
obstetrician-gynecologist, so you have certainly seen many births.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: I personally delivered 3,000 babies.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Three thousand.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  I delivered seven over the weekend, this
weekend.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A hobby.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Well, it's not a hobby.  I am a citizen-based 
legislator, and I don't plan on being here very long, and I want to keep 
my skills and at the same time be based in my district, based on what I
do, which is a doctor.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is fantastic.
<p>
So did you find -- one thing I found compelling, if you could tell us
a little about with the child, that in these late-term abortions,
the pain sensors in the child, they are not completely developed
in a rather horrible way.  Could you tell us a little bit about
that?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  Well, I think the important thing
is that this is -- even though others would want us to think that
this is a benign procedure for the infant, both in terms of the
anesthetic that might be applied and also in terms of the maldeveloped
pain fibers, that the opposite of that is actually the case, and
there has been some controversy over the anesthetic, and it is
important that women who are listening to this understand that
we can safely give general anesthesia to a woman without harming
her baby.
<p>
Some of the testimony that has been quite inaccurate
and unfortunate, that they would put forth untruths in terms of
that, could lead women to make a poor choice about needed surgery
during their pregnancy, so they should not do that.  We can give
anesthesia safely during pregnancy.
<p>
But I think more importantly is the fact that the fetus does in fact 
experience the extreme pain associated with this; that the nerve fibers 
are developed and that the anesthesia that a woman might receive locally 
has no impact at all in terms of protecting the fetus from that.
<p>
But why would somebody worry about pain if they're talking about 
terminating their life in the first place?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  And so there is all this paradox of what are we 
talking about and how do we raise the level of awareness of this human
life.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Of what happens.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Of what actually happens.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Cathy, you have been working on this a lot.  What is the 
status right now?  It has obviously passed the House, thanks to the work 
of Congressman Coburn and others.  Where are we?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  What we are talking about, obviously, as we described it, is 
such a horrible procedure. I mean, we are talking about a baby who is 
partially born, and the Supreme Court never addressed that situation when 
they legalized abortion, unfortunately.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  But I think that is why you find -- I mean, we were very, very 
pleased with the House vote.  We had 288 people voting for it.  Lots of
traditionally pro-abortion members crossed over, supported the
ban, I think because of an ad campaign that we are running, really
getting the word out about what this procedure does.  They were
seeing that this is killing a live baby while it is being born.
<p>
So that was the victory in the House, and we were very pleased
about that, and it is --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now we are to the Senate.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Yes, it's coming up in the Senate very quickly, possibly
as early as next week.  So we really have been working on the
Senators.  It is a tougher battle over there, because the Senate
has different rules, and therefore, they are able to amend the
bill, and we fear amendments that would weaken or gut the bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As a citizen legislator, are you a little surprised
by the difference in the rules between -- especially when it comes
to a horrific thing like this, partial-birth abortions?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Well, I would say, as one of the freshman Members 
of Congress, I have lots of disappointment in the rules of the Senate,
not necessarily in the Senators that are supporting some of these
critical issues for our country.
<p>
But what we need to do is to change the Senate, in my opinion, and to try 
to get people that are reflective of what our society's views are today. 
<p>
The real issue is, not very many people can say that it is okay to perform
a partial-birth abortion if in fact you know what it is, and the
real issue around abortion is let's not know what it is; therefore,
we don't have to deal with it.  And that is what is so important
about this ban.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, that was what was so interesting
during the floor debate on that, where one of the first things
out was Pat Schroeder trying to say, &quot;Let's not show what
we're talking about.&quot;
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And the very first vote out of the box had to be, Oh,
this is what we're talking about; these are the pictures.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  To be on the charts.  There were big charts blown up for
people that may have not seen that.
<p>
But that is what -- I mean, I just need to commend Congressman Coburn 
because he has been such a leader, but especially to have a doctor, a 
practicing doctor, up there, even though this is not, of course, a recognized 
medical procedure, especially the partial birth.  All abortions we don't
think would be recognized, but to have you up there -- and I know
you talked to a lot of Members and Senator Frist on the Senate
side.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  I think that is helpful to some of the Members.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: I think the other thing that is important, if I 
deliver a child that is 24, 26 weeks, I am obligated as a physician to
do everything I can to keep that child alive.  And we take the
same child, turn it around in the womb, and pull its feet out
and its body out and then puncture its cranium and suck its brains
out and say that never was alive.
<p>
There is a tremendous paradox. You know, the tension has to build on that, 
and that is why I am very thankful, not so much that we passed this bill, 
that the American public is now willing to look at what we really do when
we abort babies.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I think that has been the biggest victory, frankly, the fact 
that we are just talking about late-term abortions. Yes, they happen; in 
fact, 77 percent of the American people think there aren't abortions past 
the first three months, the first trimester.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  We should say -- I mean, of course, we in the Family Research 
Council and all the pro-life groups, we are opposed to all abortions. I 
mean, every abortion takes an innocent human life.  This particular abortion 
procedure is so heinous, as we talked about, but it is a starting point.
<p>
As we can see, we did get an overwhelming number in the House, and
we hope, we assume, that the Senate will follow along with that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And we may see a Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act
come up in the Senate as early as Monday.  What do you think,
looking to the next session of Congress, Cathy and Congressman
Coburn, what kind of pro-life activity do you think might come
up next session?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  Go ahead, Cathy.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Well, I mean, certainly, as the little piece mentioned,
we certainly have ongoing, unfortunately, ongoing pro-life battles,
mainly in the funding bills that fund Congress to get abortion
restrictions.  We will probably still have to continue with those,
hopefully maybe make some of those permanent, because right now
they are an annual fight, since these are annual funding bills.
<p>
I think we are talking with pro-life leaders and other pro-life
groups about looking at some other proactive or offensive-type
measures that get at the heart of the abortion procedure, other
types of limits.  We are talking about those, but definitely we
would certainly like to be more on the offensive, but we do have
a pro-abortion President.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, we do.
<p>
MS. DEEDS: So we do have a difficult time.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  We also -- we have an absolute epidemic with 
sexually transmitted diseases.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, we do.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: And although there, unfortunately, are not many 
forward-looking studies on the teaching that we now teach through title X 
funding, the retrospective analysis of that is that every state that spends 
more money on that has a higher incidence of teenage pregnancy, a higher 
incidence of unwanted pregnancy, a higher incidence of abortion, and a higher
incidence of HIV infection and --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It tracks the money.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  What it does is it tracks a loosening
of moral values.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: It gives a false sense of security.  The question to 
be asked is, when you go to doctors' groups who think that our policy is 
fine on AIDS, and you say, &quot;What's the best medical advice that
you would give your patient to prevent them from having a sexually
transmitted disease or getting pregnant or getting HIV?&quot;
they would say abstinence.  Why is that not our national policy
if that is the best medical advice?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is the best medical advice from a doctor, and I hope you all 
were listening. Pleased stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i> following this commercial break.  We will look ahead 
toward issues that face Congress in 1996.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I am now joined by Jacqueline Halbig,
FRC's Congressional Liaison; Cathy Cleaver, Director of Legal
Studies; and back with us is Marty Dannenfelser.  Thank you for
joining me.  I don't feel like I get to see enough of you all,
because everyone is running around all the time, and we're looking
ahead, what is going to happen next?
<p>
Cathy, we haven't talked to you.  We are actually going to be doing a whole 
show on your area in January.  But you are working on some pivotal projects.
 Tell us a little bit about what you see ahead in 1996.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Right.  I see a lot in the area of religious liberty.  I think
that is foremost in Americans' minds right now.  We have a state
of religious discrimination, and Congressman Hyde and Congressman
Istook are both working toward solving that problem by a Constitutional
amendment.  I think it is going to be a very interesting first
part of 1996 in terms of religious liberty.
<p>
Also, we see parental rights, a huge issue; very important to parents to get 
the government bureaucracies to play second in terms of who should decide how
to raise your children.  That is going to be a key issue, and
I also see that in early 1996.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What is kind of ironic about the Religious Equality or Religious 
Liberty Act is that a lot of people think, doesn't the First Amendment already 
give me those kinds of rights?  What is your answer to that?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Well, it does, absolutely.  The problem we are seeing is that
the Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment in such
a way that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment mandates
discrimination against religious people or religious organizations.
<p>
That is not what our founding fathers intended, and that is not
what the literal language of the First Amendment would have us
see.  But we see, since the 1950s, increasingly, a sort of trend
by the Supreme Court in this misconstruction of the First Amendment.
 So a Religious Liberties Amendment would not change the First
Amendment; it would, rather, correct these misinterpretations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Legislatively speaking, Marty, what is going to
need to happen to get this kind of religious liberties ball rolling?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, we're starting the ball towards hearings.
 There have been some hearings in the House and Senate so far,
and Congressmen Hyde and Istook have now introduced some amendments,
and they are going to be looking at hearings very soon, perhaps
before the end of the year, and then by early next year actually
moving the legislation in committee.  So we are going to have
to have a push at the grass-roots level to try to get positive
action.
<p>
But we do have some very good friends in people like Congressman
Canady, the subcommittee chairman, Congressman Hyde, and Congressman
Istook and others who are pushing for this.  So we are optimistic
about coming together and moving that legislation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you see a lot of support for it on the Hill?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes.  Yes, there is very strong support.  I think that 
particularly this new Congress is very committed to the idea of families 
and religious faith.  They are realizing that people's religious faith
is so instrumental in framing their values, in framing what is
best for society, and that religion should not be put on the back
burner, should not be treated unfairly vis-a-vis every other type
of expression.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is the kind of thing that comes up, just this week, a woman 
selling her son to pay a drug debt; last week, a woman cutting out a child of 
another woman because she wants a baby; and people say, how did we get this 
far? And it seems to be a lack of values and faith-based values.
<p>
Now, you are going to work on that, I know, Jacqueline, but what other
issues?  You are working on the Senate side, the House side. 
What issues are you tracking and do you see coming up?
<p>
MS. HALBIG: Well, I am concentrating on education reform as being a big 
issue in the second term of this session, and it is pretty exciting.
 We have before us -- our big goal with FRC is to repeal the federal
role in education -- and we have before us a few bills that will
tackle that.  One, in its embryonic stage, would get rid of the
Department of Education, and that is a first step.
<p>
But probably the biggest obstacle we have to this is President Clinton. 
If we can get through the House and Senate a bill that will get rid
of the Department of Education, we can pretty much expect that
it will be vetoed by President Clinton.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  But why would we want to get rid of the Department of 
Education? Some people say we need more standards, not less.  Don't we 
need a federal role?
<p>
MS. HALBIG:  Well, it's interesting.  Ever since the inception of the 
Department of Education, we have seen nothing but a decline in education. 
I mean, that is where all the studies came up that said, &quot;Oh, my 
goodness, we can't even compete with Germany and Japan anymore,&quot; and 
how interesting that that has all happened since the inception of the 
Department of Education.
<p>
So, clearly, education has declined since we have had a federal department. 
So to give power back to the local schools and parents is really where it's 
at.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I remember campaigning for Reagan in 1970-something, and we 
were talking about getting some changes in education.  Marty, you have been
around Washington, I hope, longer than me.  What do you think?
 Can we do that?  We have about 30 seconds left.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: I think it is going to be very difficult to achieve those 
changes on Clinton's watch, but we have to begin framing the issues and
moving them through Congress and then explaining them to the general
public, and these things will grow as the public understands.
 A lot of this is tied together, empowering parents, not bureaucrats.
 Parental rights legislation, reform of education -- there is
so much from the philosophy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So it is a values-based approach to the problems of, hopefully, 
the next century as we are nearing that point.
<p>
We are going to plan on having shows on all of these actually coming up, 
religious liberty in particular. One last thing as we are looking forward to 
a new session. I understand that Patricia Schroeder just said that she is not 
going to be back next time, and not the biggest pro-family advocate
we have ever had. Marty, what is your one thing that you would
say about Pat Schroeder?  Oh, well, sorry, we have to go.  But
we want to hear that.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Okay.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will take a look at the 
Family Research Council's press conference that took Banned Books Week by 
surprise. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. FRC staff consistently 
is working on projects that will move the public debate beyond simple 
rhetoric. Charles Donovan, an FRC senior policy analyst, had the chance to do 
just that in a groundbreaking study that checked out liberal allegations
of book banning.
<p>
The report was released during National Banned Books Week in a September 
news conference, and it answers the question, Are classic literary works 
really being banned from libraries? Let's find out as <i>Straight Talk</i> 
brings you Home Front News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I am Kristi Hamrick, the Director of Communications for the 
Family Research Council, and we are very excited to have this opportunity,
as Paul Harvey would say, to &quot;tell the rest of the story.&quot;
<p>
This whole idea of censorship and banning books and some kind
of a hostile image of pro-family America, for the rest of America,
is not only laughable; it is not statistical.  I think we have
two good indications of what a pro-family America sees today happening
in our culture among the Banned Books Week concept.  We will have
some original research.  We will have some people talking about
their experience.
<p>
DR. DONOVAN: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
I don't know whether it was our decision in Family Research Council or the 
National Press Club's. Of course, we are meeting in the First Amendment 
Room this morning, which is totally appropriate.
<p>
Before I get into a little bit of my statement, which I will try to keep 
brief because we are going a little long, I will say that if the
ALA had control of the Second Amendment and not the first, every
child would have a gun.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
It is a pleasure to be with you here this morning and to release the results 
of a survey conducted by Family Research Council.  It is an 18-month-long 
project that I undertook with a colleague of mine, William T. Spont.  Our 
basic qualifications are that we love books.
<p>
We noticed a trend, based on personal observation and talking with 
booksellers in New England, whereby a continuing number, an increasing number, 
in our view, of classic works of literature are finding their way into library
discard bins, book sales, used book stores, and the like.
<p>
We had one particular case where we were in a conversation with a New
England bookseller, major bookseller, and she showed us a volume
that was obtained from a library discard.  It was a $600 book
on the commercial market, essentially a rare book which the library
had for some reason chosen to dispense with.
<p>
That and a number of other impressions about the &quot;dumbing down&quot; 
of education and potentially the dumbing down of libraries struck us with 
the idea of conducting a national survey, which is what we did.  We
compiled a list of 100 major classic books of literature.  They
span a wide variety of topics:  art, architecture, literature
-- that is to say, fiction -- science, philosophy.
<p>
We took that list and sent it to over 500 libraries across the United 
States in all 50 states.  The only libraries we excluded -- and we are
talking public libraries -- the only libraries we excluded were
the very largest urban libraries:  Boston, Detroit, Chicago, and
so forth.  We presumed, based on some evidence, that they would
have the vast preponderance of these books.
<p>
We conducted a pilot survey in Massachusetts to test the list.  We also 
sent it to a couple of very good small collections in New England to verify
that the list was an achievable list.  We found that these small
collections both had a very high proportion of the books, approximately
80 percent.
<p>
We then waited for results.  It took two mailings.
 We got 204 responses from 49 states.  We promised -- I should
mention this -- we promised the individual libraries anonymity,
first of all because we don't want to be seen as critiquing or
criticizing any particular institution; secondly is the practical
concern that we wanted to encourage their cooperation.
<p>
I want to praise the libraries for their diligence in responding to 
us. A 40 percent response rate to any mailing nationally is extremely
good.
<p>
But these are very serious people in the libraries.  They
are very concerned about their collections, and a number of them
-- and these really are getting to our results -- a number of
them acknowledged to us in writing, in written comments on the
survey, that in fact classics do tend to disappear over time.
<p>
We found that, on average, the national average for libraries
other than urban libraries was something like 36 of 100 books.
 At least six libraries told us that as a result of our survey,
they went out and purchased books which they believed were on
their shelves at one time but that had disappeared.
<p>
Now, our basic point is not that there is book banning with respect to 
classics. In fact, this illustration of what is happening to classics 
illustrates how you can use the term &quot;banning&quot; quite loosely. 
We would not apply the term &quot;banning&quot; to these books.
<p>
What is happening -- we think it is of much more significant social
interest than many of the other controversies about literature
today -- is what we would call disappearing books.  In fact, we
think it would be more appropriate to have a disappearing high
education in the humanities week in the United States than to
have controversies week-long about whether or not public libraries
should buy Madonna's <i>Sex</i>.
<p>
In any event, let me give you a couple of examples. Einstein. Fifty-four 
percent of the libraries had Einstein's major work on relatively.  A 
similar proportion had Darwin's book on evolution, <i>The Voyage of the HMS 
Beagle</i>. The major works by Kepler on Copernican astronomy, 30 percent. 
Russo's <i>Social Contract</i>, one of the most important bases for the 
understanding of social policy in a democracy, under 50 percent.
<p>
What is happening to these books?  A variety of things happen to them. 
They deteriorate over time.  Books break down; they are discarded.  Some 
are not recognized by librarians as being important to the culture or
as being commercially valuable.  They are put on the discard or
what they call the deselection list.
<p>
Some are stolen. We have one incident with respect to the information raised 
by Focus onthe Family that was a case of theft.  Theft does happen.
<p>
So we concluded in our report that classics are especially subject to
deterioration; that in a time of constricted library budgets --
and I don't know whether they are constricted or not; it is a
point of fact that many libraries say they are -- it makes the
most sense for libraries not to discard some of the most important
works in their collection.
<p>
We recommend a number of steps be taken to reverse this.  First would 
be what we are doing here this morning, more media attention to the fact 
that there is a dumbing down of our libraries taking place.  And we also 
recommend what many librarians told me that they -- and we surveyed many 
of them by phone -- what they really find valuable.  They prize a cooperative
spirit in the community.  They see themselves as servants of the
community.
<p>
The vast majority of librarians are not presenting
<i>Playboy</i> to children, and they have no apologies about it.  They
are not buying it, or if they are buying it, they are putting
it on a reserve shelf.
<p>
So the vast majority of librarians we talked to are very concerned 
about this problem.  They want citizen cooperation. They love people 
who come in and who love books, and they rely heavily not on academic 
groups but on individuals who are simply widely read, many of whom -- 
one librarian told us he dealt with his classics problem by a fellow in 
the community who just loves philosophy.  He said, &quot;Well, go into the 
shelves. Tell me what I've got; tell me what I'm missing.&quot;  The gentleman
came back and gave him a list of major works in philosophy that
were missing.  He went out and bought them.
<p>
This is the way libraries are meant to work: to use all of the expertise of 
the community, to be sensitive to the values of the people in the community,
to make cooperative decisions.  And I want to say in closing that
most libraries do a very, very good job.  Most parents are very,
very concerned about their children.  Most of us, nearly all of
us, are concerned about educational quality.  If we are concerned
about those things, we will not complain about parents who care.
 We will do more to restore and strengthen our library collections.
<p>
Thank you very much.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
Tonight we're going to ask some tough questions about sex and sexual 
politics. Does it matter whether people engage in heterosexual or homosexual 
sex? What does the research reveal?
<p>
Family Research Council examines a broad spectrum of issues
that affect families today.  One of the most controversial is
homosexuality.  Today homosexuals and lesbian activists are a
powerful force in government and in the media worldwide.  At the
heart of the debate is an effort to change the historical definition
of family, from that foundational unit bound by marriage, blood,
and adoption to any kind of relationship.
<p>
Tonight's show will focus on the current status of the homosexual agenda. 
In particular, we will look at the United States armed forces, which was 
highlighted in a key court battle just yesterday.  But more about that 
later in the show.
<p>
First, let's hear what Gary Bauer, president of the
Family Research Council, has to say about another critical issue
featured in the news during the past few weeks:  Bosnia.  Could
President Clinton's peacekeeping mission shape the world's future
in a drastic way?  Gary Bauer provides you with his perspective,
unedited by the media, as he takes you behind the headlines. 
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: This week one of the biggest news items is Bosnia.  What 
pitfalls do you see for the President and the nation in the Bosnia conflict?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, you know, Harry Truman had said a long time ago,
&quot;The buck stops here,&quot; meaning the Presidency.  Bill
Clinton ought to be aware of the fact that it is very easy as
commander-in-chief to commit American soldiers in all sorts of
places.  It is very hard to extricate them with honor once you've
gotten them in a fix.
<p>
If you put 20,000 or 30,000 men on the ground in Bosnia, and a year 
from now there isn't peace, then getting out of Bosnia while maintaining 
the credibility of the United States is going to be very tough; and at that 
point the American people, I believe, and public opinion generally will 
turn on the President.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that this will bring the
women-in-combat issue to a head again here in the United States
debate?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  It will raise the women-in-combat issue again.
 I have noticed that almost every press story filed in the last
couple of weeks manages to show a woman in uniform.  I think,
if you have women in the service on the ground in Bosnia who end
up dying in combat or dying in accidents or become the targets
of terrorists, that you could have another whole debate in the
country about the appropriate role of women in combat, which is
a debate, I think, that is long overdue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: At the end of the Bosnia debate, do you think that 
Americans will be more in favor or less in favor of women in combat?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I think, long term, Americans are going to be in favor of the
ability of women to join the military and serve in support positions.
 But I think once Americans see young women, their daughters,
coming home in body bags, whether it is in Bosnia or the Middle
East or some future conflict that we are not aware of, I believe
at that point public opinion will turn against this idea of complete
equality in combat of women and men.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Another big news item internationally is Ireland and the 
divorce debate. What do you think will happen to Ireland now that they have 
approved divorce by a very narrow margin?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, if I were Ireland, I certainly would hesitate before I 
would go down the road that the rest of the West has taken in the last 30 
years. No-fault divorce was hailed in the United States 20 years ago as a 
great advance.  What now we know looking back on it is that no-fault
divorce has resulted in a lot of abandoned women and children.
 And it is harder to get out of a contract with a lawn service
company than it is to get out of a contract with your spouse.
<p>
I think Ireland made a mistake.  That was a very narrow vote.
 The other interesting thing about that vote is that every major
political party in Ireland, every major newspaper, supported liberalizing
the divorce laws.  And yet with all of the establishment saying,
&quot;Vote yes,&quot; only barely half of the country voted that
way.  Half of the country had no representation whatsoever.
<p>
So I think there are still a lot of traditional-values people in
countries like Ireland, certainly here in the United States, and
I think that we still have a chance of seeing a rebirth of traditional
values, in contrast to the vote that took place.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Family Research Council released a poll where the number 
one finding was that people believe that because of the moral decline,
the country is in real trouble.  There is a very tragic story
about a woman who sold her son because of a $2,000 drug debt.
 What do you think this situation says about the direction America
is headed?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, this is the outrage of the week,
right?  I mean, almost every week, there is some horrific story
that, just a few years ago, would have been unimaginable.  The
week before this, it was the story out of Illinois about these
thugs literally cutting a baby out of a woman that they murdered.
 Before that, you had Susan Smith sending her children to the
bottom of the lake.
<p>
You know, people come with all kinds of explanations.
 Some people say it's government programs causing these things.
 Other people say it's heartless social policies, or it's poverty
or whatever.  I don't believe it's any of those things.  I think
it is evidence -- all these things are evidence of a country that
has drifted away from its basic belief in God and from a basic
embrace of traditional values.
<p>
Now, when a culture does that, all through history, whether it was ancient 
Rome or ancient Greece or America in 1995, there's a terrible price to pay, 
and we're paying that price now.  Hopefully, Americans will see these things
and rethink the trends of the last 30 years.  But for now, we
are going to continue to reap a terrible whirlwind of tragedy,
family breakup, and horrors that we are already beginning to see
on a daily basis in the newspapers.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we'll be joined by Anthony 
Falzarano, a former homosexual who has devoted his life to ministering to 
the homosexual community.  Stay with us as Anthony brings us his perspective
on the cultural struggle taking place.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  For thousands of years, homosexuality has been discouraged
in cultures the world over.  Experience, common sense, and considerable
medical evidence show that homosexuality is immoral, unhealthy,
and destructive to individuals, families, and societies.
<p>
So why is America seeing homosexual activism on so many levels?  Why
are homosexuals featured on network TV comedies?  Why are homosexuals
featured on news broadcasts and in newspapers and magazines all
over America?  Why are they so loudly pressing for gay marriage,
gay adoption of children, gays in the military, and special civil
rights?
<p>
The short answer is that this did not happen by accident.
 Gay activists have waged a 40-year campaign to change the culture,
aided by a willing media.
<p>
In 1948 and in 1953, Alfred Kinsey released his famous Kinsey reports on 
male and female homosexuality. Kinsey made the case that homosexuality was 
widespread and not much different from normal sexuality.
<p>
In 1950 the first American homosexual activist group, the Medishien(?) 
Society, was formed. Citing Kinsey and producing many unscientific but 
well-publicized studies about homosexuals, activists began working to change the
moral consensus about homosexuality.
<p>
In the 1950s, UCLA psychologist Evelyn Hooker did three studies comparing a 
group of 30 homosexual men with 30 heterosexual men.  Although that study 
showed clear psychological differences, gay activists and the media have 
misreported the studies as showing that somehow homosexuality is normal.
<p>
The next big steppingstone came in 1973.  After a campaign of intimidation,
the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from
its list of disorders.  The gay lobby within the APA is now trying
to criminalize psychological therapy for those seeking to leave
the lifestyle.
<p>
At the same time, aggressive lobbying extended to more than just organizations. 
It became political, at the grass roots, city by city, state by state. Sodomy 
laws have been swept from the books in more than 25 states.  Gay rights laws
have been passed in nine states and in more than 100 cities. 
Gays are bringing court cases seeking to adopt children, to marry,
and to serve in the military.
<p>
MILITARY OFFICER:  The military's policy on homosexuality does a great 
injustice to the thousands of military personnel who are highly trained, 
dedicated, loyal, and who also happen to be gay.  This policy must be changed 
now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In all of these efforts, activists have employed
a flood of bad studies which we can only call gay science.  Here
are the claims:
<p><ul>
<li>Ten percent of the population is homosexual.
<li>Homosexuality is genetic.
<li>Gays comprise a third of all youth suicides.
<li>Gays are a major target of hate crimes.
</ul><p>
Although none of these has been verified by reliable science, media 
reports have persuaded many people that they have.
<p>
Last week an activist group -- Parents, Family and Friends of Lesbians and 
Gays -- launched a $1 million advertising campaign to vilify people who 
oppose the homosexual agenda.  The TV ads feature scenes of gays being
beaten, with the image changing to the face of Pat Robertson,
Jerry Falwell, and other opponents of homosexual activism.
<p>
The intent is to say that anyone opposing gay activism directly causes
hateful physical attacks on gays.  The intent is to silence all
critics.
<p>
Homosexual and lesbian activists have made it clear in
recent days that they are in this fight to change the world --
from one that values and cherishes home, family, and heterosexual
marriage as the cornerstone of society to one that says anything
goes.
<p>
With us tonight is Anthony Falzarano, executive director
of Transformation Ex-Gay Christian Ministries.  Anthony himself
has been transformed after rejecting a long-time homosexual lifestyle,
and he is here to bring you his testimony and practical insights
regarding today's homosexual community.
<p>
Thank you very much for joining us, Anthony.  You are working with an 
excellent organization and running an excellent group here in Washington, 
D.C., that works with homosexuals, talking to them about what's true. 
There are a lot of messages out there.  What do you see as some of the
biggest pieces of propaganda in the homosexual debate today?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Oh, the number one piece of propaganda that is being
pushed on America today is that people are born gay and that there
is a genetic predisposition to homosexuality, and that is not
true.  There is nothing out there, Kristi, that proves that. 
There is not one bit of information.
<p>
I am a former homosexual. I was gay for nine years until I came to Christ 
and got help from a national organization called Exodus International, and
they helped me leave the gay lifestyle behind successfully.  I
am now married and I have two children, and I have been married
for 12 years, and I am living proof that you are not born gay.
 We are currently helping about 6,000 former homosexuals within
the ex-gay network.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And from your experience both inside and out of the lifestyle, 
do you see an aggressive, or more aggressive, push today, or have you seen 
an accumulation of efforts to bring us to the place where we are, especially 
like, for example, in the military?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, the gays in general, they are highly organized.  They 
are much more organized than the church in America.  They are much more 
organized than our government.  They are real grass roots.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Why is that?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, it's real simple.  They don't typically
have wives and children to go home to at night, and they can work
14, 15 hours a day, and they are very organized and very determined,
and they are fighting for their lives right now.
<p>
In the military, with the Clinton Administration now, they are just getting 
license to push homosexuality into the military.  They have been in the
military for years, and they have been underground, thank God,
but now with the Clinton Administration they are just coming out
of the closet in the military, and we are heading for a disaster.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You actually were part of some of the efforts to
talk to the American Psychiatric Association.  Do you see that
as being in recent history one of the more disastrous changes
that took place?  Because what it said was, We're going to now
say that this is just a normal condition.  You actually went there
recently.  What has been your involvement with that, and what
have you found?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, what is really under attack
is authority in this country.  Basically, the American Psychiatric
Association, in 1993, was lobbied by the gay activists, the insurance
industry in our country, to push homosexuality out of the DSM-III,
which is the official digest of psychological disorders.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What's in it for them, though?  Why do you think they would 
do something like that?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  It's real simple.  Basically, if they want gay rights, 
and if they can erase from the books that homosexuality is a neurosis, 
that it is a disturbance, then they can claim that they actually are a 
minority, that they are actually born this way, and, as if you are a woman 
or a Jewish person or a Catholic, that you should be able to be protected
under our Constitution.  That is their motivation.
<p>
What happened was, the reason the American Psychiatric Association was 
lobbied by the insurance industry is because if you go for sexual 
reorientation counseling, it takes six months to two years to walk out of 
homosexuality successfully, and we are talking maybe $100 a session.  You 
are talking about $10,000 by the time somebody walks out of homosexuality.
<p>
If they give gay affirmative counseling, that is six or seven
sessions with a psychologist or a psychologist --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: To tell you that you're fine.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: -- to tell you you're fine, there's nothing wrong with you; 
you went to the gay lifestyle.
<p>
Well, that happened in 1973.  Now it is blowing up in the insurance industry's 
face because now, before somebody dies of AIDS, they are spending about 
$250,000 a patient before this person dies of AIDS.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When you're looking at talking with a person who is in a 
homosexual lifestyle, in particular, I understand you are talking about 
sexual identity disorder, that there are roots to homosexuality and lesbianism 
inside of a person in their life.  What is sexual identity disorder?  What are 
you seeing?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, 80 percent of the people that come
to Transformation Ministries in Washington, D.C., have been sexually
molested and/or raped as children.  We see that.  We take an informal
poll every six months, and the data is accurate.  It keeps coming
up constant, somewhere between 70 to 80 percent.
<p>
We see the male homosexual did not bond with his father.  We see the lesbian 
did not bond with the mother.  So we see non-bonding with the same-sex
parent over and over again.  We see high levels of divorce, high
levels of alcoholism, very, very dysfunctional family situations.
<p>
I don't know why this is not being reported to the media, other
than there is a 6,000-member gay journalists' organization now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  You know, the gays are in control in Hollywood; they are in 
control of television; they are in key positions at the <i>Washington 
Post</i> now; and they watch everything that is coming into the newspaper 
or television and radio, and they are editing it out.
<p>
A reporter from the <i>Washington Post</i> came to our ministry six years 
ago. He wanted to do a story on us.  After the meeting, he said, 
&quot;This is fantastic. This is news.  We're going to do a story in the 
<i>Post</i> on it.&quot;
<p>
He calls me the next morning.  He says, &quot;Anthony, 
I hate to tell you this, but we can't do the story.&quot;  And I said,
&quot;What happened in the last 12 hours?  You were so excited
last night.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: He said, &quot;My editor's a lesbian, and she killed the 
story.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  There is a lot of one-sided telling of the story of
homosexuality and lesbianism as we have researched, at Family
Research Council, the literature.  One of the big projects that
we did was the Ten Percent Project, which took a look at the research,
the good research which said 1 to 2 percent of the population
was gay at best compared to 10 to 20 that the homosexuals were
talking about.
<p>
One of the things that is missing today, though, is an analysis of the 
good scientific data on homosexuality and lesbianism.  What are you seeing? 
I know we are seeing a repetitive message that it's genetic.  What's your 
answer to the &quot;it's genetic&quot; statement?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  It's an absolute lie that comes from the pit of hell. 
Basically, we are seeing many people come through Exodus and walk successfully 
out of a homosexual disorientation.  We see them going on to marriage.  We see 
them having children.  We see them out of the lifestyle 10, 15, 20
years.  I have been out of the lifestyle totally now for 12 years.
 I mean, it's doable.  It's hard.  It's the equivalent of coming
off of heroin.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What does it take?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: I mean, you are really turning your life totally over to 
Jesus Christ to realize that you need this higher power -- and I call
my higher power Jesus Christ -- to walk successfully out of a
lifestyle that basically permeates your entire being.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it is more than like a 12-step program.  To leave the 
lifestyle does require that looking outside of yourself.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Yes, finding out the root causes, what happened to you as 
a child; putting together a puzzle of dysfunction in your early upbringing;
finding out what happened with the relationship between you and
your same-sex parent; submitting your fleshly addictions.  Many
homosexuals are addicted to pornography, masturbation, promiscuous
sex.
<p>
I mean, I had a guy in the ministry who had sex with over
5,000 partners, and he was 32 years old.  Now, that is an extreme.
 Many people that come to Transformation and Exodus-type ministries
have never had a sexual encounter, just suffer with the fantasy
and pornography part of it.
<p>
We help all kinds of people.  We help people who are prostitutes, who are 
homosexual prostitutes. But what we see over and over again -- sexual 
addiction, sexual molestation early in youth, and we see brokenness with 
the same-sex parent and great, great dysfunction in the family unit, the 
upbringing.
<p>
And the devil is attacking the family.  He is trying to destroy
the family now, and we must keep our families together.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And that's at the heart of it, isn't it?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's an attack on the family. Today it would seem
that what we are doing is we are looking at redefining the family
to include anything that a person might be involved in.
<p>
But for someone that wants more information about your organization, could
you give us a couple of phone numbers?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Yes, absolutely. I think the Exodus number will be appearing 
on the screen. But we are in San Raphael, California, the national ministry 
called Exodus.  It is area code 415 454-1017.  Transformation in Washington
is area code 202 371-0800.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And for someone who wants a little bit more information, Anthony, 
what would you say to the person who is -- we've got just a couple of seconds 
left -- who is considering a homosexual lifestyle and wonders if they're
gay?  In 15 seconds, what would you say to that person?  &quot;What
if I'm gay?&quot;
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Don't believe the lie. Yes, you are struggling with a 
homosexual disorientation. But think of yourself as a man or woman struggling 
with homosexuality disorientation; don't think of yourself as gay.  There is 
quite a distinction between being homosexual and gay.  Homosexual means I 
suffer with this. Gay means coming out of the closet.  Before you come out
of the closet, get some help from Exodus International.  You don't
have to be gay.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for being with us, Anthony.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we discuss a pivotal
and possibly historic event which occurred just yesterday as the
Family Research Council presented evidence denouncing the involvement
of homosexuals in the military in a court case.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  December 5, 1995, could be recognized
as a significant date in the battle over homosexuals serving openly
in the military.  On this date the case of <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>
was heard before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond,
Virginia.  Family Research Council was granted permission, in
an unprecedented decision, to present oral arguments along with
the Justice Department in this case over the dismissal of Navy
Lieutenant Paul G. Thomasson, a self-identified homosexual.
<p>
LT. THOMASSON: This policy that tells gay and lesbian service members
that they can go in harm's way for their country but that they
can't &quot;come out&quot; and try to dispel the stereotypes or
overcome the prejudice with which they suffer is absolutely inimical
to the very Constitution that they've all sworn to defend.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  He is one of several servicemen who has highlighted
problems with the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; standard.
<p>
Within days of coming to office, the Clinton Administration began
promoting homosexuals and lesbians for open service in the military,
despite a long military history that barred such service because
of its impact on military order and effectiveness.
<p>
In 1993, Congress passed a clear law that prohibited homosexuals and 
lesbians from serving.  But the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; 
regulations were written to implement the law, and they made the standard
unclear, some say deliberately so, to encourage lawsuits that
attack the law itself.
<p>
ACLU SPOKESWOMAN: For over two decades, the ACLU has worked in the courts to 
bring about change in our nation's policy on the service of lesbian and gay 
Americans, and for the past six months, the ACLU Washington office has played
a leadership role in working with the administration and Congress
to develop a plan that would usher in a new day of freedom for
these service members while ensuring the readiness of our nation's
defense.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Family Research Council was allowed to
testify after arguing that the Justice Department was not going
to uphold the law, which would be their traditional role, but
instead, they were going to argue that the vague standard, &quot;don't
ask, don't tell,&quot; would fulfill the requirements.
<p>
That would mean that both the plaintiff, Lieutenant Thomasson, and the 
Justice Department would essentially be on the same side.  And so the
Family Research Council stepped in to make the case for the legal
standard.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  I was pleased with essentially what
Professor Woodruff said, because he really set the agenda straight,
and that is that there is a distinction between what the directives
say and what the law says.  The laws are very clear in regard
to this whole issue that homosexuals should not serve.  What the
directives have done, what the Clinton Administration has done,
is contrary to what the American people have long wanted, and
that is to not allow homosexuals to serve.
<p>
And so I feel very good that Professor Woodruff really drew the line in 
the sand for the American people today, representing not only the American
people but the United States Congress.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Each side says that they are confident that they will be the 
victor.
<p>
REPORTER: Are you going to appeal if you lose?
<p>
LT. THOMASSON:  We're not planning to lose.
<p>
FEMALE:  And that's why I'm very confident that
the government side will win, because the implementing or the
augmenting argument from FRC will be helpful in that regard.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And both sides agree on one thing:  No matter which
way the ruling goes, this pivotal case will move on to the Supreme
Court.
<p>
With us now are two individuals who have been at the forefront
of the battle against homosexuals getting involved in the military
in service.  I would like to welcome Lt. Col. Bob Maginnis, a
policy analyst with the Family Research Council, and Melissa Wells-Petry,
an attorney for Family Research Council who has represented FRC
in several court cases.  Thank you so much for joining us.
<p>
You all were obviously both in Richmond yesterday.  What is so pivotal
about this particular case?  Why does this one matter so much?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, this is the first time an amicus, such
as us, was allowed to argue in federal court to point out the
obvious, that the Clinton Administration is not enforcing the
law that passed Congress back in 1993, and that is ludicrous.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I used to actually be a reporter covering the courts.
 I've never seen an outside amicus of any kind be allowed to speak.
 I don't know.  Melissa, you're an attorney.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: It's a very unusual situation.  It does happen, but very 
unusually. And there are a lot of unusual things about this case, not to
mention what you brought up in the beginning, is that essentially
the homosexual activist community and the Clinton Justice Department
are taking a united front, and they are going into court and saying
the policy allows homosexuals to serve.  And, actually, the law
does not allow homosexuals to serve, and it has been our role,
it has fallen to us say, &quot;What part of 'No' don't you 
understand?&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, when the law was written, Congress was, in
essence, attempting to make it clear after Bill Clinton came to
office, &quot;You're talking within days of getting here about
gays in the military; we're saying that open homosexual service
is a problem.  Here's the law.&quot;
<p>
Why did it even go this far?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, back in the summer of 1993, President
Clinton, as you showed in your video, announced his policy from
the stage at Fort McNair.  It was don't ask, don't tell.  And
then when the law took effect, the law basically took the longstanding
bar against homosexual service and it just codified it; it made
it a law.  And the distinction between what Clinton said at Fort
McNair and what the law says are really night and day in terms
of who should serve.
<p>
The Clintons have created special classes of homosexuals, those homosexuals 
that will remain, quote, celibate and those homosexuals that engage in what 
homosexuals do. And the law doesn't talk about it.  It says all homosexuals 
are homosexuals.
<p>
I think what you're really seeing here, Kristi, is just a basic
power grab by the Clinton Administration.  Now, it's not the first
time that this administration has tried or actually has put itself
above the law.  But, really, what you are seeing here is you are
seeing a situation where the American people and Congress said,
&quot;No, it is a very bad idea to put homosexuals into the military,&quot;
and the Clinton Administration is so committed, for reasons best
known to itself, to that agenda, to putting homosexuals into the
military, to enlarging the homosexual agenda in our nation, that
now there is this power struggle.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And there's a power struggle.  You know, Congress passes 
laws. The President is supposed to faithfully execute them.  If he
doesn't do that, what do we do?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Who does?
<p>
Bob, you were in policy at the Pentagon and had a long military 
career as well and worked on the policy of gays in the 
military. Some people are going to say, &quot;There have always been 
homosexuals in the military.  Why not have open homosexual service in the
military?&quot;
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  No.  Well, Melissa and I were a small group of people 
that essentially did most of the background work on the President's group 
that worked in the Pentagon on that. There are a lot of reasons, and we 
discovered many of those during the course of that six-month study.
<p>
Clearly, there are cohesion reasons.  There are military readiness reasons.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, explain cohesion for a second.  I don't think people -- 
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  It is what keeps units working, keeps them
fighting together, trusting.  You know, you have to trust the
person in the foxhole with you, in the tank, in the airplane,
to do the types of things and not to be sexually aroused if you're
the same gender under some pretty intimate types of situations.
<p>
We heard from thousands of people when the Army went out and asked
old soldiers and present-day soldiers, &quot;Tell us, have you
ever had a problem?&quot;  And we heard a lot of problems out
there, current and old problems, about homosexuals that were,
quote, in the closet but were discovered to be doing things that
really undermined the trust and confidence you have to have in
one other.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And this is a fact in particular, isn't
it, when you have someone who is in authority over younger men,
in particular?
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Absolutely.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And I think it's very important to point
out that the fact, whenever you have a rule, whatever that rule
is, there are a certain number of people who don't abide by it.
 There are a certain number of people who evade it and therefore
don't bring the problems that the rule was designed to address
necessarily into the situation.
<p>
But it's a whole 'nother question to say, What would the military be like 
if we removed that rule totally, took all the brakes off, took all the 
restraints off? You cannot compare an army where a few soldiers are breaking
and evading the rules to an army that has no rules.  So that analogy
just breaks down analytically.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're going to have more time to talk later.  But the military 
traditionally has said, We want you to not be sexually active with each other, 
men and women, man and man, however you want to do it.  You have found
that to be disruptive now sometimes even with women in the military.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Absolutely.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Very clearly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Tell a little bit about why the military says to
the people involved in it, Don't sleep together.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, I can tell you that I did some -- and I can't give 
you details -- but investigations during Operation Desert Storm in
Iraq and Saudi Arabia, where we had relationships among soldiers,
some of which were senior, which are the ones I investigated,
which in some cases didn't happen but they were alleged to have
happened, and you go down and you talk to the soldiers that are
under this supervisor, this senior person, and there's a lot of
backbiting, there's a lot of distrust, finger-pointing, and just
morale bottoms out.  They don't trust this person because they
think they're off sleeping with the commander or whatever.
<p>
MS.HAMRICK: Right. Sexual politics.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY:  It's really a loyalty question.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to get more into that.
<p>
Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i> following this commercial break.  We'll hear
more about yesterday's court action, more about these kinds of
sexual politics.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I am joined once again by Bob Maginnis and Melissa 
Wells-Petry, both of whom attended and were active in the recent court case, 
<i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. Welcome back.
<p>
Family Research Council is not my first job. I have been in many 
different work environments where there is sexual harassment, in particular 
one where the boss was sleeping with different women in the office.
<p>
It seems to me simple to understand that the same reason I don't want an 
army that sleeps around is the same reason I don't want that going on in my 
own office or the kind of pressure that -- who gets promoted, the people 
who sleep or don't sleep?  What are you seeing, Melissa?
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Well, it should be simple to understand, especially when we 
feel that way about the normal work environment, and there is absolutely
nothing ordinary about being in the military environment.  This
is an organization that has a sense of togetherness, physical
and emotional, that really has no parallel in the civilian world.
<p>
And when you are talking about the remarkable dynamic of sexuality,
it really begins to involve people's, not only their full attention
but their loyalties.  And inside the armed services, one's loyalties,
every soldier's loyalty must be to the mission, not to some little
intrigue that is going on inside the company.
<p>
That is the seed, that pernicious seed, that begins to flower into what 
Bob said was this breakdown in morale across the board.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What have you seen, Bob, in your experience?  You've done a 
lot of investigation.  When there are homosexuals serving in a unit and
they haven't told per se but there's a knowledge that they are
gay, what is happening?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, there is a common knowledge amongst especially the 
young, enlisted soldiers when you have especially, say, a sergeant who 
everybody suspects is gay, but the seniors can't quite catch this person in 
the act, and they won't acknowledge it.  And so it has created a level
of tension which is just -- you could break it like you're breaking
ice.  You know, it just shatters once it is discovered, because
everybody knew it.  But it is terribly devastating.
<p>
Any sexual issue -- because most of what I investigated were sexual issues
for senior officials, and I saw a lot of them -- and, invariably,
you would talk to the people and they would tell you what was
going on and how this was dysfunctional.  It was just like the
coffee(?) talk.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY:  See, that's what is so artificial about a policy that 
focuses only on when you tell.  That's completely fake, because -- let's face 
it; let's have some common sense here -- the difference between a homosexual 
who is unknown and one who is known, that state of affairs can change in the 
twinkling of an eye.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And that state of affairs is very transient, depending on 
the opportunities presented, the emotional appeal that is involved in a 
situation, and so on. So we are talking about the Clinton Administration basing 
a policy on something that not only is fake but is like ephemeral.  It
goes like that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's a trust level, too, isn't it? I mean, basically, we're 
saying I will identify myself by the way in which I will have sex and say that 
I will never have sex. Isn't that what we're asking people to say?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, we are.  We are essentially --
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Well, under the Clinton regulations, right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Under the Clinton regulations.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Right.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: They are asking -- like Thomasson yesterday.  They are 
saying, &quot;Why in the world didn't you ask him whether or not he was
going to remain celibate?&quot;  Now, he didn't say anything about
that in the testimony, but that is essentially the expectation.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY:  But I always find it amazing that celibacy,
which is frankly out of fashion everywhere in public policy --
you can't get anyone -- in fact, people are suing if you try to
include an abstinence-related protocol in your sex education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And suddenly celibacy is in vogue among homosexuals in 
the military?  You know, in every program that has to do with sex, the last 
thing that they are factoring in is celibacy or abstinence.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes. Our Federal Government just spent $400,000 to do an ad 
campaign that is going to advise you to use condoms.  But in the military, 
apparently, no one is going to have to.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Yes. Oh, yes. Celibacy is in vogue there, yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And yet the military provides pornography to the soldiers and 
homosexual pornography now.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: That is a new development.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What do you think of that?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: We checked.  About two weeks ago, we went to the 
Pentagon, and we looked at what pornography was on sale at the Pentagon
bookstore.  Now, there are only nine different books of heterosexual
pornography -- there were some empty spaces, so we assume there's
more -- and there were two for homosexual pornography.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: There were sales at the Fort Myer post exchange for 
homosexual flags and bumper stickers, and so forth, to identify yourself.
<p>
Now, this is under the Clinton Administration policy that says homosexuals 
aren't supposed to be serving, and yet you have, at taxpayer expense 
subsidizing this stuff, no taxes being charged for the sale of it, and it's 
out there.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And, of course, it is broader than just -- I mean, when you 
begin to talk about pornography, you are talking about impacting on
the whole --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The whole sexual climate.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: -- moral and social climate of command.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right. This isn't going to go away, and we're going to have 
to have you all back. When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at the Family
Research Council's effort to show that the media does not always
present the facts.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back.
<p>
The Family Research Council's director of cultural studies, Bob Knight, 
has been involved in the media for many years, working at one time for the 
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>. In a 1993 Accuracy in the Media press conference, 
Bob presents some facts regarding the homosexual agenda and how the media 
presents it to the public. Let's take a look at his insight as <i>Straight 
Talk</i> brings you Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
<center><h4>Segment from Accuracy in Media Press Conference<br>
June 1, 1993</h4></center>
<p>
MODERATOR:  Our next speaker and I have something in common.
 We both come, figuratively, out of the belly of the beast.
<p>
Bob Knight was a former editor of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. I 
formerly was a correspondent for the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, so we 
know the media from the inside out.
<p>
Bob is now director of cultural studies at the Family Research Council. Bob?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Well, the reason we are here today and here to see the video is 
because the media has been omitting what's really important.  They have
done this on a number of occasions.  But in all my years in journalism,
I never saw an issue treated so dishonestly as I have the gay
issue.  And it is what is omitted that bothers me.
<p>
You know, you can pick up the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Washington 
Post</i>, and I think the information there is reliable.  But it's what 
they're not telling you that is significant.
<p>
They didn't tell you, for example, that Roberta Achtenberg was an attorney 
for the bath houses in San Francisco at the height of the AIDS epidemic. 
In 1984, the Public Health Department tried to close those bath houses
because they knew they were a breeding ground for AIDS and were
taking the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of young gay men.
<p>
She was an attorney for a group of bath house patrons and managed
to keep them open.  I think this action may have contributed to
the loss of life of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men.  And
yet the media didn't think that was worthy of reportage.
<p>
Similarly, the way they reported on Roberta Achtenberg's role in 
persecuting the Boy Scouts was curious.  They said that right-wing 
opponents had accused her of punishing the Boy Scouts and being against
the Boy Scouts' policies of excluding homosexual scoutmasters.
<p>
This is full public record.  She has been doing it for years.
 She has made no secret about it.  And yet it is left up to debate
whether she actually did it or not.  It almost seems as if her
critics took it up, and yet there is ample opportunity to document
her attitude on the issue.  That was never done.  It was left
as a cloud.
<p>
I will give you a personal example of media bias.
 When I was at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, somebody had written a 
story about gay cruising in Laguna Beach, California, which is a gay
mecca much like Key West.  The gist of the article was that gays
had changed their cruising methods.  They weren't frequenting
the parks as much.  They weren't hitting the public restrooms
as much, although some still were.
<p>
This story went on for 80 inches, which is typical for an <i>L.A. Times</i> 
story. Our motto used to be, &quot;Get it last, make it long, get it 
right.&quot;
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But, anyway, I got hold of the story.  I was editing it, and I
said, &quot;Wait a second.  You know, in this entire article about
gay cruising, you never mention AIDS once.&quot;  And this was
when AIDS was really taking off.  It was the most obvious topic
in the gay community at the time.
<p>
And I asked the editor, I said, &quot;Why aren't we mentioning AIDS?&quot; 
And he said, &quot;Well, we just didn't think it was relevant.&quot; 
AIDS not relevant to a story on gay cruising and whether there's a change 
in habits? Come on.
<p>
This is why we are here to see this video today.  The
media has been systematically excluding information about the
homosexual lifestyle, about the politics surrounding the issues,
about almost everything associated with the issue.
<p>
Another prime example would be the idea that gays are born that way, that 
there are genetic studies that indicate that you are born gay and there's
nothing you can do about it.  The latest study that was touted
was in the <i>Archives of General Psychiatry</i>. It was by two 
researchers, Drs. Bailey and Pillard(?), and they had done a study of male
twins previously.
<p>
I remember the <i>Washington Post</i> headline.  It
was something on the order of &quot;Study Indicates Lesbianism
Has Genetic Origin.&quot;  What they didn't report was in the
very same edition of the <i>Archives of General Psychiatry</i> was an
article that reviewed all the current literature on the issue
by two doctors and psychiatrists, and they concluded:  &quot;At
present, there is no evidence to substantiate a biologic theory
of homosexuality.&quot;
<p>
Further, they said, &quot;Efforts to do so seem to be more driven by lack 
of satisfaction with the current psychosocial explanations than anything 
else. There is no new medical evidence that is solid to suggest that it is 
biological.&quot;
<p>
But this is typical.  An authoritative article goes unnoticed;
one that supports part of the gay agenda gets heavily publicized.
<p>
What you are about to see on this video is what did not get publicized
in Washington.  I have heard people in the media try to say that
what you see on the video is just on the fringes of the march,
that it really didn't represent what went on that day.  But we
had people out there.  They were all over the mall, and they said
this stuff happened everywhere.  If you were in Washington that
day with your kids, you couldn't avoid seeing obscene acts committed,
anti-religious imagery, topless lesbians, any number of bizarre
sights that were carefully hidden from the major network shows
and from major print media.
<p>
So I think the report, that group out of California that did such a fine 
job with their first gayagenda film and their second, which deals with the 
homosexual agenda in education, have done -- if anything, they have surpassed
themselves.  This is a dispassionate look at what really occurred
that day in Washington.  It deserves to be viewed by every American
so they know exactly what the homosexual agenda is about.
<p>
Thank you very much.
<p>
[Applause.]

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
Tonight we're talking about an issue which has touched each and every 
one of us:  divorce.  As rampant as divorce is across the nation, it is a 
topic that is rarely discussed, perhaps because of the emotional chord of 
regret, heartbreak, and disillusionment it strikes.
<p>
Tonight <i>Straight Talk</i> confronts divorce head-on.  We're going to ask, 
What impact has it had on society?  Why has there been such a drastic rise 
in the divorce rate over the past three decades?  And, most importantly, is 
there a way to curb this damaging cycle of family breakdown?
<p>
First, let's hear from Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's
Assistant to the President for Government Relations.  After years
of working on Capitol Hill, Marty provides a unique and insightful
look into issues before Congress which affect our nation.
<p>
I had the chance to discuss some of the most current Hill wars with
Marty, so let's see what he has to say, without media editing,
as we take you behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are here today with Marty.  Thank you
so much for joining us.  Marty works on Capitol Hill for the Family
Research Council.  And this last session of Congress was historic,
because for the first time since 1973, we saw an actual limitation
on abortion -- not all the way through yet -- the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act.
<p>
Marty, what has it said about Congress today that they are looking at 
banning a procedure that might end a child's life when they are pulled 
into the birth canal and killed moments from birth?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, I think that this issue was chosen very strategically, 
and it was a very good decision to use legislation like this that focused 
on a particular procedure and forced people to deal with the reality of 
abortion. So many times in the past, the pro-abortion side has been able to 
engage the argument on cliches, and so on, of keeping the government
out and that sort of thing, and not focusing on the child.
<p>
So it is very important that people understand what is going on,
and as you pointed out, most people don't realize that late-term
abortions are a reality.  They believe that they are only in the
first three months and even only for hard cases -- life of the
mother, rape, incest, perhaps a few other hard cases -- and it
is much broader than that.
<p>
This bill is going to land on the President's desk, and the indications 
are that he will veto it.  But it will help to point out that he does have 
a very extreme position that is in line with the most extreme advocates of 
abortion on demand in this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that will hurt the President if he vetoes 
the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think it will.  I think he is probably falling
back on his friends at the major networks to try to put the best
spin on it, and he will say that there wasn't the appropriate
health exception, and of course, we all know that the health exception
they're talking about is a license for abortion on demand.  It's
a definition of health that encompasses any possible social or
psychological circumstance.
<p>
But the President will try to project that he's just so concerned about 
women's health and that he signed such a law in Arkansas, and if only 
that could have been there, he would have signed it, but in fact, his 
allies all know that that was a gutting amendment which the Senate defeated, 
and it remains to be seen.
<p>
I think the grassroots pro-family and pro-life movement know that that is 
extreme, and they are really catching on and getting the word out.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that the best thing that happened in the 
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act debate was that we talked about what's 
actually happening in abortion clinics.  What do you think the take-home 
message is for pro-life Americans as they have seen some success, even
if the President does veto it?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think that the educational issues are very important, 
that it is important to talk directly about the issue, let people understand 
what the realities are, and to use this legislation as a focal point to
show that the license for abortion in this country is so broad
and so extreme that it really needs to be addressed.
<p>
It is an uncomfortable issue for many people.  They would rather not deal
with it.  But this is the type of issue that causes them to take
a second look.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  There has been a lot of attention on Speaker Newt Gingrich, 
on his high negatives, on possible ethics problems.  Is his persona going to 
be a problem for Republicans as they are dealing with the budget debate?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think it is causing some problems in that it really 
has emboldened the Democrats.  They feel that they have him on the
run a bit, and that once they start digging into even this limited
ethics probe that is now in place, that it might open the door
for a wider probe.
<p>
I think they do have to be careful, though, if they start down this 
road and seem obsessed with this, that their candidates are not talking about 
the issues; that it could have a backlash.  But right now it does seem to 
have energized them, and some of the comments, particularly the reference to
the treatment on the airplane back from Israel and how that might
have impacted on decisions regarding the budget, have been unfortunate
and probably overstated.  I don't think that that really had anything
to do with the decisions on how that budget was handled.  I think
that was the way things were going anyhow, but it is unfortunate
that the Democrats and some of the media had an opportunity to
cast it in those terms:  He shut down the government because he
was mad at the President type of argument.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Representative Enid Waldholtz, a Republican of Utah, is sort 
of struggling with her own values issue right now.  Her husband is going to 
be indicted, and she came forward recently and said, &quot;I'm innocent and
I'm not going to resign my seat.&quot;  What impact do you think
that is going to have on what is going on now?  Any at all? Is
this bad for the GOP or is this just bad for Representative Waldholtz
personally?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, it is certainly problematic for her personally. 
There are some out there now who are starting to make the charge, &quot;Well, 
look at these hypocrites. These were the family values candidates, and 
they're hypocrites.  Some of them have had troubled marriages, there are a 
few divorces, and in one case the spouse of one of the members admitted to 
being unfaithful.  And yet they are trying to say that this somehow
suggests that there's a values problem for that member of Congress.&quot;
<p>
So these are very curious charges, and what people stand for is
not really related to perhaps potential failings of a few members.
 You have to look at the broader issues.
<p>
The same people who are trying to zero in on this are trying to ignore some 
of the other issues that the Senate Banking Committee is now looking at 
and gross inconsistencies in who knew what about Whitewater and related
issues, and many of the people in the press who are looking at
every little iota they can find about Newt Gingrich are very anxious
to avoid the issues of who might have obstructed an investigation
of wrongdoing, and so on, within the administration.  So there
is a double standard that has been there for a long time, and
this continues to be a problem.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Marty, we appreciate taking your time from up on the Hill. 
Thanks so much for being with us today.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we'll be joined by Bill 
Mattox, Vice President for Policy at Family Research Council. He will 
bring us his perspective on divorce and how it will affect almost 1 million 
children this year.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[From marriage ceremony segment]:
<p>
MINISTER:  In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
and what God hath joined together, let no man put asunder, and
you may now kiss your bride.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Today, when people think of marriage, all too often the next 
word that comes to mind is divorce.  The 50 percent divorce number comes 
from a yearly comparison of the number of new marriages to the number of 
divorces. Overall numbers are not as bleak.  The fact is that one-quarter
of all those who have ever been married will also be divorced.
<p>
Still, divorce links all American lives because, directly or indirectly,
we have all been affected by it.
<p>
MALE INTERVIEWEE: My parents got divorced when I was real young.
<p>
FEMALE INTERVIEWEE: My parents were divorced when I was 10 months old.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In fact, the prevalence of divorce may be the factor which creates 
the acceptance and understanding of this phenomenon, one which leads
to an increase in child abuse, juvenile crime, sexual promiscuity,
teen male suicide, and even more broken homes.
<p>
Divorce, amazingly enough, also increases one's chances of health problems. 
The <i>American Journal of Public Health</i> found that either the breakup
of one's marriage or the divorce of one's parents significantly
reduces the average lifespan.  Divorced men who don't smoke have
only a slightly lower risk of dying from cancer than those who
smoke a pack of cigarettes a day.
<p>
Considering how divorce negatively impacts so many lives, it is interesting -- 
and disheartening -- that the divorce rate has tripled over the last 30 years.
<p>
MALE INTERVIEWEE: I just think it's a product of our society in general.
<p>
FEMALE INTERVIEWEE:  I think there's a lack of commitment, that
marriages are easier to get out of, and there's just not the commitment
to the family that there used to be.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But, as the people who have watched the breakup of their own 
homes or the homes of loved ones can tell you, it's not easy to save a 
marriage. There are no easy solutions to this epidemic problem.  But the
research agrees with those who have struggled through:  it is
worth the effort.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  With us tonight is Bill Mattox, Vice President for Policy with 
Family Research Council.  Bill has been examining the divorce issue for years 
and has been widely published on the subject of divorce effects on the very 
young, seen not too long ago in the tragic suicide death of singer Kurt
Cobain.
<p>
Bill, welcome.  Thanks for being with us again on <i>Straight Talk</i>. 
You have been tracking the impact of divorce for a long
time.  What kinds of trends are you seeing, especially over the
last 30 years?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, in terms of the actual prevalence of divorce, the 
divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has kind of plateaued since that time. 
We have seen a slight decrease since that time in the number of divorces 
in each year.  But it is still a very, very serious problem, and especially 
when you look at this from a historical standpoint, comparing the prevalence 
of divorce today to two or three generations ago.  Many, many more people 
are affected today; many more children are affected today than ever before.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When a lot of the movie industry in the 1960s and
1970s very much glamorized divorce and glamorized let's get out
and be all that we can be, and now we've kind of seen what we
are in divorce.  What impacts happen to the people who actually
divorce?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, you know, this is really one of the
most interesting things about this subject, though it is a sad
note, is that if you talk to a lot of that 20-something generation,
those kids 18 to 30 years old that we have been polling in several
of our public opinion surveys, you find that concern about this
issue is greater among that group than among older Americans,
and I think part of it is because many of them have grown up in
an era where divorce was commonplace, where it was at one point
glamorized.
<p>
And yet they have seen the negative fallout and have experienced 
that firsthand, either in their own lives or perhaps in observing 
the lives of their friends.  And it is not a difficult thing to 
convince them that this is a serious problem and one that really 
ought to be addressed.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I think one thing that I found interesting.  Family Research 
Council is getting ready, under your leadership, to do a state-by-state 
divorce stats release -- it is going to be coming soon -- that, state by 
state, the statistics are different.  What did you see in that?  I found
that very fascinating.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  It is interesting that there are some significant differences 
between different states and, indeed, different regions of the country.  Oddly 
enough, you can reasonably predict the divorce rate in any part of the country
by knowing the number of days out of the year that a woman can
wear a bathing suit.  Now, I am not suggesting that there is a
correlation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Oh, my goodness!
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  But, basically, if you think of the sunbelt region, which 
includes, of course, the Bible belt, what you find is that divorce rates
in that part of the country are dramatically higher than in the
Midwest and Northeast.  The mountain states in the Far West tend
to have higher divorce rates, as well.
<p>
There are some important reasons for this.  One is that divorce rates among 
Catholics, Jews, and Mormons tend to be significantly lower than among 
Protestants, and so --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And they're in the northern regions.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Especially in the Northeast and Midwest, you have
a high Catholic population.  So part of the reason why you have
higher levels of divorce in the Bible belt than in, say, states
like Massachusetts -- I mean, get this.  Teddy Kennedy's home
state is number one in marital stability, and Donald Trump's,
New York, is tied for second.  Who would have ever thought it?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's fascinating.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  So the prevalence of a Catholic population is a major 
predictor here.
<p>
But perhaps an even more significant predictor of differences in divorce 
by state is the degree of social integration; that is, how rooted are the 
people living there in a larger community.  And what you find is that in 
areas of the Northeast and Midwest where you have had families that 
have lived in this area, in this neighborhood, for years and years and 
years, the communities are more stable. When couples go to marry, their 
families know each other.  There is a wide circle of people who can advise 
them about whether or not they're compatible and also a wide circle of people 
who can hold them accountable, to say, &quot;Look, we're counting on you
to make this marriage work.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: When you see marriages in less stable areas, more transient 
areas --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Like Washington, D.C., or Los Angeles, or commuter
towns.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Exactly.  What you have -- a lot of military
towns see this quite dramatically -- what you have, then, is situations
where people are quite often marrying without knowing a lot about
each other.  They quite often have dissimilar backgrounds, and
they do not have the community surrounding them to both advise
them and hold them accountable, which is so critically important.
<p>
And, indeed, this is, I think, one of the very important functions
that churches should be providing and, indeed, in some areas are
serving to provide, because we know that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: More counseling, more accountability -
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Exactly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A discussion of what you're getting into.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: That's right, because of the one things that we do know that
is rather encouraging in terms of the relationship between religion
and divorce is that those who attend church on a weekly or even
more frequent basis have dramatically lower divorce than do those
who attend less frequently or not at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Let's go through just a couple of quick things on that. 
There were an interesting series of dynamics on, if these things are in 
your life, you are less likely to divorce.  What are a couple -- five,
ten -- things that you see with that?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, sadly, even though a lot of young people who have gone 
through the divorce of their parents are worried about this, quite often 
they are at higher risk of divorcing themselves, partly because they 
haven't seen good role models in their own home.  And again, this is why
the role of the community is so important, and the role of churches,
to model good marriages, so that those who haven't seen it at
home can at least know what it is that they are striving for.
That's a significant predictor.
<p>
The age at which one marries often has a significant effect. The younger --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We were talking about this the other day.  So the 
50-year-olds and the 18-year-olds, they've got different sets of resources.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: That's right.  Those who marry in their teens are
at greater risk, in part because the maturing process has not
quite often taken full root, and so the marriages are more fragile.
<p>
Generally speaking, if you can make it through that first eight-year
period, that is when most divorces occur, is during the first
eight years of marriage.  There is also, then, a kind of upturn
when men and women hit mid-life crisis in their forties and whatnot.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  But if couples can make it through those kind of critical 
early years, then the chances of long-term success are much, much greater.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, I think what was interesting -- now, obviously, I just 
want to state Family Research Council would not want a battered woman or 
someone in a domestic violence situation to continue to be injured.  We 
are talking about marriage-strengthening patterns and things that
are generally true.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Oh, no question, and I think this is a very, very important 
point. If you look at public opinion data about adults, say, a year, two 
years, three years after the divorce has occurred, quite often what you find 
are folks who have very serious regrets, who believed that -- they believed
this lie, that divorce was going to be liberating; it was going
to make their lives easier.
<p>
And yet what they discover is that quite often they have merely exchanged 
one set of problems for another.  And many of them, at that one, two, three 
years out point are saying, &quot;Gee, we wish we had tried harder.  We
wish that we had given it a better shot, because maybe we could
have worked something out.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, as a person who married later, I can definitely say dating 
can be not all it's cracked up to be.
<p>
But marriage provides a lot of benefits that I was not aware of.  We were 
looking at the video piece. Health benefits. What are some of the 
surprising collateral benefits of marriage?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  It is interesting, and I guess the important point there to make, 
as well, is that the health benefits, though they are present for both men and 
women, they are especially present for men.  Men benefit significantly from
marriage in any number of different ways.
<p>
As you pointed out, there is a lower correlation for things like lung cancer 
as well as stomach cancer, less alcoholism, less depression -- all sorts
of health benefits that are associated with stable marriage. 
And it comes in part from the fact that they've got someone to
help encourage them to adopt good health patterns, to regulate
their diet, to encourage them to exercise, that kind of thing.
<p>
And there is a certain stability that comes into their lives that
isn't always present in cases where one is living alone, especially
if they are still dealing with the emotional fallout of a divorce
or a painful marriage.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, it is funny. I saw Zig Ziegler speak, a motivational 
speaker, business leader, talking about how men who were kissed on their way 
to work made more money than men who were not, which was an interesting 
statistic.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But I appreciate your being with us, Bill, and I would
encourage people to call Family Research Council for more data
on this.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we continue
to discuss divorce.  We will talk to some people who are practically
examining this issue state by state, and we will examine some
proposed changes in legislation which discourage an &quot;easy
out&quot; of marriage.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I would now like to 
welcome Larry Huff, Director of State and Local Affairs for the Family 
Research Council; and two individuals with whom Larry works closely:  Randy
Hekman, Executive Director of the Michigan Family Forum, and Dennis
Mansfield, Executive Director of the Idaho Family Forum.  Gentlemen,
welcome.
<p>
Randy, you have had an interesting career.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: That's true.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You have been a judge, a father of nine, lots of --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Not nine, just 12.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Just 12!
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  We've got to get that number right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Gosh, I demoted you.  I have to -- and as a judge, what
can you tell us about how no-fault divorce has affected us as
a culture?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Well, as we've already heard from Bill Mattox, it has 
impacted lives, certainly mothers' and fathers', but especially kids'. 
Seventy percent of children that are currently in juvenile facilities 
today have come from broken homes.  In fact, most of the people that a 
juvenile court judge -- and that was the kind of judge I was for 15 
years -- are from families where there has been divorce, or no marriage 
in the first place, but most of them divorce.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.
<p>
And you are in Idaho; you are in Michigan.  What prompted you all to say, 
&quot;Divorce reform is something we're going to take on&quot;?  Because 
it is certainly not the thing that is on the top of a lot of people's
lists.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  It really isn't.  In fact, if you were
to go through most of the state legislatures, you'd find that
most people would look at you, and they would say, &quot;Well,
why do you want to get rid of no-fault divorce?  Why do you even
want to engage in the debate over this?  It seems like you're
looking for an issue.&quot;  And that has not been the case.
<p>
We think the issue is already out there.  It's on every street corner,
it's in every broken family, it's in every bottle of booze; that
there's a divorce that is sort of divorcing, in a sense, the physical
from the spiritual across our culture, and it's happening family
by family.
<p>
So our thought was, if we were really to deal with the social ills 
that are involved in Idaho, which is a very conservative,
very pro-family kind of state that still is seventh in divorce,
along with Alabama, then we'd better engage in the debate now
and in essence be a point person on it.  So that's why we jumped
in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What are you seeing nationally, Larry?  Family
Research Council is taking on a divorce reform project.  But why?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  I think it is largely due, Kristi, to the fact that
there is just a recognition across the country increasing that
families who stay together are a model for a prosperous society
and virtuous society, and that that is the model that works, and
a recognition that with the breakdown of families comes the breakdown
of America, and it's beginning to impact more and more lives,
and when things impact us personally, I think it moves us to want
to make a difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I want to ask you all, a lot of people, they think, 
Yeah, divorce is bad.  Okay, what are we going to do about it?  Okay, 
try harder.
<p>
But you all are doing some things, some real things, to change how 
divorce works in America.  Please describe that.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  You see, back in the late 1960s, early 1970s, folks thought, 
well, you know, there is such acrimony in our courtrooms, and we have such 
a problem with divorce.  People are showing up.  They want to get a divorce,
and one of them has to pretend that they've been wrong or done
some sort of faults.  Let's eliminate that charade.  Let's just
have no-fault divorce, which means that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But they had to do that why?  Because you couldn't get a 
divorce --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  You couldn't get a divorce without showing some
fault.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  So the husband or the wife would admit to fault. They said, 
&quot;Let's do away with that.&quot;
<p>
Well, we now have no-fault divorce, which means that either party can get 
a divorce from the other party for any reason at any time. What that means 
is that it is legally easier for a person to divorce their spouse, even if 
they've been married for 20 years, than it is to fire someone that you hired 
last week. There is no legal way to stop that party from leaving.
<p>
The net result has been significant injustice for parties.  It has resulted
in women, particularly, losing major economic strength.  In fact,
one study shows that women lost like 72 percent of their income
following divorces.
<p>
No-fault divorce actually also hurts existing marriages. You don't 
really want to invest in something unless you feel that it is going to 
be worth my investment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  But you can't hold onto your spouse. They can turn away and 
walk away for any reason at any time. Why invest in that marriage? 
As a result, existing marriages are hurt through no-fault divorce.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So how will we change that?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Well, we're hoping in Michigan -- in fact, there is a
bill in the legislature in Michigan -- and our hope would be that
early next year we are going to see the first state in the Union
to reverse no-fault divorce.
<p>
What it would do, it would allow divorce based on mutual consent; that if 
both parties truly want the divorce, fine.  But if only one wants it -- the 
husband wants out so he can marry a new model, for example -- he can't just
walk away and get that divorce automatically.  He will have to
prove fault against that spouse of his or else get that spouse
to agree, and for both of them to agree, and basically, there
is going to be a financial transaction at that point to get --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: And that's the way it ought to be.  The man that deserts the 
person that he has committed his life to and the children that they have 
spawned through that relationship, it seems to me that he ought to own up to 
that commitment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So we are talking about a two-tier system.  If we
both agree, we both sign out, we're out.  If we don't agree, then
there's going to be some money changing hands.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Well, if they don't agree, there is going to have to be a showing 
of fault under those circumstances.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  I would shy away from calling it a two-tier system.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Okay.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  I would say, more importantly, that it
is the logical consequence of a covenant relationship; that we
have covenanted together to be one, and we're going to march ahead,
and if you want out, well, you know what?  There's a price for
everything, and that price may be that you just don't have an
easy out, whether it's the husband or the wife that leaves.
<p>
And in fact, what we're doing in Idaho is we're watching Michigan,
and we're hoping that, depending upon the movement of the governor
and the legislature in this, that would see Idaho, Washington,
Oregon, and other states come up, but we are definitely ready
to roll on this.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So there are a lot of states watching what is 
happening there?
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, there are other settlement formulas that are out there, 
aren't there, Larry, some saying that if there is a divorce that 
children's standard of living cannot change?  What are some of the other
options that people are looking at in a divorce formula?
<p>
MR. HUFF: There are a lot of disincentives built into divorce in 
different fashions, and what we found is that actually a lot of those end
up trying to reform marriage laws instead of reforming divorce
laws, and creating different types of marriages and this kind
of thing, and giving the courts a lot of latitude dealing with
what happens to the kids, and some of that is positive and some
of it is not.  But what we really want to focus on again is instituting
justice back into the divorce laws.
<p>
The number one product of government should be to produce justice, and that 
is just not happening in our divorce laws.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So what does the opposition say? It sounds reasonable.  You 
know, divorce is the number one impoverisher of women and children.  So why 
would I not be in favor of this?  And I'm sure you're not going to tell
me that your whole legislature is saying, &quot;Yes, let me sign.&quot;
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Well, a lot of them are.  Frankly, legislation doesn't
happen -- with all the possible things to enact into law, legislation,
even if there is general agreement, doesn't happen unless the
heat is turned up a little bit and the public seems to want it.
<p>
Frankly, the biggest obstacle is the public is just getting aware
of what this issue is, and so part of our job is to inform the
public, and the media has been helping us in Michigan to do that,
and I'm grateful for this program to do the same.
<p>
But the only opposition that we have seen, frankly, has been a number of 
family lawyers.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: They are earning their keep with no-fault divorce, and they may 
have some concern that if things change, maybe they'll have a hard time 
earning their keep.
<p>
It is interesting that back when the law changed in 1972 from fault to 
no-fault, the lawyers opposed that change, as well.
<p>
Interesting -- the feminists -- there are many feminists,
believe it or not, who favor a return to more of a fault system,
because women typically -- again, men get really beat up by no-fault
divorce as well, but a lot of women do, especially those that
have custody of the children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And get exchanged for the trophy wives.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  That's right, and they end up -- no-fault divorce says, Hey, 
we're just going to be even split, everything right down the middle.  But 
the typical woman earns 75 cents on the dollar for every man, and so 
following that divorce, that is why women's income plummets, typically.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And the man's generally goes up, I think, what, 40 percent?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Well, that's one study.  I've seen other studies suggest
that it's even or it may even go down a little.  Nobody really
wins big time through divorce; few people do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Right. But nobody gets hurt like the children.
<p>
MR. HUFF: That's right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to talk a little bit more about
that in just a moment and, Dennis, hear more about what is happening
in your state, as well.
<p>
Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i> following this commercial break. We will hear more about 
the tragedy of divorce, both nationwide and state by state. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. Tonight we're talking about divorce and the 
crippling effect it has on individuals, as a nation and as a whole.
<p>
I am joined once again by Larry Huff from the Family Research Council, 
Randy Hekman of the Michigan Family Forum, and Dennis Mansfield of the
Idaho Family Forum.  Welcome back.
<p>
Larry, when we're taking a look at divorce, it's hard not to look at 
children. It's not just about a man and a woman.  There are, a lot of 
times other, other people involved.
<p>
What have you seen when it comes to divorce reform?  Are children going to 
be better off?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Well, we think they will, Kristi, because, as you mentioned, in 
the wake of these breeches often lie kids with broken hearts, and
the opponents of moving back to a system that requires more justice,
these opponents say, &quot;You know, if you do this, you are going
to reinstitute bitterness and acrimony back in the process.&quot;
<p>
I think that's just really a naive view, because when people get
divorced, unfortunately, there's going to be bitterness there,
and what we have now is that bitterness is transferred to the
custody battles, and in those custody battles the kids are often
the ones that just really get hurt and get caught in the vise
between this acrimony that is there between the parents.
<p>
And so we believe that settling this issue at the beginning of the 
divorce proceedings will really take some of the pressure, at least in
the divorce process, off of the kids.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In a fault system, will the parent found at fault have 
fewer, perhaps, privileges in terms of the children?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  I really think that changing it more back to a fault system 
will actually give more clout to the more innocent party.  See, under 
current law -- just think through with me for a minute -- under the current 
law, where you can leave your spouse at any time -- let's take a classical 
example. The man does leave his wife and children that he has been married
to, say, for 15 years.
<p>
Right now, she is required to negotiate with him. He already has what he 
wants, which is the divorce. And so she needs to come to him and say, 
&quot;Look, if I can't have you and the family back together, at least give 
me the house, enough money to survive this experience, and custody of the 
kids.&quot;
<p>
And he could come back to her and say, &quot;Hey, look.  Don't
push me too hard or I'll go for custody of the kids.&quot;  And
I have seen illustrations of that in real life.
<p>
If we change the law like we're hoping to do in Michigan, he does not 
automatically get the divorce he wants.  He will be required to negotiate 
with her.  And again, she can say, &quot;Look, if I can't again have
the family together, at least give me these three things.&quot;
 He will have to pay a higher price, you might say, to get out
of the commitments he has made.  And that's justice.  That's the
way it ought to be done.
<p>
Now, let's not sound sexist here.  Often -- in fact, I have some 
illustrations where men come home from work and are aghast.  Their wife, 
their children are gone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly. It happens.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  The divorce has been filed.  Next thing they know, they're 
obligated to be paying child support.  Wife is now living with her boyfriend 
with the kids, and he has to subsidize it and gets to visit with his kids at
McDonald's every other week.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's sad out there, especially for people who don't want 
the divorce.  What if you don't want a divorce?  Can this change result in no 
divorce?
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: I think what it really does, it results in the opportunity
for discussion, because right now, when that spouse leaves and
the divorce papers are sitting there on the table and the husband
comes in from a camping trip and his kids are gone or the wife
comes -- there is no discussion.  You know, that decision has
been made.  They're out the door.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: What we're hoping for is that there's an opportunity to 
come back to not necessarily a rekindling of that spark that happened
but at least civil discussion that may ultimately lead to reconciliation.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  You know, it could be done, though.  There's a group
called Retrovive(?), which is a Catholic-oriented group.  These
consist of folks who have been to the brink of divorce.  Many
of them have been through divorce and have worked themselves back
together, the word &quot;rekindling.&quot;  I mean, they have
rekindled the relationship; they are more in love now than they
have ever been.
<p>
They then mentor other couples whose marriages are on the ropes, and 
they have an 80 to 90 percent cure rate, believe it or not.  That is an 
amazing --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is a phenomenal --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  And they're around the country. It's a big group.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  And even those that aren't in an official capacity -- my wife 
and I have poured ourselves into two families, one that was divorced for nine 
years, the husband and the wife.  They remarried and they have had now five 
years of marriage that has been outstanding.
<p>
Another that was separated, husband and wife, for a year and a half.  We met 
them through a series of Providential occurrences, acted as agents to bring
them back together.  They've been married now for two and a half
years.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Great.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of the things that we have seen here at Family Research 
Council looking at the data is partnering troubled couples with healthy 
couples --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: -- that that is a tremendously successful thing to do. And 
there have been even discussions of requiring some counseling in a 
no-fault/fault situation. Is there consensus for that, Larry, on a 
national level?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: For requiring counseling?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Yes.  There are a number of states introducing divorce reforms 
of all types, and the most popular divorce reform is to require counseling 
both on the front end and what they call so-called reality therapy for 
those who want to divorce.  Before you get a divorce, you just need to 
understand some of the implications.
<p>
The one caveat that I think we all have a consensus on is that we want 
that to be done -- we think it is a good thing to provide it, as long as 
it is done by people who are in the business of counseling; that is to say, 
private-practice people, the church, people like that, not government 
counseling. We don't think government counseling is the proper solution.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right. The government's good at taking your money,
but saving your marriage?
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  No, not good.
<p>
MR. HUFF:  It's just not under their purview; it is just not a
positive thing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And wouldn't there need to be a bias in favor of saving 
the marriage?  I think one thing I am concerned about is, in the 1970s and 
1980s, there was a bias toward counseling to get out.  You know, &quot;You're 
right; you're stressed.&quot;
<p>
MR. HUFF: Self-actualization.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Right.  Really, no-fault divorce has that same bias.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  We give all the legal clout to the party
that wants to break the relationship now and no legal clout to
the party that wants to preserve the relationship. It shouldn't
be that way.  If marriage is that important to our culture, which
it is, if anything, the presumption should go the other way. 
We need to change that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think it takes too much to the therapeutic 
state of mind that we would require counseling? Are you at all 
concerned about that, that we're a little -- are we headed into 
psychobabble land?
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  Well, no, I don't think that's the case, but I do think 
that it goes back to the issue of communication.  For example, we were 
talking earlier about communities who have made a decision in our clergy 
to come together and say, &quot;This is our basic understanding of the
covenant of marriage.  Let's have counseling before marriage.
 Let's have counseling before a divorce.&quot;
<p>
What these covenants have been -- in fact, I think the entire state of 
Michigan may ultimately move towards that.  Isn't that right, Randy?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: They're looking at it, yes.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  In fact, the clergy are coming down there and saying, 
&quot;Look, you cant' leave me, as a Methodist, move over to that guy who 
is a Presbyterian and get married without going through this type of 
pre-marriage counseling.&quot;
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  That is not legislatively induced.
MR. MANSFIELD: No.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  And they've done it in communities -- Peoria, Illinois; 
Modesto, California; Louisville, Kentucky; certain communities -- all 
the religious leaders of all denominations have come together and said, 
&quot;Look, we can agree on two things. We think marriage is great; we 
think divorce is bad.&quot;  And so let's just commit that we will not 
intentionally marry someone in our churches, our synagogues, whatever, 
unless these folks have first gone through four months of premarital 
counseling, mentoring with an experienced married couple, some premarital
testing, maybe some conflict resolution discussion.
<p>
It has been amazing how the numbers of divorces, like in Peoria, have 
gone down 20 percent from the year they instituted this, and stayed
at a lower level, and in other communities that have done it.
 We're thinking of doing that for the whole state of Michigan,
by the way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's fascinating.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  But again, totally outside of the legislative control.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: There has to be that private-public partnering.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  We really view it as two rails on a road that brings the 
locomotive of our culture down in a quick way.  One is law, one is culture. 
Our belief is that if we can help encourage the clergy to realize that those
two things are true -- marriage is good and divorce is bad - 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: -- and then have accountability with it, the locomotive that 
we have sort of attached our culture to can have a smooth trip.
<p.
Right now, I am telling you, there are all sorts of curves and problems up 
ahead, and we've got to take a leadership position.  Quite frankly, the 
legislative leaders and federal leaders are not even talking about it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: No, they're not.  And I was wondering, Larry, on a state 
level, are there some states that are not interested in this at all?
 I mean, you look at a state like Nevada.  They make a lot of
money from the divorce machine.  I mean, they practically advertise
it.
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Well, it is easier to get a divorce in Nevada than
in any other state in the Union, and the divorce rate in Nevada
is higher than any other state in the Union.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: An interesting connection.
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Yes, there is a nexus there. And, yes, I think that we have a 
ways to go in shaping a consensus that justice needs to be reinstituted. 
I mean, some folks still are just not interested.  But again, I think there 
is an awakening, and I think folks are beginning to perk up and say, 
&quot;Wait a minute.  We have a responsibility here.&quot;
<p>
I mean, again, healthy marriages are the basis of civilization, and it has 
been so for centuries, and just a recognition that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And is &quot;justice&quot; the word for it?  Is that the 
phrase that you are taking forward?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  I think it really is. Yes, it is.  I mean, again, we want people 
to recognize their duty and their responsibility, and the law is a teacher, 
and the purpose and the product of law should be justice, and that's what
we must reinstitute into the divorce process.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That seems to have been almost the unspoken thing, that the law 
became the enemy of marriage rather than the advocate of it.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: I think you're right.  Also, I think that in what Larry has 
talked about regarding justice, that needs to be the point of discussion.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to talk more about this.  When
we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at the Family Research Council's
efforts to shed some light on an interesting and possibly criminal
issue related to the famous Kinsey sex reports.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. The Family Research 
Council's Director of Cultural Studies, Robert Knight, has been 
investigating the famous Kinsey reports and, with the supportive work from 
Dr. Judith Reisman, wrote and produced a documentary which provides shocking 
evidence that the Kinsey Institute could have ben involved in the sexual 
abuse of children as part of the famous Kinsey human sexuality studies.
<p>
Just last week, Bob was asked to participate in a news conference called
by Congressman Steve Stockman.  It was an attempt to spur the
government to further investigate those possible criminal allegations
involving Dr. Kinsey or other sex researchers working with him.
<p>
Let's take a look at Robert Knight's insights as <i>Straight Talk</i>
brings you Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
[From a press conference held December 7, 1995, on the Child 
Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995]:
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE STOCKMAN: Today we are going to be dropping a bill that 
asks that Congress to look into whether there was any violation of the 
law regarding a study by Kinsey.
<p>
I as a public servant have no greater duty to this country than to protect 
the most innocent, and that's the children.
<p>
We are not accusing anybody at this point of anything. We are asking 
merely that we look into the study to see if there was any criminal 
activity.
<p>
What I as a government official would like to do is to find out if the 
government was involved in molesting or manipulating poor, young children for 
the benefit of so-called pseudoscience.
<p>
We are not here to ask for anything more than to look into whether criminal 
activity may have been taking place.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Hi.  I'm Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies
for the Family Research Council, and I'm writer and director of
<i>The Children of Table 34</i>, which is a half-hour documentary video
that we just released that exposes the use of children in these
sexual experiments.
<p>
It is founded on the work of Dr. Judith Reisman, who has been courageously 
trying to uncover this mystery for more than 15 years, or about 15 years. 
I mean, talk about tenacity. Dr. Reisman has been at it for more than a decade, 
and she has been ignored.  The scientific establishment has chosen not to
take up her case, and it is time they did so.
<p>
This bill, the Children Protection and Ethics in Education Act, merely asks 
Congress to let some light into the Kinsey Institute and try to determine
what happened to these children about 50 years ago in Alfred Kinsey's
famous sex studies.  He has clear tables of data revealing systematic
molestation of children.
<p>
Most recently, because of statements made by Dr. John Bancroft, current 
director of the Kinsey Institute, we have reason to believe that what Dr. 
Kinsey wrote and what the current Kinsey Institute is saying are quite at 
odds. At the very least, we have a scandal of accuracy, and at worst, we
have a scandal of criminal molestation of children in the name
of science.
<p>
We are asking Congress -- and we commend Representative Stockman, who 
is bringing this forward, along with 41 of his colleagues -- to do 
something that should have been done years ago.  Dr. Reisman pointed it 
out, that there really is no statute of limitations on crimes of this 
magnitude.  The Nuremberg laws were clear. You can't sweep something 
under the carpet for 50 years and hope it stays there.  The truth 
eventually will come out.
<p>
We have high hopes that with Congress now opening the door, and perhaps 
with some cooperation from the Kinsey Institute, we can get to the
bottom of this.  I have more hope for that than I did before,
because Dr. Bancroft broke silence on the topic.
<p>
I just mentioned earlier that he said there was a problem with the data. 
Specifically, Dr. Kinsey wrote that there were nine pedophiles who 
collected the data on the children.  Dr. Bancroft now says there was one
elderly pedophile, now dead, whose name he refuses to reveal.
<p>
We are asking Dr. Bancroft to come out with this man's name. 
Surely, if you can uncover priests molesting children, oh, 10
years ago, 20 years ago, you can uncover the name of a guy who
was supposedly responsible for much of this research 50 years
ago.
<p>
It may lead to the unraveling of the mystery.  It may tell
us how the children were obtained for the experiments, where they
got them, whether parents gave permission, where the children
are now, which ones of the children are in need of care.  This
is a traumatic experience these children went through if in fact
the data is accurate in these tables.
<p>
So Family Research Council commends Representative Stockman, Dr. Reisman, 
and everybody who is trying to get to the bottom of this, and we wish for 
a speedy resolution of this problem.
<p>
Thank you.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
One week ago today, the most exceptional minds on welfare policy and 
the most successful front-line workers met together for the Family 
Research Council's &quot;A World Without Welfare Symposium.&quot;  The 
purpose of this extraordinary event, put together by FRC policy analysts 
Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson, was to talk about a world without 
the failed safety net of government but with the loving support of a 
dependable community. If you have ever asked yourself, &quot;Is there a way 
to help people really do better?&quot; please stayed tuned.
<p>
But first, let me share with you an insightful conversation I had with one
of the key symposium speakers, Dr. Virgil Gulker.  Dr. Gulker
is the founder and president of Kids/Hope/USA, which is a revolutionary
volunteer service model that helps people get involved in the
lives of needy children and families.  He has also authored several
books about real volunteerism, written from hard experience after
founding Love, Inc., an international network of over 300,000
church volunteers.
<p>
Let's hear Dr. Gulker's perspective on one-on-one support rather than 
anonymous welfare subsidies.  It's a story you're not likely to read in a 
lot of media outlets, as we take you behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're here today with Dr. Virgil Gulker.  Thank
you so much for being with us on Behind the Headlines.
<p>
Your program, Kids/Hope/USA, is revolutionary.  How did you get started in 
this kind of unique partnership program?
<p>
DR. GULKER: I had done a lot of work with church volunteer programs, because 
I just have the absolute conviction that within the larger Body of Christ
we have the most awesome potential to get to children and families.
 When I researched Kids/Hope/USA, however, I found that there
were some changes in program models that we had to look at; that
the experts I had talked to had very clear feelings about what
the local church could do.  Virtually everyone said, &quot;Get
these folks to come alongside young children at that time in their
life when their values are being formed, their self-esteem is
being developed.&quot;
<p>
Yet when I went to the churches and asked hard questions about what a 
program model could look like, the pastors were saying, &quot;Virge, 
please don't set up another agency or program.  You need to do this. You 
need to help us reach these children and families.  But we have so many 
agencies coming to us already, saying, 'Give us your money, give us your
prayers, give us your best volunteers,' and somehow that is going
to build up the church.  In reality, it's not building up the
church; it's weakening the church.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: My own church has caring ministries, a person who makes sure 
that you get a meal if you're sick or a ride to the doctor if you need
one.  It's a volunteer program.  Are we talking about a formal
volunteer program that is overseen in the church?
<p>
DR. GULKER: What I offer a church is a system that will show them how to
recruit, train, supervise, and affirm their members specifically
for relationships with at-risk kids who are identified within
the local elementary school.
<p>
We are not putting together a pool of church volunteers; we are putting 
together those individuals from your church, for example, who really catch 
the vision for a child.  And it is really a manageable vision.  We're not 
saying we want 20 or 50 hours a week.  We're saying, &quot;Give us an
hour a week for at least a semester, and you can change the life
of a child.&quot;
<p>
We are getting reports back from teachers and school personnel that are 
so extreme, I don't even dare to put it in our literature, because no one 
would believe it.  These teachers are saying that after two sessions with a 
church volunteer, they see significant academic and behavioral improvement 
in these children.
<p>
And I think it is important for the listeners today, too, to recognize 
that for so many of these young children, especially elementary school 
children, that the primary need is not food or clothing.  Those needs may be 
present, but the primary need is to have someone come alongside them and 
affirm them; someone to say, &quot;Billy, Judy, Samantha, Jasmine, you have 
value. I care about you. I love you.&quot;  And the best way to express
that love is just to put an arm around the child and be there
for them.  The results are incredible.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So what the church does is a local church says, &quot;We have 
a concern for children,&quot; and they would choose a neighborhood school, 
I am assuming --
<p>
DR. GULKER: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: -- a single school, an elementary school generally --
<p>
DR. GULKER:  Yes, right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And then you come in and say, &quot;All of you in
this church who are concerned about the children in the school
that is your community program, community school, we're going
to help you help these kids.&quot;
<p>
DR. GULKER: Right. In fact, we actually get involved a little earlier than 
that. Once they express interest, I don't ask them to make a commitment to 
do it.  I ask them to form an exploratory team.  We gather some folks
from the church and community and, together, we look at two questions:
 One, does the church have access to these children?  And to find
that out, we need to go into the elementary school.
<p>
I wish you could go with me on some of those visits to school as the 
principal, teacher, social workers, et cetera, sense that this collection
of people might be coming into the school to help them love the
children.  It is amazing what an impact that has on them.
<p>
The second question for us is, does that church have the commitment
and the capacity to do this kind of work?  Because we are not
just asking them to collect food baskets; we're looking for some
long-term relationships.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How do you define commitment and capacity?
<p>
DR. GULKER:  For me, first of all, it means finding
out whether or not a church really wants to pull this off.  Again,
because we're dealing with relationships, we dare not engage a
child if we're not serious about maintaining it.  I don't want
a church member or a church coming back saying, &quot;Well, Virge,
you didn't tell us that these kids don't smell so great,&quot;
you know, or that they're coming from homes where there's dysfunction
and so forth.
<p>
I had to find ways to really prove commitment and
capacity, and what I look for are a number of things:  One, I
want them to pay a part-time director.  Now, in churches that
ranges from a reasonable wage to a nominal fee for a church member.
 We always want someone from that church to direct the program
so we can develop and maintain relationships.
<p>
There is a modest budget that we ask the church to provide, and many 
of those line items can fit within the existing budget.  I ask, also, 
for a fee for my organization.  It is based on church size.  It ranges
from about $2,500 to $8,000 depending on the size of the church.
Right now we are working in churches ranging from about 150 members
to 3,500.  We are working experimentally with an inner-city church
with 30 members, and for them that fee is less.
<p>
Another commitment criterion for us is the willingness of the pastor to 
be one of the volunteers.  I cannot exaggerate the importance of a pastor
who puts his rear end on that little chair next to that child.
 The school and the church know at that point that they are committed.
<p>
We want a minimum of 10 volunteers who can go into the school.
 We recruit those volunteers plus substitutes; also, one prayer
partner for every adult-child relationship.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Earlier, you said that your program costs each church that 
participates a fee.  What does your program provide to the churches for 
that fee?  I am sure it doesn't underwrite the whole cost.  But what
would they receive?
<p>
DR. GULKER: It is generally about a third of what we need to set up a 
program in a church. But for that money, we offer the presentations to 
appropriate church audiences; we work with that exploratory team; we 
train the leadership team, the director; and then we provide the training 
through a Christian child psychologist for the volunteers who go into the 
schools.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The statistics on father absence in the inner cities
and in homes across America are brutal.  Clearly, this is a tremendous
social pathology.  Because of that, do you see a need for more
male volunteers?  Are you seeing the problem of father absence?
<p>
DR. GULKER: Our request now as we go into churches is that 60
percent of the volunteers be men.  I have nothing against women;
I married a woman.  But the reality is that I am so convinced
that Christian men can be God's gift to this culture if they are
willing to respond.
<p>
As we have men going into the school coming alongside these children, 
the children at first are mystified. Some of them, candidly, have no 
idea what a father model is like.
<p>
One school superintendent who reads to all of the kindergarten students 
in his district reported recently that after reading a story in a kindergarten 
class, a little girl came up to him and just looked at him very quizzically, 
and finally she said, &quot;So this is what it's like to have a daddy?&quot;
<p>
I don't know that the men in our audience, for example, know that if they
make that connection, they will never be the same, absolutely
be changed, guaranteed.  We will train you at two levels:  first,
relationship building, and second, the specific methods and materials
for working with that child.
<p>
Teachers who refer students are giving us, first, a list of positive 
characteristics of this child, because that is what the relationship will 
build around.  We need a specific objective for the child, plus we need 
periodic progress reports so that we know if we are proceeding in that child's 
life.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What would be an example of an objective for a child?
<p>
DR. GULKER: Aside from relational issues, a child may need help
in learning simply to read or to read with greater proficiency.
 We have had a number of children who don't know how to spell.
 We get second and third graders who cannot read, and again, if
they don't master that skill soon, they are not going to make
it.  The probability of welfare dependence, unemployment, drug
usage, all of those personal and socially destructive behaviors,
increase in a much greater level for these children who are not
mastering those skills.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How does a volunteer achieve relationship objectives? Is 
that accomplished by then just showing up?
<p>
DR. GULKER:  A quick story.  One of our volunteers, who is
one of the wealthiest people in her county, was matched with a
child who is from one of the poorest families.  The teacher said
to her, &quot;Betty, this child has lots of needs, including some
academic.  The primary need is for someone to let him know that
he has value.  Simply by being with him, by being a kind adult
role model, you are going to communicate that to him.&quot;
<p>
Betty noticed that her little boy needed shoes, and she said to the
teacher, &quot;May I buy these shoes?&quot;  The teacher said,
&quot;Please don't do that because it is going to have a devastating
effect on the family if you do that.&quot;  Betty could buy this
boy a shoe store; she is that wealthy.  Yet she needed to understand
that the boy's greater need was for love.
<p>
I talked to her recently, and she said that as she entered the school 
recently, the boy saw her at the end of the hallway, and he threw his arms 
open wide, and he began to run down the hallway shouting her last name:
 &quot;Mrs. Matthews, Mrs. Matthews!&quot; to love her, and when
he approached her, he just wrapped her in the biggest hug.  She
was impacting his life, because suddenly he felt good enough about
himself to accept her love and return that love to her.  It is
amazing how quickly that happens.  Children are wonderfully resilient.
<p>
We get terrible referrals sometimes:  the mother of a third-grade
boy who, after having another baby this past November, went to
court, decided she didn't want the third-grader anymore, and gave
him away.  He is now living with his grandparents, and we have
a man working with him.
<p>
I think it is important for us as Christians to recognize that Christ can 
use us to be the redeeming factor in the lives of these kids.  Without our 
involvement, we will lose a generation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we will bring you the 
highlights from the Family Research Council's symposium, &quot;A World 
Without Welfare.&quot;  You won't want to miss it.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are bringing you a one-of-a-kind welfare symposium, 
where those who are tackling our current welfare problems all over the 
country gathered to strategize on the kinds of changes needed to help
broken lives.  Let's take a look.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995]:
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: We do have quite a lot of work before us before we can say the 
phrase, &quot;World Without Welfare,&quot; and mean more than the title of a 
one-day symposium. This day will be devoted not only to arguing that the 
welfare state needs new limits but to outlining what will be required
of us, and social conservatives in particular, if we are to realize
those limits.
<p>
We are asking for a return to the vision of our founders, and the fact that 
calls for relimiting government and rebuilding civil society should sound so 
radical to our modern ears is really a testimony to how far wrong we have 
strayed, especially in the last 30 years under Great Society programs.
<p>
One of the founders' most important insights is that the freedom of 
individuals and the vitality of communities are not competitive but 
intertwined, and that assumption has staked out a large plot of common 
ground to be shared by conservatives of all stripes.
<p>
Of all the speakers here today, Dr. O'Lasky is probably the one who needs 
the least introduction.  His work has dramatically redefined the terms of
the national welfare debate.  Please join me in welcoming Dr.
Marvin O'Lasky.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
DR. O'LASKY:  Thank you all very much. Thank you, Jennifer.
<p>
Let's start out by thinking about all the people here who are not only 
well intentioned but also intent on seeing good results, who understand 
the difference between effective compassion and what is well intentioned 
but often does exactly the opposite of what it sets out to do.
<p>
The essential problem of the welfare system now is that sometimes it 
succeeds in keeping people fed, but it kills dreams.  It kills the helping
dream of many Americans.
<p>
There is good news around the country. Folks here in this room who are 
doing it know it, that we are recovering the lost tolls of charitable success. 
We are seeing a new great cloud of witnesses emerge.
<p>
We are living in an era with many heroes who, I should say, are ordinary 
people who become heroic as they show through hard suffering with, that the 
American dream of compassion is not dead.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. We are showing you some 
highlights from last week's World Without Welfare Symposium.  Now we have
the chance to hear from Dr. Virgil Gulker, whom I spoke with earlier
in the show.  He has more to tell us about the need for volunteers
to touch the lives of those trapped in poverty.  But it's not
as hard as you might think.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995.]:
<p>
DR. GULKER:  I want to thank Jennifer E. Marshall and the Family Research 
Council for convening this very singular gathering.  I know of no other 
similar gathering that I have heard of or attended around the country. I 
think they are giving us an opportunity to discuss the critical issues
facing all of our communities, the church, and especially the
poor.
<p>
I look at the 350,000 religious congregations in this country
-- average membership roughly 100 people per congregation -- and
I think of what those 35 million Christians could accomplish.
 Their potential is awesome.  Yet I hear so little about the role
the church and its members can play in this process of reaching,
reconciling, and healing lives.
<p>
The experience of Love, Inc., says very clearly that there are Christians 
in every community who are prepared to help, to give hope, to share love, 
if they are approached, if they have the appropriate training, and if
they are affirmed for that relationship.
<p>
As Jennifer said, what I learned with Love, Inc., through the 300,000 
volunteers was that we don't need heroes.  We need very simple, very basic 
people, people like me and like many of you, who are prepared to come
alongside someone who needs principally love, nurture, and affirmation.
 The church is that sustainable local organization.
<p>
If we can give them an infrastructure, a personnel department designed to
link their members with children and families in the neighborhood,
we can change the lives of the church members and the lives of
those people.  The church simply giving out food or money or clothing
is not going to make it.  That is the same kind of commodity distribution
that the welfare system has tried for so long, and it has not
worked.
<p>
We are the Body of Christ.  We have the most awesome potential
not just to share Christ but to share that transforming, reconciling
message that can change and empower lives.

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. Tonight's show gives you some highlights of
FRC's &quot;A World Without Welfare&quot; Symposium.  We now hear
from Don Everly, founder of the Commonwealth Foundation and the
National Fatherhood Initiative, as well as Robert Woodson, founder
and president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise,
dedicated to empowering low-income families.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995]:
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: The panel he will moderate includes spokesmen from both the 
think-tank world and the grassroots, and together they will explore what 
we might be able to do to foment a new social revolution, even while 
recognizing the limits of New York and Washington to address matters of the
heart.
<p>
So please join me in welcoming Don Everly, who will make
a few introductory comments, and then we will hear from our panelists.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MR. EVERLY:  I wanted to talk -- actually, being the wrap-up panel, we 
probably carry some obligation to try to tie together the day.  Actually, 
the interesting discussion this morning about libertarianism versus 
traditionalism sort of centered on an idea that I think is actually very 
important.
<p>
There are very important arguments to be made within public policy. There 
is also very important work to be done beyond this more sterile and
fragmented debate about the actual cause and effect of the rise
of the central government and what you can actually expect if
the central government pulls out, and that is to promote social
change by nongovernmental means.  It is sort of libertarian means
to traditionalist or moral ends, if you will.
<p>
I asked that the panel be entitled &quot;Building a New Social Movement,&quot;
or I would actually prefer &quot;new social movements,&quot; plural,
because I think social movements are very different than political
movements.  They tend to be very dynamic and grassroots and independent
often of political and policy affiliations, and I want to talk,
just to set the stage for discussion, about a few of those things.
<p>
But I ask that we consider this whole question of how we, as we
are moving into this very critical period with government retreating,
can actually conceptualize and try to implement broad-based social
change through social movement. So I really compliment the FRC
for stepping into this important arena.
<p>
So I think, having set the stage, I am going to encourage the panelists 
to move in any direction they wish with this, but the suggestion was that 
we use this panel to kind of talk about how we might work as leaders
-- moral, spiritual, social, community leaders -- to orchestrate,
direct, summon forth the kind of social change on a society-wide
basis.
<p>
I will first make the introductions very briefly, just
by giving you my own personal perceptions of these very distinguished
people.
<p>
Bob Woodson really is the founding father of the American
neighborhood empowerment movement and has brought more insight
to the changing concepts and techniques of how to reclaim neighborhoods
and empower people and empower families as well as anybody and
been a voice for that, bringing into our public debate a concern
for the empowerment of neighborhoods and families.
<p>
Moving along, Ronald Moore -- and again, you have his bio with you -- I 
have been hearing so much about the program in Mississippi, as I am
sure you have, Faith and Families, and we are very, very eager
to hear about the innovative work that is being done there to
sort of throw public leadership behind the importance of churches
in providing community-based charity.
<p>
But let's start with you, Bob, and we'll move right across the table.
<p>
MR. WOODSON: Thank you. Since I run an organization that conducts 
conferences, I will take seriously the charge to be brief.
<p>
The National Centers aids low-income people in 38 states to achieve 
greater independence and self-sufficiency, and we do this by going around 
the country and studying not dysfunction of low-income people, but we 
study their capacities and their strengths and identify them as the
experts, and we have learned some things out of that experience
that I will share with you that will constitute my remarks.
<p>
But I think [there are] some principles that should guide our work.
 Bill Bennett, not too long ago at a conference, said that liberals
look at low-income people as a class of victims and conservatives
tend to look at low-income people as aliens.  I think this is
true, that some of the principles that we follow, that we find
very useful, and that the goals should be not to protect people
but to give them the capacity to protect themselves.
<p>
The second principle is the low-income neighborhoods over the past 30 
years have seen $5 trillion worth of poverty programs parachuted into
their communities by professional providers, with the requirement
that they participate.  Now I am witnessing conservative paratroopers
strapping up, prepared to parachute in, with an emphasis on what
we as outsiders can do for those people inside, and I think this
needs to be rethought and challenged.
<p>
The other principle that we can do is that we need to be careful to strip 
labels from people. I think it is possible to be appalled at one group 
attacking another group because of their race or their religion.  We ought
to be upset about that, without having to identify the race of
the villain or the race of the victim.  We ought to be against
violence and insensitivity and bigotry, regardless of the perpetrators.
<p>
Another point that I think would be critical, and that is to not
just offer charity to poor people but use the considerable political
and economic strength of churches and church-goers and others
to remove the kinds of government barriers that prohibit faith-based
organizations from properly serving their own peers.  I think
professional credentialing is the primary barrier that low-income
providers have that is enshrined in state and local and federal
policy; that certification is not synonymous with qualification.
 It is elitist, and those elitists are not just liberals.  Poor
people have to confront conservative elitism, too.
<p>
And so, therefore, if conservatives really wanted to make a difference 
in terms of empowering people, they should work as we have done with the 
National Institute of Justice, Clint Boleck(?), World magazine, and 
Christian broadcast, when many of the groups that we help have transformed
the lives of thousands and thousands of hard-core drug addicts
by using Jesus Christ and the gospel.  But yet they are confronted
with state policies that require them to have master's degrees
as providers.
<p>
But yet it is very difficult to get conservative politicians interested 
in such an issue, and therefore, I think a group like this and others 
ought to look at ways that they can mobilize to remove the barriers.
<p>
The other thing we can do as a principle is to look upon some of these 
local providers not as objects of our charity but teachers of us, because 
many of them have overcome some of the greatest difficulties that life
ever serves up.
<p>
Secondly, they do not believe in rehabilitation. Rehabilitation attempts 
to restore you to what you were before. Grassroots people do not believe 
in rehabilitation. They believe in transformation.  They don't want the 
person to return to what they were before; they want them to return to a 
new person, to become a new person.  They are the experts at this, and 
there is a lot that we can learn.
<p>
I would like to see scholars sit at the feet at some of these experts, 
question them, explore with them how they were able to do what they do, 
and make low-income providers the experts.  It is quite possible today 
for people to be experts on poor people, be they left or right, and never
talk to a single poor person.
<p>
The other thing that I think you can do is to stop studying failure and 
study success.  Conservative scholars look down their nose at capacity 
studies of poor people. This ought to change.
<p>
And finally, I think that we need to remove the barriers that separate 
people across the divide, that we need to disaggregate poverty. Some 
people are poor because of external circumstance.  For people like that, 
a helping hand is all they need.  But the kind of poverty that troubles 
most of us is caused by moral and spiritual crisis, and that can be saved 
not by some outsider coming in offering a helping hand, but that outsider
should strengthen local providers.
<p>
What I find troubling about a lot of mentoring programs, it assumes 
that people, institutions that are indigenous to those communities do not 
have the capacity to heal.  So, therefore, I think, before you rush to 
recruit volunteers to go into low-income neighborhoods and reach out for a 
child, you ought to first determine whether or not there is a local antibody
that is resident in that neighborhood that is already doing that,
and what can you do to strengthen that local antibody to reach
that child.  Because sometimes, if I were to come into your home,
walk past you to tutor your child, take them to the zoo, and then
buy them shoes, what does it do to your relationship to your child?
<p>
So let's not assume that all low-income people are not responsible
parents or there are not institutions indigenous that could play
a constructive role. I will end on that.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>.  We continue
to bring you the Family Research Council's World Without Welfare
Symposium.
<p>
Now we will hear from the Reverend Ronald Moore, who
pastors two churches and is the field coordinator for the Mississippi
Faith and Families Program.
<p>
Then FRC's Jennifer E. Marshall, the symposium's creator and organizer, 
will give her insight into the day's successes and our welfare state's 
future.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995]:
<p>
REV. MOORE: Good afternoon.
<p>
So many times, we are concerned about being politically
correct.  Since I'm a Baptist preacher, I don't have to worry
about that.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
If I was an atheist this afternoon, I would tell you that man perhaps 
crawled up out of a slime pit; in his crawl, he lost his tail; that man 
wasn't created, he evolved. But I am not an atheist; I am a Baptist 
preacher. So God created man.
<p>
If I was Black Muslim today, I would tell you to put all
your faith and trust in Honorable Elijah Mohammed.  But my Bible
tells me that my Savior was born in Bethlehem. Elijah Mohammed
was born in Georgia.
<p>
My Bible tells me that my Savior would die one Friday afternoon on a 
cross. Elijah Mohammed died in a hospital. My Bible tells me that my Savior 
would get up the third day morning. Elijah Mohammed has been dead a long 
time. He hasn't gotten up yet.  So all of my faith and trust is in Jesus 
Christ. I believe that Jesus Christ changes lives.
<p>
A few years ago, before Kirk Fordice was elected governor of Mississippi, 
many people were wondering, what are we going to do about this decadent 
mess that we have in this state.  We are the poorest state in the Nation.
 We have the highest rate of unemployment.  We have the highest
rate of teenage pregnancy, and we have more children being born
out of wedlock than any other state in the Union.  So we've got
some problems.
<p>
But finally, our governor, after riding through our state, looking at this 
decadent mess that we have, going from housing complex to housing complex, 
going from community to community, just threw up his hands and said, 
&quot;Listen. Government created this mess.  Maybe government can help fix 
it, but not alone. Government can only help.  But this problem has to be 
turned over to an entity that has been empowered to change not just conditions
but change the lives of individuals.  This needs to be turned
over to an entity that doesn't just treat the effects of problems
but can treat the cause of the problems.&quot;  He asked the local
churches to become involved in the lives of welfare recipients.
<p>
You know, we have spent, someone said earlier, over $5 trillion
in this war on poverty, and in Mississippi we have had every job
training program that you can imagine. We have had every food
program, every program that you can imagine to help the homeless
and help children that have been born out of wedlock, and we're
still in the same condition we were in some 15 years ago.
<p>
So what needs to be done?  Well, first of all, we realized that we had
to get the churches involved, that we needed some positive grassroots
action from the local level to engage the lives of these AFDC
families.
<p>
The governor of our state asked all of our churches -- we have 5,500 
churches in Mississippi -- to adopt at least one welfare family.  We 
have 55,000 AFDC recipients in Mississippi, and out of that 55,000, if you 
were going to see the profile on a particular family, you are probably 
going to find out that these families, 80 percent are African-American 
mothers. You are going to find out that they read perhaps on a sixth, seventh, 
or eighth grade level, and most of them have four to five children, and
they haven't worked in the last 10 or 12 years, and they have
all been on AFDC all of their lives.
<p>
So he realized we had a problem and realized that we needed to work with 
these AFDC recipients. So what must we do?  Well, we asked the churches to 
become involved. We asked every church to adopt a family.  And in Mississippi,
we have the only state-church-family partnership right now in
the Nation.  The program is called Faith and Family.  We ask that
each and every church would adopt one family that has been referred
to that church by the state.  Each and every family is an AFDC
family.
<p>
We ask the church to adopt the family, determine the needs
of that family, and address those particular needs.  Each and
every church has some idea of how they are going to address a
particular need of a particular family because those families
are normally centered around that church.  Normally, the church
members are aware.  They know these particular individuals.  And
the churches are only interested that can provide that one-on-one
intervention.
<p>
In Mississippi we have case workers that work for the state. Each case 
worker has about 250 clients that they simply call up and say, &quot;How 
are you doing?&quot; and they hang up the telephone.  We want to reverse 
the ratio. Why not, instead of having one case worker to 250 welfare clients, 
give one church with 250 members one AFDC family?  And you have 250 people 
seeing about one family.
<p>
We have been able to change some things with
that, because we have jobs programs in our state that have spent
$300,000 to $400,000 and have yet to put anybody to work.  We
have other programs that have worked with the poor, that have
worked with the homeless, and we have seen no results of their
work, basically because they have been trying to work with individuals
from the outside, and the church is able to work with them from
within.
<p>
We don't want to change just the condition; we want to
change the person, because if you change the person, the person
can change their own conditions.  When you walk into housing complexes,
you can walk in some apartments, in one apartment, walk into three
others without ever going outside, because you have people who
live there who don't care.  They have no hope, they have no responsibility.
 Since there is no responsibility, there is no sense of accountability.
 So we realize that there has to be a great change.
<p>
So as the church adopts the family and begins the program to change the
life of this family, to upgrade this particular family, to change
their life from a life of dependence upon the government to a
life of self-sufficiency, they move through that with a series
of courses.
<p>
Each and every church has gone about doing this differently.
 Some of them have taught basic hygiene, grooming, preparing resumes.
 All of this is taught, however, from a Biblical perspective.
<p>
In the past, in our jobs programs, they have been able to go to
school, sit there for an hour to hear what the teacher has to
say, and leave.  They go back the next day and the next day, and
they are in the jobs program some 10, 15 years, and they never
find a job because no one has really met the total needs, or the
real need hasn't been met.  So we have been able to address the
real need of the family.
<p>
This has really upset a lot of people because they really don't 
understand the concept of what we are trying to do in Faith and 
Families. No one is trying to proselytize families.  We are trying to 
take them and ask the church to find out what their needs are, introduce 
them to a divine entity. Hopefully, they will accept that.  If not, teach 
them other life-coping skills that this family can leave a life of 
government dependence to a life of self-sufficiency.
<p>
And it is so simple.  It is simply going back to the basics, because, you 
know, you have young ladies who are on AFDC, who have never worked.  She 
becomes 18 or 19. She has a child.  She moves out of the home of her mother, 
moves into an apartment, and she is asked to take care of that apartment.
 She receives a welfare check of $96 a month, a utility voucher
of $86 a month.  She is given a Medicaid card and given $306 of
food stamps and said, &quot;Listen.  Live your life.&quot;
<p>
We put her in that apartment.  We expect her to take care of it.
 But she doesn't know how to wash dishes.  She doesn't know how
to comb a child's hair.  She doesn't know anything about proper
grooming.  She knows nothing about health and proper hygiene.
<p>
So, consequently, when that child leaves home, he goes to school
and he tears up the classroom.  Consequently, when she leaves
home, goes to try to find a job, she will go into the person's
office who is going to hire her or interview her with five or
six earrings in her ear, six or seven in the other ear, an earring
in her nose, with braids all in her hair, because she has no concept
of what proper grooming should be like.
<p>
So we are asking the churches, have asked the churches, and the churches 
are doing this.  We are just simply going back to basics.  We'll teach 
them how to say, &quot;Yes, ma'am&quot; and &quot;No, ma'am,&quot; 
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; &quot;No, sir,&quot; how to carry yourself, how to
dress properly, how to spend your food stamps.  And, finally and
hopefully, we try to get them to accept Christ or try to get them
to change their total concept of the religious community.  Hopefully,
they will join the church.  But we cannot proselytize.  If they
decide to, that's fine.  If not, we don't worry about that.
<p>
But the state, the church and family working together, we have been
able to take girls who have never worked in their lives, who have
been parts of other jobs programs, who have worked with those
programs who have not been able to find employment for them. 
We have been able to put each and every one of these families
to work.
<p>
In the state of Mississippi now, we have about 190 churches
involved in Faith and Families over this one-year period.  Out
of that 190 churches, we have a total of about 200 families involved.
 At this particular time, eight families have been moved totally
off of welfare; another 55 are about to come off of welfare. 
We have another 206 churches about to enter the program.
<p>
If we can take every church in Mississippi and adopt five families,
we would have half of our AFDC population off of welfare and into
a work environment within a one-year period.
<p>
And not only that; we are addressing the residual effect of what has 
happened, because when you train the mother to go home and train her 
children -- and, interesting enough, what is so good that our church 
members have been able to see, we have been able to see a young lady that
we have taken into the church and train her in life-coping skills,
teach her how to take care of herself, and go back home with her
and watch that young lady take Clorox, take detergent, and clean
up that filth that she had been living in for the last 10 or 15
years.  It is remarkable how, when that change takes effect in
her life, that she will go back,and instead of passing the telephone
from apartment to apartment, she'll take sheetrock and nail it
up to the wall, take masking tape and mask it, paint the house,
because she realizes, she has learned that she needs to be responsible,
that she has to be accountable; that if she wants to go up, she
is going to have to be able to change her attitude.  And we have
been able to do that with each and every family that we have adopted.
<p>
The state's role in this program is simply to refer families to
the churches and to offer the ongoing technical assistance.  The
case management entity stays involved, because they are the advocate
for that particular family.
<p>
Now, one problem with our program, and you might find this in your state. 
There is a huge welfare bureaucracy in Mississippi, and they have tried 
everything that they could do to tear down Faith and Families, because the 
case workers feel that they are going to lose their jobs and that the
churches are going to become case managers.  The social workers
feel the churches are going to become social work entities.
<p>
So, a few months ago, they started sending us families with sixth,
seventh, and eighth grade educations, and everybody was saying,
&quot;Listen.  There is no way you're going to be able to place
these people.  They can't do anything.  Most of them can't read,
they can't write, they don't know how to talk.  What are we going
to do with them?&quot; And our governor was a little worried about
that.
<p>
Within the last month, we put together a database of about
15,000 families in Mississippi.  Each of these 15,000 families
have a specific need, and that need is they need domestic workers.
 They need someone to come into those homes that can wash dishes,
that can clean floors, that can wash the windows, that can take
care of children, and we're going to refer these sixth and seventh
and eighth grade clients; we are going to train them and refer
them to those people who need domestic workers.  Domestic work
in Mississippi is not like it was 40 years ago.  Domestic workers
make $250 to $350 per week.  Most of them have medical and dental
coverage.
<p>
What I am simply saying is, every individual can find
work, and whenever they find work, there is a sense of dignity.
 It develops dignity, it develops accountability,   it develops
responsibility, and their moral and their ethical lives are changed,
and I am not talking about a temporary change; we are talking
about a permanent change.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MR. EVERLY: Very good.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: I just want to close by saying that I think, in
the end, we are going to adopt our answers by default, because
there is no alternative strategy, and at the moment we really
sort of have two competing alternatives.  Either we create an
underclass and we treat them as wards of a custodial state and
we just spend lavishly to keep them comfortable while we ask them
to leave us alone, or we can begin restoring functions to neighborhoods
and communities and to churches.
<p>
I think the fate of our experiment with self-government really depends on 
our capacity to begin renewing a sense of responsibility but across all 
income brackets, coupled with a renewed commitment to our founding fathers' 
faith that all men, every single one is created equal to live up to those
responsibilities.
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
Tonight <i>Straight Talk</i> is celebrating Christmas with you, sharing 
the sights and sounds of the holiday season throughout our Nation's 
Capital. It's easy to forget sometimes that Washington, D.C., is a city
of many people with lives and families and special traditions
of their own.
<p>
We will be showing you how a very special organization
makes a difference in the lives of children who are not fortunate
enough to share Christmas with their parents.  These are the children
of adults who are incarcerated.
<p>
And we have a surprise guest, Dr. James Dobson, president and founder of 
Focus on the Family, a best-selling author and psychologist, and a man who 
has been a powerful voice for family, reaching millions every week.
<p>
But first, let's hear from Phil Olsen, the Family Research Council's
Vice President for Resource Development. In his many travels across
the United States, Phil has had the opportunity to talk to Americans
face to face, building relationships on behalf of FRC.  But his
career, like his brother, Merlin Olsen, began on the football
field as an award-winning athlete.  His work with children's sports
camps and charities led eventually to Family Research Council.
 So join me as Phil Olsen shares his experiences through the eyes
of a caring citizen, not a politician, as we take you behind the
headlines.
<p>

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are very excited that Phil could join us today on Behind 
the Headlines.  Phil, you and your staff travel around the country.
 You meet a lot of people, real Americans.  At this time of year,
what is uppermost on people's minds?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Well, Kristi, we do get the opportunity to travel quite a 
bit. As you know, we have a field staff that represents the Family Research 
Council, and we have the opportunity to travel around the country and meet
with our donors and our supporters, and it is truly a phenomenal
opportunity for us to get a chance to meet these people.  And
there are a number of things on their minds.  They are very concerned
about the direction that America is headed.  They are very concerned
about the impact that decisions that are being made here in Washington,
D.C., will have on their families.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In fact, Family Research Council, under your staff, does a poll 
of the people who support us. What did they say were their top concerns in 
the poll that you all did this year?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  Actually, we did a poll earlier this year, in January and February, 
and it is important to us as an organization that is representing families in 
America to find out what families in America think are important, the
issues that are important to them.
<p>
We were interested to discover that, this year, the most pressing issue on 
people's minds has been education, you know, what is going to happen in 
terms of the education of their children.  And parents are very concerned
about the Federal Government's intrusion into the education of
the young.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Any surprises in the poll as you were taking a look at it?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Not really. I think that issues that are important to America -- 
sanctity of life, abortion, pornography, health care -- a lot of these are 
near the top of that list, as well.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Phil, you have had a very broad career:
 one of nine; you were a football player with the L.A. Rams and
with the Broncos; you have worked for network television.  You
have spoken, you have worked with kids.  You have seen people
who are very wealthy, people who are very poor.
<p>
What common themes, though, do you see?  Are these people facing the same 
kinds of problems on the different ends of the spectrum?  What are people
really struggling with?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  I think we all face the same problems. I mean, some might have 
more money than others, and maybe the ability to buy some success or to buy 
some relief, but I think, in the final analysis, Kristi, we are all faced 
with the same challenges, and that no amount of money, no amount of
power or prestige or opportunity can really make up for failure
in the home.  No success really can make up for failure in the
home.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Is that what is driving people, a concern
over the success or failure of their homes?  Is that the kind
of common challenges you are seeing?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I think so, and I think that people -- unfortunately, too many 
people -- are listening to the messages of our culture, and our culture 
does not tell them the truth.  And I think that there is a lot of 
frustration there as people chase solutions that they think are going to 
provide them with the kind of happiness and satisfaction they seek, only
to find, when they get there, that there is nothing there but
an empty bag.
<p>
I think there is a lot of frustration, a lot of disappointment, in our 
society, and I think that that is another reason why people are coming back 
to issues that affect the family, because they realize that in the final 
analysis, they need to protect their family.  They need to protect their 
children. They need to try to create a situation and a circumstance where 
they can provide for the needs of their children without the fear of
intrusion from the outside.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: There are a lot of people out there who may be in their 
sixties and seventies and eighties who would define themselves as liberals 
or moderates, or on all different sides of the political spectrum.  Are you 
finding that, though, the presence of children and people kind of grappling
with home failures are bringing them back more toward a conservative,
pro-family side?  As you look at our constituents, have they come
from a lot of backgrounds to a pro-family perspective, or have
they always been there?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  I think that's a good point. I think that our constituents 
are across the spectrum.  I mean, you find them in every walk of life 
and in every financial circumstance, and I think that is one of the 
things that excites me, that we don't represent a small group of 
constituents out there; we represent Americans who, across the board, 
believe in the same kinds of things that we do.
<p>
We are talking about traditional Judeo-Christian values. We are talking 
about the values that have proven themselves over time.
<p>
One of the things that excites me about being involved
here with the Family Research Council, Kristi, is the fact that
every time we embark upon a research project, or every time we
validate research that has been done by others, it tends to validate
Biblical principles, principles that have been proven over thousands
of years to work.  And that is an exciting thing for me.
<p>
I think that our constituents out there are coming to realize the very
same thing.  They know what works.  They know what doesn't work,
and too many times out of bad circumstances or bad experiences
where they have seen things that have happened either in their
family or in other families.  It only brings back even that much
harder the message of the importance of protecting their family
and their children and their future.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: If you would describe a pro-family American, how would you 
describe that person? What are they like?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  Well, that's an excellent question. I think that to me a 
pro-family American is just that; he is pro-family. He is focused on 
the welfare of his family and of other families as well.  I think that 
these are people that we are seeing out there, and most of them are not 
only interested in what is best for their family but in trying to do 
things that would benefit other families, as well.  And so I think that 
that, maybe in a nutshell, would capture that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Phil, we thank you so much for being with us in Behind the 
Headlines and look forward to seeing you again.
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I thank you, Kristi. It has been great to be with you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, we will be taking you on a 
Washington, D.C., Christmas journey, and we will also be joined by Prison 
Fellowship's Mark Morgan, whose Angel Tree organization is brightening the
lives of many, many children, especially during this holiday season.
 Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[Christmas scenes.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  All over the Nation, families celebrate Christmas
and the holiday season with their own unique traditions.  But
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i> would like to 
share with you a glimpse into the many celebrations throughout 
Washington, D.C., as we take you on our own special tour of Christmas in 
the Capital.
<p>
[Christmas scenes.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Each year, the National Christmas tree lighting ceremony, 
which originated on December 24, 1913, draws people from around the world. 
<p>
Christmas and the holiday season have special meaning to each of us.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE: Christmas is a time for me and my family to get together and
come across the oceans and see how everybody has grown over the
year.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Christmas means a time of the year in which
everyone develops a sense of joy and happiness and finds pleasure
in doing for others to a degree to which afterwards you might
regret, but in any case, while Christmas is going on, it's a great
time.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Good will to your fellow human being and an
extra day off of work.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Christmas means time with my family and my friends and just 
a moment to reflect on life and be thankful for what I got.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE: Christmas means to me sharing time with my family, going to 
church, and buying lots of gifts for my kids.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Christmas to me is a time of giving and have thanks. Christmas 
is every day.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE: It means the spirit of giving, and we are celebrating the 
birth of Jesus Christ, and that is what it should be about.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ministries and outreach programs throughout Washington, 
D.C., help create some extra special Christmas memories in many lives.
<p>
[From Angel Tree celebration segment]:
<p>
SPOKESMAN: Angel Tree is a wonderful ministry of Prison Fellowship 
Ministries. It gives moms and dads that just happen to be away from their 
boys and girls at Christmas and who are in prison, it gives them an 
opportunity to fill out an application and to ask nice people, like the 
Congressional wives, if they wouldn't please buy a present for you so that 
you know that your mom and dad that can't be with you love you very
much.
<p>
And so that is what Angel Tree is all about.  These presents
are from your father or your mother that can't be here today,
and it says that your mom or dad loves you very much and that
Jesus Christ loves you very much, and we hope that this makes
your Christmas just a little brighter.
<p>
[Gift-giving segment.]
<p>
SPEAKER: So who did Jesus come for?
<p>
AUDIENCE: Everybody.
<p>
SPEAKER: All people, everybody from every land.  And whose Son is he?
<p>
AUDIENCE: God's.
<p>
SPEAKER: The Son of God.  Very good.  And that is the true Christmas 
story.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  With us tonight is Mark Morgan, the National Project 
Coordinator for Angel Tree Ministries of Prison Fellowship,. We just caught 
a small glimpse of how this ministry is impacting children's lives, and
Mark is here to tell us more.  Welcome, Mark.  Thanks so much
for being with us.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Thanks, Kristi.  It is great to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I hope by now that everybody has seen this little triangle 
somewhere in their church or in their community. But in case they 
haven't, what is Angel Tree?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Angel Tree is a gift-giving program for the children of 
prisoners at Christmas time.  It is an inmate-initiated program, where 
our local staff people all over the country take applications into
federal and state institutions and in some places county jails
and give those applications to inmates who fill them out, give
us the name, age, birth date of their children, and we pass those
out by location, almost by ZIP code, even, to churches and groups
in the community where the children are living.  So even federal
inmates, say, in Washington State, their children living in Georgia
will be served by people living in Georgia in that area.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it got started -- inmate initiated.  Someone said at one 
time, &quot;Wow, I wish somebody could give a present to my child&quot;?
 How did it get started?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  It started 14 years ago by a lady named Mary Kay Beard who 
was herself an inmate in the Julia Tetwiler(?) prison in Alabama.  She and 
several other women were incarcerated, and she noticed that the women 
were stockpiling like little soaps and toiletries, shampoos and things, 
that churches and volunteers would bring into the prison, and these women 
would stockpile them and then at Christmas time gave those as Christmas
gifts to their children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Wow.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: And when Mary Kay was out and now working as the Prison 
Fellowship area director in Alabama herself, she and another woman said, 
&quot;We've got to do something for the children of prisoners at 
Christmas time.&quot;
<p>
So in two malls, one in Montgomery, Alabama, and one in Birmingham, 
Alabama, they set up an angel tree and put paper angels, cut out in 
the shape of angels, on the tree with the names of about 500 children in 
the area, and then people, passers-by in the mall, would come and take the 
angel off. And so that year, over 14 years ago, 566 kids got gifts from 
their parents in prison on behalf of church volunteers and also passers-by 
in the mall.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Community and --
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Community members.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, today, though, you are serving up to a million?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  We think there are nearly a million children who
have parents in prison.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is amazing.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Prison Fellowship volunteers and churches and organizations 
across the country this year will minister to over 470,000 children,
we think, who have parents in prison.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I was very intrigued, reading a little bit about the program, 
that if your father was incarcerated or your mother was incarcerated, you 
have a six-times-more-likely chance to also go into a life of crime,
and often beginning in the third grade.
<p>
I hadn't thought of it like this before, but are you at Prison Fellowship 
looking at Project Angel Tree as a way to turn children from a certain path?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Definitely.  Angel Tree is merely just a present
-- it is more than just a present under the tree, but it starts
out as a present and it becomes a year-long involvement in the
life of that family through the volunteers in the community that
are getting involved through Angel Tree.
<p>
We see Angel Tree as being a foot in the door for year-round ministry to 
these families. Because the children are likely to end up in prison, many 
of the inmates who are in prison there now say that they also had
a parent or a sibling in prison.  And so we see a huge cycle of
crime, and we are trying to break that family cycle and get in
and close the gap that is caused by the incarceration; also make
an impact on the child's life.
<p>
We are doing more than just Christmas Angel Tree. We are now involving 
kids in other projects throughout the year to try to make an impact.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The first time I heard about Project Angel Tree was on a Dr. 
James Dobson -- and we get to meet him a little bit later in the program 
-- on a broadcast where they said, &quot;We need more presents.  We
have a tremendous shortage.  Mail little Walkmans to the Angel
Tree headquarters.&quot;
<p>
I mean, the coordination for prisoners and volunteers and delivery, that's 
a lot of people.  I mean, how have you guys handled the growth from 500 
presents in a mall to a million children today?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Well, it is a logistical challenge, and we --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Nightmare?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Not a nightmare totally, but it is a great challenge for us. 
If it were not for over 14,000 churches and some 75,000 volunteers that
get involved in this program -- we think it is the largest program
of its kind that is ministering to children of prisoners involving
so many people, nearly a million volunteers a year.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How do you get hooked up, though, because you all -- now, 
do all the names come to Prison Fellowship?  You are the disseminators.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Right.  We have an office in almost every state,
and they receive the applications, and then they recruit churches
throughout the year, and volunteers, radio stations, businesses,
Christian Bible studies, and so there is a large group of people
that are offering throughout the year to get involved during the
Christmas season, and then we provide them with training materials,
a video tape about the program, the posters, and all the materials
that they need to run the program, and then they call -- 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Then do a lot of these people stay involved throughout
the year?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  They do.  They are now getting involved in the families 
throughout the year, not only just buying the gift and bringing it back 
and delivering it, by either having a party that we saw in the video or 
delivering door-to-door to the families.
<p>
When you deliver door-to-door or bring them into a church through a 
church party, you've got an instant contact and you have been face-to-face 
with them, and then it is easy to continue ministry by sending birthday 
cards or providing food to the families during the holiday times when it is 
tough.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I know some friends of mine, and I have heard this story
regularly.  They are getting in their car, and they are driving
to deliver some gifts, and it is getting a little scary.  And
then they get there, and the reception that they receive is so
amazing.  I mean, is it the kind of thing that some of the volunteers
are having some adventures in trying to deliver this?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: We see that a lot of times.  There are some children that 
live in areas of town that you normally wouldn't go into.  But we call
ahead to the families.  We ask our volunteers to check, to pick
a time that they know is going to be a lot better, maybe on a
Saturday morning when there is better daylight, and they go to
the families.  They are knocking on doors and they don't seem
to see any response.  But then you look up and see coming out
of the second-floor window all these faces peering out, looking
for you, waiting for you to show up, and then running down and
receiving you.
<p>
When you take gifts in to these families, often they have no tree. If 
they do, it's a Charlie Brown Christmas tree, you know, the typical very 
small tree, and rarely are there any gifts under the tree, and so we 
also try to provide care-giver gifts, whether it is just a food basket or 
something.  But we really see that these people want us to come into 
their homes. They don't trust anybody. Nothing has ever been done for 
them, many times.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  And so it is great to see somebody caring for them and actually 
smiling and saying that they love them and giving the gifts on behalf of 
the incarcerated parent and in the name of Christ.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, you kind of had an experience like that.  You were trying 
to find a house, and it was a little bit tough.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What happened?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: I was with a friend of mine from work with Prison Fellowship, 
and we had decided to deliver gifts in Southeast D.C.  We went across 
the bridge into Anacostia, and it was after a time that I had personally 
been a victim of crime, and I was a little wary of going into the area we 
always hear about being the crime capital.
<p>
And as I approached the house, there were four young guys standing there, 
but they were really strong looking and had their hoods pulled down over 
their heads and their coats really wrapped around tight, and they asked us
what we wanted and what we were doing there, and I said, &quot;Well,
we're here to deliver gifts to Robert's family.&quot;  And these
kids -- they looked like men -- they immediately melted into teenagers
and into children, and they said, &quot;That's us.&quot;  The
oldest kid said, &quot;That's me.  That's my family.&quot;  And
so they took us into the house and we sat around and passed out
the gifts and mentioned that we really wanted to come in at Christmas
time, and it was just an amazing story.
<p>
But you see these kids that are putting on a strong persona and are --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And they're kids at heart.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  They are truly kids, but because Dad is not there, they are 
having to defend the family, and they are watching their home front, and 
so it is something we have to be careful of.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What is the 800 number, very quickly, for people who want to 
get involved?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: It is 1-800-398-HOPE.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  398-HOPE.  Great.  We are going to be looking forward to 
hearing more.  Please join us after the commercial break as we continue to 
hear about the Angel Tree program and Prison Fellowship.  We'll let you know 
what you can do to help touch the lives of those who are incarcerated and 
the families they left behind.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I am joined once again
by Mark Morgan of the Angel Tree Ministry of Prison Fellowship,
an organization which gives hope to prison inmates and their families.
 Welcome back.
<p>
We were talking a little bit through the break about Prison Fellowship, 
and frankly, you know, you look at Angel Tree.  It is a program that is going 
to give gifts to the children of prisoners.  But, you know, every year, there 
are so many people you could give to.  Why would you give to those families? 
Why target those children?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Well, a lot of times I, myself, wonder why would we want to 
do something for an inmate specifically. But these people are people who have 
been, whether it is circumstance or by choice, they have chosen to be part of 
crime, and they are now part of that, but their families are suffering, and 
there is a huge number of children in this young children demographic
now, this wave that is coming, and if these children fall in the
footsteps of their parents -- our prisons are overcrowded now
-- there is not going to be any place for these kids, and we want
to get involved before they get involved in hurting others who
are victims, you know, to victimize others, and we also want to
get in there and just share love with them to change them, to
get them involved in a better way of life.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I think what is kind of ironic, statistically speaking, is 
just today in the <i>New York Times</i>, for example, they were talking 
about the ending of one crime wave, the beginning of another, as the baby
boomers have gotten older, and maybe they don't want to run and
climb in and out of windows so much.  The crime rate has gone
down, but they are predicting a massive increase of crime as the
children of the baby boomers hit the teen years, a 21 percent
increase among youth crime, which is frightening if you think
about children on street corners.
<p>
But my question is, have you seen through this project any of these children's 
lives changed? Are you seeing children getting involved in ministry, children
frankly having a relationship with the faith community and with
a personal faith that is changing their lives?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: There are churches and groups that have adopted their Angel Tree 
families and are involved with them year round.  They are now involved
in the churches, and we have quite a few Angel Tree recipients
now who are actually involved as Angel Tree volunteers themselves,
who are going out and ministering to others in their own peer
group to share how the ministry and how Prison Fellowship and
Angel Tree has touched their lives.
<p>
We even have -- one of my favorite stories is of a camp that has sponsored 
Angel Tree kids for the last five or six years now up in Maine.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  There are children from New England that
get to go each year, and one of the children's names is Bo Price.
 He was a camper for several years as an Angel Tree child.  He
got involved, volunteers were involved in his life.  His grandmother
and he were involved very heavily in the church they went to that
ministered to them, and he ended up being the top student in his
school and is probably going to be involved as a camp counselor
at this camp in the next year or so.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is fantastic.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: So he has turned his life around.  We got in at a
time where he was young enough and it was a time where we could
minister to him.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And vulnerable.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And ready to be reached out.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Definitely.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What about to the people in prisons? I mean, I am
assuming it has to touch the children.  But does it make your
ministry into the prisons work better?  It certainly is a practical
step to show them that you care about them and their families.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: I mentioned earlier that Angel Tree is a foot in
the door for year-round ministry for the families.  But it is
also a foot in the door in the prison systems for us as Prison
Fellowship, started by Chuck Colson over 17 or 18 years ago now --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Very impressive.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: -- has grown in the prison system.  But inmates are still 
wary of going into the chapel programs and into any volunteer-led programs 
sometimes. But when an inmate finds out that his kids have received gifts
from Prison Fellowship, that somebody has actually done something
for their family, has actually dared to go into the area where
they live, has dared to cross the threshold of their home, has
gone in and given gifts to the family and spent time with the
mother or the grandmother, whoever is taking care of the kids,
many inmates just say, &quot;I can't believe you actually did
something for me.&quot;  And they are more open and receptive
and will then go into the Prison Fellowship Bible studies or marriage
seminars where their marriages can be restored.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Is this one of the biggest doors that you have?  I mean, 
Prison Fellowship works certainly one on one in the prisons and in Bible
studies and in a lot of practical things to show people that there's
a life for them beyond the bars.  But are you finding that Angel
Tree is one of the better ways to get through to their own heart?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  It sure is.  In a sense, it is a cup of cold water
presented in Christ's name to the families, to the inmates.  Even
the volunteers that get involved really see how easy it is to
be involved in ministry.  And because of that, more and more inmates
are getting involved in the prisons, in the Bible studies.  The
church behind the walls of the prison is growing, and that is
great, because there needs to be a place of comfort and rest for
inmates behind the bars, because there is a lot of stress and
struggles for them.  But also for the families, it is a great
ministry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are seeing statistically -- at Family Research Council, 
we like statistics -- that father absence is one of the key sources of a 
problem in the child's life, not that they don't need their mother, but 
there generally is one care-giver, and the dad is missing.
<p>
How has Angel Tree helped fathers maybe re-engage in the child's life?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: We are working more and more to do that, because when 
inmates are released from prison, they go back into their homes, into 
their families, and want to immediately assume the role of father again. 
However, their children, if they have boys, those boys have assumed that 
responsibility and that role.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: And even the mother who is working and holding down two or 
three jobs is taking care of the family, and all of a sudden, the father 
wants to come back in and assume his responsibilities.  There is a lot that
they need to know, and through some of our other programs, through
Angel Tree and some of the communications we are getting -- we
have a booklet that we give to the prisoners when they fill out
their applications.  We are using those as tools to try to train
the parents, you know, to parent from prison.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ah, that is fascinating.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: So there is an area of parenting from prison that the inmates 
need to assume their responsibility, and Angel Tree is a chance for them 
to again be a steppingstone into the family again, to bridge that gap, to 
speak to their children through a gift and through a note written on their 
application saying that, &quot;Just wanted you to know that&quot; --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That I have been thinking about you.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: -- &quot;that I'm thinking of you, that I haven't forgotten 
you.&quot; And a lot of times the kids will say, &quot;I told you my daddy 
wouldn't forget me,&quot; or, &quot;I told you my mom wouldn't forget 
me.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, in addition, for those people who get involved,
a gospel message is given with each gift.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Right. Angel Tree is different than other Christmas gift-giving 
programs in that it is done in the name of Christ and in the name of an
incarcerated parent.  Some of the materials we have developed
through American Bible Society have been -- as a gift from them,
they gave us Scripture pieces to give to all of the Angel Tree
children, the care-givers, and also the inmates this past year,
both in English and in Spanish, to those families that we have,
and they have allowed us to print on the inside just an easy step-by-step
tool of what is Angel Tree. It is the Christmas story.  These
different pieces -- there are three of them for the kids that
are age-appropriate.
<p>
But it also gives us a chance to share the Christmas story and what is 
the Christmas gift and to lead them in a knowledge of what Christmas is all 
about, that Jesus was given as a Christmas gift, and that He is love, and we 
try to introduce love into those facilities.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: These children don't get to see a lot of that, do they?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: No. As I said, the kids on the street that I ran into and other 
families that I have delivered to and that I have been involved with, even
the kids who come to some of the camps that we are having Angel
Tree kids at, there is such a solid, Don't mess with me, this
is who I am, this hard outer shell, but after just a couple of
kind words and a little trust-gaining, they just melt, and they
are so eager for love and eager for a positive role model, because,
as you mentioned, Dad or Mom is gone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: After five and seven years of working with this on the outside, 
on the inside, what has surprised you about this ministry?  What do you think
people need to know?  Maybe they didn't expect this.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: I am amazed at how Angel Tree has grown on its own.  It is 
not a program that we can even really control or manage because the
word of mouth on the inside of the prisons has just grown that
this is a program you can trust in; they're going to work and
do something for your kids.  And also, on the outside, more and
more churches are getting involved.
<p>
But as we see the number of children rise, there are, as I said, nearly over 
a million children of prisoners, maybe 2 million, we think, that we need to 
minister to.  And so, more and more, we need more and more churches and
volunteers and groups and organizations to be involved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It has got to be kind of scary for a guy -- he is in prison --
or a woman, thinking that his children are going to totally forget
him.  I would think the fear level would be high.  Just as a practical
matter, I was wondering, after Angel Tree, do you see more children
coming to the prisons?  Do you see a physical connection made
through the gift connection?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  We have, and a lot of churches are providing transportation for 
the family to the prisons to reconnect that group there so that they can do 
that, and also, you mentioned something else, if I can backtrack just a 
little. At Christmas time, the suicide rate is very high in prisons.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: It is a lonely time during the holidays for inmates.  And so 
Prison Fellowship and Angel Tree provides a link to their families and gives 
them a chance -- because a lot of inmates have expressed that they are 
worried about their families during the holidays.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And I can imagine why, yes.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: They are depressed and lonely, and then they are thinking 
of their families.  And so --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Let's make sure you give the 800 number one more time.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Sure. It's 1-800-398-HOPE.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Okay, 1-800-398-HOPE. Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Following this commercial break, 
we will hear from Dr.James Dobson, who, through his ministry, Focus on the 
Family, has impacted thousands of lives.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.
<p>
Just recently, I had the wonderful opportunity to speak with Dr. James 
Dobson of Focus on the Family.  Dr. Dobson and his staff are touching 
lives all over the United States through his ministry, which helps people 
strengthen their own families and deal with the struggles of family life.
<p>
Dr. Dobson is also making an effort to be a good influence on government, 
advocating a pro-family agenda through his daily radio show and 
publications. They reach millions every week.  Now let's hear what Dr. 
Dobson has to say to us.
<p>
Dr. Dobson, it is a privilege to be with you today. You come to 
Washington regularly, and I know you have been involved here for years, 
back in the 1970s and the 1980s in the foundation of Family Research 
Council. Why are you here in Washington, D.C.?  Why are you involved?
<p>
DR. DOBSON: Kristi, I come here because so much of what happens to the 
family is linked to what government does.  I wish that were not true. I 
really wish government would stay out of the family.  But they don't,
and as a result, the policies of government are very, very important
to the stability of the family, first of all, financially, of
course, through the way the family is taxed, but then now the
moral issues, you know, of abortion and the possibility of gay
marriage and other things.  All of those kinds of policies are
being discussed -- parental consent for abortion -- many, many
things that we care about, and there is only one way to influence
that system, and that is to come here.  So that's what brings
me to this city.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Some of the media elite are trying to insinuate that 
the family values issues in the next election have run aground a little, 
that it maybe is the economy. You look at the polls recently in terms of 
the numbers on the balanced budget, and they are saying, &quot;We want 
our programs more than our tax cuts.&quot;
<p>
Do you think people are losing interest in things like partial-birth 
abortion and the family tax cuts? You know, is the media elite correct?
<p>
DR. DOBSON:  No.  I think that is the message the media elite would like 
people to believe, and frankly, that is what both political parties would 
like people to believe, even the Republicans, if you listen to them. They
want to talk about money, as though that's the only thing that
Americans care about.  They want to talk about taxation and about
deficits and about reorganizing government and about long-term
debt and interest rates and that sort of thing.
<p>
Well, those things are important.  You know, the economy is important to 
the family, too.  But there's a whole lot more that's out there.
<p>
What this city does not know, Kristi -- and I know you are aware of this
-- but what this city doesn't know is that there are multiple
millions of people out there who are not represented by the <i>Washington
Post</i> and not represented by the <i>New York Times</i> and the media 
establishment, who are just good people trying to raise kids and trying to 
maintain family life, and they are very alarmed by what is happening to
their children, by the influences of Hollywood, by the rock music
industry, by the filth that's out there, by the violence that's
all around them, by the drugs, by the gangs, by abortion, by all
these moral issues that are there.  And they are really waiting
for politicians, somebody, to step forward and speak for them
and their concerns.
<p>
Their greatest concern is not the country. Their greatest concern is their 
own little family.  And so the larger financial issues are important, yes, 
but they don't represent all of the concerns that are out there.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right now on Capitol Hill you have this clash of the Titans in 
the budget project.  We have soldiers possibly going to Bosnia any day now
and people shipping out all the time.  We have Medicare debates
going on with this whole discussion that we are trying to steal
from the elderly.  And it's Christmas time.  I mean, that's a
lot to be throwing at people at Christmas time.
<p>
What is your sense? You talk to more people probably than most of us in a 
year, in the mail and in your conversations.  Are people feeling overwhelmed
by all these crises in government?  Do they want to see resolution?
 Are they looking for something different at Christmas?
<p>
DR. DOBSON: I really believe that most people are not terribly concerned
about crises in government.  They are concerned about crises in
their private lives.  They are concerned about how to keep their
family together, how to get through tomorrow, how to pay the Christmas
bills, and how to keep their kids moral and how to protect their
family from the influences of a culture in the wake of a moral
free-fall.
<p>
That is what is on people's minds.  Yes, they watch to some degree what 
CNN says and what they hear from this city, but it is much more personal 
than that.  And I think, this Christmas, people feel the way they have -- 
I am generalizing, but the people I know and that I hear from feel the way 
they have for many, many years.  They are looking to put meaning into 
Christmas. They are looking to get in touch with their kids and their families
and to add the spiritual dimension.  And this city is sort of
important but sort of &quot;out there.&quot;  That is at least
my impression.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is out there, actually.
<p>
DR. DOBSON: That's right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You've got a big schedule.  I just wanted to ask you one 
last question.  When you go home to Colorado Springs, what do you hope 
you were able to accomplish here today, during Christmas time?
<p>
DR. DOBSON:  Some of the meetings that I am having today are frankly 
confidential.  I have been asked not to talk about them, certainly not 
in advance. But I can just tell you there are some high-level meetings 
that deal with the pro-life agenda and how to advance it, how to protect 
that little unborn child.
<p>
Now, we just recently had a wonderful experience, of course, on Capitol 
Hill with the passage of the partial-birth abortion ban bill, which would 
ban that horrible procedure where little children, little babies, full-term, 
viable babies are killed in a horrible way, and we are very grateful that 
that legislation passed.  But that is only the beginning.  We've got a lot 
more work to do.  So that is the primary thing I am here working on
on this trip.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for standing up for life and thanks for being with 
us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.
<p>
DR. DOBSON:  Thanks for having us.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> brings
you some holiday cheer from the Family Research Council staff.
 Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. FRC staff works very 
hard for today's families, and we very much value Christmas in this 
important family season.
<p>
Tonight let's hear from some of the Family Research Council staff
as they share the meaning of Christmas in their lives and some
of their own special holiday plans.  Please watch with me Home
Front News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
FRC STAFFER: What Christmas means to me?  Well, Christmas means to me a 
time of getting together with family, celebrating the holiday, spending 
time with your loved ones.  But most of all, Christmas is remembering why 
we have Christmas.  It's the birth of the Christ Child sent here
to save us from our sins and to take us to heaven.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: Family, being together with the family and sharing and caring.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: To spend some time with my mother, which it has
been a long time since I've had Christmas with her, so I will
spend some time with my family and have fun.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: My family used to always get together, and my dad used to 
always read the Christmas story the night before, on Christmas Eve, and
we would always get together with our family on Christmas Day.
 So family is the main thing of Christmas for me, and snow, too.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: Instead of doing gifts for each other, we're going
to go and -- and, as a matter of fact, our families, instead of
buying gifts for us, they're going to send us the money, and then
we're going to find a place that is really special, and that's
going to be our Christmas.  So that's kind of special.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: Christmas means that I get to go home and spend time with 
my family, and it means that I can eat my grandmother's cooking,
and it means that I get to go to my home church and I get to visit
with the people there and hear my minister speak, which is something
that I have missed since I have moved here.
<p>
But Christmas also means that there is going to be peace that whole day, 
and that it is so quiet, and that maybe it will snow.  And what I'm going
to do that is really special this year is I'm just going to sit
down and enjoy my former home with my parents.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: I think the thing that comes instantly to mind is family, you 
know, being around family and having them near to you at that time of
the year.  It is particularly important to have them in a group,
and I think the other thing, the second thing that I think about,
obviously, is that it's to celebrate the birth of Christ, and
that's important to me.  So those are the two things that come
to mind.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Just to always remember the spirit behind
Christmas.  It is the birth of Christ.  It is not the sharing
of presents or the Christmas tree or the lights or the cookies.
 It's that Christ was born and it's a time to celebrate.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: I guess Christmas to me means, it definitely is the meaning 
of eternal life for me.  Without Christ coming to Earth, we wouldn't
have eternal life, and that is the meaning of Christmas to me.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  My family.  Going home and just being with my family.
 I mean, that is really what it means to me, and all of my cousins
getting together and everybody just hanging out, and that's it.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  It will be just a chance for everybody to get back
together from all over the country, from both coasts, and come
back to the heartland.  And I miss the snow.  It's going to be
a white Christmas there.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Christmas?  This Christmas I'm going to go to Tennessee and 
spend it with my family.  And, also, what Christmas means to me is I think 
about people in other countries that can't celebrate it because they don't 
Jesus and never heard of Him.  A lot of them are my friends on the other
side of Planet Earth.  So I think about them during Christmas.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Christmas is the coming of the Savior who saves
us from our sins, you know, and to save us all.  What does it
say in the carol?  To save us from Satan's power when we had gone
astray.  Tidings of comfort and joy.  Is there anything better
than that?
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Well, I will be celebrating Christmas
with my two little girls, Miosh(?) and Kianshay(?), and now since
my mother has passed, it means a lot, because I usually spent
Christmas with her.  But other than that, it's just a happy celebration
day for me.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  This Christmas I am going to visit my
family in the Middle East, so I will be much closer to where Jesus
was born, and I am really looking forward to being with them after
having not seen them for so long, and looking forward to being
in the kind of land that Christ was born in 2,000 years ago.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> is looking at the industry behind the get-rich-quick fantasy,
gambling.  It reaches farther than most of us are aware, touching
many lives, and it leaves behind not a trail of sparkling lights
and wealthy patrons but the darker side of our culture:  crime,
broken dreams, and dying economies.
<p>
Stayed tuned for the insights of those fighting this billion-dollar business. 
You may be surprised by what happens to those cities and states that embrace 
the dream that gambling offers.
<p>
But first, let's hear from Marty Dannenfelser, who spearheads FRC's 
government relations strategy.  After years of working on the Hill, Marty's 
contact list reads like a who's who of those congressional leaders who are 
changing government as we know it.
<p>
In recent weeks, the battle for controlling the future direction of the 
American government has been fought over the budget. Join me as Marty 
Dannenfelser shares a perspective gleaned from the closed meeting 
rooms where tough negotiations have been taking place, Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're talking about the budget today, and it's kind of 
interesting.  Lately, reports of the budget negotiation are a little bit 
like the weather.  You know, they are very vague and there's a large room 
for error.  And, day after day, we come in and see that there's a budget 
negotiation but nothing has been decided, and yet government continues. How 
is it possible for us to have no budget and yet have government?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, the Congress traditionally passes a budget
each year, but that budget is really only a blueprint.  What really
affects what gets spent is what is known as the appropriations
process, and if they do their job the way they are supposed to,
they should pass 13 appropriation bills every year that fund the
entire government.  Usually there's a few agencies in each bill
that are funded, like the Department of Health and Human Services,
Labor, and Education, for instance; three very big departments
are funded in one bill.  Department of State and others are funded
in other bills, foreign affairs in some other bills, and so on.
<p>
So those appropriation bills are generally moving forward.
A few of them have been vetoed by the President; two or three
of them have been stuck in Congress.  So when they don't pass,
they have kept many of the major services in those bills funded
by what is known as a continuing resolution, which is a bill that
allows funding to continue, usually at a lower level than what
it would otherwise be funded at through the appropriation bills,
usually the lower of what either house has passed or last year's
level, whichever is lower.  But they can construct that however
they choose.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So then we have the budget, which is sort of a blueprint 
of what it is that we can spend; and then we have appropriations bills, 
which are kind of like checks that we write out; and then a continuing 
resolution, which authorizes spending at last year's levels?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: For the most part. There have been a number of programs 
that the House, in particular, has voted to zero out that are still being 
funded at 75 percent of last year's levels.  Now, that may be about to
change, because the House in particular and Congress in general
are now talking very seriously about targeted appropriations,
which I think is a very good idea, to get the President's attention
in the overall budget negotiations, that things like Americorps
will be zero-funded.  The idea of paying volunteers just should
not be done.  It just does not make sense at a time when you've
got these huge deficits.  But that's one of the President's pet
programs, but I don't think the general public is clamoring for
the Federal Government to pay volunteers when there are millions
and millions of volunteers around the country doing things to
help people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of the media is encouraging everybody
to hang tough, you know.  Don't compromise.  Let's take these
disagreements out on the campaign trail.  And we hear talk that
we could just continue funding the government with continuing
resolutions and then debate it all out during the election.  Is
that a good idea?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  No, not really.  I think that keeps things largely 
on automatic pilot.  I think one thing that the voters said in 1994 is 
they wanted change; they wanted things to be done differently.  And to 
continue largely the status quo would not be what the voters want.  So I 
think that they need to start getting more serious about the process.
<p>
One thing in terms of what you said about the budget.  If they want to 
make substantive changes in law -- for instance, the family tax relief
that we have been very strongly advocating -- they do need to
pass some separate bill so that can be part of a larger budget
package, what they call a budget reconciliation package.  And
we hear so much about entitlement spending.  If they want to do
anything to stop or reduce the level of automatic spending, they
need to pass a law to change it.  Otherwise, that automatic entitlement
spending will continue.
<p>
So that is why a budget reconciliation bill is important if you want to 
make those kinds of fundamental changes.  But the things that the people 
in Congress can control are the purse strings and the annual appropriations. 
That is where they can really control it if they stick to their guns.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it seems that, every year, you have to fight the budget 
process two times:  one, to fight for the budget, which is the blueprint;
a second one to fight for the actual spending.  Is that the way
it works?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes. You can pass what is called a budget resolution, 
which sets -- it is a blueprint. But in order to enforce those areas of 
agreement, you need what is known as a budget reconciliation bill, 
which actually changes the law in the important areas to effect those 
changes. Then you carry them out throughout the year through the appropriations 
process in terms of the spending levels.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Although the President and the Congress seem to be winning 
at different points, is there a danger that the public says, &quot;A pox 
on both your houses; we don't want anything to do with either of you in the 
next election&quot;?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, they have been getting pretty frustrated,
I think, with the people in Washington, both at the executive
level and the congressional level.
<p>
We have had the phenomenon for many years, though, of many people saying, 
well, they hate the Congress but they love their Congressman.  That changed 
a little bit in the last election cycle, but it would be a very
interesting question to see how it plays out in this year.
<p>
It is really a matter of framing the issues, because people overwhelmingly
want a balanced budget, but then again, the President senses there
are certain programs that they don't want to see cut, and in fact
what Congress is proposing does not cut some of those programs
but does in fact reduce the rate of growth in the programs, such
as Medicare and Medicaid.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So here we are having a little bit of fiscal constipation, 
you might say, and we wonder what is going to happen.  Could that energy 
be redirected so that we have a third party?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Possibly, but I don't think the history of third 
parties in our country has been a very good one.  There have been a 
few that have been fairly competitive, but I think that most people 
sense that it is the two major parties that are most likely to elect 
their candidate, and ultimately, you have to impact those parties and 
get their attention.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Initially, the pollsters and the pundits said that 
President Clinton finally looked Presidential.  Now they think that 
Congress is doing a little better.  Is President Clinton the winner in
this budget debate?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think right now it has become more equalized. For 
a while, I think Clinton was winning. The Republicans let the debate get 
off of the big-picture argument about balancing the budget and into some 
of the specifics that Clinton wanted to talk about, Medicare and education 
and some of those types of things.
<p>
I think the tax relief issue, too, has not been emphasized enough, 
that families know that they are being squeezed, and one of the reasons 
they are being squeezed is by over-taxation.  So the idea of family tax 
relief needs to be promoted, that this is really part of the package, and 
they need to make that point more effectively.  There are some very
good charts that are put together that show how every state and
families in each state will benefit.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  About a week ago, President Bush gave an interview where he 
said that his one regret or miscalculation, you know, the biggest one that 
he had, was in deciding to go ahead and raise taxes after that &quot;Read
my lips:  No new taxes&quot; promise.
<p>
But Bill Clinton ran on middle-class tax relief.  The Republicans were 
very clear two years ago that they were here to fight for tax relief. 
Could they make a mistake, all of them, if they neglect pro-family tax
relief?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, I think there's a tendency sometimes
when people are in Washington for a while to start listening to
this inside-the-beltway chatter, particularly what you might call
the media elites.  And you're right; the media elites never like
tax relief, and they have no identification with family tax relief.
<p>
I just heard about one of the economically oriented groups that
did a focus group in Michigan, and one of the things that was
most clear was that the people wanted the tax relief, and I think
that people have seen that.  As you noted, President Bush and
some others have seen that, particularly when people have been
promised tax relief or that there would be no new taxes and then
the politicians went back on their word, they really do react
adversely to it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  There are a lot of different budget items on the table. 
Who has more to lose if these promises aren't kept?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think the President has more to lose,
because he is much more visible to the country.  The members of
Congress have their individual constituencies.  They have a better
opportunity to talk one on one with their constituents and to
show them what they are doing.
<p>
So I think that the risk is really for the President, and if there is a 
down-turn in the economy, we could have something of a recession -- and 
we are starting to see a great deal of uncertainty in the stock market, 
and so on -- the President is the one who is going to be held accountable.
 He tends to  benefit from economic growth whether or not he is
responsible for it, but he also is the one that is held accountable
if things start to go downhill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Marty, you are up on Capitol Hill every day, and it has been 
a tough year for the people up there.  They have worked practically through 
Christmas. They closed and opened on the same day the next session.  Tell
me, what is the mood up there on Capitol Hill?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think they are getting their breath a little bit. 
I think they worked really hard, you know, and an intense schedule
during the first year, and I think the fact that they have now
had a little bit of time to be with their families, to be back
home with their constituencies, I think some of them are going
to be refreshed, and I think you are going to see them come back
with a renewed aggressiveness, particularly with this targeted
appropriation strategy that I think is going to be the main focus
of particularly the House people.  They see that as the lever
to really get Clinton's attention in the overall budget negotiations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So they have a renewed aggressiveness.  For what?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  For getting spending under control, basically
Congress saying, &quot;We're going to balance the budget, with
you or without you, and if you're not going to cooperate in a
larger budget agreement, then we are just going to target the
appropriations.  We are going to fund those things that the public
really wants and that we feel are important, but we are not going
to target the nonsense like Americorps paying volunteers and Goals
2000 to intrude on local education and things like that.
<p>
So I think once they start doing that and they let the President know
they are serious, he is going to have more of an incentive to
negotiate with them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you very much for being with us, Marty. We 
appreciate your time.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Thank you. It was a pleasure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, we'll show you a side of 
the gambling industry you probably haven't seen and present a roundtable 
discussion with those who are fighting the billion-dollar business state 
by state. Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[Gambling segment.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Atlantic City and Las Vegas.  These cities invoke images and
sparkling lights, slot machines, poker tables, and money, money,
money.  In fact, these two cities for years have been the premier
meccas for those hoping to win the jackpot of their dreams.  Yet
currently 25 states are battling to get a piece of the action
by legalizing or expanding gambling in their own communities.
<p>
The gambling industry promotes itself as pure entertainment, as
well as a provider of economic development and tax revenue increases.
It may all sound like merely fun and games, but studies indicate
the contrary.  Each year, Americans lose more than $35 billion
in gambling.  Low-income families spend five to ten times more
on lottery tickets per capita than middle-income homes.  And among
those who bought the tickets, few were winners.  They lost three
times as much to gambling than those in the upper income brackets.
Compulsive gamblers had an average gambling debt of $43,000,
and to pay for those debts, 85 percent have stolen from their
employers.
<p>
Personal debt and embezzling are not the only things
that follow the gambling industry.  For example, over and above
the monetary costs that individuals and cities suffer, Gulfport,
Mississippi, saw at least 200 percent increases in rape and robberies,
as well as drastic increases in burglary, larceny, and arson.
<p>
With all that in mind, is the thrill of the jackpot worth the
chilling consequences gambling brings to a community?
<p>
To answer that question and many others, in our next segment, <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i> presents a roundtable discussion
involving Family Policy Council leaders from several states battling
the gambling industry.  They are concerned about gambling's impact
on individuals and communities.  The Family Policy Councils work
to research key issues, such as gambling, and inform their states'
representatives and citizens of their findings, which touch the
lives of families, sometimes very negatively.
<p>
So please stay with us as we begin this engaging discussion.  You won't want 
to miss it.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back.  We are here with some of the leading experts 
on gambling, especially at the grassroots level.  They have been working on 
it for years, a very impressive roundup here at <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. But first I would like to introduce to you 
Larry Huff, who is Family Research Council Director of State and Local 
Affairs.
<p>
Larry, you have been working with these gentlemen and, I know,
have become an expert in your own right on gambling.  First, who
are we talking to today?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Okay, Kristi.  This is Paul Scianna, president of the Missouri 
Family Policy Center. To my left is David Zanotti, president of the 
Roundtables of Ohio. Michael Geer is here beside you, president of the 
Pennsylvania Family Research Institute.  And beside Michael is Mr. Bill 
Brooks, president and executive director of the North Carolina Family
Policy Council.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks so much for being with us today. You all have come 
a long way, I know.
<p>
Frankly, though, just to start off, what's wrong with a few lottery 
tickets?  Why are you all upset by a little bit of gambling? It doesn't 
really hurt anybody, does it? Don't hit me.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Kristi, in short, I think the problem is that gambling in the 
long term has very negative impacts on two main fronts:  one, economically,
and two, socially.  And I think that is the problem that is being
borne out again and again in studies that we see, is that in spite
of all the projections that are made about the good things that
gambling will do for a community, the long-term impacts again
are very detrimental to the economics of a city and to the city's
social problems.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And is it to the economics of a city, or are you 
seeing it to the economics of the state?  Where is the breaking point? 
Does it stop at the border of the town that has brought gambling in, 
or does it spread out further? What are you all seeing?
<p>
MR. GEER:  I think it really spreads across the state.  But, you know, there 
was a late state senator from Pennsylvania, Alphonse Deal(?), who said that 
gambling takes the clothes off the backs of the children in his district and
the food off of their table.
<p>
So when we talk about economics, whether it is in city or a community or 
across the state, the real impact is on the very lives of children and of 
families in those communities; and as lawmakers in our state of Pennsylvania
who are considering the possible expansion of gambling, they have
to recognize that if they allow that, they are going to be taking
the clothes off of children's backs and the food off of their
tables.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But how has that happened?
<p>
MR. GEER:  Well, it happens in a number of ways.  Number one, those who 
directly involve themselves in gambling, it is just not a winner's kind
of activity.  Gambling happens -- the reason why these businesses
exist is to take the money out of people's pockets.  So instead
of a husband or a wife or a father going down and spending their
money to buy food or to buy clothing for their family, they will
be spending it on a get-rich-quick idea, going down to a casino
or buying lottery tickets or whatever.
<p>
And it is proven time and time again, although there are some people who win, 
far and away, most people lose, and it can be an addictive behavior that 
will lose significant amounts of money and again take the money away
from them.
<p>
Additionally, then, it goes beyond that to take money out of other 
businesses in the community.  They call it economic development, but 
what has been shown in community after community where they do have legalized 
gambling -- casinos or riverboat casinos -- is that the other businesses in 
the community dry up. They go out of business, and that means jobs for 
people, and those jobs are lost, and again, those families go hungry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, I am a former Pennsylvanian.  My parents are still
there.  There has been a lottery there for a long time, a lot
of corruption that we have seen time and time again.
<p>
MR. GEER: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The balls injected with water or fluid. What
are some of you guys seeing?  I mean, it would seem like gambling
doesn't bring a clean sheet of money in; it brings a lot of dirty
money in with it.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Well, Kristi, one of the most interesting arenas of 
corruption when it comes to gambling is political corruption. In fact, 
it is probably the most dominant and the least talked about form of 
corruption.
<p>
The casino industry has become a major political funding machine in the 
United States of America, and what they do is they use their influence once
they get into a state to then begin to manipulate the legislature
according to their own whims and wishes, which is very dangerous.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How do they do that, though?
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: Political contributions, and that has been --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So legal manipulation.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Absolutely, the legal manipulation. But what ends
up happening is situations like you have in Atlantic City, where
it starts legally, and then, the next thing you know, you have
a mayor being dragged off to prison because of the fact that it
gets illegal pretty quickly because of the influence peddling
that accompanies these large contributions.
<p>
But back to your earlier question. There are two basic themes about 
gambling, particularly about casinos, which is the rage right now, and 
that is, number one, casinos don't work.  I think everyone around the 
table agrees. They don't work as a means of economic development. And 
secondly, casinos cannibalize local economies.  They simply destroy 
human beings.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, some people would say, though, you
set up a casino, you get the tax revenue, you have people there
using the dry cleaners, shopping at the grocery store --
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: No, that's not true.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  -- and it doesn't bring business in?
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: No. Statistically, in fact, Robert Goodman, a professor from 
Massachusetts University, has a great new book out called <i>The Luck 
Business</i>, where he documents over 20 years of research.  Historically, 
this is the third wave of gambling in the United States.  And it helps, I 
think, to go back to a little bit of history.
<p>
Gambling has been here since the time that the boats first got here in the 
1600s. It had its first wave until about the Civil War, where the culture 
basically had enough of gambling and began to outlaw it at the state level.
<p>
The second wave began in 1931 when Bugsy Siegel succeeded in Nevada,
where he launched the first casino enterprise.  And it stayed
that way until 1976, with only one state in the Union having casinos.
Then in 1976, when Atlantic City came forward, this began the
third wave, which we are in the heart of.
<p>
After 20 years of experience from 1976 until 1996, what we now have is 
enough documentation to find out that casinos don't create jobs.  They 
actually destroy jobs.  In Atlantic City, within 10 years of the time that 
casinos came, one-third of all the restaurants were out of business.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, why is that?
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Because the casino is like a giant sponge.  It sucks up the 
revenue. It sucks up the local dollar.  It sucks up the family.  And it 
leaves nothing in its wake but destitution.
<p>
MR. GEER:  They compete with the local restaurants.  For example, many casinos 
use as a draw to get people into their establishment low-cost dinners or 
oftentimes free drinks or low-cost drinks, to the point where they are not
only -- I mean, they are competing with the local restaurants
for their own business as well as then cleaning out the wallets
of those people who come in there who have no money to spend anywhere
else.  They can't buy a shirt at a department store or go get
a cup of coffee at the local diner.
<p>
So it is not only in Atlantic City but in Mississippi, in Illinois, you see 
these restaurants drying up, and other establishments as well.
<p>
MR. HUFF: With the advent of legalized gambling in Atlantic City in the last 
25 years, they have gone from something like 2,100 businesses outside of
the gambling arena to like 1,100 businesses.  So we have about
reduced in half the number of businesses that are really putting
back into the economy instead of sucking out of the economy. 
Those legitimate business have been cut in half since gambling
came in in 1976.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: You know, and Dave mentioned that gambling has been around since 
the boats got here. But I find it rather interesting that the Virginia House 
of Burgesses, which was the first representative body of the new world, among 
their first orders of business, they passed stern laws against gambling,
drunkenness, idleness, and immorality.  And so it has always been
here, and we are talking about the impact that it is having on
families.
<p>
The majority of Americans approve of some form of legalized gambling, 
but they don't want it in their own backyard. So if it's in some distant 
city like Las Vegas or Atlantic City, it's okay, but they really don't 
want it in their own backyard. And one of the reasons why is when you begin 
to increase the access to gambling, the folks who gamble the most -- 
statistics -- there is a U.S. Government study that shows that lower income
people lose, on the average, three times more as a percentage
of their income than do middle and upper class people.
<p>
So for a middle-class person who could afford to travel in years past
to Atlantic City or Las Vegas, their gambling money was discretionary
spending money.  For the folks who are gambling today and buying
lottery tickets -- which, again, lower income families buy five
to ten times more lottery tickets than middle-income families
-- for them, this is not discretionary spending money.  This is
just as likely to be food money, clothing money, their rent money,
or whatever.  And so you have a desperate person in an act of
desperation.  Once they lose this money, they only find themselves
in a more desperate state.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So it's a tax on the poor, basically.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA:  It is.  It is the most regressive tax on the poor in 
America's history.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Yes, there are cases, studies, in Massachusetts, for example, 
in some of the poorest neighborhoods that show that families making less
than $10,000 a year are buying more than $2,000 a year in lottery
tickets.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.
<p>
MR. BROOKS:  So it's a very regressive tax. And, also, back to the point 
that there's only a certain amount of money in circulation in an economy. 
A good example of what Michael Geer was talking about is, down in Virginia,
a border state to North Carolina, where they put the lottery into
effect back in 1988, the retail markets in the southeastern corner
of Virginia, down in Virginia Beach and all that area, which is
a pretty large area, over a million people, the retail merchants
saw their sales just plummet.
<p>
So they asked their local Economic Development Board to do a study, and they 
came back and they said, &quot;You've lost $430 million in a three-year 
period.&quot; They were able to, at that particular point, put the numbers 
on that.  Once the lottery or gambling becomes integrated into the
economy, then it's much more difficult to go back and establish
a base line and see what the effects are.  But in this particular
instance, they were able to very well document the loss to the
local retail merchants.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And we haven't even talked about the implications of crime 
yet on the community.
<p>
When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going to look at more of 
the cost of gambling to a town, to a city, to a state. Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. We are looking at the issue of gambling and its tremendous 
negative impacts on a community, on a city, on a family.
<p>
Larry, you've got some interesting information there, taking a look at 
gambling.  What do you have for us there?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Yes, Kristi.  The attorney general of the state of
Maryland, just in October of this year, last month, just released
a report measuring the impact that gambling would have on the
issue of crime, and I want to read you a brief quote.  He said
this, quote:
<p><blockquote>
&quot;The impact would be this.  Casinos would bring
a substantial increase in crime to our state.  There would be
more violent crime, more crimes against property, more insurance
fraud, more white collar crime, more juvenile crime, more drug-
and alcohol-related crime, more domestic violence and child abuse,
and more organized crime.  Casinos would bring us exactly what
we do not need, a lot more of all kinds of crime.&quot;
</blockquote><p>
And again, this is the attorney general of the state of Maryland, who 
based this -- this is the executive summary of a long study that they
had done there in their state, with scientific measurable outcomes
on the impact that gambling has on communities.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And do we believe that?  What's your perspective?  Do you 
think that crime really is a variable?
<p>
MR. BROOKS:  I think that crime definitely is a variable.  It increases 
crime. Some of the attorneys general around the country have said that. I 
think in Connecticut the attorney general up there a number of years ago 
made some very definitive statements about that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And yet crime is not our only problem.  When we are talking 
about crime, we are talking about an industry that sucks people into 
itself, and we have pathological gambling, compulsive gambling.  What are
you all seeing on that?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Kristi, I think again what is happening is you have people -- as 
we said in the last segment, it is a regressive tax on the poor, and when 
folks are already having a difficult time, and then they get into gambling 
as a regular habit, that puts them in a more desperate situation, and
being in those desperate situations, then they are more inclined
to be involved in desperate behavior. So I think it is just a
regression all the way from tantalizing involvement to seeing
the roots of that fleshed out in crime.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: Kristi, in Ohio, our attorney general serves with our governor 
on a coalition to prevent casino gambling from passing on a statewide ballot
initiative.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: And we have been battling that since 1989.  We are looking at it 
again this year.
<p>
When you talk about crime, you have to understand that gambling
is an addictive form of behavior.  Everybody knows that.  Not
everybody gets hooked, but the percentage of people who do exhibit
the same criminal tendencies as other people in addicted forms
of behavior, and that especially applies to matters like property
crime.
<p>
Crime in Atlantic City went up 300 percent with the advent
of casinos.  Now, they can blame it on people, but I've got news
for you.  The correlation just is not there.  When you have a
situation where people need money to take care of their fix, they're
going to hit property crimes; you're going to have petty crimes
and this sort of thing, the aggravated personal -- these are very
much in-your-face crimes.
<p>
The other form of crime that is very aggravated with casinos and with 
expanded gambling is embezzlement, the white collar crime, where people 
who are law-abiding, decent, middle-management types suddenly, because 
of their fix, start stealing from their employer.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: My understanding is that you also see, maybe through some 
of the crime issues, a decrease in property values in the areas surrounding 
casinos, even stretching 10 miles and 20 miles out away from that facility.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: That's an excellent point, and it is almost never brought up
in the debate.  That is the fact that when a casino gets in or
riverboats get in your backyard or back puddle, depending on what
it might be, suddenly the crime factor drives tax rates up because
of enforcement, which drives property rates down.  So people that
were sitting in cozy little suburbs suddenly find a new reason
for flight, and their property values go down.  So a casino in
your neighborhood could be a disastrous idea.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the issue, I know, that you all are looking at on a state 
level, people are fighting the tax issue, and yet there is a direct 
correlation between the influx of gambling and the increased cost of law 
enforcement and prison kinds of monies.
<p>
Does this resonate with the lawmakers you are talking to at all, that 
you are going to be caught paying more in police protection, more in 
prisons, more in property crimes?
<p>
MR. GEER:  Well, it really depends on what is influencing the
legislators.  I mean, many of them are willing to look at the
debate and to understand the facts and to understand the empirical
evidence, as David has pointed out, and everyone else here, about
the reality of it.  Many of them, though, are influenced by political
contributions and other things that tend to blind them, if you
will, purposefully, to some of these factors.
<p>
But studies have been done in Alabama and in a number of different states, 
in Mississippi, in North Dakota, that indicate that, for the amount of tax 
revenue that comes into state or local officials, to the tax coffers,
they are spending more in terms of dealing with the compulsive
gambling.  When you have embezzlement, you have a situation where
there has to be money involved in that, or the social costs in
terms of helping those who are compulsive gamblers themselves,
a psychological addiction, as well as the cost of adding additional
policemen.  There is not a city that has allowed casinos in it
that has not had to significantly beef up their law enforcement
staff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. GEER: Nobody wants more policemen if the reason for more policemen is 
because they have more crime, and that is what this will invite.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And the costs don't always balance out, do they?  The costs 
to a community in lost property values and increased crime.
<p>
MR. GEER: Well, again, these studies indicate that actually more money is 
spent in tax dollars than they bring in, and so it is a loss.
<p>
MR. HUFF: I think the perfect example of that is in Mobile, Alabama.  Mayor
Mike Dow, who was in favor of bringing gambling in because he
thought it would enhance the economic situation in Mobile, commissioned
a study of 41 social service executives, and they found that the
impact on the cost for the city of Mobile would be $15 million
for one city alone in social service costs to counter the problems
that gambling would effect.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: This brings back up, Kristi, the issue of good public policy. 
It is not good public policy for any government agency to advocate that 
people throw their money away.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: It is just not healthy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That sounds logical to me.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: It is just not healthy, especially then when you consider 
the incredible costs that accompany this kind of compulsive behavior.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA:  And that is one of the ironies, too.  Many times
gambling is sold on the back of school kids.  The first thing
they will do is tell you that the lottery is going to benefit
education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: And the national study shows that states that earmark some 
or all of their gambling revenues for education, less than 4 percent of 
the education budget goes towards schools.
<p>
Just last year in Missouri, less than 2 percent of the state's education 
budget came from gambling revenues, and we have the lottery and riverboat 
gambling. That amounts to a little bit less than $5 per month per student 
enrolled in public schools in grades K-12, and there is a tremendous price
tag that comes along with it.
<p>
I would just like to revisit a second this issue of the crime, because 
the industry does talk about the fact that the crime rate does not increase. 
See, they talk about in terms of crime rate, and that is the amount of 
crime per person coming through, and they say if you have an influx
of a large number of people anywhere, crime will increase.
<p>
One of the things that we have seen in Missouri is, for instance,
the little town of Branson that has a population of 33,000 people
has an influx of 6 million tourists a year, and their crime rate,
which is the incidence of crime per the number of people coming
in, has not substantially increased at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And Branson is a family town, country music and --
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: Yes.  So it is not the quantity of people coming through 
as much as it is the quality of the people that you are attracting.
<p>
The New Jersey Crime Commission said, after reviewing all the statistics,
that, in their opinion, it was inescapable that casino gambling
is a magnet for street criminals.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, I was interested, when I was a reporter and Indiana 
was looking at a lottery, I asked one of the state officials if they were 
going to have a state fund for compulsive gamblers.  Since we say, well,
we'll have a drunk driving program, are we going to have a state
compulsive gambler program?  And he didn't answer my question.
<p>
But what are you finding at the state level?  Who helps these
people?
<p>
MR. GEER:  Well, that's really kind of one of the unfortunate
things, at least in my view, in terms of how this fight has gone
on, because there are compulsive gambling organizations that have
arisen that are helping those people who are caught in addictive
gambling.
<p>
In Pennsylvania, though, what they have done is struck
a deal with those who want to bring casinos and say, &quot;You
just give us a million dollars a year and we'll keep quiet about
opposing this.&quot;  And so they, in the interest of wanting
to help people, they think if they get money in that they are
going to be able to help people, and yet they are not standing
in opposition to this.
<p>
You know, as we talk about all of these statistics that are out there, 
I think it is the anecdotal things that we hear about.  I don't think 
there is any of us that does not know someone, somewhere, who has been 
caught in the web of addictive gambling, whether it is a businessman who 
might be listening to this who knows one of their employees who is 
embezzling. I talked to one in Erie, Pennsylvania, who had a woman who 
worked for him for many, many years.  She got caught in embezzling and
then ended up having to be fired.
<p>
So there are many people who hear these statistics, and they think, 
Well, it's not going to affect my family.  But the reality is that it 
will. And so all of us who hear these things have to realize that these 
are real people who are getting caught in this.  These are real damages
that will be caused to my communities, and I'm going to have to
stand up and stop it.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: You know, Michael, the thing that a lot of people aren't 
seeing now but are going to see more and more of is the issue of how this 
affects my family, my children, because statistics show that where casinos 
are, kids start showing up, and gambling is on the rise with those young 
people.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Some of the statistics that we have seen, for example, in 
Atlantic City, there was a survey that found that 25,000 teenagers or 
minors were ejected from casinos in a single year, and 230,000 were denied
admission.
<p>
If gambling is there in a community, the teenagers will want to take 
advantage of it, just as they see their parents setting an example 
and gambling themselves.  If the state is saying it's okay, then to 
teenagers, yes, that's okay; the state has said this is a fine thing for 
us to do.
<p>
And when you get down to the level of how it impacts families, it really 
destroys families. We have several chapters of Gamblers Anonymous in North 
Carolina, not started because we have gambling in North Carolina legally,
but from people who have moved down from states that have gambling,
and they have set up Gamblers Anonymous chapters because that
is the only way that they are able to continue to deal with the
problem once they recognize that they are compulsive gamblers.
 They have to be in a support group to be able to deal with that
problem.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, there's a lot of human destruction
going on out there in the name of good government.
<p>
When we come back, <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i> 
is going to talk about some of the gambling initiatives at the local level
in each of these states.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. We are talking about gambling and the tremendous impact
it has on families at the state and local level.
<p>
Larry, you have worked on a lot of these gambling issues.  Where is the 
fight now as we are looking at it?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Well, Kristi, clearly, with lotteries in 37 states and casinos 
in 23 states and initiatives in a host of other states to bring the same 
to their own state, it is clearly on the state level.  I mean, there is a 
big push to legalize casino gambling probably more than anything else in
almost every state in the Union.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: They came at Ohio in 1989 in the legislature and their 
attempt failed.  In 1990 they went to the ballot and got beat two to 
one, thumped royally.  They came back again twice in the legislature,
and now they are back again with another ballot initiative for
1996, again riverboats.  The proposal changes a little bit every
time.
<p>
But, really, what is happening in the country is the evidence
is beginning to crest against them.  They have probably hit their
high-water mark, provided that citizens are not intimidated by
their big revenue and their big sales pitch.
<p>
You know, there is gambling in 23 states as far as the casino type, but 
there are only 10 states that have it, aside from the Indian reservations,
which is now a federal issue.  So they need more states, but they
are having a tough time to get them.  Since 1994, they have been
getting beat up on the ballot regularly.  So citizens are beginning
to have an impact, but they've got to get involved.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: And it is important, too, that you look at the standpoint 
that, up until now -- and the information, as Dave said, is becoming
more and more readily available, and it goes against the industry,
because states have been in this very unique position of having
to both promote and regulate gambling.  They have become so dependent
upon the revenues that they have had to promote it; by the same
token, they have had to regulate it.  And so the evidence as it
begins to mount now is going to begin to show that the decisions
that they have made in fact have cost them more money that they
make them.
<p>
It is like nutritionists say that you could eat celery
and that you would actually burn up more calories chewing and
digesting celery than what you would get nutritionally from it.
And that's the same thing with gambling.  It looks like the coffers
are full, but in the end the states are going to starve to death
if they continue to rely upon it for revenue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is astounding.  So, basically, the money -- it is 
all administrative, all, who knows, corruption, whatever, all legal fees, 
and very little in actual revenues.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA:  It is the social costs associated with it as well.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: And it is important to note that, again, it is the money 
that it sucks out of the economy that would be spent on bread and milk,
on carpet, on furniture, on refrigerators.  Anyone who owns a
small business in the retail side, anyone who is in the restaurant
business, and certainly anybody who has an employee base of manufacturers
should fight this thing tooth and nail because they are a massive
loser, a massive loser.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Go ahead.
<p>
MR. GEER: And this is not a little boy crying &quot;Wolf!&quot;  I 
mean, there is evidence.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: Certainly.
<p>
MR. GEER: This book is full of the evidence of every community that has 
adopted these, with all of the promises that were made of economic 
revitalization, and it has not worked.  And it is those businessmen, those 
businesswomen who own the restaurants, who own the refrigerator/appliance 
stores or the clothing stores, (who) are the ones who are paying the
price now.
<p>
As for those communities that don't have it, those people need to step up 
to the plate and say, &quot;We're going to fight this with our dollars, 
with our influence, and get involved.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And the book again is <i>The Lucky Business</i>, for 
those of you just joining us, with Robert Goodman.
<p>
So it is not the savior of a city?
<p>
MR. GEER: Not at all.
<p>
MR. BROOKS:  You know, Kristi, one of the things that we have seen in 
North Carolina, for example, as the evidence has been presented -- David 
was talking about how it takes a lot of money to sell lies, but in our 
case, all we have been able to do is to actually present the evidence
to legislators and to others who would listen on the gambling
issue, pointing out how it impacts the poor, it harms the poor,
it creates compulsive gamblers, and it destroys retail businesses.
<p>
I was testifying before a Senate committee a couple of years ago,
and back in the gallery were sitting all the convenience store
owners, and they were there to testify in favor of the lottery
bill.  Well, when I presented the evidence that I shared a while
ago about Virginia, there was this little buzz that started back
in the back of the room, and after the meeting I was able to give
them more information.
<p>
They came back this time in our legislature and were against. They 
had taken a position actually against the lottery privately. Publicly, 
they had set their numbers so high as to what they had to get to sell 
tickets, so they knew nobody would buy it.
<p>
So that was an interesting case of where a group of retail businessmen 
actually looked at the numbers and said, &quot;Yes, this is really 
true,&quot; and they checked with their cohorts in Georgia on the other 
side of us and in Virginia with the convenience store people, and they 
found out, yes, this is a real revenue loser for our businesses.  So that 
is the kind of thing where just getting the information out to people and
letting them see what the facts are can really make a difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Has the Federal Government saying that gambling
on the Indian reservations and all these newly discovered tribes
looking for newly discovered gambling licenses, has this impacted
you all negatively as you are looking at the gambling issue? 
In some ways, the Federal Government seems to have thrown its
weight in that area on the behalf of the gamblers.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Yes, we have seen the situation develop in North Carolina 
where we've got one tribe who is looking for recognition.  They happen
to be a tribe that is located, if in fact they are a tribe, right
on I-95, halfway between North Carolina and Florida.
<p>
MR. GEER: Just coincidentally.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, coincidentally.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Between New York and Florida.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: But we have the Cherokee Indian Nation in western North 
Carolina, and we are somewhat perplexed as to how federal law deals with
this whole area, because federal law says that the Indians can
do in a state what the state allows.  Well, we only allow bingo
in North Carolina for charitable purposes.  Well, they have been
running bingo for years, but now, all of a sudden, they have decided
that they are going to put in casinos, and they simply have gone
in and put in two casinos.
<p>
I have been out there and looked at them, and they are the same kinds of 
casinos they have in Cripple Creek, Colorado, and some of the others. They 
have all the games and the one-armed bandits, electronic now -- there is 
no arm. But they are basically doing what we think is in violation of
the federal law, and there is a real squishy area there as to
who prosecutes.  The North Carolina attorney general says it is
not his responsibility because it's a federal law.  But yet, then
you rely on the federal district attorneys to prosecute, and so
far we haven't seen anything coming out of this administration
to indicate that they are going to do anything about it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is not surprising.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: This is also a tool that the industry uses against states as 
well. They pressure states and say, &quot;If you don't bring gambling in, 
then some Indian reservation will have it, and you're going to lose the chance
at getting the revenue as well.&quot;  And it is just that pressure,
that extra lever that they use to pry it in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So we are probably going to see a more federalizing, then, 
of the gambling issue, perhaps.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Well, the Indian question is going to have to be dealt with, 
because as the waves of gambling go, historically, once you hit the high-water 
mark, then you see things begin to roll back.
<p>
What is tragic, absolutely tragic, is what our government, with our tax 
dollars, has permitted to let happen to the Indian people.  I mean, we thought 
what happened to them the first time around was bad.  Look at what we are 
doing to them this time.  It is a disaster.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is very disappointing.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  And it is all going to come back, because the 
negativities of gambling will cycle.
<p>
There was an instance just in northern California. You all probably heard 
about the Pomo Palace incident on an Indian reservation just a few months
ago, where they ended up in a shooting war for 11 days, I believe
it was, or 11 people were seriously injured.  They were up and
down the streets just like in the wild, wild west that started
out over a fist fight, which started out over an election over
who would control the Indian casino, the Pomo Palace.  People
ended up dead and wounded in the streets over this matter.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Amazing. You know, obviously, we are going to have to
keep watching this.  It is not going to go away.
<p>
I would like to thank my guests for being with us today.  Please stay 
tuned. We'll be right back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> takes a look at 
issues involving what some in our country see as the greatest tragedy we 
have allowed to permeate society since slavery, the sorrow of abortion. 
<p>
The pro-life movement held its annual March for Life on Monday, January 22, 
coinciding with the anniversary of the infamous <i>Roe v. Wade</i> Supreme 
Court decision. It's a case which tears the heart of our Nation in two. 
Since then, the pro-life and pro-abortion movements have been bitterly
locked together hoping to influence government and impact the
lives of Americans in the struggle.
<p>
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> will bring you guests who are taking a look at 
where our country has been and currently stands in this abortion battle.  But 
the conflict goes much further than official Washington, and so we will be
talking with the new wave of pro-life activities.
<p>
But first, <i>Straight Talk</i> would like to show you some of the March for 
Life participants, who are rarely allowed to express their views in the media. 
We hope to show you some faces that look familiar, because they are
the faces of your mother, your sister, or your neighbor, someone
who has an opinion with whom you can identify and not be embarrassed
by the radical tirades so often portrayed in media coverage.
<p>
Let's hear why these individuals marched for life, reasons you probably
won't read in the newspapers or see on broadcast news, as <i>Straight
Talk</i> takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">

<p>
[March for Life segments follow:]
<p>
MARCHER:  I don't know if I can, but I had two children out of wedlock, 
and it was my choice, and my husband and I now are proud parents because
we chose life and not abortion, and I'm sorry.  And my husband's
here for a personal reason from an older experience, and we just
think that if we could get everybody to listen to us and to know
that conception is the time that life begins and that it's not
later on, and these partial-birth abortions are the worst thing
I could ever imagine or think of.  There are plenty of us out
here who would adopt babies and who would take babies and who
can't have them, and that's why we're here, just to be heard.
<p>
MARCHER: We're hoping this makes a big impact on all the politicians
that are against the new bill that they're trying to pass.
<p>
MARCHER: Just not enough education for women, and that's why they make
the choice.  The doctors don't tell them enough and nurses don't
tell them enough, and they don't have enough education to know
that they're killing somebody and not taking a bloody mass out
of them.
<p>
INTERVIEWER:  What do you see as a viable alternative to this, to 
abortion?
<p>
MARCHER:  Lots of women who are raped decide that that's what they want 
to do because it was under such a vile circumstance.  But if you can just 
hang in there for nine months, just for the baby, and give enough of that 
of yourself, there's plenty of people out there who would adopt babies. I 
know there's lots of kids in foster homes now, but the problem is trying to
be solved, and there are responsible people out there who would
love to have the children.
<p>
I guess the most beautiful choice would be to raise your child, no matter 
what circumstance the child was conceived under.  Children just bring a 
great joy to your life, and I can't explain it.  You have to -- I don't 
know -- if you're a mother, you know.
<p>
MARCHER:  This is an issue that affects so many women, and what we believe is 
that, in the situation of a crisis pregnancy, the solution is to eliminate 
the crisis and not the child.  Abortion has not been the solution for women
that NOW and other so-called feminists claim it has been, and
we're here to say that you can choose life and be there for both
the woman and the child.
<p>
INTERVIEWER:  What do you see as the alternative for women [inaudible]?
<p>
MARCHER:  All kinds of situations, solutions: helping them through legal 
means, keeping their jobs, child support enforcement, getting the men in on 
this, you know, because they're half responsible, aren't they?
<p>
MARCHER: I'm here because I wanted to speak out against abortion.  I think 
that it's wrong, and I came to speak to our Congressman about it, but
I was really disappointed about the way it turned out.  The march
is going better, though.  It is more positive, and I think it
is lifting everybody up.  It's really great.
<p>
MARCHER: I'm definitely in support of getting rid of abortion.  I don't 
think it should be an option that is supported by our country.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: What do you see as alternatives [inaudible]?
<p>
MARCHER: That we should educate young women and young men of how to protect 
themselves from getting in a situation that might cause an abortion.
<p>
MARCHER: I think adoption is a good idea.  If you can't take care of the
child, I'm sure there's somebody out there that would really like
to.
<p>
MARCHER:  I'm here today because I'm on the battlefield for
life.  I am adamantly against death by abortion, and it's a life-and-death
issue.  You can't deny it.  If there's life in the womb, you have
to go in there to kill it, and that's what these abortionists
do, and they say, &quot;When does life begin?&quot;  It doesn't
matter.  They don't go in there and kill the life until the life
is there.  So, basically, it is a life-and-death situation.
<p>
The definition of abortion, according to Webster's dictionary, is
the termination of a pregnancy resulting in the death of a developing
human.  If there's death, there had to be life, and if there was
life and now death, it's murder.
<p>
The basic thing is that all women know, when they have sex, that they have 
run the risk of becoming pregnant.  They should be ready to accept the 
responsibility for their actions.  We have alternatives of adoption, we have 
crisis centers.  Every archdiocese of New York, especially our Cardinal
has said, Any woman that becomes pregnant, we will take care of
you, and if you don't want the baby, we will put it up for adoption.
 And a lot of the other bishops have said the same thing.  The
alternative is there.  You accepted the sex situation.  You're
pregnant; accept the responsibility.  Be a human being.  Don't
kill the human being within you.
<p>
MARCHER:  I'm here today to march for life because of the sanctity and the 
beautifulness of life, and I'm so glad to see this huge crowd.
<p>
MARCHER: We are here, the marchers, because we do not agree in abortion, 
and so we would like to see the laws changed so that abortion would be 
stopped and outlawed in our land, because it is murder.  No matter how
small that little fetus is, it is a human being, and they have
not been given a right to live.  Their right has been snuffed
out before they even get a chance to protest.  People are taking
their rights from them, and as I said, they are humans.  They
are gifts of God, and they have every right to be born.
<p>
I do not wish any person, woman, teenager, that has had an abortion, I
do not condemn them.  God loves them as well as He does everyone
else.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
begins our discussion about abortion and where the debate
is taking place today.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS: <i>Roe v. Wade</i> has got to go, hey, hey, ho, ho! <i>Roe 
v. Wade</i> has got to go.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  January 22, 1996, marked the 23rd anniversary of a decision 
that became one of the most famous and controversial court cases in our 
Nation's history, <i>Roe versus Wade</i>. Jane Roe, a pseudonym for Norma 
McCorvey(?), challenged Texas' 1857 statute making abortion illegal, and 
she won, bringing us to what pro-life advocates battle against today,
the legal authority for women to abort unborn children.
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS:  Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and in the hour of our death.  Amen.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: To remind the Nation of this landmark decision, thousands of 
pro-life activists from across the United States marched from the White 
House to the Supreme Court steps, hoping to stir the hearts and minds of
our country's leaders and citizens.
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS: Mr. Policeman(?), tell me why unborn babies have to die.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Included in this year's March for Life was Norma McCorvey
herself.  Just a short time ago, Ms. McCorvey rocked the pro-abortion
movement by denouncing her 1973 decision and by announcing that
she had embraced the faith of so many of those who had prayed
outside the clinic doors she had helped open.
<p>
Has this stand against abortion forced women and men to consider the 
ramifications of abortion?  Or has the Nation accepted abortion as a 
viable means of birth control?  The 1996 March for Life participants don't
think so and, in marching, are sending their message loud and
clear to a nation and a world.
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS: Pro-choice, that's a lie.  Babies never choose to die.
<p>
MARCHER: I love you, Mom.  Thanks for saving me.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you could see, this year's March for Life was extremely 
successful in bringing individuals from across the Nation.
<p>
So to fill us in on why the pro-life movement is not giving up in the 
face of a pro-abortion Presidency and the liberal elite, we are talking to 
Cathy Deeds, Deputy Director of Government Relations for the Family Research 
Council, and Frederica Mathews-Green, a syndicated columnist and author of 
<i>Real Choices</i>. Welcome.  Thanks so much for joining me.
<p>
Frederica, you've been looking at abortion -- I read a very interesting 
article of yours in <i>Policy Review</i> -- as a societal issue, and I found 
it interesting about your background that you were involved in Feminists for
Life, which to some people is probably a little bit of a non-sequitur.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  A contradiction in terms, that's right.  Well,
one of the reasons I came to Feminists for Life was that, 20 years
ago, I was a feminist for abortion.  So I have had a complete
change-around on the issue, and because of that, I am particularly
interested in persuasion and in helping people to turn around
and to begin to envision America without abortion.  We don't have
to go on with the status quo.  So I'm more concerned with that
than with politics, which kind of represents the two arms of the
movement, I think.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's true.  What accomplished your change on the issue 
of abortion?
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  I read a description of an abortion in <i>Esquire</i> 
magazine, of all places. A doctor had asked to observe an abortion when a 
friend did one, and he described the woman lying on the table, and the 
doctor took the needle and stuck it into her abdomen, and then he began
to see how that the needle began to jerk and shake as the baby
died.  It was such a horrifying description to me, and at that
time I thought it was just a glob of tissue.  It never occurred
to me there was actually a baby in there fighting for its life.
 And that turned me around.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And that is pivotal, and we got to meet you. In your book, 
you were talking about why women were choosing abortion and why they were 
then, some, choosing not to have abortion.  As the pro-life movement kind 
of assesses where it is, what is moving the discussion from abortion to life?
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  I think that, paradoxically, one of the good
things that happened was that we had some losses.  I know this
sounds ironic, but I think that the fact that the Casey decision
was in some ways a setback for the pro-life movement, that we
had Bill Clinton elected President, that we took some punches
in the last few years, has allowed our friends on the pro-choice
side to begin to examine their own ambivalence.  And we're starting
to see this come out in some magazine articles and some other
places.
<p>
And as they begin to look at their ambivalence, they begin
to admit what I had to admit, that it actually is a child, and
is this really what we want?  Do we want an America where a million
and a half unborn children are being killed every year?  That
begins to open doors toward finding some solutions, I think.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You are noting ironically now that we have the most
pro-abortion President in the history of America, signing on the
anniversary of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, within days of his being sworn in,
a series of executive orders to take abortion even further.  And
yet abortion numbers have been going down.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN: Abortion numbers have gone down just very slightly, 
and it's one of those things you don't want to make too much of because
there are so many factors that might be influencing this.
<p>
One of the most hopeful, I think, is that polls done recently of teenage
kids say they're choosing abstinence at a much higher rate than
ever before.  The rates of children that are in high school that
are having sex before marriage are dropping and dropping.  Who
knows?  Maybe they are just coming to their senses.  But I would
certainly hope that that is one of the factors.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And then, hand-in-glove with the societal changes, we see 
change, Cathy Deeds, up on Capitol Hill.  Cathy has been up there for
quite a while.
<p>
The strategy on the issue of abortion in in some ways a hostile 
legislating environment has been interesting. It has not been a 
straight-up, let's-go-for-the-constitutional-amendment approach. 
How would you describe the strategy today as it parallels
and tracks the sort of change in abortion attitudes in the culture?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Well, I think we have a unique situation in the 104th
Congress because we have a pro-life Congress.  The majority of
the Congress is pro-life.  That has not been the case for years
and years.  So there are some things we can do because of that.
<p>
The problem is, as we have been talking about, we have a pro-abortion
President.  So although Congress may pass very strong pro-life
bills, they will not get past this abortion President.  So we
really have to look at issues of consensus.  There are many issues
like federal funding, for example, that the majority of people
oppose their tax dollars being used to fund abortion, those kinds
of things, and Congress has passed some of those measures this
year, and a few have gotten to President Clinton when it's in
another bill.
<p>
But I think if we look at issues in this current political situation, 
where we have the majority of the people, that's a possibility.  But it 
is a difficult situation.  We have a pro-abortion President who will veto 
a straight pro-life bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So in some ways a growing legal availability of
abortion has created some discomfort and led us to some consensus-possible
ground on partial birth.  The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act --
Cathy, we want you to give us an update on that -- was fascinating
because people who had never cast a pro-life vote in their entire
lives said, &quot;I'm not in favor of taking children who are
viable outside the womb,&quot; which would be the majority of
those children who are pulled from the womb, a Metzenbaum scissors
stabbed in the base of their skull, and living brain tissue extracted,
killing them, and then removing the child.  And a lot of people
cast a vote for life on that.
<p>
Cathy, what is the status of that bill?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Well, we talked about that a little bit on this
program a month or so ago, and yes, it's very exciting that the
bill was passed overwhelmingly in the House and in the Senate,
by a narrow margin, but it did pass.  The Senate added some minor
amendments that we were able to support, but therefore, the House
and the Senate have two different versions of the bill, so it
has to be worked out, and most likely the House will take the
bill up again and then it will go to the President.  I am sure
of the timing, maybe a month or so.  And, of course, he has vowed
to veto this bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  It is just incredible to think -- I mean, we have done a 
tremendous, I think, education campaign.  A number of people have seen the 
ads that actually depict this procedure.  We have talked about that, 
actually seen what's happening.  This is a partially born child.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is right.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  The Supreme Court never addressed the issue of a partially 
delivered baby.  Clearly, most people think that is wrong, and as you said, 
so many entrenched typically pro-abortion members supported a ban on this.  
And yet President Clinton, who is such an extremist on this issue, is still 
going to veto this.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Right.  You know, the majority of Americans are not even 
aware that abortion can take place after the first trimester.  They think 
that it is only in that first three months, and they are appalled to know 
that there is no legal reason why you can't pull a nine-month child out and 
kill them.
<p>
What other kinds of consensus, Frederica, do you see as possible
as you look at the way that society is going on abortion?
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  I think one of the things that is starting to
emerge is the voice of women who have had abortions who are experiencing
terrible grief.  I believe you will be talking about that later
in this show.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  But if you have had 33 million abortions now, I 
believe, in America -- and because of the repeat factor, I am not sure exactly 
how many women that involves -- but that millions and millions of women who 
have been told that abortion was a gift to you; it's a blessing; you
should rejoice; you have no right to sorrow; you have no right
to grieve -- and they grieve in silence, but you can't keep that
inside forever -- and I am seeing a rising tide of abortion grief
breaking forth as women talk about it.  I think this may become
a really overwhelming force.
<p>
So this is something that again will continue the change in the public feeling 
about abortion.  One of the problems we've had is, we've been saying, 
&quot;It's a baby,&quot; and they're saying, &quot;No, it's a woman's 
right.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  When women start saying, &quot;No, it broke my 
heart,&quot; that shoots that argument apart.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I want to hold up Frederica's book, <i>Real Choices</i>.
It's the kind of book that you have to encourage people to read,
because it's the heart behind the event.
<p>
It is interesting that when I was a reporter, I interviewed a psychologist 
who was not a person of faith at all, who said that he got involved in 
post-abortion counseling because women were testing as having been sexually
violated when they reported having had an abortion experience,
women who had not been raped, not been molested, and yet this
abortion was a violation of them.
<p>
Cathy, we don't have a lot of time.  Any other bills besides partial birth 
that we need to be watching?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  There's a number of funding restrictions that we're trying 
to get enacted that are, unfortunately, bottled up in some of the 
appropriations bills that are stalled in the Senate or that the President 
has vetoed.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So people need to be writing --
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  So we are working on that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We have to encourage people to get some pluralized(?)
sentiment in letters and read the book.
<p>
MS. DEEDS: And also, you know, we are somewhat discouraged on the federal 
level at times with a pro-abortion President, but certainly efforts could
take place on a state level, and the state legislatures are restricting
abortion funding, and there's lots going on at the state level.
So people can watch that, too.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That will be fantastic.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we speak to an attorney
who represents those whose lives have tragically been affected
by the malpractice of abortion doctors.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I would
now like to welcome Helen Donovan, an attorney who represents
individuals and their families who have been severely affected
by the mistakes which are sometimes fatal made by abortion doctors.
 It is a whole new kind of malpractice suit, and thank you so
much for joining us, Helen.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I have seen some of the different random cases.  I think
one of the big differences now is this is not random at all. You represent 
one of several attorneys in a national perspective who are saying there 
are malpractice issues taking place here, and there is something we need 
to be looking at.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: They are taking place all over the country.  Ours is a small
firm, Amshoff, Donovan and Smith, and we represent women all over
the country.  There are attorneys in every state who are representing
women, but our goal is to more or less go out there and say, wherever
you are, we would be willing to look at your records and see whether
you may have a legal claim.  We don't take cases unless there
is merit to them, meaning there was malpractice, there was negligence,
there was a lack of informed consent, there are real damages.
<p>
There are many women out there who, unfortunately, have been violated
somehow, but they may not have a case.  But I think everyone would
be surprised at how many thousands of women there are out there
who do have real legitimate, alive claims, in the sense that they
meet the statute of limitations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of malpractice issues and abortion, do you find that 
that as a surgical procedure, given that I know your firm initially just 
looked at malpractice in general and now is looking at some of this 
specifically, is there a higher rate of incidence in abortion cases, in 
abortion practices, than other kinds of surgical procedures?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: I think it would be hard to say that.  One of the problems with
the whole abortion issue is the statistics and reporting.  We
know there are deaths out there, and we know they are not reported.
We know there are sterilizations, as in life-saving hysterectomies,
that don't go reported, in all different ways of reporting, whether
they don't get reported to the vital statistics bureau or whether
they have no requirement to report them at all, you know, they
are a clinic or a doctor's office.  So it is very hard to say.
<p>
Because the procedure is so underregulated and there are many
physicians who are operating, you know, like they moved to a new
town, changed their name, and got their license renewed, I would,
in general, say that there are more complications.  Some of them
are uninsured.  Many of the physicians are uninsured, so they
just can push the woman out and that's the end of it, and they
know that she's not going to come back to their clinic when she
starts to have an emergency situation.  She is usually going to
go to the hospital.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What are the typically kinds of injuries that you are 
seeing? Or maybe it is not typical. But what is kind of the breadth of 
injuries?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  Well, there is a range.  We see some conditions where the 
woman started to hemorrhage a couple of days after the abortion.  She ended
up going to the emergency room and they did another D&amp;C on
her.  Very traumatic for her, probably not a big-time case.  She
may have had retained parts.  That is very common.  She may have,
unfortunately, passed the head of the baby in the toilet.  She
is certainly traumatized by that, but it is going to be difficult
sometimes for us to find a doctor to say, &quot;Yes, that was
a breach of the standard of care, equals negligence; you've got
a malpractice case.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: And the other gamut would be death.  There are numerous 
fatalities out there, and those occur in hospitals as a result of clinic
abortions and as a result of doctor's office abortions.  Doctor's
office abortions and clinic abortions kind of get mixed together,
because many places the people presume that's an abortion clinic.
You know, it has the names on it like a clinic.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.  It has kind of the look of the traditional clinic.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  It is listed under &quot;Abortion services&quot; in
the Yellow Pages.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: It turns out that it is actually operating as a doctor's 
office, which means it doesn't have to meet any of the state requirements 
for an ambulatory surgical facility if that state has a regulation
that says abortion clinics and/or ambulatory surgical facilities
will have the following services available.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So they're sort of making it appear they have one set of 
services and having a completely other set.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  Well, it's a doctor's office, so it has nobody measuring the 
standards or anything like that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So what kinds of cases are you looking at, then,
in terms of that?  What are some of the horror stories you have
seen with your own eyes?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  Well, certainly we have a number of death cases on our docket, 
and I am reluctant to talk about our cases before there is a judgment or a 
settlement; one, because we never want to be accused of taking our case to 
the media.
<p>
But I do look in the papers and track as many other cases
as I can, and I am sure many people are familiar with the recent
conviction of the New York physician who killed a woman.  Well,
he had five -- his license was already revoked and he was appealing
it, so they still let him practice medicine, and he had numerous
other violations, and he is one who had changed his name and moved
to a new part of town.
<p>
I just heard of a terrible situation in Florida where apparently a 
girl may be facing a number of amputations because of complications.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  She was a diabetic or she had a circulation problem 
following the abortion?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: I am not familiar with all the facts.  Actually, a news source
called me and asked me about that one.  Numerous young girls die
from abortion.  In Chicago, a 13-year-old; Alabama, 18-year-old;
Houston, Texas, 15-year-old and immigrant.  And that is also very
common.  Young girls who are very afraid, who aren't going to
ask lots of questions, and who also may not have a good understanding
of their own medical history.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Who probably wouldn't know the questions to ask even 
if they asked a lot.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: Right, or maybe they don't understand the informed consent 
form, but they're not going to ask, &quot;Yeah, I'd like to really talk
to the doctor about this informed consent form.  I'd like to have
him explain to me what perforation means or what hemorrhage means.&quot;
You know, they are not going to go into the details that that
might require.  Or if they do ask, they are going to be told,
&quot;Oh, don't worry about those.  That never happens.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What have you seen in terms of jury reactions and
judge reactions to the emotional trauma issues?  I mean, so often
pain and suffering is the jury button to push, it would appear.
So for a person who did pass a head, did pass limbs, and was
traumatically faced with the fact that there is a person inside
myself who has died and I am very traumatized by that, are juries
and judges at all empathetic to that for these women?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: I think it varies.  There are some precedents where women 
who did pass the baby afterwards did recover for emotional damages,
and that would be sort of strictly emotional images.  There are
other cases where that gets no sympathy.  I would say that judges
and juries vary as Americans vary, and it is very difficult to
predict in any case how it is going to go.
<p>
Many people have no sympathy for the woman who chose an abortion, 
regardless of the fact that this is medical care provided in their 
community, and it is obviously substandard, and you would think that 
everybody would be just as concerned about this procedure as any, but --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We don't have a lot of time yet, but have the feminists
and some of the liberal women's organizations come alongside you?
 I mean, this would seem like a women's health issue; yet my understanding
is that women have distanced themselves from it.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: Well, I would say that the radical feminist movement would 
like us to just shut up and go away.  We are often portrayed as just
harassing doctors and clinics and things like that, which is hardly
the case.  We cannot afford, both money or resource-wise, to prosecute
any case that is not meritorious.
<p>
So we hope in the long run they will see that they have as much interest 
in protecting women from unsafe clinics and doctors as we do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you would.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will be talking to a man who took
it upon himself to help women in crisis pregnancies.  Please stay
with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. Tonight we are talking about abortion and its 
effects on individuals' lives, and I am joined by Woody FitzHugh, a golf 
professional who has a testimony of his own and decided to given women a 
viable option to abortion.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Thank you, Kristi.  Nice to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for being with us.
<p>
You have been interested in the pro-life movement for quite a while, but 
how initially did you decide to get involved in creating an alternative? 
We will get into what the alternative is in a second.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Okay. Well, the transformation in my life I owe to two 
people who inspired me.  Firstly would be Jesus Christ and secondly is
my wife, who has stuck me all these years and been very supportive
in everything I've done.
<p>
It was actually in 1994 when, as Bill Clinton became President and he 
signed a fetal tissue research bill on June 10, I just had a furious 
feeling towards him and I wanted to something to help the situation, 
and I began studying about the situation and found out that it seemed 
to be considered by most people to be a women's issue.  We all know, 
if you think about it, that it's not just a women's issue.  There is a 
man involved every time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: So I felt like I could do something, and I wasn't going to 
go shoot a doctor or anything, so I felt like as I grew and matured as
a Christian that that is when I felt like I heard from God in
not to be a fanatical way but in my own spirit that I ought to
do something to help this situation, and that is how the idea
came about.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And the idea was -- now, to go back to your man comment 
for a second, did you feel like, look, I don't care if I'm not allowed 
in here, that I want to get into this issue?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH:  Absolutely.  I feel like this is the most
heinous crime that has ever befallen this country, and there has
to be something done to stop it.  We are losing babies every 20
seconds.  We are losing entire generations at a time, and there
seems to be no one out there standing up and saying, &quot;Hey,
this is really wrong.&quot;  I mean, I know there are many of
us who are, but according to, if you read the liberal media and
what not, they have control, and so you very seldom hear anything,
and I just felt a great desire to get involved and do what I could.
<p>
I mean, I am one person.  I am not an expert, as the other panelists
were, but I felt a desperate need to do something.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In fact, you are a golf professional, and you have a long 
history in sports.  And so what did a sportsman decide to do?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Well, I was at a golf tournament at the time it happened, 
and I had a revelational experience in which I felt that the best
thing for me to do was to be an open home in which the women could
come as an alternative to abortion and be protected, have shelter,
have services rendered to them, have a Bible study perhaps or
some kind of a training program, job training and some nursing
care, and so that is how the idea began, and two years later --
we actually purchased the house on January 22, 1994, the anniversary
of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, and now we just passed our second year, and we
are very close to opening the doors.  About another week, we will
be letting the girls in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And what is so fascinating about your story, Woody, is 
that -- I mean, here you are, a man in your community that has been 
involved. You took your own money and you bought a house to make a place 
for women and their children, which is pretty amazing.  I mean, what has 
been the reaction of the community to your gesture to reach out to these 
women?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: We have had so much support from really everyone that
it has been a wonderful experience from the very get-go.  We have
had laborers, construction workers, wanting to help, donating
their time, helping to build the entire house.  We actually had
to renovate the entire house.  It was an 1891 hotel which was
very dilapidated at the time that we took possession of it, and
so it needed all kinds of work, and the volunteers just came from
all the churches and all different kinds of walks of life, and
laborers, and we have doctors now who are going to deliver the
babies for free; we have nurses who are going to go check on the
girls; we have just support from every angle, and it has been
a wonderful thing.  It is very exciting to see it unfold.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And where will the girls come from?  How will girls
hear that this is a home that they can come and live in -- right?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Right, absolutely.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And stay and get some training and some support, and you 
don't throw them out when they have the baby; you are going to help 
them segue into the community.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH:  Absolutely.  We have job training, as I said, and they 
will be learning to do some kind of vocational skill, and we will allow 
them to stay at least six months after the pregnancy comes to term, and 
we will do that to help get them back on their feet, because the worst 
thing to do is just to shelter them until the baby is born and then say, 
&quot;Thanks a lot. See you.  Next girl, come in.&quot; We want to make a 
change in their lives.
<p>
We want to save the children, and we want to give them a good start in 
their lives beyond the time that the baby is born.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic.  How will girls come to you?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Sorry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And we want to give a phone number, too.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH:  Yes.  The girls will come to us from the various pregnancy 
centers as well as from any church counseling.  Pastors, if they find out 
that a girl in their church has gotten pregnant, they will send them to us. 
And, basically, crisis pregnancy centers throughout the area.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: This is very exciting.  For anybody that wants more information, 
they can call us at Family Research Council.  Thank you so much, Woody,
and to all my guests.
<p>
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at what Gary Bauer, president 
of the Family Research Council, has to say regarding the abortion issue 
in his speech given to those involved in this year's March for Life.  Don't go 
away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. We now bring you
a portion of the speech given at the March for Life Rose Dinner
by Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council.  Gary
presents thought-provoking insights into the abortion debate.
Let's take a look as <i>Straight Talk</i> brings you our Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
[Segment from March for Life Rose Dinner follows:]
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Thank you very much.
<p>
I want to talk to you this evening not only about the direct subject
of the sanctity of human life but also about our country and the
relationship of the sanctity of human life to America and to its
future.
<p>
I fell in love with America a long, long time ago, as
I know each and every one of you did, too.  And so it's worth
it for us tonight to think about our country and about its hopes
and dreams and about its fears and nightmares.
<p>
You know, there's that great old book that I am sure all of you are very 
familiar with, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> by Charles Dickens, and you may 
remember that the book begins with that wonderful line, &quot;It was the
best of times and it was the worst of times.&quot;
<p>
Now, the line was obviously written about England and France many years 
ago, but I believe it is a perfect description of America in 1996.
It is the best of times, and it is the worst of times.
<p>
You know, there are many ways that you can measure a great nation.  You
can measure it by the strength of its military or the growth of
its economy or the gleam of its cities, and by those measurements
the United States is a great nation.
<p>
But you can also measure a nation by how many of its children cry themselves 
to sleep at night, and the fact of the matter is that tonight in America 
too many of our children will cry themselves to sleep.  Too many children
abandoned, too many children without a father's arms to comfort
them.  Too many children already exploited through pornography
or slaves to drugs or sexually abused.
<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, by those measurements, the United States is in danger 
of becoming something other than a great nation.  And to top it all off, 
1.6 million of those children, this year and every year, will not
even make it out of the womb alive, and by that measurement, we
are in danger of becoming something less than a great nation.
<p>
I believe there is a sense in the United States today that we
are all one wrong turn away from a disaster.  And so what in the
world happened to this shining city upon a hill that the founding
fathers wanted and tried to give to us?
<p>
I think the first thing that happened is that we forgot God, and having 
forgotten God, we have unleashed the hounds of hell on our streets and our 
neighborhoods and our communities.  How ironic that that would happen here,
of all places.  Every one of us has in our pockets, or you ladies
in your purses, money that says, &quot;In God We Trust,&quot;
and the phrase has become as cheapened and as devalued as the
money it is printed on.  Lincoln called us the almost chosen people.
<p>
But to listen to the experts today, you would think the greatest
danger facing America is that men and women of faith like you
may actually go into the public square and assert God's word on
issues like the sanctity of human life or what it is we owe to
those who are more disadvantaged than us, and I am here to tell
you tonight, ladies and gentlemen, that unless you go into the
public square, America will not survive in the next century.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
The second thing that has gone wrong is that we have neglected
and failed as a culture and a society to pass on the great traditions
of our culture to our children.  We could spend all evening talking
about that issue alone.  Our children sit on the shoulders of
giants.  And yet the research shows that most American young people
have no idea of the sacrifices that have been made for the liberty
that they have today.
<p>
I think the third thing that has happened is that we have allowed 
Washington, D.C., and the people in Washington to become our masters 
instead of our servants.  And I don't point to any particular party; I 
point to both parties.  It's time for us to remind both parties that our 
liberty comes from no man; it comes from God.  It doesn't come from the 
President of the United States; it doesn't come from the Speaker of the 
House. It comes from God, and it is guaranteed to us by the original
contract with America, the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution of the United States.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
The fourth thing that has happened -- and perhaps this should be at the 
top of the list, because all of these really are related to one another
-- is the issue that brings you here every year, that in this
country we have allowed the sanctity of human life to evaporate
and slip through our hands, and we pay the consequences every
day, not only in abortion but in city streets that we are fearful
to allow our own children to walk on.
<p>
Now, it is impossible to come to Washington, D.C., and have a dinner like 
this and not have a speaker like me turn to the question of politics.  And
so I know in an audience like this that there are both Republicans
and Democrats, and I want you to have patience with me because
I am going to insult you both.  Let me begin with the Democratic
Party, because that is the one that is easier for me to insult.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
You know, I grew up in a Democratic home, a blue-collar family, and 
whether you are a Democrat or not, you have to concede that the Democratic 
Party, over the years, has been the party of the little guy.  They were 
there at the beginning of the civil rights movement.  They were there to 
build a safety net for the poor in the United States, and they deserve great 
credit for being there for the little guy and when working men and women 
were organizing in the factories of America.  It is a great history and 
tradition that the Democratic Party has.  But on this issue, they have 
abandoned the littlest guy of all.
<p>
Let me share some letters with you. Here's a letter written back in the 
early 1970s. &quot;While the deep concern of a woman bearing an unwanted 
child merits consideration and sympathy, it is my personal feeling that 
the legalization of abortion on demand is not in accordance with the values 
which our civilization places on human life.  Wanted or unwanted, I
believe that human life, even at its earliest stages, has certain
rights which must be recognized:  the right to be born, the right
to love, the right to grow old.&quot;
<p>
Now, that couldn't have been said better by Nellie Gray or Jim Dobson. 
That was written by Ted Kennedy in 1971.
<p>
Here's a telegram in 1977, an open letter to Congress: &quot;As a matter 
of conscience, I must oppose the use of federal funds for a policy of 
killing infants.&quot; The sender of the telegram is referring to the 
effort in Congress at the time to subsidize abortions, and he called it 
killing infants. Was that written by Jesse Helms?  No, that was a telegram 
sent by Jesse Jackson on September 6, 1977.
<p>
Here's one written in 1986: &quot;In my opinion, it is wrong to spend federal 
funds for what is the taking of a human life.  It is my deep personal 
conviction that abortion is wrong.&quot;  Signed by then Senator Al Gore,
now the Vice President of the United States, who is sent by President
Clinton all over the world to promote abortion on demand.
<p>
And speaking of President Clinton, here is a letter in 1986 signed
by then Governor Bill Clinton:  &quot;I am opposed to abortion
and to government funding of abortions.&quot;
<p>
What happened to these men between the time that they wrote these letters 
and today is that they sold their souls for political gain, and they ought
to be ashamed of themselves.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
Now, what about the Republican Party?  Well, all during the 1980s, the 
Republican Party provided the leadership for the pro-family and pro-life 
movement, and I was proud to serve in the Reagan Administration during those 
years. But having said that, I also don't have to remind you that there
are some party leaders, some pollsters and pundits in the Republican
Party walking around with their finger up in the air trying to
figure out which way the wind is blowing and ready to sell you
out on this issue.  And it just doesn't come from those in the
liberal wing of the party.
<p>
So I am here tonight to say to the National Democratic Party and to the 
weak-kneed Republicans, of which there are some, that if neither of you 
know how to turn saving babies into a winning political issue, the American 
people may eventually decide that neither of you deserve to be the governing
party of the United States.
<p>
[Applause.]

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at Congress 
in 1996 and asks, with the budget in limbo, are you getting all the government
you're still paying for?
<p>
With the primaries already under way and members gearing up to defend their 
seats, what issues will be at play?  Tonight's guests give us their predictions. 
You won't want to miss hearing their inside perspectives from those
who work closely with Congress on both the Senate and the House
sides.  And you will hear from one freshman Congressman from the
class that the media tells us is terrorizing the politicians living
inside the beltway.
<p>
But first, <i>Straight Talk</i> invites you to hear from Gary Bauer, 
president of the Family Research Council.  A political veteran, Gary not 
only shares with you some of his predictions on the 1996 issues; he offers some 
hope for the future of the American family.  There are steps we can take to make 
a difference.
<p>
Although Gary is seen on various newscasts and quoted in many
newspapers, for the full story, <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind
the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, Gary, we are in an election year, and it is always
interesting how the way people campaign isn't the way they necessarily
govern, and there is always new information coming out.  What
do you see in the budget debate this year that sort of highlights
that phenomenon?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  You know, this is one of the serious problems facing the 
country, because I think the American people, by and large, have concluded 
that Washington doesn't speak the truth; that the politicians in Washington, 
D.C., play fast and loose with the facts, and now we have some recent 
evidence that I think is pretty disturbing.
<p>
Both sides in the budget debate were assuming and predicting that the Medicare 
Trust Fund would run a surplus last year.  The estimates were it would be as 
high as $4.7 billion.  Now that the Medicare debate is over, we discover
that instead of a $4.7 billion surplus, there was a $35 million
deficit.
<p>
Now, clearly, the Clinton Administration had to know that by the time the 
debate was going on.  These figures come in every month.  Right about the time 
the debate would have been at its peak, the Clinton Administration had to know 
that this massive deficit was going to appear, and yet they did not announce
it until after the debate was over and, not coincidentally, their
side had won.
<p>
So I can certainly understand the cynicism level that you see among the 
American people, which is a very disturbing thing for a democracy when, 
particularly, citizens and young people decide that they can't trust those who 
would lead them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We have seen that people mean a lot of things when they talk
about balancing the budget, and in the same way they have meant
a lot of things when they talk about being pro-family.
<p>
You wrote a book that deals with that, Gary.  Tell us a little bit about it.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Kristi, I just got real tired of people who believe
in traditional values being smeared and stereotyped as being bigots
or extremists or radical right or Christian right, all these terms
we hear thrown around.  I look at the agenda that we believe in
and that most of the people who support us believe in, and it
is a pretty mainstream agenda.
<p>
So we decided to write a book, <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, in which we 
would describe what America would look like if my side won, if we were the 
Hollywood movie producers, if we were running the school boards and had the 
White House and the Congress and the university presidencies, and so
forth.
<p>
I think the America that I describe in that book is an
America that 80 percent of the American people want; that is,
a country with safe streets and schools that work and traditional
values and kids who are being raised the right way again.
<p>
Our hope is this year that a lot of people will read that book and
it might help provide some context for them as the debate goes
on in 1996.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of my favorite things in this book
is the yes or no questions at the end that really help people
understand exactly what is happening.  Why did you put those in?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, one of the hardest things to pin down is an
American politician.  I don't know if many of our listeners have
ever written to members of Congress or not, but if they have,
they will find that almost no matter what position they take,
the member of Congress, when he writes back, seems to find some
way to actually agree with them even though, when you look at
the voting record, they are voting against many of the things
their constituents are writing about.
<p>
What we try to do in this book is, as you point out, at the end of each 
chapter, give a couple of questions that a citizen can ask somebody running 
for school board or for Congress or the Senate or for the Presidency
that are very clear, have yes or no answers, and leave very little
wiggle room, as we call it in Washington, D.C., for a politician
to be able to deceive or to get around the truth.
<p>
And again, our hope is that a lot of citizens, armed with these questions 
and with the facts, will be able to make more valid judgments about
who is speaking for them and who is not.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ironically, right now, Hillary Clinton also has a book out, and 
she's on the author's circuit.  Yet her vision of family is very different
from the vision you describe.  How is that impacting you?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, there is a really telling quote in Hillary Clinton's
book that you really have to think about, and as we all thought
about it, it became more and more disturbing.  Mrs. Clinton says
in her book, &quot;There is no such thing as other people's children.&quot;
<p>
When you read the book, you discover that what she means is that
she has a vision that government ought to play a major role in
the raising of children, whether it is government day care or
government intervening in education or government making judgments
about what should or should not be taught, and so forth.
<p>
Our vision is diametrically opposed to that.  We believe that parents are
the first and most important teachers that a child has; that they
bear the ultimate responsibility for what those children ought
to be taught.  And so we kind of welcome the fact that Mrs. Clinton's
book is out at the same time as ours, and quite frankly, I would
be quite happy if I could engage her in a debate about American
families and American children and the proper way to go.  Kids
don't need more bureaucrats in Washington; they need more people
who love them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Doesn't government have a role?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Well, certainly there are things that government can do
to make family life easier, and we can probably all tick them
off fairly easily, whether it is lowering taxes on families so
that hard-working mothers and fathers can keep more of what they
earn or something like educational choice, which would enable
parents to choose the schools they want to send their children
to.  So there are things that are reinforcing to what the average
mother and father is attempting to do.
<p>
The problem comes up when government attempts to replace those parents, to 
have a bigger role than the parents or the family has in the nurturing of 
those children.  We have 100 cases of that, examples of that.  We look
at programs like welfare, which might have been very well intentioned
but in fact have in many ways destroyed the inner-city family.
<p>
So a lot of what government does ends up being very hurtful, and
many of the good things that government could do to help families,
it just doesn't do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you hope to accomplish with <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I realize Americans are busy.  There are 101 challenges and 
time demands, and so forth. I would be happy if I could just get a large number 
of average Americans to read this book, have a better sense of what the 
pro-family movement is all about, and perhaps be just a little bit more 
educated when they look at public policy issues and look at those who are
attempting to get their votes.
<p>
You know, with all the influences that are on us, all the paid advertising, it 
is tough to know how much influence a book like this can have, but I know that
Dr. James Dobson of Focus on the Family has set a goal of distributing
a million copies of this book by the end of the year, and I think
if that actually happens, it could have a major impact on the
public policy debate.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Dr. James Dobson has partnered with you, and Focus on the Family 
has published <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, hopefully, to put forth a positive 
image. Do you think that this book could help with the cynicism that is really 
rampant in American politics today?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Cynicism is really a killer in a democracy.  People have got to have 
some degree of faith in their government, in those who would govern them.  I am 
an optimist about the ability to reform Washington and to turn the
country around, and so if <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, if that book
in some small way gives people a sense of how things could be
better, then I think it would be a very positive contribution
to the debate this year and beyond.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much for being with us today, Gary.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> begins
our discussion of the congressional year ahead.  Please stay with
us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. To begin our look ahead at what Congress has in store for 
1996, I am joined by Bret Bernhardt, Legislative Director for Senator Don 
Nickles; Marshall Wittmann, Director of House Relations for the Heritage 
Foundation; and Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's Assistant 
to the President for Government Relations.
<p>
Welcome to the show, gentlemen. Predictions are such a fun thing to do. It 
is the beginning of an election year, and yet the end of the legislative 
session.
<p>
Let's just kind of go around.  Marshall, what do you see as sort of 
the top five, top ten issues that you think are going to be really hot in 
Congress?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, I think the main issue is going to be the
divisions between Clinton and the Congress, liberal versus conservative,
on every issue, I think, coming down the pike.  Congress will
try to remind the American people that Bill Clinton is a liberal
and they are conservative.  So you are going to see issues like
immigration, you are going to see issues like tax limitation and
the balanced budget amendment be revisited in the House of Representatives.
Education may be another issue.  Another key issue will be the
partial-birth abortion veto, which has already passed the Congress.
We expect Clinton to veto it.  There may be an override fight.
<p>
But every issue, you will see Congress reminding the American
people that Bill Clinton is no conservative.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And who is going to win that?  I mean, I think we have seen 
that Bill is pretty good when it comes to telling that kind of story. 
How do you think they are going to be able to play the game?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, the ultimate decision will be made by the American 
people in November when they vote in the election, and I think that they
will be the major arbiter of who wins this fight.
<p>
The past year we have seen the first skirmishes in trying to make 
government smaller.  Now, Clinton might have won the first round, but I 
think the most important round will be fought in November.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Marty, what do you think?  You have been on the Hill a long 
time, and welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. What do you see as moving 
the Congress forward in 1996?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think we are going to see some continuing focus 
on the budget, balanced budget.  With the governors' recent conference, there 
seems to be a renewed focus on a possible balanced budget agreement that
would be between the President and the Congress.  So I think that
is going to happen.
<p>
The question of what is going to happen with family tax relief is of great 
concern to Family Research Council, and some other policy matters that are 
still unresolved. We have had the Labor-HHS bill stalled in the Senate. We 
have some important pro-life concerns on that legislation.
<p>
I think Marshall is right that there are going to be some bright lines drawn 
between the President's rhetoric and his true positions on some issues.  The
challenge in some cases is going to be getting these through the
Senate.  I know Bret is well aware that there is quite a challenge
on the Senate floor with the amendment process and the lengthy
debate, and so on, that it is much easier to control the process
in the House and get some very stark legislative proposals brought
up, and certainly the partial-birth bill moved much easier in
the House than it did in the Senate, but it has passed both and
will be onto the President's desk sometime soon.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, Bret, I do want to hear your predictions as well, but 
the bright line -- they always say it is a little harder to draw a
bright line in the Senate than the House.  Would you agree?
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT: Yes, I think that is right.  In the Senate it
takes roughly about 60 votes to get something through that is
very controversial because of the filibuster that is able to be
done by the Democrats in the Senate.
<p>
I think you will see -- and I agree with what Marty and Marshall have said 
here -- that in the Senate you will probably -- and I would imagine the 
House to a great degree, also -- moved as consensus items here initially,
and as we have seen with the welfare with the governors having
put together a consensus bipartisan-type package, that will probably
begin moving here fairly soon, and that could be then the sparkplug
that then gets the budget negotiation ignited again.
<p>
And then later on we will move into some areas in which we define the 
Republicans' agenda and get us ready for the elections in the fall.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, you are nonpartisan, of course, Marshall.  However, in 
terms of defining the Republicans' agenda, that is a lot of items on
the table.  How would you define it?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, you know, one thing we have to make clear is that Bill 
Clinton wasn't exactly telling the truth when he tried to cast himself as 
Ronald Reagan in the State of the Union address.
<p>
What will happen is that there will be a number of issues.  It might be 
through the appropriations process, where we try to show that Bill Clinton
is on the side of big government, and Republicans and conservatives
want smaller government.  It might be on the issue that Marty
touched upon, family tax relief.  And it might be on these important
social issues such as the pro-life issues.  It may be on the issue
of racial preferences.
<p>
So there will be a number of issues that will come down the pike, I expect, 
this year that Congress will try to make that distinction, because, as we know, 
Bill Clinton is a very good talker, but you have to look at what he does and
not what he says, and Congress will be trying to point that out
to the American people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, it is very ironic. In one week he makes a very wonderful, 
warm speech, and in another he brings us back Dr. Henry Foster in a program that 
won't talk about teen sex, just teen pregnancy, which was a tad surprising.
<p>
But tax relief, everybody from the <i>Washington Post</i> to the <i>New
York Times</i> tells us that we could all get along without tax relief.
Is that your assessment, Marty?  Is tax relief holding us up
on the budget?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, we don't believe it is holding us up. The 
question is, with those people who want to get rid of tax relief, is their 
agenda to really reduce the deficit or is it to have more money available 
to spend on more social programs?  I think that the answer is the latter, 
that they really want to use that money to spend it.
<p>
There is some talk of trying to separate the two, do the budget reduction 
first and then come back to the tax package.  But I don't think that is 
likely to happen.  I think that, particularly in the House, the leadership
is committed to doing that as a package if there is to be a package,
and there has been discussion on the debt limit bill of at least
doing a first installment of family tax relief and probably at
least capital gains reduction of some sort.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, a lot of people are reporting that there probably will 
not be any budget agreement made, that we will just live on continuing
resolutions, spoon-fed every now and then, until the election,
and then that will be one of the shining lines drawn.  Do you
all agree with that?
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT: I think that if that is the case, if we don't get a budget 
agreement, we will continue on in that process.  But I think, as I said 
earlier about the welfare agreement being the catalyst for producing a 
budget agreement, you could have a situation where you will have room for 
a tax cut, and if you get in the area of $150 billion, say, we have
plenty of room for the child tax credit, capital gains, and a
few other items that we have had in the contract and other items
we have been pushing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the new kids in town, sort of courtesy of Mr. Forbes, 
has been the flat tax.  Does this draw any lines for us, or do you think the 
welfare reform, the pro-family tax relief, and some of the other thing -- 
immigration -- will supersede?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: I think the flat tax will be an important issue in the 
election.  I don't expect that Congress will overhaul the tax code this 
year.  But what the flat tax points out is how much money has gone from the 
family in Washington, and you have all these special interests in Washington 
who play the tax code, except Mom and Dad back at home at the kitchen table
don't have those lobbyists at Family Research Council fighting
them.
<p>
But what the flat tax does is draw that distinction between
those for big government and those for smaller government.  And
I think that will be debated.  It will be the great debate of
1996.  But I don't think there will be any congressional action
other than hearings.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think the flat tax is as big an issue, like devolution 
was, like let's make government smaller, let's make the tax flatter?  Does it 
have that kind of power?
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT:  I don't think it does as much as smaller
government.  We tried this in 1986, and a lot of blood was let
in coming up with that 1986 package.  It started out as a flat
tax, and look what we ended up with.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT: So I think there is a lot to be said. It is going
to be a long ways before we get to an actual flat tax.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you see, Marty, as you kind of look at the war of 
the issues?  Where do you think pro-family Americans are really going
to be looking?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think a lot is going to really focus on the 
cultural agenda, what are our children learning, what kinds of influences 
are affecting them in society, what kinds of dangers are they exposed to 
in the area of crime and drugs and things like that.
<p>
I think there is still very deep underlying concern about issues like that, 
and I think families are going to look to see what is the government doing 
to make the world and the country a safer place for their children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Can they offer anything?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Government?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: For the family.
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: What government can do is get out of the way. So often 
government makes decisions, whether it is in terms of Goals 2000 education, 
whether it is in terms of the tax policy, where they tell moms and dads what 
to do, how their children should be educated.  In large part government needs
to stop being an obstacle to families, and over the last 40 or
50 years we have seen that time and time again, whether it is
values or economic issues like taxes.  Government steps upon the
territory that should be the preserve of the family.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are kind of coming to the end of our time.  Marshall, 
we wanted to ask you quickly, I think it was very much a surprise to people
yesterday when Pat Buchanan actually won in Louisiana, and by
no small margin. What is your assessment of that?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, more than anything else, it underscores the volatility
of this election period.  We saw that in 1994; to some degree
in 1992.
<p>
The other interesting part is the role that social conservatives
played in that vote.  If you look at the vote, the reason that
Buchanan did so well because of the strength of social conservatives.
So people of faith and family are having an impact and will have
an impact this year, and those people who ignore them do so at
their peril.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And I don't think that is a surprise to any of the people 
here. Thank you for being with us.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we discuss a children's
issue that has a lot of parents worried:  education.  What do
the upcoming semesters hold for America's students?  After this
break we'll find out. Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I would like to
welcome guests who have the inside track on our country's educational
issues:  Amy Myers, Press Secretary and Government Relations Director
for the Eagle Forum; Hans Meeder, Professional Staff for Long-Range
Policy and Planning from the Economic and Educational Opportunities
Committee; and Jennifer A. Marshall, Education Policy Analyst
for the Family Research Council.
<p>
Thank you for joining us.  Thank you for having a smaller title.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
We are taking a look at all the issues coming up in 1996.  We have looked 
at the Hill. But education is very near and dear to a lot of people's hearts.
Hans, why don't we start with you?  Where do you see education
issues going in 1996?
<p>
MR. MEEDER:  Well, I think that the key that we are going to have to work 
on in 1996 is that President Clinton is continuing to have a barrage of lies 
about what creates quality solutions for our children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Give me an example.
<p>
MR. MEEDER:  Well, he basically has created a Goals 2000 program
to basically have federal control over curriculum content and
the direction of education reform.  They continue to put money
into programs like the Title I program and Head Start, which are
30 years old, have been reformed five or six times, and still
the studies show that they have no lasting impact on our children
for good, and if anything, they might actually perpetuate some
bad practices.
<p>
And yet, at the same time, what we see really works
for kids at the local level are parental control and involvement
over education, strong local commitment and flexibility, and a
strong focus on academics.  It is really not that complicated.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So how do we get there?  Give me a quick one on
how we get there.  Then, Amy, we are going to ask you.  How are
we going to achieve it?
<p>
MR. MEEDER: It is not one silver bullet that will fix it, but the first 
step that we are going to work on is identifying how many federal programs 
are out there, what the federal role really is, and then start a process 
of trying to turn back as much control locally as possible.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amy, what do you see?  We are looking at education in 1996.
What is going to come up?
<p>
MS. MYERS: Well, I think you will see a lot of issues that come up.  Whether 
or not they go anywhere, we will see.  The House of Representatives tends to 
be a little bit more favorable toward parents and local control, whereas the
Senate is still a little bit behind schedule on that.  And, of
course, you have President Clinton, who thinks that only Washington
knows how to control education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. MYERS: I think through the appropriations process we might see the 
defunding or cutting back on a number of programs that a lot of 
conservatives feel are detrimental to the --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How about Goals 2000?  A lot of concern for that.  Do you think 
we will see a cut in Goals 2000?
<p>
MS. MYERS:  Well, we did see a cut in the House version of the appropriations 
bill, which was zero funding. In the Senate version it was fully funded. So 
we probably will not see Goals 200 eliminated.
<p>
It is a two-fold process. You eliminate funding as well as repeal the law. 
Goals 2000 does not have a lot of money in it compared to other programs. 
However, it does have a lot of the federal strings.  I think that is what 
is most concerning to a lot of American families.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: To have you do this analogy quick for me, Jennifer, you said 
one time that if you look at every educational dollar, the government throws
in a few pennies and then controls the spending of the rest.
How does --
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  That is right.  It is something like on the order of 6 
to 7 percent of the Federal Government contributes to local education; 
yet I don't know how much percentage of the actual mandates and regulations 
are actually coming from the Federal Government. So you can tell that they 
have really got the beast by the nose.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It has been kind of interesting because
some states have said, &quot;Okay, we won't take that federal
money,&quot; and I am sure parents in those states initially think,
you know, we've lost all this money, when they have lost a fraction
of what it takes to run local schools.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: That is right.  Something like $2 per student per year, 
something that you could buy a sandwich with at McDonald's, and what you 
have to do for that money is form a state school improvement panel,
form local panels, revise your curriculum, submit proposals to
the Secretary of Education, for $2 per student.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is amazing.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: Ridiculous.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you think is going to come up in 1996?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, we hope that there will be a great discussion on the 
federal role in education, and we are especially looking forward to 
consideration of the back-to-basics bill, which would shut down the Department
of Education and block-grant those programs for a period of four
years.
<p>
What we would really like to see, and this would mean an
end to the federal role in education, would be a tax cut at the
end of that time to return the money to the people who are putting
it in the pot right now, so they could run education at the local
level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Hans, what does your organization see as
the likelihood of that?  Do you think long term -- even in 1996,
short term -- we could see the end of the Department of Education?
I have heard its death knell before.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. MEEDER: Well, the thing that we have to realize, most Americans 
don't really know the difference between -- I hate to say this -- but
between local, state, and federal involvement, and that is why,
when the President starts talking about extreme cuts to education,
which, at the most, we are talking about one-half of one percent
of national education spending, is what we are talking about reducing
at the federal level, but when he starts throwing that kind of
talk around, people get very nervous, because most people are
very supportive of education in general, and we have seen polling
that shows that of the general public, only about 19 percent right
now support eliminating the Department of Education, and almost
80 percent oppose it, and a lot of it because they don't understand
what the Department of Education at the federal level really does.
<p>
We feel that in order to do it successfully, we have to undergo
a very big education effort to show people the massive proliferation
of programs.  Just to let you know, the Department of Education
itself has about 250 education programs, maybe a little bit more
than that.  But we are in the process of identifying several more
hundred education programs already spread across the Federal Government.
<p>
What our members don't want to do is get rid of a couple hundred
programs and an agency and yet still have the Federal Government
very involved in education, and then we all think the problem
is solved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Because they have put those programs maybe under 
Agriculture or under another department.
<p>
MR. MEEDER: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Same thing, but just a different way of paying for it.
<p>
MR. MEEDER: Hundreds of programs have cropped up over the last 40 years. 
Basically, any Congressman or Senator that wanted to say they were for 
education created a new program, and we have multitudes of Indian ed programs, 
science programs. Unfortunately, very few of those programs are really 
focused on basic academics, the reading, math, and science, and many of
them are just kind of special interest buyoff programs.
<p>
So we feel that before we can really move on restructuring the federal
role, we have to know what is out there and then educate the public
on that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, Phyllis Schlaffly has been a real leader in that. 
I mean, she has worked very hard on education issues. What is her 
perspective on the back-to-basics approach?
<p>
MS. MYERS:  I think that we and Phyllis have said that the back-to-basics
approach is a good step in the right direction.  It does not eliminate
the federal role in education; however, it does definitely move
us toward that direction.
<p>
We don't think that there is a constitutional role for the Federal 
Government to be involved in education, and that is how we would 
eventually like to see things end up.  Given the current Congress and the 
current President, we don't see that as a realistic goal in the 104th 
Congress.  You don't have a Senate that will do anything and you don't 
have a President that will sign it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's the hard part.
<p>
MS. MYERS: Yes. But we would like to see an end in the federal role in 
education, and just to add on to what Hans had said, I know that their 
committee has shown well over 660 programs throughout all of the agencies
in the Federal Government that are involved in education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One thing we know about government is it grows.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
Thanks so much for being with us.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will hear from one of the 
freshman class of lawmakers, Congressman Dave McIntosh. Please stay 
with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I had the opportunity to speak with an influential 
House freshman, Congressman Dave McIntosh, Republican of Indiana.  Let's 
hear what he has to say about our country's year ahead.
<p>
Thank you very much for being with us today, Congressman McIntosh. You 
have been one of the most influential freshman Congressmen, and as
you look at this year ahead, what do you see coming up on Capitol
Hill?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  I think it is going to be a year
of challenges.  I represent Indiana, so I like to use the movie
Hoosiers as an example.  I think the freshman class are the small-town
team, the myelin players, and we are in the big leagues now for
the championship.
<p>
All the press is saying, &quot;Oh, they're bound to fail, they're bound 
to buckle and give up on their principles.&quot; But we are at halftime, 
and we are reassessing where we want to go, and everybody knows the 
fundamentals are there, and if we stick to what we told people we cared 
about in the last election, it will carry us on to victory, ultimately, if 
not before November then after November, because I think the American people 
want to see the changes that they voted for in the last election, less
government -- and even President Clinton has agreed with us on
that -- but even more than the budget and the tax issues, which
I think are important, they want to see a reaffirmation of the
family and of faith as being important in our public lives.
<p>
And so you are going to see next year a renewed effort to focus on
those issues and say it is time that we have a constitutional
amendment that will allow school prayer, that will allow freedom
of religion in our public lives.  It is time that we look at our
welfare program, not just as a budget matter but as a program
that is devastating families and driving people to divorce, driving
young children into a terrible family situation, and we have to
fundamentally get rid of that system and change it.
<p>
The other one that I am going to be looking at is the marriage penalty 
that is not only in our tax code but in also a lot of government pension
programs and benefits, where they tell somebody, &quot;Look, if
you were only divorced, you would be getting more money.&quot;
And to me that is just wrong to say to people, &quot;Because
you are married, you are going to be penalized.&quot;  It undermines
the family and the basic institution of marriage in our community.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Are you concerned that the budget debate will have
a negative effect on family issues?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think what you are seeing now is the freshmen who 
were new to Washington -- and I have enjoyed getting to know my colleagues.
They are so committed to the principles that they believe in.
A lot of them were not politicians.  You get people like Steve
Largent, who was a football player and had never run for office
before, did this because he believes in the future of the country.
That is typical of a lot of our colleagues.
<p>
They are determined to not back down on our promises, and what I think we need 
to do is say, &quot;Look, the President has stopped us from getting
to a balanced budget, but now we can get some of the things done.&quot;
The rest of it, we need to go back to the American people and
say, &quot;We took it as far as we can.  Give us another round
of support and we can, to use the Hoosiers analogy, we can win
the game in the end.&quot;  But it is going to take the support
of the people and the voters and people to get involved next year.
<p>
One of the things that I tell folks at home in Indiana -- because
they will come up to me and say, &quot;Hang in there. You're doing
what we sent you to.&quot;  I'll say, &quot;Thank you, and I need
you.  I need you to help me build support in the community, to
get out there and ring doorbells with me, talk to people, and
let the community know there is a plan to get us back on the right
track where we restore families, build strong communities from
the bottom up.  But it is going to take everybody, not just 40-some
members of the Congress or 200-and-some members of Congress but
everybody in the country to do that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The media and the people inside the beltway have really 
demonized the freshman class and blamed them for the impasse in the budget 
debate. What is your perspective on that?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think, ultimately, that is a convenient excuse for 
people. There is one thing that has happened.  The media and the people in 
Washington don't really know what to make of the freshmen, because we are
not willing to paper over the differences and say we are balancing
the budget when we know we are not.  We are saying, &quot;At least
let's be honest.  If we're only getting half a loaf, let's tell
people that.&quot;
<p>
And so it has been hard for them to figure out how to work with us as a class. 
But I think, ultimately, you had Presidential politics coming into it. President 
Clinton, I think, did not want a balanced budget, so he vetoed the effort
we had.  Senator Dole, President Clinton views him with suspicion
because he is running for President.  And there were some larger
forces involved in it.
<p>
But, ultimately, we need to say, let's get what we can.  But if it isn't the 
real thing, if we haven't really balanced the budget, haven't given the 
families their tax cut, let's not paper that over but take it to the voters
in the election next year.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, it has been interesting watching the budget debate. 
There have been a lot of kudos coming to the freshman class as having really 
advanced the discussion of a balanced budget, and then you have the 
<i>Washington Post</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> and the pundits on 
Saturday and Sunday morning saying, &quot;You know, great advancement of the 
issues, but if you could just get rid of those tax cuts, we would all
be on the same page.&quot;  What is your response to that?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: It is typical Washington, actually.  What has 
happened is, as the negotiations have gone, spending keeps going up every
step of the way, and what they are saying is, as you take more
and more for Washington's budget, let's get rid of the provisions
that help the family budget.  Put aside your tax cut that allows
the average family to get something out of this balanced budget.
<p>
We did some studies in my home town in Muncie on what the typical
family would benefit from the tax cuts.  They make about $25,000.
Oftentimes both parents will be working.  They have two kids,
and they would pay about a third of their money in taxes, either
to the Federal Government, to the state, or to local property
taxes.
<p>
If we had a $500 tax credit, instead of paying a third
or roughly about $8,000, they would only pay $7,000, and that
is a huge difference.  That is $1,000 that they don't have to
turn over in their paycheck.  It is a pay raise that they see
right away that, each week, adds up, and eventually, they are
able to save for their family and be able to have a better lifestyle.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Looking at all the issues on the table - we have
tax cuts, welfare reform, school choice, religious liberty --
what is your perspective on what the top three issues really are?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  I think you are going to see at this
point a balanced budget, an honest balanced budget, with the family
tax cuts, a religious freedom amendment that says we need to have
the ability to have prayer in school.  We need communities to
be able to have a creche scene at Christmas.  Our faith is important
to us, and you see that a lot in the freshman class, where people's
personal faith is what guides them, and they bring that forward.
<p>
And then I think the third major issue is in education.  A lot
of us would like to get rid of the Department of Education, certainly
get rid of Goals 2000.  But, fundamentally, on the positive side,
what we need to do is say that parents and communities can do
a much better job than bureaucrats in Washington, and we need
to allow parents to have the ability to guide and control education.
<p>
They are the ones who teach the values at home.  They are the
ones who need to have a school system that reinforces those values.
And working together with good teachers, we will be able to teach
our young people so they can be good citizens.
<p>
But if you have this Goals 2000 where you are not really teaching them, 
you say it is okay to misspell words - we are going to let you be creative
-- or you teach them values that are just wrong and simply not
what parents would want their kids to have, then the education
system doesn't work for us.
<p>
So those are the three main areas I think we are going to focus on.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What do you think is the untold story of the freshman class?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: A lot of us would like to get rid of the Department 
of Education, certainly get rids of Goals 2000.  But fundamentally, on the 
positive side, what we need to do is say that parents and communities can
do a much better job than bureaucrats in Washington, and we need
to allow parents to have the ability to guide and control education.
They are the ones who teach the values at home.  They are the
ones who need to have a school system that reinforces those values.
And, working together with good teachers, we will be able to
teach our young people so they can be good citizens.
<p>
But if you have this Goals 2000 where you are not really teaching them, 
you say it is okay to misspell words - we are going to let you be
creative -- or you teach them values that are just wrong and simply
not what parents would want their kids to have, then the education
system doesn't work for us.
<p>
So those are the three main areas I think we are going to focus on.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, what are you looking forward to in 1996?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think it is going to be a year where, in reality, 
we are ahead at half-time.  The President has said it is the end of the era
of big government.  Families count.  I am not sure he means it
totally, but he has said that and, basically, delivered a State
of the Union speech that could have been Ronald Reagan's.
<p>
I worked with Ronald Reagan for a while.  Probably the difference is 
Ronald Reagan would have meant it.  But it is nonetheless a consensus
now that we are moving in the right direction.  I am optimistic
that on some things we will be able to pass them in Congress and
the President will sign them.  Other things, I think, we will
have to once again, as I said, take it to the election.
<p>
But I have a lot of optimism about that, because I think you are going
to see a lot of people who started to get active in 1994, were
never that political, realize that the future of the country is
going to be at stake, and it is one of those times in our country's
history where we can renew government and set it on a new course.
<p>
The other thing that I am looking forward to is actually in 1997,
and it is not political at all.  It is the national Promise Keepers
meeting.  We had a regional event in Indianapolis at the Hoosier
Dome there, and you had 60,000 men coming together and reaffirming
their faith.
<p>
What I tell people is, this is a revival that can happen in our country. 
It is not government, it is not politics, but it is real because it is 
people in their own lives and in their own communities.  What we can do 
in government is make sure we stay out of the way, that we don't block that 
from happening. And I think that is going to be an exciting event for the 
entire nation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: At the end of 1996, after the election, will the story of 
this year's Congress be one of further realignment in a pro-family 
direction or of a swing back to the way that it has been, a little more 
politics as usual?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think it could go either way at this point. I 
think the fundamentals are there.  You have good leaders who stand up for 
family values. But the real critical decision is going to be on election day,
and I certainly hope that we have further realignment in a pro-family
way.  I think you will have a lot of politicians talking about
it.  The challenge will be to get people who say, &quot;That's
my first priority, is the family and reestablishing the family,&quot;
so that we can really realign the priorities here in Washington.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, thank you very much for being with
us.  Best of luck to you, and we look forward to seeing what comes
ahead.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: Thank you very much.  Congratulations
on all the good work you all do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at what Gary 
Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, has to say on CNN's 
<i>Crossfire</i> almost one year ago regarding an issue which continues to 
permeate our country's political world, abortion.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. Gary Bauer has often had the opportunity to appear on
many network news programs, and it interesting to see that Gary
was fighting the same battles regarding the abortion issue on
CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> during an appearance almost one year ago. So
let's take a look at a brief news clip as Gary presents some thought-provoking
arguments. <i>Straight Talk</i> brings you some Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News"></center>
<p>
[Segment from CNN Crossfire, March 23, 1995, follows:]
<p>
MODERATOR: Gary Bauer, as a Democrat, I certainly
wish you every success in saddling the Republican Party with your
views on abortion.  But isn't Senator Specter right in saying
that you will help reelect President Clinton if you insist on
pushing the Republican Party to adopt your views?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Right.  Well, in all due respect to Senator Specter, whom I have
worked with on many occasions, including the confirmation of Clarence
Thomas, which I hope you are still very proud of, sir, I think
that Arlen Specter is wrong about that.
<p>
The great growth in the Republican Party since 1980 has been based on 
Reagan Republicanism. That is not a fringe.  It means small government, low 
taxes, a strong defense, family values, and the sanctity of life.  That's
the kind of Republican winning all over this country.  That's
the formula for victory.  That little office over at the DNC that
Lynn Cheney(?) talked about is an office that would love to see
us abandon that winning formula.
<p>
MODERATOR: Well, why not be just a little bit cynical?  I know you might not be 
up to this, but there are a lot of Republicans who would like the pro-life
forces within the party to just be a little bit cynical, a little
bit strategic, and lie low for a bit, as some are doing, as Ralph
Reed does on alternate weeks, and wait until -- you know, organize
your forces, as you do, and then wait until you have a Republican
President and a Republican Congress, if that happens, and then
pop back up and say, &quot;Now here we are.  Now let's call in
our chips.&quot;
<p>
MR. BAUER: You know, Mike --
<p>
MODERATOR: Wouldn't that be a cleverer strategy?
<p>
MR. BAUER: No.
<p>
MODERATOR: Since you must admit that abortion is more controversial within 
the Republican Party than small government, low taxes, and all those
other things you listed.
<p>
MR. BAUER: I think the American people are sick of clever. I think I may 
be unusual in Washington, D.C., but I don't believe in stealth candidates. 
I believe that candidates win when they state what they believe and state it 
with conviction and stick to it regardless of polls.  That is what worked 
for Ronald Reagan twice, and I believe that Ronald Reagan, four months
ago, won his third landslide victory when candidates that ran
on all of his philosophy swept into office all over this country.
<p>
Mike, I want to be really clear about this.  I believe the Republican
Party ought to have an open door to anyone who wants to walk in
the door.  But the party has to stand for something, and I believe
at that core --
<p>
MODERATOR:  Why should anyone vote Republican who believes that a woman's 
right to choose is important as you believe that a fetus' right to life is, 
if the Republican Party platform says that abortion is murder and should be 
illegal with no exceptions?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, the fact of the matter is that 60 percent of the 
American people in a poll just this week by the <i>Washington Post</i>, not 
a conservative newspaper, found that Americans either want, in the case of 27 
percent of them, an end to all abortions, or in the case of 33 percent more, 
restrictions on abortion.  You can win an election with that 27 percent and
the 33 percent that believe abortion on demand is a mistake and
needs to be restricted.
<p>
The fringe here is the position that the Senator takes, which is no 
restrictions at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with us to 
hear how you can get more information on Gary's book or the issues
affecting you and your family in the upcoming year.

Next week we will be celebrating Valentine's Day with a new slant
on what many consider to be true romance: abstinence.  Saving
sex for marriage seems to be an increasing trend, and we will
meet some people who will explain this not-so-old-fashioned phenomenon.
We hope you will join us again as we continue to bring you perspectives
not often seen in the media and exclusively seen here on <i>Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <I>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</I>.  I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight's
<I>Straight Talk</I> celebrates Valentine's Day by taking a look
at romance with a newly rediscovered twist.
<p>
When you think of romance, you may think of flowers, candlelight
dinners, and late night walks with that special someone.  In recent
years in our culture, it also means a night that ends with a sexual
encounter.  All too often this sexual experience takes place between
two people who don't share a lifetime commitment to marriage.
<p>
It may seem harmless, but tonight we'll talk to those who
don't think so as they share their personal experiences.  <I>Straight
Talk</I> will discuss the wave of abstinence that is sweeping
the country among teens and young adults who are looking for love
in all the right places.
<p>
But first, we invite you to hear from Gary Bauer, president
of the Family Research Council.  Gary has experienced many elections
throughout his years inside the beltway, and he shares with us
his views on the Iowa caucuses and how the results indicate what's
ahead in New Hampshire.  Although you've heard a lot of predictions
by now on what will happen between now and Super Tuesday, when
the Republican nominee will probably be known, Gary brings a unique
perspective from the pro-family frontlines as <I>Straight Talk</I>
takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thanks for being with us today on Behind
the Headlines.  It was interesting in the Iowa caucuses how prior
to the election everyone said that Dole had to have 30 percent
to survive.  Then he gets 26 percent, but it's the great unreported
story.  What's your take on why Dole's showing -- a poor showing
-- of 26 percent is so un-talked about?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I think, first of all, Kristi, the thing that
strikes me once again is just how bad the conventional wisdom
in Washington, D.C., is, and I say that as a person that obviously
works in this city and has been here a good long time, but the
pollsters and pundits, even those on the conservative side, really
get out of touch with the grassroots.  I think everybody thought
that Dole would do quite well in Iowa.
<p>
He did win, but it is, I think, an extraordinary warning
to his campaign that 26 percent of the vote in, what, his third
or fourth campaign in Iowa -- this is not a sign of strength.
Someone said &quot;many more victories like this, and he'll be
limping into San Diego.&quot;  So I think it is a sign that the
Dole campaign has some real challenges ahead and that he has to
deliver a much more aggressive and a much better message for the
future than he has been able to deliver so far.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Pundits agree that the race was for number
two.  Dole appeared to have one locked up; the question was how
big was his margin.  And then Buchanan wins the number two spot,
and nobody wants to talk about it.  Why do you think that is?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, Washington and the press corps generally
has an aversion to Pat Buchanan that is, I think, pretty obvious
to even the untrained eye.  It reminds me of this same aversion
that they had to Ronald Reagan.  People forget, you know, the
Reagan presidency was tremendously successful, and he is a beloved
figure in many ways now, but back in 1976, when he was taking
on Gerald Ford, people laughed at Ronald Reagan.
<p>
He was considered to be unelectable.  The Washington establishment,
including a good number of conservatives, thought that he was
splitting the party.  He was losing a lot of money.  He was in
debt.  He lost the first five primaries.  Even when the public
began to respond to him and he began to have success, Washington
and the press corps was in denial about him.  They still couldn't
believe that the American people responded to his message.
<p>
I was struck by the fact that Buchanan and Alan Keyes, the
only two candidates really aggressively promoting a pro-family
message, that if you put their two votes together in Iowa, they
would as a team, they would have won the Iowa caucuses.  So once
again, I think the message out there is that people are hungry
to hear about these issues and hear about them in a very articulate
and heartfelt way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  CNN reported in an exit poll that 42 percent
of the people who voted for Pat Buchanan said that conservative
values were the reason they chose him.  What do you think that
means for conservative issues as we watch this electoral cycle
unfold?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I think that if the party doesn't get the message
now, they'll never get it.  What these voters want, these new
voters that have poured into the Republican party in the last
15 years, is a candidate who is willing to speak with as much
passion about the right to life issue, about the family, about
protection of culture, et cetera, as much passion about those
things as they do about flat taxes and the budget deficit.
<p>
So far, a lot of Republican candidates have only talked about
the economic matters and then almost as a throwaway line have
said, &quot;well, yeah, and I'm pro-life,&quot; and so forth.
That might have worked 20 years ago in the Republican party.
It doesn't now.  People are hungry for this message, and I think
Buchanan's success will force the entire party to fashion a message
better than they've done up until now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How do you interpret Alexander's third place
win and the fact that he leaped over both Forbes and Gramm?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think Alexander is benefiting from sort
of the fact that he's not the other guys.  He hasn't engaged in
a lot of negative advertising.  He has conducted a pretty upbeat
campaign, and if voters got turned off by one individual or another
-- certainly many got turned off by the incredible negative advertising
Forbes has done -- Alexander was a place that they could turn
to and not really worry about being embarrassed about their vote.
Whether he has legs to make it through the next six weeks when
there is an incredible number of primaries and you really have
to start delivering a vision for the country is unclear at this
point.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I was watching the pundits yesterday, and I
very much agreed with one who said that Forbes' fourth place showing
indicated that money can't buy everything.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Yes, you know, the Family Research Council doesn't
endorse candidates, but I must admit that personally I was pleased
to see that a candidate can't do well just because he can write
unlimited checks.  That is a disturbing thought to me, that somebody
can take $20 million or $30 million and buy a Senate seat or buy
a governor's race or buy the presidency.
<p>
I think at the end of the day the American people will want
more than good advertising.  They are going to want to know that
the candidate shares their values, and serious questions arose,
on the social issues about whether Steve Forbes shares those values,
in the last three or four days of the Iowa caucuses.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Here at the Family Research Council media office,
we get normally at least 100 calls a day, often more, and in the
last week the number one question asked of us, for you, Gary,
is how do you interpret Gramm's plummet so that he took only a
five place position in Iowa?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, if I was happy to say that you can't buy
the presidency, I was also very sad to see Phil Gramm's fall on
these hard times, as he clearly has in Louisiana and Iowa.  Senator
Gramm is a good and decent man.  I think that he probably miscalculated
about where the center of gravity is in the Republican party.
Gramm led the way defeating national health care.  He deserves
great credit for that.
<p>
He has been incredibly articulate on economic issues, but
I think he didn't understand or has not understood up until now
that on these social issues you have to address them.  You have
to convince the voter that you are committed to these things,
that you are willing to do something about them, and his inability
to do that opened the door for Buchanan and some of the other
candidates.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of the themes that the media has not reported
and almost ignored exclusively is the common man theme of working
class Americans concerned for their families.  How will they support
them?  Where is the money going to come from?  Buchanan's numbers
show that in the last three primaries, but particularly in Iowa,
the majority of his supporters, almost 90 percent, made under
$70,000.  How do you interpret the common man theme in this electoral
cycle?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think there is.  You know, the Democratic
party demagogues these issues.  They take working men and women
who are really hurting, and they try to play class warfare over
it, and they try to suggest that a few more government bureaucracies
and a couple thousand more bureaucrats will make it all right,
and we all know that is foolish.  It hasn't worked.
<p>
But there are some in my party that are kind of cavalier
about this sort of issue.  They sound like they don't really care
that America's basic industries have had to downsize in the last
20 years, and they act sort of neutral over the question of whether
American companies start building their plants in places like
Mexico and China and so forth.
<p>
I grew up in a blue collar family, and I know how those people
think, what they strive for, what they care about.  A lot of those
people play by the rules.  They are the backbone of the country,
and I hope my party will fashion a message for them that is attractive.
I think Pat Buchanan is doing that, and I think that is why in
Louisiana and Iowa he did so well among voters making less than
$30,000 a year.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Everyone is packing up and leaving Iowa today,
heading off to New Hampshire and around the rest of the country.
We should know in the next six weeks who is going to be the leader.
How would you advise candidates about getting legs, building
legs, taking their campaigns forward?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think for all the candidates the basic
message is this:  that the American people are interested in smaller
government and lower taxes, traditional values, the sanctity of
human life.  Mold those things together.  Put together again the
Reagan coalition that really won three landslide elections, two
Reagan elections and then George Bush on Ronald Reagan's coattails
in his first race.  Put that coalition together again, and that
is 55 to maybe 59 percent of the American people.  That is a majority
in any race, and it is the road to victory for the Republican
party.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thank you so much for being with us today.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <I>Straight
Talk</I> discusses the new sexual revolution.  Stay with us to
hear why teens are committing themselves to abstinence.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In the beginning of the sexual revolution,
our cultural leaders, from liberal university professors to movie
stars, first questioned marriage, said love should be free, said
we didn't need that kind of commitment.  But free love turned
out to cost everything, from dreams of growing old with one faithful
partner to sometimes life itself.
<p>
So our society went looking for band-aids to cover the symptoms.
Sometimes a temporary fix came in new drugs for the latest twist
on sexually transmitted diseases, like chlamydia and syphilis.
Then came AIDS.  Now they are pushing condoms, saying sex should
be safe, but safe sex can be risky to your health and your heart,
and so the pendulum swings back.  Generation X polls indicate
a new revolution, a time for a love that is real and lasting and
pure, a love that sees sex as a celebration of two lives shared
together forever.
<p>
Are these ideas controversial?  They are the foundations
of Family Research Council's Save Sex for Marriage campaign, which
featured young adults who have committed themselves from this
day forward to save sex for a lifetime love in marriage.  The
campaign appeared in national magazines such as <I>Rolling Stone</I>,
<I>Seventeen</I>, and <I>Teen</I>, and the response isn't what
you may think.
<p>
Many young adults called and wrote FRC actually thanking
the pro-family organization for speaking for the growing number
of people who don't want to be a statistic of one night stands
and broken dreams.  Relationships are very important to the generation
which best understands the tragedies of divorce, fatherlessness,
and abandonment.
<p>
Today not everybody is doing it.  There is a resurgence toward
abstinence, in part because it is easy to see that so-called safe
sex isn't safe and it isn't enough.  In fact, in a recent survey,
84 percent of sexually active teenage girls said that the topic
they most wanted information on was how to say no to sex without
hurting the other person's feelings.
<p>
Research also indicates that the sexually active struggle
with the untold story of emotional ties difficult to break, and
in a sexually predatory environment, many people are looking for
a way out, as well as a way to tell a real love from a line.
<p>
Among America's youth, virgin is no longer a dirty word.
The new sexual revolution isn't about sex at all.  It is about
saving it.
<p>
As you can see, a whole new sexual revolution is afoot, and
to help us understand why, I am joined by Juliette Pierce, an
abstinence educator who created her own successful program called
Choices from the Heart; Mike Griffin, a high school teacher who
has implemented abstinence education for students at Bishop McNamara
High School; and Gracie Hsu, a Family Research Council analyst
who has studied teen sexuality and written a number of pieces
redefining today's sexual attitude.
<p>
Welcome to the show, everyone.  Thanks so much for joining
us.  I am in very sacred company here, the experts.  You all have
been looking at issues of teen sexuality for a long time, and
we were talking before the show started.  I had a sex education
program where we had to learn how much it cost and where we could
buy it and had pop quizzes on that kind of thing.  I imagine that
you all wouldn't want to see that taught in some of the programs
you are working with.
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  No, you would not be getting that in Mr. Griffin's
sex ed course.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What would I be getting?
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Well, I am teaching at a Catholic school, which
focuses on a lot of things from the Catholic teaching, but even
more specifically to the sex education issue, you get a values-based
curriculum.  The kids need to know the plumbing of sexuality in
the body; more importantly, they need to know how that relates
to their life.  Oftentimes kids do know some of the plumbing,
but when it comes to choices, they do not know them.
<p>
I'll give you an example.  The other day in my class, I had
a freshman who was telling us the ABCs of the female reproductive
cycle, and when asked the question &quot;how long is the entire
woman's menstrual cycle&quot; gave me the answer of four days.
Now there is a good chance from the numbers that this kid may
be sexually active, which, as I said to the girls in the class,
is a bit scary, that the kids do know the plumbing, but they don't
know the values, and they don't know some of the moral issues
that lay at the heart of human sexuality.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Did you find that as well, Juliette?  You were
working with AIDS and HIV teaching.  Did you find as you were
looking at the mechanics of disease and sex that values was totally
missing?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  I did.  In fact, I talked to a group of youngsters
about don't you want to be involved with someone who loves you,
and the response that I got was what do you mean love?  I don't
want anyone to lie to me.  It was as though they would be insulted
if someone insinuated that there was love involved, because then
they would realize that that wasn't real at all, and they would
prefer the person be honest with them.  So there was a real lack
of values involved.
<p>
So what I try to do with Choices from the Heart is to talk
to them about why it is they choose to be sexually involved. 
What is the reason behind it?  So let's not treat the symptoms
by giving them ways to protect themselves, but let's talk about
how they can really do some introspection, look at the motivations
behind why they are sexually involved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What would you say are the top one, two, three
reasons why kids are having sex and having it very young these
days?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  Well, I can tell you that I've gotten a separate
set of responses from males and females.  From the females, the
answers range from trying to lay a foundation for a relationship,
trying to solidify a relationship, peer pressure, and then thirdly,
just wanting to feel grown up, and that was the way that they
were doing that.
<p>
The males, on the other hand, had a whole separate list of
responses.  Their responses ranged from peer pressure, feeling
like they were left out if the fellows, quote, unquote, knew that
they were not sexually active, to, you know, the whole idea of
being able to conquer someone and what that is about for them,
and then, lastly, probably just wanting to be involved in a relationship
and making it something that was very special between themselves
and that other person involved.
<p>
But if you will note from those top three responses, there
are very few areas where the males and females agree on the reasoning,
which was a real red flag to say to them, look, there are two
separate agendas being promoted here.  You know, who do you think
is going to win when both people have an agenda and they don't
share the same goals in being sexually active?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Common sense relationship skills.
<p>
Gracie, there is a lot of discussion on abstinence programs,
and we are certainly talking to two people who know how to run
a good one.  What does the research show about how do we help
kids restrain their sexual impulses?
<p>
MS. HSU:  Well, the number one reason why kids become sexually
active is because they don't have a good support base, or at least
that support base is collapsing.  So, of course, the best prevention
is to have two parents in the home who love the kids and who will
raise them with an expectation that they will save sex for marriage.
But beyond that, if there is sex education in the schools, which
we don't completely come down on, but if there is, then we want
it to be in abstinence-based programs, because those programs
have shown to work.
<p>
In complete contradiction, the contraceptive-based approaches
actually show that there is more sexual activity, more exposure
to sexually transmitted diseases, and an increase in teen pregnancy,
and that is not what we are looking for.  We are looking for success,
because what contraceptive programs do is that they make equivalent
not having sex the same as having sex as long as you don't have
any of these outcomes, and we know that when you have sex, even
if you don't get pregnant or get an STD, that you are going to
be suffering long-term with broken relationships, in marriage,
with a more difficult time to have sexual satisfaction, things
that really do impact kids' lives on a long-term basis.
<p>
But if I could just give a little pitch to some good abstinence
programs, for example, Best Friends, right here in the city, has
just done a recent evaluation, and it showed that only 1.1 percent
of all the girls that have been through this program have gotten
pregnant.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And this is a relational program, where you
pair girls up with an adult to provide a little more support.
<p>
MS. HSU:  Right, and there is also the positive peer pressure
that comes about, because they will say I'm your friend, and you
cannot do this, and I will hold you accountable.  And that's really
what this is all about, and we would like to see that kind of
thing replicated, because it really has to do with positive relationships.
If they have a good father figure, you know, or a good mom who
is willing to lay down the rules and hold them accountable, then
you know that you are going to have a far better -- not just in
terms of being abstinent, but a better kid in terms of character
development, being able to have self-control and self-discipline.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of the people on the left say that the
reason why kids are getting pregnant is they just don't know enough
about condoms, and they are going to hand them out everywhere
we go; we're going to make them free; we're going to subsidize
them.  Ironically, we spend about $10 for every condom-based program
to any $1 or less than $1 on abstinence.  Do you find that kids
have heard of condoms?  You know, have they heard of contraceptives?
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes, definitely.  Let me say one thing.  Teaching
in a Catholic school, there are a lot of things that may be different,
but in terms of teaching this issue, I don't think what I'm teaching
is anything different than could be taught in a public school,
and make no mistake about it:  from dealing every day with teenagers,
promoting condoms as well as the abstinence message sends a double
message.  You can't have it both ways.
<p>
I had one of my students last year who, when I described
Joycelyn Elders saying we want to teach abstinence but we also
need to teach them what to do in the back seat and that is using
latex condoms, you know, they said to me, they said, &quot;Mr.
Griffin, what are they saying?  They are saying on one hand, you
should be abstinent and wait until you're married, but on the
other hand here's a bunch of condoms.  You know, what are the
condoms for, to abstain with?&quot;
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
And the kids ask the questions.  We need to, as adults, realize
that they need some guidance, and that's why I could not agree
more with what Gracie said.  As a teacher, I know that ten times,
maybe a hundred times, more important than what I do is what goes
on in the home, and that's where the public schools might take
a lesson from the Catholic schools in which our job is to support
what the parents are being taught, and the parents want values
taught.
<p>
They don't want to turn their kids over to sex educators
and health educators in the public school who have their own agenda
and their own set of priorities for these kids.  They want values
taught to them, and even if parents may not have made all the
right choices themselves, they want something different for their
kids, and they want some help.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Juliette, you work with some kids that are
really troubled.  If the home is broken down, what do you think
a person like yourself can tell them?  We have about a minute
left.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  What I do is I talk to them about what their
goals and aspirations are.  What is it that they would like to
see in terms of their life, and then let's talk about the choices
that you're making right now and how that plays into your ability
to realize those goals and dreams and aspirations.  So even if
their home life is such that they really can't see any support
or reinforcement, but I'm saying to them I know that's what you're
seeing, but what about your life?  You have some degree of control,
and let's talk about how you can make the best choice.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  These are exciting programs.  Please join us
after the commercial break as we continue to discuss why young
people need to hear that saving sex is the best way to save themselves
from physical consequences and emotional heartache.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <I>Straight Talk</I>.  I am
joined again by two people who offer more to teens than the choice
of using or not using a condom, abstinence educators Juliette
Pierce and Mike Griffin, and we are joined by Rob Anderson, a
medical technician and body builder who was featured as a model
in the Family Research Council Save Sex campaign.  Thanks so much
for joining us, you all.
<p>
These guys are some professionals, Rob, but I know you work
with kids regularly and have used body building even to help meet
people and as an inroad.  What do you find when you're talking
to kids really helps them say I want to take control of my sex
life, as well as my physical life and my mental life.
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Well, the thing I've found most important
is developing a relationship with the kids, getting to know them,
and I think the most important thing is credibility.  When they
know that you've taken a stand and that you have made a commitment
to abstinence and that you are doing the same thing that you're
talking to them about doing, they really appreciate and respond
to that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you find that it has called a more open
communication maybe than you were initially comfortable with to
kind of take that stand?
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Well, yes, it got real open.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
I really had no intentions of ever modeling for a poster
promoting abstinence or anything like that, and you know, when
people who knew that I took that stand asked me would you do that,
I thought, my goodness, but the opportunity presented itself and
I said if I'm really going to take a stand, I might as well take
the stand.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's right.  Very visible, too.
<p>
In your work, do you find people like Rob who stand up and
who is an athlete, does that make a difference when you see other
people, other adults, taking a stand?  Juliette, what do you find?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  It makes a tremendous difference, because I
can tell you that in the earlier part of actually introducing
Choices from the Heart, I felt like I was the lone voice crying
in the wilderness, and there were so many people who felt very
passionately that I was wasting my time.  So to see someone like
Rob say that, you know, I believe in this enough to go public
with it and to talk about it is very important, and I think youth
can identify with someone who they know is not too old to have
any fun.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's right.  Or want to, anyway.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  Exactly, exactly.  And they say if this person
has made this decision, then maybe I should think again about
the choices that I've made.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Great.
<p>
Being in a faith-based school, Mike, I wonder if it is different.
Probably people assume there are lots of role models around.
What has helped support your efforts?
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Well, it is definitely role models, and Rob
won't be leaving the studio today until he agrees to come to Bishop
McNamara to talk to my kids.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But, yes, they need role models, and they do sort of assume
-- you know, we were talking before the show; a lot of people
assume Catholic school, all of a sudden these kids will have gotten
this education already, but they need role models, too.  They
need people who will walk the walk, and that is one of the things
that I have found helps the effectiveness of my program.
<p>
Some days I'll walk in there and I feel like I am fighting
every single cultural attitude out there, but the one thing that
I have is I'm walking the walk, and I can tell them this is what
I stand for, and kids today, if they need anything, it's someone
who will stand up for something.  In a society where so often
they see people bend their own morals just to fit whatever they
want to do with their life or their particular immediate goal,
to see someone who will stand up for values is something that
they will take with them forever, and that will make a difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We've been talking a lot about saving sex and
abstinence, and I think we have to emphasize that we are not talking
about people who maybe have never had sex.  We're talking about
people making a decision from today forward.
<p>
Rob, when you're talking to kids, do you see a lot of kids
discouraged, you know, saying I'm sorry, I had sex; I can't do
what you're doing; it's too late for me.
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  I've seen a lot of
kids like that.  I went to one group downtown, and this one girl
said, you know, &quot;I understand you're telling me that I have
a choice, but sometimes you get in situations where you don't
have a choice,&quot; and I was just devastated.  I mean, I didn't
feel like I could say anything.  But talking to those folks, I
always try to emphasize that it is from this day forward.  A commitment
to abstinence, like you said, isn't -- you can't commit to the
past.  You can only commit from this day forward, and hopefully
I can be encouraging to folks that way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Juliette, what do you say to the kid who says
&quot;look, I can't do it; it's too late for me&quot;?  What's
your response?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  Well, I tell them from my own personal experience.
I tell them that at 22 I came to the realization that, you know,
I was tired of having my heart broken, and I realized that there
was a direct correlation between the amount of involvement that
I had in a relationship and my ability to recover after the relationship
was long over.
<p>
So what I do is I share with them that this is something
that you can do, and what you have to do is really make a decision
and then look at your lifestyle, look at the company that you
keep, look at the choices that you are making, and let all of
those things correspond or reinforce your decision to be abstinent
from this day forward.
<p>
So that means that if you are involved with someone and that
person has not taken the same stand, then chances are that that
relationship is going to go through quite a bit of tension, because
you are going to be fighting against, you know, someone who wants
to be involved with something that you don't.  So I encourage
them to involve themselves with individuals who are of like mind
so that they are already lessening the chances that they will
be faced with compromising situations, and to think through a
date.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, right.
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  So if it means that John can't walk me to the
door tonight because long good-byes lead to early good mornings,
then John can't walk me to the door.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's right.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  And try not to spend a lot of time alone with
that person, because you know that chemistry alone is going to
cause you to interact with one another, but if you are in the
company of others and everybody is on the same page regarding
their commitment, then chances are you're not going to be involved
in those compromising scenarios.
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes, I have to say, in talking with my students,
some of the most powerful and persuasive moments when I can see
the benefits of abstinence come from those who may have been sexually
active.  I was in my classroom the other day, and I felt like
Rob; I felt like I wanted to break down when one of my 16-year-old
students looked at me and said, &quot;you know, being involved
in this game and in this lifestyle, sometimes it's gotten to the
point where I'll be talking and a boy will be talking to me, and
I'll even in the back of my mind ask myself, you know, why is
he messing with me?  Why is he even talking to me?  What's he
got on his mind?&quot;
<p>
I thought how sad to be 16 and so cynical, but how realistic,
too, and what the kids need to see is, as you said in the opening
piece, the sexual revolution, all of these great rewards that
are supposed to come from this type of living and from this activity
just don't cut it.  They don't happen.  They don't make it.  So
sometimes those kids who may have been in this situation can be
really powerful.
<p>
So I try to bring some of my seniors, maybe who have been
sexually active and who as a result of the course have chosen
abstinence, come back, talked to the younger kids, and tell them
I know, I've been there, and I can see why that's a lie; that
lifestyle, and those goals, and those promised rewards don't end
up materializing.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  The other piece of that, too, that I want to
add is that there's a misconception that intimacy means physical,
and one thing that I reinforce to them is you can be intimate
with someone and hold their hand, because intimacy is your willingness
to commit to knowing what's going on in my heart and what's going
on in my mind, and if you are willing to do that, then you can
look at me, and I'll feel as close to you or even closer than
if we were actually physically involved.
<p>
So let's look at what intimacy really is and the commitment
that it takes to get there and not just reserve it for something
that is physical, because truly that is where we have missed the
boat.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And in taking marriage out of the equation,
we've lost the fact that sex is the culmination of an intimate
relationship, not the evidence of it.
<p>
We don't have a lot of time left, but one thing that we've
looked at, and I wanted to see if you all agree with us.  So much
discussion of AIDS and death and the down, how sex can kill, as
the Family Research Council has looked at data, we've said, look,
it can't be all about death.  We're not telling them don't get
a disease.  We're telling them there is something good out there
if you have the skills and the self-confidence to wait for it.
<p>
Let's go around quickly before we get to the end.  Rob, what
would you tell kids in terms of why it's a joyful, enjoyable thing
to wait, rather than just the AIDS.  I mean, we know sex can kill.
What don't we know about how good it can be to have a more stable
relationship?
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Well, I'd say that I waited, and it was worth
the wait.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
I just got married this December.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Congratulations.
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  And that commitment to save sex for marriage
is now a new commitment to stay committed to my wife for the rest
of my life, and I would just say that that commitment just yields
peace in my heart from knowing that I'm not bringing a whole lot
of baggage into my marriage relationship, and my virginity was
a gift to my wife on my wedding night, and it was a blessing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic.
<p>
Mike, what would you say, the positive side?
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes, that's why I get really personal with
the kids.  I tell them, you know, the reason why I'm waiting is
so that when and if I get married I can look at my wife and say
I loved you even before I knew you, and I committed myself, and
if I want to go all the way with marriage, I want an all-the-way
way to celebrate it, and that is through sex in marriage, and
the rewards will come after that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's fantastic.
<p>
Juliette, what would you say, the positive?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  I would let them know that the choices that
they make today will give them the ability to make choices in
the days ahead, but if you don't make the right choices now, then
you don't have the ability to make the choices in the days ahead.
So to draw the correlation between the right now and then, and
every young person has goals and aspirations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Oh, yes.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  No matter what they are or how bizarre they
may be, they all have them.  And wouldn't it be great to know
that all of those possibilities are available to you and that
absent of something tragic, you have the ability to live out those
dreams.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I hope that people will call us to hear more
from you all.  Thank you so much for coming.
<p>
When we return, <I>Straight Talk</I> will bring you some
individuals who have committed themselves to saving sex for real
love.  They have their own unique reasons and experiences, and
you won't want to miss them.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <I>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</I>.  I would like to welcome some
very special individuals to our show, Kate Gilchrist, a young
woman who, although formerly sexually active, has committed herself
to saving sex for marriage, and Maggie Kuhn and Scott White, each
of whom are waiting to share themselves with their lifetime love
in marriage.  Thanks to you all for being here.  We really appreciate
your time.
<p>
We see a lot of discussion, especially in the world of numbers,
about Generation X and what people think and what people feel,
but you're the people everybody is really talking about.  How
do your peers see sex?  Do they think it's insignificant whether
or not sex takes place, or are they concerned about issues of
the heart?
<p>
Scott, how about you?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  I think a lot of kids think that sex is just
something that they can do in high school that there really aren't
any consequences with what happens afterwards.  They really don't
see the long-term effects of maybe a pregnancy or maybe an STD,
but it really just depends on what circle of friends that you
get into, with some kids getting involved with different things,
where you see some that completely stay away from sex and that's
not even an option, but other people just think of it as a casual
thing on the weekends.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that most people, Maggie, appreciate
the consequences?  Are they thinking about AIDS?  Are they thinking
about anything?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I think a lot of time people, especially high
school students, are just so excited about the freedoms that they
have in high school.  It's just getting older and knowing that
you're your own person.  I think a lot of times people don't really
think about the consequences, because they're so caught up in
doing what I want to do, and they don't really think about whether
or not this is what they want to do.  They're thinking about,
you know, what's great for right now, and they're not always thinking
about the long-term consequences.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think, Kate, that there's not enough
information out there, or do you think it's the way it's told,
or do people need more of a personal approach, someone to come
alongside.
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  I think that there is plenty of information
out there, and I think that it is an individual's own choice.
I think it is a lot the age that you're at in high school.  You
go through, like, this rebellious stage where it is easy to just
totally go against your parents, even if they talk to you about
it all.  I really don't think that a one-on-one would work.  I
think it really just depends on the individual itself, because
I know that I wouldn't have accepted a one-on-one from anybody.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What helped you make your decision to say from
this day forward I'm going to save sex for marriage?
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  I got sent away to a program for two years,
and I realized that God had really just taken me out of the whole
situation that I was in and placed me in a place that could just
help me get my priorities straight again, and when I was able
to come back home I was so different that I did not want to even
resort back to sex, because I realized how much God had just done
for me when he pulled me out of that whole situation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So in your circumstances, it would have been
faith that made a key difference.
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  Yeah.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Among your friends who are saving sex, what
do you think is making a difference?  What's helping people make
that kind of decision?  Scott, what do you think?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  I think that a lot of kids, really, they don't
want to see sex as -- it's the ultimate gift that you can give
your husband or your wife, and that's just something that you
can really -- that's the one thing that you can hold onto and
that nobody else can take away, and it's really your decision,
because a lot of things in this world, you really can't count
on, and that's one thing that you know that you can have and that's
going to be your decision to give up or not.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What about you, Maggie?  What do you think
is helping people when they make a decision to save sex?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I think it's very much a personal conviction.
I think you hear so much about sex in our society.  It's so common.
It's just something you have to decide on your own, and I think
for most of my friends and for myself, I think it's just having
faith in God's plan and knowing that sex is perfect when it's
within marriage, and you just have to wait, and you know, it's
hard to wait, because we're all human.  We want immediate answers,
and we want immediate intimacy, and sex seems like such an easy
way sometimes, but really it works in the opposite direction,
and when you really wait, sex is just created for marriage, and
that's how it's the best.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, you all are talking about a lot of people
have to make up their own minds, but Scott, you're on a council
in your high school to kind of bring some abstinence-based programs
in. Do you think a peer group approach works better?  What motivated
you?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  A lot of kids -- the council is just a student
advisory council, and they're basically what Fairfax County, which
is the high school system I go to -- they're using that as a forum;
they're now using abstinence as an option, whereas before it was
more geared toward safe sex.  Most people are just really -- the
approach they are trying to do is just a peer-based group, and
they are trying to use peers as saying, look, this is going to
be an option instead of just worrying about safe sex, or no sex
at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you guys think about the culture that you
live in, you know, the movies, the music, is any one thing more
difficult to take than any other?  Where does the most pressure
come from in terms of kind of saying, hey, it's no big deal, have
sex, whatever?  Maggie, what is your impression?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I can't really single out one specific type of
media or one specific area of our culture.  I think it's all over,
and that's what is so overwhelming is that it's not just one area.
It's not one thing you can turn off.  It's everything.  It's
in music.  It's in television.  I mean, you read about it all
the time, and that's what is so overwhelming is that our society
just -- it's just common.  You know, having sex before marriage
is seen as totally normal, whereas saving yourself until you're
married is just -- well, it's not spoken of, really.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It really isn't, is it?  Kate, now that you've
made even a chance of plan, are people respecting your change?
Are they saying great job?  What's the response of people?
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  A lot of people at my high school -- it's
a public school, you know, not a lot of Christians around there
-- they don't understand why I can't have sex, as long as when
I get older it's not as it is now, you know, just a lot of different
people and stuff, and people at my church and at youth group where
we go to, they really accept it and they just think that it's
great, and I'm really affirmed by that, and there are people at
school that, you know, they're, like, that's just amazing that
you can do that, you know.  It's hard.  It seriously is.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Where do you think some of the biggest pressure
comes from, if you kind of look -- is it the whole pile-on of
the culture?
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  I think it's everything.  I think that there
is a lot of peer pressure in the schools, and not only in the
schools, in the music that you listen to.  I know I listen to
a lot of R&amp;B and stuff, and every song that you pretty much
hear, every slow song, is about, like, somebody's legs or having
sex with somebody, and seriously it is, and it's just like, whoa,
what does that put in my mind, and t.v. shows like <I>Melrose
Place</I> and <I>90210</I> and just shows like that.
<p>
I mean, it's just like relationship, relationship, having
sex with one person and another.  It's just crazy stuff, and it
just all really just fills up your mind.  I think it's how much
you accept it and how much you watch that stuff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Sure.
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  Like, I just choose not to watch those t.v.
shows.  One, my mom won't let me, but, two, I just choose not
to, because I see a reason why.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How can any of you defend yourself?  You've
made a decision.  You know, what do you do to defend yourself,
maybe, from the culture or even from the peer group that might
say, you know, hey, it doesn't matter.  Scott, what can you do?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  Well, I think it's really like Maggie said before.
It's a personal conviction, and that is just the basis, I think,
of my walk and knowing God's plan for me.  He knows that whatever
happens, if I'm supposed to get married or not, that He has just
called me, and He has just said I'm not supposed to have sex right
now, and that's just one of those things that you just kind of
take to heart and you just really think about, that you don't
really have -- that is not an option for me right now to worry
about.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We have very little time left.  Maggie, I'm
going to let you close us out.  What advice would you give someone
who is kind of struggling right now?  How would you encourage
them to make the kind of decisions that you three have so courageously
made?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I would just say to just step out for a second,
step out of your life and look in and look at what you're doing
and really, you know, question your actions.  I think so often
people just act without thinking, and when you really get down
to it and think about having sex before marriage, it honestly
doesn't make sense.
<p>
I just think so many people if they just took a step back
and actually looked at what they were choosing to do, whether
it be just like a quick decision or even if they think, okay,
well, I really love this person, I think they really need to just
stop and think about what they are deciding and remember that
sex is a lot more than a physical thing.  It has emotional ties.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's really personal.
<p>
Thanks a lot.  Thank you for joining me, and when we come
back, there will be more <I>Straight Talk.</I>
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <I>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</I>.  FRC staff is often asked by the media to
present their views on issues affecting families today.  In December,
Cathy Cleaver, FRC's Director of Legal Policy, gave her view on
the increasing cyberporn threat.  So let's take a look at an excerpt
from an <I>NBC Nightly News</I> cyberporn story as <I>Straight
Talk</I> brings you some Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News"></center>
<p>
[Segment from <I>NBC Nightly News</I> follows:]
<p>
MS. PAULEY:  A different kind of government shutdown in the
news tonight.  What happens when smut and freedom of speech collide
on the Internet?  Today Americans who use the CompuServe on-line
service found they were subject to another country's rules.  Here
is NBC's Fred Francis[?].
<p>
MR. FRANCIS:  Because CompuServe has a global reach, it says
it was forced to block -- some say censor -- access to 200 sexually
explicit discussion groups on the Internet to appease a German
prosecutor who found the material pornographic.
<p>
In the dark alleys of cyberspace, where pedophiles can prey
upon very young children, it is common on the Internet for sexual
predators to roam free.  This man was charged and convicted for
luring children through the home computer.  Even adults are often
enticed by raw and raunchy pictures and text.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER:  It's going to take laws like Germany has, saying
we are not going to tolerate child pornography; CompuServe, stop
serving it to your subscribers on a silver platter.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  <I>Straight Talk</I> continues after the break.
Stay with us to hear how you can get more information regarding
the issues and trends affecting you and your family.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us here at <I>Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council</I>.  If you would like
to receive more information about our organization, tonight's
guests, or the topics discussed, call us at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week we will be discussing one of the hottest family
issues nationwide and in Washington, D.C., parental rights.  What
are parents privy to and excluded from when it comes to their
children's lives and sometimes life-changing decisions?  We hope
you will join us next week to find out as we continue to bring
you a unique pro-family perspective not often heard in the media
and exclusively seen here on <I>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</I>. Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> asks who 
holds the right to raise our nation's children today.  Inherently it is 
the parents' rights to decide their children's upbringing and education, but 
these essential rights are being challenged across America.
<p>
For example, just last summer Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Earls[?] were refused the 
right to the results of AIDS tests and cervical cancer tests given to
their 13- and 15-year-old daughters.  Who held back those results?
The same Georgia middle school that condoned a counselor driving
the girls to a health clinic during school hours where they were
tested, given condoms, and prescriptions for birth control pills
without their parents' knowledge.  We will find out why this scenario
is becoming increasingly common and how some are attempting to
combat increasing government control over our children's lives.
<p>
But first, let's hear about the current buzz in Washington and
across the country about the first Republican primary.  I had
the opportunity to discuss the Iowa and New Hampshire results
with Family Research Council's Bob Morrison, who is special assistant
to Gary Bauer.  Bob provides insights into what the primaries
mean to you and what they could mean to our country's upcoming
elections.  With Super Tuesday just around the corner, you probably
won't read Bob's perspectives in your local newspaper or hear
it on your favorite newscasts.  So stay with us as <i>Straight Talk</i>
takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, thank you so much for being with us here on Behind the 
Headlines. A lot of attention is being paid to Iowa and New Hampshire right
now.  Is that attention deserved?  Historically, have these states
been make or break?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  Sure they have.  They are very, very important throughout 
their history.  It is a way for a system that has grown large and unwieldy 
to sort of break it down into a manageable size, Iowa being part of the Midwest, 
New Hampshire representing sort of the flinty Yankee tradition.  They are 
still states where you can do politicking on a retail basis, at least
until this year, where it wasn't always a question of how many
ads can you throw up on television but how many people can you
meet in lodge halls and church basements and high school auditoriums.
How many people can you just go to a meeting among farmers? 
So both states are manageable, and that is why they play a critical
role.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think there is something special in
the mix of midwestern practicality and family values and the northeastern
frugality that makes it really important that we be in those two
particular states, or do the candidates really illuminate themselves?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  Well, there is a conservative bent, in that sense.
In the Republican caucuses and primaries in those states, there
is a tendency toward a more conservative side, which the Republican
party has seemed to represent over time.  In the Democratic party,
that is not necessarily the case.  In the Democratic party, some
notable liberals have done well in Iowa and in New Hampshire.
So those are critical points.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How have they evolved in importance?  Well, in this year in 
particular we have had what is called a front-loading of the primary and 
caucus system, so that candidates have really been out there campaigning 
furiously for well over a year.  Some of those candidates who announced
for president in the Republican side announced six months to nine
months earlier than they typically did in years past.  There is
going to be a fury of campaign primaries -- mostly primaries from
this point on -- between now and the end of March.
<p>
So it is very possible by mid-April, by tax time, we may see a winner emerge
who has amassed more than half of the delegates that are necessary
to be nominated on the Democratic side and on the Republican side.
Now it is assumed that President Clinton has no opposition, no
declared opposition, that they will just sort of routinely go
through the motions and he will wrap up the victories he needs
to assure his renomination.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One rather schizophrenic criticism of the process is that on the 
one hand Iowa and New Hampshire make really liberal Democratic choices and on 
the other hand very conservative Republican choices.  Is that fair?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  The activists in both parties tend toward being liberal
in the Democratic party and conservative in the Republican party.
That is the tendency.  Now we all know that there are well-known
conservative Democrats:  Governor Casey of Pennsylvania, Sam Nunn
of Georgia.
<p>
There are conservatives in the Democratic party; there
are liberals in Republican party:  Arlen Specter, Governor William
Weld.  So to the extent that these folks still get elected in
various offices, you cannot say that the parties are monochrome,
they're all one thing or all the other.  But this is the first
opportunity to bring out some of those seething activists who
have been waiting to get in there and pitch in every four years,
the people who may have a terminal case of Potomac fever.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Every political year, people like to complain about
the limited choices available to them, and yet the political process
does seem to continue.  How have some of our greatest leaders
fared in the Iowa and New Hampshire process?
<p>
MR. MORRISON: They are relatively modern vintage, so basically Ronald 
Reagan, as I mentioned, did not do well in Iowa in 1980, came smashing 
back to beat not only George Bush but Bob Dole and a host of other
contenders in 1980, and Reagan was basically the man to beat after
the New Hampshire primary.  In 1984, the New Hampshire primary,
the Republicans, Reagan was just renominated.  There was no contest
really.  But for the Democrats it was a very big fight, and that
is when Gary Hart came forward.
<p>
As far as presidents who have been elected, as I mentioned, Reagan did 
well in New Hampshire. We also had Carter doing well in the Iowa caucuses. 
Carter came on to win the New Hampshire primary in 1976.  Bush, of course,
coming out of New Hampshire in 1988, captured the nomination and
went on to win the election.
<p>
A key New Hampshire contest was four years ago for Bill Clinton.  Bill 
Clinton was in serious trouble in his candidacy.  There were stories about 
draft evasion. There were stories about womanizing.  He was in very, very 
serious political shape, but he was able to score a number two slot.  He did 
not win the New Hampshire primary.  Neighboring Senator Paul Tsongas,
former senator from Massachusetts, actually won, but this is that
expectations game.
<p>
Clinton was able to come up so close to Tsongas in New Hampshire that 
he virtually came out and proclaimed himself the comeback kid and 
essentially was able to reenergize his campaign coming out of New Hampshire. 
In a short period of time, people thought that Clinton had won New Hampshire.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Prior to the influence of Iowa and New Hampshire, most political 
candidates were chosen by party bosses in the back room.  Now we have this
more democratic approach, Iowa and New Hampshire, I think, very
powerful in that.  Are we better served today by electing our
candidates in primaries or by the old system?
<p>
MR. MORRISON: If you had a national primary, then the other things that 
people don't like, the concentration on money, would only be that much
more intense.  You would have to raise huge amounts of money to
mount a campaign nationwide.  Even as we have it, with what's
left of Super Tuesday, several southern states holding primaries
on the same day, as we come out of New Hampshire you are going
to see that a lot of people have to raise a huge amount of money
very quickly.
<p>
The odds will then tend to favor those who have already raised a huge 
amount of money. President Clinton obviously is in good shape for 
fundraising.  Senator Dole is in good shape for fundraising.  But it 
is not absolute.  The interesting thing is what these states do in spite of 
big money, and the example that we have this year is the fate of Senator Gramm.
<p>
Senator Gramm once said that he had the best friend in politics that you 
could have, ready money, and he had said that you needed to have $20
million to even get into this game.  He didn't even get to the
first primary, and that's not the only time that has happened.
Texas Governor John Connelly, former Secretary of Treasury, he
raised a massive amount of money in his campaign -- I believe
it was close to $10 million -- back in 1980, and yet Governor
Connelly did not survive this Iowa and New Hampshire winnowing
process.  So basically what Iowa and New Hampshire do is not so
much to give us the nominee but kind of tell us who has been culled
from the pack.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Well, Bob, as you and I are sitting here talking, people 
are actually voting in New Hampshire. So when the people are watching 
this <i>Straight Talk</i> episode, already the results will be known. What 
would you tell those people who are already aware of what happened?  How 
could they interpret the events?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  Well, just basically don't lose heart,
be engaged, make your wishes known.  If you are happy with the
outcome, stay with it.  Encourage other people.  We have had too
much disaffection and cynicism in our political system.  It is
not an ideal system, but as Winston Churchill said, democracy
is the worst system except for all others that have been tried.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being with us on <i>Straight
Talk</i>.
<p>
MR. MORRISON: My pleasure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> delves 
into why parents' rights to make and influence key decisions in their 
children's lives are slowly diminishing. Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am now joined by Cathy Cleaver, Director of Legal Policy 
for the Family Research Council.  Cathy's extensive research into
the parental rights issue has led her to some interesting court
cases currently being battled across the United States.  Also
joining me is Paul Webster, a legislative assistant to Congressman
Steve Largent of Oklahoma who introduced the Parental Rights and
Responsibilities Act of 1995.  Welcome, both of you, to the show.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Cathy, you have been tracking this issue for a while, and 
for others it might seem self-evident. Okay, we care about parents. We 
think they should be in charge of their families.  But what has brought us 
to the point where we are actually looking for legal outcomes?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Well, we are just recently seeing an increasing, I feel, 
arrogance on the part of government in protecting children from their 
parents. We have seen it at the U.N., in the rights of the child, and
now we have seen it increasingly in our country.  The most evident
examples are the condom distribution programs, where condoms are
given to children as young as 11 or 12 years old, even over their
parents' objections.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And even in New York, the New York state court ruled that 
the parents could have no say.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER:  Well, New York, we were lucky in New York two years
ago.  New York said, no, this does violate parental rights, but
just last month the Massachusetts Supreme Court case saying parents
have no rights in this regard, children will be given these condoms,
even if parents object, was denied a hearing by the Supreme Court.
So now we have a terrible situation in Massachusetts where parents'
rights were simply dismissed.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So having conflicting cases, Massachusetts and New York, does 
that drive it towards the Supreme Court, do you think?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Perhaps eventually. That's what we thought would drive it to 
the court this time, but they said no.  I am sure there will be other cases, 
and we will be working on cases to take it up to the court to resolve
this, because there is precedent at the court.  The court has
said that parents have this right and that the right shouldn't
be infringed.  So it's not anything new that we are searching
here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Paul, wasn't the condom distribution kinds
of cases that perked your attention and Congressman Largent's
attention, or were there other things that made you think we need
to get involved legislatively?
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Well, what our interest was was a desire to support and protect 
America's families.  Congressman Largent came to Washington with really an 
agenda that was two-fold: one of them which focused on fiscal matters, 
balancing the federal budget; the other one specifically was to support and 
garner some kind of governmental, I guess, inactivity or limits on the 
government to the kinds of things that are going on that many families across
our country feel are threatening or infringing their ability to
just live the way that they live, live the way that they were
brought up, those types of interests.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Give us an example, you know, some issues that you all were 
looking at and saying I think the line is getting a little fuzzy here, and 
it shouldn't be.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Well, I think it's very clear.  I was asked a question, 
&quot;well, I have kids, and are you telling me that all these government 
interests are trying to break down my door and do terrible things between 
my children and I?&quot; My response is I don't think that anybody is 
proactively targeting your family to go after and make some kind of mischief.
<p>
What we hear in our office are families that are going about their 
business attempting to raise their children the way that they raised or
the way that they think that their conscience dictates and finding
that just in the normal course of day-to-day activities, either
through a school or through some other government agency, that
they are now prohibited from just confronting their educators
and saying, hey, listen, I take great pains to instill in my children
things that we believe in and values that are important to us,
and we would really appreciate it if you didn't contradict us
through whatever means that you are doing so now.  And those kinds
of reasonable actions are the kinds of actions that many times
across the country have been halted and really given families
very little recourse in terms of what they can expect and what
kind of support they can expect from the government.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it has been particularly sensitive on issues like sex 
education, condom distribution, and the discussion of values that might 
come up in, say, outcome-based education, where we are going to define
diversity as a value and then maybe bring in issues regarding
homosexuality that might have a different moral perspective than
parents.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER:  The school is very often the setting for
these kinds of violations of parental rights.  Psychological counseling
that parents don't want given to their children but that is given,
regardless of the objection, that is another big area, but even
outside the school, child protective services sometimes have come
into the home -- in fact, I shouldn't say sometimes, more often
that we would like -- come into the home and removed children
on mere rumor or on things as benign as spanking of a child. 
Now that doesn't happen every day, but it's happening with increasing
frequency, and that is sounding an alarm for parents.  You know,
we should be able to discipline our children with reasonable corporal
punishment, for instance.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.  You know, I think one thing a lot of people aren't 
aware of is that the Children's Defense Fund, a very liberal so-called 
pro-child group, formerly headed by Hillary Clinton, has advocated that no 
child be allowed to come home from the hospital until a social worker has 
been there first.  What other big picture, you know, big picture new
world order kind of intrusions do you see proposed by people?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Well, the children divorcing their parents.  There's
another key example, I think maybe derived from the same group.
We have a case out of Washington State that people have looked
at for some years and have been frustrated about where parents
were trying to protect their child from drugs and from sleeping
from her boyfriend.  This is a minor child, and that child wanted
to file for divorce, and social service agencies came in and said,
no, you child, your rights are being trampled on by your parents.
So we are going to protect you from your parents.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I know, Cathy, you've taken a look at the U.N. convention, 
and one of the concerns of people who want to strengthen parental
rights is that talks about the child's free right of association,
maybe to associate with drug dealers or to associate with people
who they are concerned about.  I think everyone appreciates in
their own life their parents saying that person you cannot hang
out with any more.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Beyond even that is the uninhibited right to receive any 
information or any speech or material that the child wants, including 
specifically pornography.  It's ridiculous. I mean, the U.N. is so far 
out of touch, but the scary thing is that U.N. principles are being forced 
upon our country against, I believe, our citizens' will.  President Clinton 
in 1994 signed the U.N. treaty on the convention on the rights of the 
child. It needs to be ratified now, and we are urging the Congress not
to ratify this for that reason alone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  I think there are really two dominant perspectives on
this whole issue.  One of them is very child-centric, that is,
whatever it takes to enhance and maintain the welfare of the child,
and the other one is a, in my perspective, much more common sense
approach, and that is our country was founded on freedom.  It
was founded on the right to be peculiar, if you will, antiquated,
progressive.
<p>
We have a society that is a free society and whose government was 
established to maintain that freedom, regardless of how it manifests 
itself, and so we are seeing the notion, the concept of freedom being 
held hostage by this idea that we have to protect specific and certain 
segments of our population no matter the cost, even if it costs us our 
freedom.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Paul, what is the status of the legislation right now?  Where
is it?
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  Well, we are very happy to see a Senate companion
to our House bill.  That is S-984.  The House bill is HR-1946,
and both chambers, the Senate and the House, have conducted subcommittee
hearings where witnesses have testified on behalf or in opposition
to the concept of the right of parents to direct the upbringing
of their children.
<p>
Right now we are working with organizations, the Family Research Council 
and other organizations, to get exact precise types of language that 
allows the courts very little wiggle room in terms of how to interpret 
the rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children.  We have 
128 co-sponsors on the House side.  So we are very excited about that, and 
we are looking forward to a subcommittee market scheduled where they'll
entertain amendments or changes to the bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Great. We are going to want to hear more about that after the 
break, and Cathy, thank you so much for being with us.  I would certainly
encourage anyone to call the Family Research Council for some
of Cathy's excellent materials.  Please join us after the commercial
break as we continue to discuss the rights of parents as we are
joined by those who are on the forefront of this issue.  Stay
tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[Segment from Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act Press Conference 
follows:]
<p>
MR. LARGENT: Currently there is an imbalance between who makes the decisions 
in the home between parents and the government as you can see represented here 
on our balance.  Parental rights.  I think this is a graphic representation
of what we're talking about.  American families in the balance.
<p>
Currently, parental rights, even though they have been recognized
as a fundamental right by the Supreme Court, by lower court decisions
time and time again all across the country, the lower courts do
not recognize parental rights as a fundamental right.  What we
do with the parental rights bill is codify into law a federal
statute that parental rights are a fundamental right and should
thereby have the same protection as any other fundamental right.
<p>
Today, because of the imbalance or misinterpretation of Supreme
Court ruling, parents must demonstrate that the government has
acted unreasonably in order to prevail.  Government must demonstrate
that it simply has acted in a reasonable fashion in order to prevail
in court cases where their parental rights have been usurped.
<p>
There are four specific areas that we address in the Parental
Rights and Responsibility Act.  That is the right of parents to
direct the upbringing of their children in regards to their education,
their religious training, their medical care, and the discipline
of their own children.
<p>
We'll go to the last chart, and then I'll introduce Greg Erken with Of The 
People. This is what we want to see as a balance between government and 
family in terms of who directs the upbringing of our children.  After the 
Parental Rights bill is passed, we will find a situation where parents
must demonstrate first that the case is about a parental right,
again, one of those four areas that I addressed, and that the
government has intervened in their parental rights.  This is the
four-step process that we are putting in place with the parental
rights bill.
<p>
Then the last two steps, the onus is really on the
government to show that there was a compelling governmental interest,
not a reasonable cause or a reasonable interest, but a compelling
governmental interest existed and it used the least restrictive
means.  This test is applied to all fundamental rights protected
by the Constitution.
<p>
We are not erecting a new test here. We are simply saying that what the 
Supreme Court has decided over the last 70 years in terms of parental 
rights being a fundamental right, that this is the standard that should be 
applied and is the accurate standard that the Supreme Court has already 
decided, and we are simply placing that in federal statute.  So that is
the heartbeat, the guts, of the Parental Rights and Responsibility
Act. That is what we are trying to do.
<p>
MR. ERKEN: I'm Executive Director of Of The People, which is a coalition 
of parents, state legislators, and grass roots activists working at the state 
level to add a parental rights amendment to state constitutions.  Our
efforts at the state level are working in tandem with the federal
efforts here represented by this legislation to guarantee the
rights of parents.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  We find it confusing and alarming that so much of government 
today seems determined to relieve of us of our parental responsibilities 
and rights, especially concerning education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you can see, it seems the parental rights battle has 
begun at the federal level.  I am joined again by a key player, Paul 
Webster, legislative assistant to Congressman Steve Largent. Also 
joining us is Greg Erken, Of The People's executive director, and 
Rebecca Bocchino, a parent who became fed up with her children's education 
and began to research why her fight to change things seemed so hopeless. 
<p>
Thank you for being with us.  Greg, your group has been working at the grass 
roots level to get behind this piece of legislation.  How is that working,
and why did you get involved?
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Well, Of The People has been working for about two years now, as 
you say, at the state level working to add a parental rights amendment to 
state constitutions, and we are also working with Paul and Congressman Steve 
Largent's, who is Of The People's national vice-chairman, in support of the
federal statute.
<p>
Just as some of your other guests have said and
will say, we got into the fight because it seems in so many areas
parents across the country are running into what we call a we
know what's best mentality for your children, whether it's condom
distribution or the resistance to school choice and vouchers,
psychological counseling or the threats to the rights of homeschoolers,
I would connect the dots and say that there is an overall assault
against parental rights and responsibilities, and we need to directly
counteract that at the federal and state level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, it's interesting that you have the right to make 
decisions for your parents unless it's different from a judge or a social
worker, it would appear.  I mean, your rights go as far as their
judgment would take you.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Yes, that's right.  I think what parents are facing now is 
occasionally they are allowed by our kind bureaucratic elites to actually 
oversee their children and their children's decisions once they leave the 
house, but we need to reverse that decision, that attitude, and we need to
make sure that parents in the vast majority of cases are in charge,
and it's the schools and other bureaucratic shops that should
ask the parents can we teach your children this, and how about
this?  Would that be okay if your child was in such-and-such a
class?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Exactly. Rebecca, you are a parent.  I know
that there were some parents that led you to say, you know, this
has been frustrating.  I need to make some changes.  What happened
in your own family situation?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Well, we thought we had moved to one of the best school 
districts in the nation. Fairfax County, Virginia is one of the largest 
school districts in the nation, and we thought we were coming to a place 
where our kids would get the best education that they possibly could,
only to find that most of the decisions were made by the school,
and we found the process of involving parents was so manipulative
that parental input actually was changed to parental reaction,
and I noticed my kids were coming home with more and more intrusive
questions, more intrusive curriculum.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Give us an example.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Guidance counseling, use of journals, sex education. I 
mean, Fairfax County is full of it, and the more questions that I asked, 
the more I was treated like the enemy and the more hostile reaction I got. 
<p>
The guidance counseling manual in Fairfax County goes into great detail in 
instructing counselors how they can stiff-arm parents from getting 
information about what their children are being counseled on, even though 
the manual admits that parents have the right to know, and two parents in
Fairfax County asked through a FOI request, a Freedom of Information
request, to know what was done with their children, and they were
told that it would cost them $600 to find that information out,
and that is unbelievable.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And that is already taxpayer funded. I mean, they are paying 
for the education the children were receiving.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Sure.  And parents found their kids were being exposed 
to psychotherapeutic techniques. Two programs that have received the 
most criticism nationally, Pumsy[?] and DUSO, were both on the approved 
materials list in Fairfax County.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, so people understand, these are sort of dream fantasy 
projection kind of things.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Give them a little detail on what Pumsy, for example,
would do.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Pumsy used guided imagery.  One of the
exercises involved tying up the teacher and blindfolding the teacher
in the middle of the classroom.  These exercises were designed
to teach students that they could retreat into their own mind,
into their own world, that they were the sole authority.  All
information could be obtained within.  Parents found their children
were taking psychotropic trips in the back of the family station
wagon, just self-induced hypnosis whenever they felt like it.
Even though counselors denied that they were using these techniques,
they lobbied hard in the general assembly not to ban the use of
psychotherapeutic techniques in the schools.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing. What are you seeing, Greg?  What other kinds of 
stories? I mean, the majority of the stories seem to come from the schools, 
where taxpayer money is presumably helping our children, but they are
not going to tell us what they are doing to help.  What else are
you seeing?
<p>
MR. ERKEN: Well, I think one of the classic kinds of cases that we see 
nowadays is condom distribution in the public schools, and parents are 
opposing not just the condom distribution, per se, but the fact that 
they are being handed out to their minor children over and against their 
consent, and there have been a couple of legal developments in the past 
couple of years that point out the need, why we need additional legislation 
for parents.
<p>
Parents in New York City a couple of years ago successfully sued
to get an opt-out in New York City for condoms.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now an opt-out, you have to explain that.
<p>
MR. ERKEN: Sure. A parental opt-out is a provision whereby a parent 
doesn't have the ability to stop the distribution period in the schools 
but does have a mechanism to make sure that their child either, say,
does not receive a condom or at least the parent is notified before
their child receives a condom from the school nurse or whatever
the mechanism is.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  While an opt-in program would be parents saying, yes, 
please give my children condoms; here's my written consent, like the same 
thing a parent would do to go on a class trip.  Yes, my child can go, rather 
than my child only can't go if I say no.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  That's right.  In a lot of ways an opt-in is preferable, because, 
after all, aren't we trying to get parents more involved with their child's 
upbringing and in the public schools.  Shouldn't we kind of fight the couch 
potato mentality that allows parents, after all, just like the rest of
us with human nature -- it's too easy to go on autopilot and to
say someone else will make the decisions for my children.  Let's
have parents make those decisions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Paul, you're on Capitol Hill.  What has been the response to 
congressmen and senators when you come with these kinds of horror stories. 
I mean, are they interested in the fact that parents like Rebecca
are being told it's none of your business what happens with your
money or your children?
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Their response is really surprising.  The first response is 
are you serious? Are you telling me that some parent in Georgia has to fight 
in order to not allow the school to take their daughters to a county health 
facility without their knowledge or without their consent?  They say are
you serious that kids in Massachusetts were exposed to blatantly
offensive and sexually explicit materials in the school assembly?
Are you serious that tests are asking things like are there handguns
in your house; are your parents on welfare?  You know, when was
the last time you masturbated?
<p>
They can't believe that this is the state of the relationship between their 
community government and their schools, which for the most part has the 
greatest government access to children and parents.
<p>
The other thing that is hard to believe that I like to point out to legislators 
on Capitol Hill is why is that so many of these state and local governments are
so willing to go to the mat for some of these things that seem
so silly and so peripheral to the education process when national
statistics are replete with examples of illiteracy, inability
to fill out job applications, remedial education in college of
basic mathematics.  I mean, it just seems to be a prioritization
that does not reflect the wishes and the needs of American families.
<p>
So really the biggest reaction is I can't believe that we need
this, and when we do explain to them, they say, wow, that sounds
like very commonsensical legislation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It's interesting the amount of attention paid to the sex lives 
of children rather than their reading ability.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Oh, it's amazing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to talk more about that in a moment.
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll hear more about the endangered
rights of parents.  You won't want to miss it.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. I'd like to welcome our guests back to the
show:  Paul Webster, legislative assistant to Congressman Steve
Largent; Greg Erken, Of The People's executive director; and Rebecca
Bocchino, whose life as a parent was affected by this key issue.
<p>
Rebecca, you were saying that in your discussions with parents
there are a lot of misconceptions about parental rights.  What
are you finding?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Some parents are making the mistake
that we need to ask the government to give us parental rights,
and that is wrong.  We have the right.  It is inherent.  It's
God-given, it's inalienable, and it is the proper function of
government to secure those rights.  Too many times we even see
Republicans talking about local control.
<p>
This whole opt-in opt-out issue, for example, in Virginia was tossed back 
to the local governments, and even some Republicans were plugging that as 
a good thing. I'd like for legislators and governors and mayors to understand
that parental rights is not subject to local negotiation.  It's
inalienable, it's inherent, it's our right, and it's the proper
functions of government to secure those rights.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And you were saying that sometimes government plays the race 
card in being against opt-ins, for example, which empower parents.
How do they do that?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  The Virginia Education Association and the NEA love to 
argue that because some families don't speak English or have other 
cultural barriers, they would not necessarily understand enough to 
make a decision to opt-in to a program. By their own logic, then, they 
also have to admit that they wouldn't understand enough to opt out, 
and if our long-range vision for education is truly lifelong learning, 
shouldn't we do all we can to lift parents up to the point where they can 
make an intelligent decision for their children?
<p>
I don't happen to agree with the statement that minority families are 
incapable of making decisions for their children.  I find minority families 
to be some of the most interested in their children's morals and values and 
education of all, and I disagree with the Virginia Education Association
and the NEA in that assumption, but we really should take a look
at opt-in as the preferred method of obtaining parental consent.
<p>
I mean, you couldn't walk into an emergency room and have a surgeon
go ahead and operate on your child unless you told them no, and
we shouldn't have it that way in the schools, either.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: As a matter of fact, the research would indicate that 
minority parents are even more conservative and concerned, and perhaps
the education establishment knows that, which is why they use
them to get out of asking.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Sure, absolutely.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What's been your experience, Greg?  You are spearheading
this state by state.  What are you finding?  As parents go to
their legislators and say we want some action, how is that being
received, and what have you been doing?
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Well, in state after state, the reaction is as Rebecca has 
described. Generally they are getting pretty much of a stiff arm, the 
parents, that is.  Paul touched on another interesting issue, which is as 
the parental rights movement grows, it is not going to be just the
kinds of parents who are concerned about the kinds of values that
are being taught, in sex ed and everything, but there is another
whole group -- and obviously there is a lot of overlap -- of parents
that are concerned just about academic standards.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Maybe not about the condoms, but when Johnny
comes home and he can't read or write, they want to get involved
with the public schools.  They are running into the same problem.
But help is on the way, because Of The People right now has launched
a number of efforts in states to put our simple amendment, which
says the right of parent to direct the upbringing and education
of their children shall not be infringed, into state constitutions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How many states are you in right now?
<p>
MR. ERKEN: We are active in 28 states, and we have a lot of interest in
the other ones.  We are going to ballot by a citizen initiative
in the state of Colorado.  It will be on the ballot there in November
1996, and I think we will also be very successful moving the amendment
by legislation in Michigan and perhaps Illinois and Alabama.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And certainly the research would indicate that when
one state embraces something like that, you get a real wildfire
starting.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  That's exactly what we are after.  We think
that the parental rights movement, because it is so potent, there
are so many parents like Rebecca out there who are fighting to
defend their families, this has the potential to become what we
call the term limits of the social values movement where we get
some victories at the state level, it spreads like wildfire, and
in turn that's going to help the efforts of Congressman Largent
at the federal level.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  And we've already seen state legislators begin to propose 
-- in Indiana the state house just passed a statutory parental rights bill 
that was -- it was not a state constitutional amendment, but Indiana, 
Alaska, Washington State, Kansas, I believe, there are a number of state 
statutory efforts that are going on.
<p>
I mean, it seems odd that we have to argue the point for something that 
is so common sense as to parents, you're good parents, you have the 
best interests of your children at heart, please, go about your business, 
we bless you and we support you, do your thing.  It's kind of funny.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In a country where an accused murderer is innocent until 
proven guilty and parents are held in suspicion, you know, almost guilty
until proven innocent.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  And it really does smack to the very foundations of what 
the United States is all about. Our constitution guarantees that we have 
certain civil liberties that are fundamental.  We have the liberty to 
speak. We have freedom of religion.  We have the liberty to believe. We 
have the liberty to exercise in the press, in the media.  The Supreme
Court has already said that -- 70 years ago was the last time
they iterated this -- that parents have the freedom to raise their
children free from governmental interference or intrusion.
<p>
So what we are really talking about and what underlies all the discussions
about today's social problems is the constitutionality of the
freedom for people to live as they choose, to live without overarching
governmental intrusion.
<p>
You know, the interesting thing back is if we look back 200 years at a 
different time in history, the people of this land revolted against a 
government that was too intrusive, that was too tyrannical, that stiff-armed 
their citizenry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Taxation without representation.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Exactly. Now we're having parenting without representation on 
the local and the state level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Greg, are you all concerned about legal challenges, 
constitutional legal challenges, and how are you preparing for that?
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Well, first of all, as Paul mentioned, we are codifying 
something that the Supreme Court said, as he mentioned, 70 years ago and 
which the court has never overturned.  What we are doing is bringing in 
out of some law clerk's file that nobody sees and you parents have to hope 
that judges will remember these cases and apply them correctly.  We
are exercising the right of the people, hence our name, to move
parental rights sort of out of the ether from some of those rights
that everybody instinctively knows they have and putting it in
black and white.
<p>
That's something that the people always have a right to do, and the 
U.S. Constitution and the state constitutions always speak of enumerated 
and unenumerated rights, and all we are doing is moving this one from 
the back burner, because it's being forgotten by too many bureaucrats 
and judges and saying, hey, we want it in black and white now.  The time 
is right to add it up there with free speech and freedom of religion.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Rebecca, is this conversation giving you more hope or
more fear?  You know, do you see any light at the end of the tunnel?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Oh, definitely more hope.  I mean, this Congress
is finally -- for the first time, I feel like we have a chance
to really do what parents have been trying for for a long time.
I don't know about you, but I don't want the village raising
my child.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's right.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: And it's the socialist mindset that says if you're against 
government providing the service, you're somehow against the service being 
provided at all.  I want to be free to do what I can do for my children
and provide for them what I can provide.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you know what's interesting about that it takes a village 
comment is that in context -- and we're talking about Hillary Clinton's
book, <i>It Takes a Village</i>, where she argues that we need more 
government to raise successful kids -- the African proverb comes from the
context that when the families break down or the men leave the
family or they've gone off to war and been killed, it takes a
village to make up for broken families, not it takes a village.
Exactly.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  And it would be one thing -- again, you
could take that slogan, and in proper context it would be okay.
For example, if the village were not undermining what the parents
are teaching their children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. ERKEN: The problem is when your child leaves home, they might 
encounter something in the movies or in the pop culture, which has 
gotten a lot of attention, which undermines parental authority.  What
we need to do is shine the light on too often it's our own government,
through our tax dollars, in the schools, that are doing some more
of that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right. The village is on the attack. We've got a couple 
seconds left.  What's one last thing you'd like people to understand 
about this issue, very quickly?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: They need to get involved.  You know, the price for
freedom is eternal vigilance, and parents are going to have to
quit the country clubs and the golf games and get into the PTAs,
get on the school boards.  They are going to have to take a more
active role in their children's lives and in their education than
they're doing now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much for being with us. When we return, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shows you a bit of Gary Bauer's appearance on 
CNN's Morning News, discussing another hot issue, welfare reform. 
Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Gary Bauer makes many appearances throughout the year on a 
variety of news broadcasts.  Gary is often seen giving his insight, 
particularly on CNN.  So let's take a look at what Gary had to say on 
CNN's Morning News regarding an issue most definitely discussed in the
upcoming election debates, welfare reform. <i>Straight Talk</i> now
brings you some Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News"></center>
<p>
[Segment from CNN Morning News follows:]
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Is there a quandary here for conservatives as to how much you 
soften on this provision?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Apparently some of my friends think there's a quandary.
I don't think there is.  I believe that anything that encourages
promiscuity and discourages marriage results in more abortion
and more illegitimacy.  That's what we've got now.  We've got
1.5 million abortions a year and one-third of our children being
born out of wedlock.  That's a disaster for this country.  Part
of the problem is welfare, and we need to reform it.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Well, but you see that there's a movement, it would seem, 
within the House and among the Republicans to soften the provisions.
How much would be acceptable to you?  Can you go with vouchers?
Can you go with some form of if not cash payment, provisions
to these unwed mothers?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I tend to be sympathetic towards vouchers in all sorts of 
areas, education, welfare, and so forth, but I hope the Republicans 
don't lose their heart on this, because I think the Catholic bishops 
are sounding the wrong note in their opposition.  To follow their argument 
through, we ought to increase welfare benefits.  Let's increase them 
ten-fold, because that will get abortions down.  Nobody believes that. 
In fact, the welfare system is encouraging abortion and encouraging 
illegitimacy by discouraging marriage.  That's what we need to get at.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Do you think the Catholic bishops are just seizing on the 
abortion issue to stake out more of a claim for the liberal position on
welfare?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I don't want to get too esoteric here,
but I think that in the bureaucracy among the Catholic bishops
there's a lot of support for the traditional welfare system that
has been put in place over the last 30 years, a system that takes
money out of the pockets of the American taxpayer and uses it
to subsidize bad decisions, and I hope that the Republicans put
a stop to that.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Is there any legitimacy, if you will, to the argument that 
this will lead to more abortions, any data to prove that?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I have a 20-year record of being a pro-life supporter. I 
don't think anybody doubts that if I thought there would be even one 
more abortion, I wouldn't support this.  I believe that the welfare reform 
will result in less abortion. In fact, the states with the highest welfare 
payments are the states with the highest abortion rates.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with us 
to hear how you can get more information regarding the issues affecting you 
and your family.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us here at <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. If you'd like to receive more information 
about our organization, tonight's guests, or the topics discussed, call us at 
1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week, we will be discussing how the media influences society
today.  From television to movies to music to the Internet, we
are surrounded by the media and its control over what we see,
hear, and sometimes the opinions and decisions we make.  Does
the media take such a responsibility seriously?  We'll find out
next time on <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.
Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
takes a look at something that hits close to home, especially for us here, 
the media's influence on today's culture.
<p>
Although the entertainment world's original mission was to bring wholesome 
programming and unbiased news coverage to the public, we have strayed far 
from that intention, it seems. An example can be seen in a recent 
controversy.  Just last week on ABC's <i>Nightline</i>, a report was given 
that insinuated American Catholics in the 1940s and 1950s, as a general 
rule, were prejudiced against Jewish Americans.  And although prejudice 
exists and is a terrible thing, should broadcasters slant a newscast with 
a negative portrayal of Catholics as a whole?  Is it fair to draw
conclusions of the views of all people in a certain group?  We'll
take a look at issues such as this and others in tonight's show.
<p>
But, first, let's hear from Bill Mattox, FRC's Vice President
for Policy.  Bill's extensive research of marriage and divorce
provides some key insights into why those who pledge to spend
their lives together in marriage often find themselves with broken
hearts and broken homes.  Bill's expertise on this subject has
been published nationwide, and <i>Straight Talk</i> would like to share
some of his findings with you as we go behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bill, thank you so much for being with us today on Behind the 
Headlines. As you know, tomorrow is Leap Year Day, and there is an 
interesting old Sadie Hawkins tradition from European history in 
Scotland beginning in 1280, and into England and beyond, that says 
that on that day, women were allowed to ask men to marry them, and
if the man said no, he might have to pay a sum of money or buy
her a silk dress.  What do you think about that old custom?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, I suspect there are a lot of young women today
who would like to see that tradition carried on and would seize
the opportunity that this day might provide to approach their
boyfriend and see if he might have serious intentions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Marriage is a fascinating topic.  Every women's magazine 
talks about it in great detail.  For Generation X-ers, it is 
particularly sensitive.  They have experienced a lot of divorce and 
marriage issues.  How is the pendulum swinging for them?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, you're right.  They very much look at this issue very 
differently, I think, than many previous generations, and I think a lot 
of that is because their experiences as children have been quite
different.  Many of them, as you know, have grown up in homes
that either never had a father to begin with because they were
born out of wedlock or, more often, where the marriage broke apart;
and many of them have seen, then, first hand the problems associated
with divorce, both what it does to adults as well as the pain
that it often causes children.
<p>
I think, for that reason, many young people today are quite wary of marriage. 
On the one hand, they don't want to go and repeat their parents' mistakes 
and very much want to avoid divorce.  In fact, in a lot of the polling
that we have done, we have seen that the concern about divorce
and opposition to easy divorce is greater among this age group
than it is among older groups.
<p>
But at the same time, because in many cases they have never seen a marriage 
succeed, they have never seen conflict resolved successfully, many of them 
are not prepared perhaps for successful marriage and, perhaps sensing
that, are quite often much more willing to go the route of, say,
cohabitation than previous generations.  We have seen here in
recent years that the rise in couples living together outside
of marriage has been quite profound, especially among younger
Americans, and I think it is a reflection, ironically, of their
concern about divorce and, in a perverse way, a reflection of
the -- at least in the case of some -- a reflection of their high
ideals about marriage and the fact that they very much want a
marriage to succeed.  Unfortunately, as you know, cohabitation
is not likely to increase the likelihood of a strong marriage;
in fact, it is more likely to hinder a successful marriage.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Divorce is a very troubling subject to just about 
everybody, and in fact divorce reform today is a very big issue. People
are taking a look at how we might change the system.  How is divorce
reform being developed to bring more justice, in particular often
to women and children who are abandoned by men in search of trophy
wives?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, there are a lot of things being talked
about at the state level, and I frankly am quite encouraged by
the kind of growing dialogue and conversation and attention that
is being given to this subject.  In fact, speaking of leap year,
I just learned about a radio station down in Texas that, kind
of concerned about this issue, approached nine different judges
in the kind of three-county area where the radio station is heard
and asked them, on the 29th of February, a special day of the
year, that they not sign any divorce decrees on that day.  And,
lo and behold, all nine judges agreed to go along with that request.
They are calling it, I think, something like Home Improvement
'96 or something.
<p>
But we are seeing a growing level of interest and activism at the state 
and local level on this subject, and the policy proposals take a lot of 
different forms. The most common approach -- and, I think, perhaps the 
most appealing approach to this issue -- is one that is being advanced in 
the state of Michigan, where they are saying, look, on grounds of sheer 
justice, we want to protect spouses who do not want to see their marriages
dissolve, if they have done nothing that would, in a sense, fall
into the category of fault, so that if one spouse just wants to
get up one day and walk out, he or she is not able to do that;
that we are going to protect the interests of the spouse that
would not want for the marriage to dissolve.  Obviously, in cases
where both parties want to see the marriage dissolved, that would
still be possible.
<p>
But I think this has perhaps the greatest potential for movement in many 
of the states, because it really emphasizes this idea of justice and the fact 
that when someone abandons commitments that they have pledged to carry out, 
that has an effect, obviously, on the other spouse and also on children,
if children are involved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  If you and I, Bill, were in a contract together and we were 
both going to bring something to the table and make a product, neither one 
of us could walk away without at least its costing some money to us, let 
alone perhaps being required by law to provide part of our contract.
<p>
In a fault-based system, my understanding is that there would
be some consequences for the person who walks away.  How will
a fault system be perhaps of assistance to women and children?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Yes. No-fault divorce is, I think, a misnomer.
There is no such thing as no-fault divorce.  I think, instead,
what we really have is, in a sense, no-consequence divorce, where
there are no apparent, at least no legal consequences, to someone
breaking a contract.  And yet we know that in other situations,
if that same man goes into the work place that same day after
he has abandoned his wife and children and decides to, say, fire
an employee or to break a contract with a vendor that does business
for his company, he is going to face certain legal rules that
he must abide by or face certain consequences.
<p>
What we have done with so-called no-fault divorce is really create 
no-consequence divorce.  And I think what we want to say is, look, if 
you make pledges, if you make commitments, if you make promises, we are
going to expect you to carry those out in the same way that we
do in other realms of life, and we are going to do this not just
for your good but to protect the interests of others who make
agreements with you based on their belief that you intend to follow
through.
<p>
Now, if for some reason the other party fails to live
up to their commitment, we will not hold you to remaining in the
marriage if you do not want to.  So if there is fault on the part
of the other party, yes, you can in those cases get a divorce.
But if, instead, you want to simply abandon your responsibilities,
you will not be permitted to do so and leave all the consequences,
if you will, to the other spouse.  We will protect their interests.
<p>
To take a look at the typical divorce, generally, the husband
is leaving a wife and child, often perhaps for a trophy wife,
and what we see, though, is that the thing that he most wants
is the ending of the marriage, and he gets that.  Then in divorce
what we see is a lot of negotiation for property and children,
and often the husband comes to the wife and says, &quot;Look,
you give me the property I want or I'm going to fight you for
the kids, and it is going to cost you a lot of money.&quot;  And
child custody battles become very bloody.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you think that going to a fault-based system will 
end these bloody wars over property but primarily for child custody?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: It may. I think it would be appropriate, whatever we do about 
fault-based divorce and whether we return to it in some way, shape, or form, 
I think it would be appropriate for us to try to disentangle these two
questions, because you are right.  It is quite common for one
spouse to kind of press on the property side while the other spouse
seeks to protect their interest in terms of child custody, and
that one quite often gets the kids and very little else.
<p>
I think it would be appropriate for us to separate these two issues and
to, first and foremost, in cases where the marriage is irretrievable,
say we want to protect the interests of the child and to make
a decision about how that child should be cared for and in whose
custody that child should be placed before we then proceed to
other questions about the division of property.
<p>
If that sort of situation were in play, then I think what we would see is 
that the decisions about who gets custody of the children would be
carried out in a way that is much better for all parties concerned,
and it would be done in a way that, of course, then would not
have implications for whether or not the parties are treated fairly
when it comes to property division.
<p>
But my hope is that we can avoid these kinds of questions as much as possible, 
and one of the things again that I find encouraging about a lot of the 
discussion that is beginning to take place is there is a growing recognition
that we have a very serious divorce problem in this country, and
my hope is that we can do as much as possible to prevent divorce
so that we don't have to then deal with a lot of these thorny
issues that arise in the course of divorce or, for that matter,
many years after a divorce.
<p>
You know, the bottom line here is commitment.  If there is a commitment to 
making things work, that goes an awfully long way toward making some of 
these difficult things all of a sudden seem less daunting and more 
overcomable.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And, of course, Family Research Council has a lot
of information and resources available.  We would welcome anyone
to call.
<p>
Thank you, Bill, so much for being with us.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
looks at a few ways that the media shapes our culture today
and whether or not industry leaders are taking that responsibility
seriously.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In today's world, it is virtually impossible to escape the 
media -- from newspapers to radio to television to cable networks, to 
satellites, to movies, to computers, and the list goes on.  We are 
surrounded by it and experience its influence daily.
<p>
As the media has blanketed our nation and culture, it has expanded not 
just in scope but in the way in which information is exchanged.  The 
growth in types of communication forms has been especially fast paced in 
the last 40 years; and, bombarded by so many messages and message forms,
the definition of normal has evolved.
<p>
[<i>Roseanne</i> segment follows:]
<p>
TEENAGE GIRL: That it's time for me to get some birth control.
<p>
[End of segment.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A few cases point:  the media's depiction of the typical 
family, whom it glorifies as heroes, and what is considered acceptable 
behavior.
<p>
So as we flip through the channels, we are forced to ask ourselves 
whether media positively or negatively affects our culture today. 
<p>
To help us distinguish between some of the negative and positive effects 
of media, I am joined by Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for 
the Family Research Council. As a former <i>L.A. Times</i> writer and 
editor, Bob has first-hand knowledge of how the news media works.
<p>
Also joining me, Tom Fitton, Director of Development for Accuracy in
Media, a media watchdog organization; and Sandy Crawford, director
of the Entertainment Division for the Media Research Center.
<p>
Welcome to this show, its distinguished guests which people need to 
know. I am surrounded.  Frankly, we started the show talking a little
bit about ABC's <i>Nightline</i> in the head.  ABC's <i>Nightline</i> 
show actually came out and said, well, we know -- and how do we know 
this? -- that Catholics almost all in general, in the 1940s and 1950s,
didn't like Jews.  Therefore, Pat Buchanan, being Catholic, must
not like Jews, either.  And now you tell me that, Tom, they have
decided to apologize.  Does this surprise you?
<p>
MR. FITTON: That's right.  They implied that Patrick Buchanan's father 
listened to Father Coglin(?), who was an anti-Semitic radio priest, talk 
show host, back in the 1930s and 1940s.  Ted Koppel came out and said,
&quot;Well, even though it was in the <i>Washington Post</i> and 
reported elsewhere, we should have checked it out ourselves,&quot; and
it turns out he didn't listen to Father Coglin, and there is this
unspoken assumption, or spoken assumption, that conservative Catholics
from the 1950s and 1940s were necessarily anti-Semitic.
<p>
Ted Koppel had to apologize on air to the Buchanan family, and that is 
a big deal in network news, to have a personal apology like that,
which shows just how far they went overboard in slurring the family.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Perhaps how much they were concerned about lawsuit,
as well.
<p>
Sandy, what have you seen in your work -- I know you
look at the entertainment medium, in particular -- about other
kinds of stereotypes that are being forced on people about all
these people are like this or like that?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: We are seeing a lot of negatives, especially where Catholicism 
is involved. That attitude is something that comes into play with 
entertainment media.  Many times you will see priests who are pedophiles, 
you will see nuns who are habitual child abusers, always whacking
children around with rulers and that kind of thing.  So you will
see that kind of stereotype, especially addressing people who
are religious or addressing people who are politically conservative.
Many times the folks who are politically conservative tend to
be portrayed as being somewhat backward and old-fashioned and
fuddy-duds; we don't want to be like that, that kind of mentality.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly. I actually was on a CNN program just last
week where they made the passing slur that, well, you know that
a lot of Buchanan women supporters have never been to college.
I had to say, &quot;Well, I don't assume that that makes them
idiots, and I don't assume that that is true, either.&quot;  You
know, I am offended on both counts.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, something we have noticed, too, is that Jay Leno has 
been particularly very, very harsh about Buchanan, and every night with 
the monologues -- I mean, we can look at these monologues and understand 
that a joke's a joke, and we can all laugh at that.  But some of these
so-called jokes have started to become very, very harsh, just
very unfair assassination attempts on Buchanan, referring to him
as being a member of the Klan and just really terrible stuff.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: As if that is funny.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FITTON: You know, the instinctive thing to call a conservative a 
Nazi, even in a joking manner, and to do it constantly night after 
night certainly doesn't help the conservative cause any, and it 
shows maybe that their instincts are wrong on this issue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, you were actually in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> 
newsroom and have had a distinguished career in journalism before 
you came to this side of the fence, and I know you've got a book 
coming out soon which we want to hear about.  But what happens inside
some of the entertainment world and news world?  Are people making
these assumptions?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Yes, the assumption is always there that if you are in 
journalism, you are a liberal, number one, and they have many ways of 
testing that.  It used to be the Ronald Reagan test, I called it, 
where a small group of people would gather in the newsroom, and then 
someone would bring up Reagan's name -- it used to Nixon's, then Reagan 
--  and there would be a general smirk, and so forth, and everybody 
would make sure everybody was smirking.  And if somebody didn't -- they 
just took it straight -- they would start boring in on that person,
and they would start extracting opinions from that person, and
that person would become a lightning rod quickly if that person
didn't tow to every liberal orthodoxy.  It was uncanny.
<p>
I can say many great things about the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and I 
think it is a fine paper, but I will say it is the most intellectually
stultifying place I have ever worked.  Even the liberals were
looking over their shoulders to make sure that the particular
brand of political correctness was absolutely correct.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is easy to see political correctness on an Oscar night 
or an Emmy night.  Everybody has to wear the red ribbon and say the
same kinds of things about the Earth and fur and vegetarianism
or whatever.  But some shows -- you all, in particular, look at
a lot of entertainment things; Tom, you had some to bring up --
some shows do go a little bit further in kind of pushing a world
view.  What have you seen in your observations?
<p>
MR. FITTON: Well, we tend to focus a bit more on news, and the problem 
is the news is pretty good at usually pointing out problems. <i>Prime 
Time Live</i> on ABC a few weeks ago had a good segment talking about 
the ethics problems that children have, that many are stealing and 
cursing and doing all sorts of nasty things in ways they used not to do,
and they pointed out some advice that you could give parents to
have your child behave in a more appropriate manner in school
or at home.  And I don't know if it had to do with religion. 
Religion was mentioned once.  Children were asked, is there anything
you would give your life up for? and they went out of their way
to say, well, there was really nothing they would give their life
up for, although there was a sidebar comment, &quot;A few children
said their family and religion.&quot;  That was the only time
it was mentioned.  It was not used as a sort of model to make
children grow up right, and the parents were told basically to
have dinner with their children more often, nothing about church.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So that's the answer to our problems, is mealtimes.
<p>
MR. FITTON: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Go ahead.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: I think that is symptomatic, and Ben Stein pointed this 
out in his book, <i>The View from Sunset Boulevard</i>, back in 1980; 
that religion on television was not so much trash as it was omitted. 
You would see a priest or maybe a rabbi perform a wedding or a funeral 
and maybe listen to a confidentiality.  But that was it.  They were
never main characters.  They were always considered peripheral.
<p>
He said there's a reason for this.  Most of the people in Hollywood
are irreligious.  They are not merely lapsed Catholics or Jews;
either they are hostile toward religion or feel it has no value
in the modern world.  Stein cited various surveys that have been
backed up since then by Robert and Linda Lichter and Stanley Rothman
showing people in Hollywood are greatly irreligious.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, I have been intrigued by the popularity of <i>ER</i> 
and <i>Chicago Hope</i> and a lot of doctor shows right now, and everyone's 
on their deathbed and nobody prays, which I find an intriguing phenomenon;
you know, week after week, everyone's dying and nobody thinks,
I wonder what happens next or even talks about it.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: That is an interesting observation.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Or it is a last resort, but never in the middle of something.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I have actually never seen it.  I must admit I am a big fan 
of both those shows.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
And I have never seen anyone pray, even at the moment of death.  They are 
hanging on for their last moment, and they want to have one last Big Mac or 
something, you know? It is an interesting last wish.
<p>
What are you finding, Sandy, in entertainment?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, for the past two years we have released every year a 
study of how religion is portrayed on television, and our findings were 
very much in keeping with Mr. Stein's findings, that religion really was 
a non-event on television, that you tended to find more families who were 
watching the Superbowl together than ever going to church, ever saying
a prayer or saying grace, that kind of thing.  So our research
results do back up those claims.
<p>
As far as this general overall politicking, we have found overall that a 
lot of the politics of prime time have toned down somewhat.  The focus has 
turned to values -- sexual, moral values, moral issues -- and I think
that is where the big debate is going to be, because we are talking
about things like homosexuality and teen sexuality, that kind
of thing, and you are seeing just so much more really sexy television
shows that are out there, and even at hours early in the evening
now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to hear more about this.
Please join us after the commercial break as we continue to discuss
the media's cultural influence with those who are watching.  Stay
with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am joined again by some experts who have investigated the 
media's influence on our culture and especially our children today:  Robert 
Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for the Family Research Council; Tom 
Fitton, Director of Development with Accuracy in Media; and Sandy 
Crawford, the Media Research Center's Director of Entertainment Division.
Thank you again for being with us.
<p>
Sandy, I wanted to go to you first because we all know that newsrooms are 
supposed to be apolitical, and I want to hear about how apolitical they 
really are.  But I was intrigued recently on again a <i>Chicago Hope</i> 
episode where they portrayed a partial-birth abortion scenario.  They
got it wrong.  According to the partial-birth abortion ban, if
your life was in danger, absolutely, it is a necessary procedure.
<p>
It is always -- you know, abortion is, after all, an ending of
something.  In this episode, the baby was dead, the woman was
going into cardiac arrest, and they removed the child and called
it a partial-birth abortion to save her life and then had a show
about this where both of these facts were wrong; and, coincidentally,
it was on the timing of the vote.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you see that kind of coincidence in entertainment?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Nothing is coincidental.  Putting something on prime-time 
television means never really having to check the facts. It's all gut.
In the producers' gut, if they knew this was right, then that
is all that counts.  Don't let the facts get in the way.  And
that is something that we find in many instances in dealing with
things like we were talking about where religion is concerned.
There is a mind-set in Hollywood where the folks just -- they
don't have the facts on some of this information.  They don't
do their homework to the extent that they should whenever they
enter the political arena.  Now, there are some folks who do do
their homework.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: But in many instances it is whatever is in that liberal gut. 
That is what is going to fly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It must be true.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: It must be true.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  And they're not going to get challenged a whole lot.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: No.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: That's the problem. They're in a little glass jar, all talking 
to each other, all saying the same thing.  As Pauleen Kale, the New Yorker 
film critic, said once, &quot;I can't believe Nixon won by a landslide. 
Nobody I know voted for him.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: They are so out of it sometimes; they don't get that 
corrective, just the questioning sometimes from another point of view.
<p>
MR. FITTON: And the question seems to be, what is the impact?  And
for a long time during the 1980s, there was this unspoken pact.
Bill Bennett and Nancy Reagan got the media companies not to
glorify drug use in their movies or in their programs.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. FITTON: Well, that has fallen by the wayside.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is sliding, yes.
<p>
MR. FITTON:  MTV is full of music videos glorifying the use of drugs. They 
have run documentary programs on MTV. CNN has run a documentary program 
with a pro-legalization bent, and this sort of stuff is coming out in the 
form of higher drug use among teenagers.  It does have a real-world impact, 
and to pretend that adults can somehow separate what is good and what
is bad -- well, we can't allow our children to be forced to make
decisions like that because often they need a little help, and
one of the ways that we can help them is by keeping some of this
bad stuff off, by encouraging the corporations to be more responsible
about it.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Even cigarettes are back as a prop, because
Hollywood had been sensitive about that.  Young people were being
led into smoking, so it wasn't so cool anymore.  But if you see
movies like <i>Get Shorty</i> with John Travolta, the cigarette is the
main prop.  He uses it much the way Humphrey Bogart used to. 
But back when Humphrey Bogart was smoking, we didn't have these
soaring cancer statistics.  So I think they are being absolutely
irresponsible in glorifying cigarette use.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are going to look in the next segment in particular at 
the issues of children with an expert with Missing and Exploited Children.
But in terms of the news media looking at children and the entertainment
media looking at children, one thing that we have noticed is some
assumptions:  that they are sexual, that they can make their own
choices, that they don't need adults.  Do you see these kinds
of assumptions being made by the news media?  You know, get those
parents out of the way of those enlightened children.
<p>
MR. FITTON: That is right. I mean, MTV, which reaches a lot of children,
whether parents like it or not, ran a series of programs called
<i>Sex in the Nineties</i>. What they would do was produce folks who
were engaging in sexual behavior that most parents wouldn't want
their children to engage in.  There was no moral -- it wasn't
called immoral. It wasn't called, Hey, maybe you ought not to
be doing that. They presented homosexual relationships the same
way they presented heterosexual relationships.  It was seamless.
They would talk to a homosexual about his or her relationship
and then they would jump and talk to a heterosexual, as if there
was no difference.
<p>
These sorts of things are being fit to our children through outlets 
that children watch.  They really have a hostility towards parental 
values in this area.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Yes, and they always say it's always up to the parent to 
be there, to change the channel.  Any parent knows you can't be in front
of a television set all the times your children might.  A case
in point was the other day when I took my daughter somewhere but
we left our 12-year-old just for a few minutes, and we had to
tell him, &quot;Look, you can only watch this.&quot;
<p>
Well, everybody knows the human heart is just -- if you say no to 
something, the human heart wants to say yes.  If you line up 30 park 
benches and on the last one it says, &quot;Don't touch, wet paint,&quot;
that's the one they're going to touch.
<p>
So we're in a bind.  If we make a big deal out of telling our son don't 
turn on the MTV, that is undue pressure on him.  And yet if we say nothing, 
he may stumble upon it.
<p>
So don't tell me it is always up to the parent to do it. We've got to 
clean up the air waves.  They ought to be family-friendly, and every 
parent shouldn't feel you have to throw up a fortress around your house 
and children.
<p>
MR. FITTON: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Sandy, you have a tool for that, and
I know Bob has used it.  Michael and I don't have children yet,
so we haven't had the need for it.  But tell us a little but about
the <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i>.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: We put out the <i>Family Guide</i> every year. It covers 
every single prime time television show on the four major networks and 
also Warner Brothers and UPN on the Warner Brothers and UPN networks. 
<p>
So what we try to do is give parents as much information about every
television show as possible.  We talk about things like what kinds
of values are on the show, if there is a lot of sex, if there
is a lot of rude language, just so each parent can make the call
themselves and apply what works for their family and make the
decision and get as much information as possible so that they
are making educated decisions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kinds of values do you see being given to our children 
or assumptions made about our children on entertainment television?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, the major assumption that is being made about children 
is that they are ratings points; they are just rating points.  Moving
a show like <i>Friends</i>, NBC's <i>Friends</i> -- that is a 9:30 
television show if I have ever seen one, with some of the subject matter
that is on, and very risque, lots of sex, lots of very vulgar
language on that show -- moving it to 8 o'clock, the ratings went
up, and of course they went up, because there are more warm bodies
sitting in front of the television, regardless of what age those
warm bodies are.
<p>
So in many instances you have networks that are
looking at children as potential audience members, as extra points
that they can sell to potential advertisers.  So that is kind
of a sad commentary on how the networks feel.
<p>
The networks do see children as being sexual beings, that they should -- 
that their wants and needs and desires are on the moral equivalency
level of those of adults; that they should have the opportunity
to experiment sexually, that kind of thing.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Right, and therefore, they are not as sensitive to parents' 
wishes. They say, we can go to the kids directly, because if they're 
competent, after all, they can listen to the stuff as well as anybody 
else.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Tom, what have you seen?  We are coming to the end
of our time.  When you go to -- and I would like each of you to
really fast respond to this -- if you look at an entertainment
industry or news company, and you say to them, &quot;Look, you're
being an irresponsible citizen of our national community,&quot;
what kind of response do you get?
<p>
MR. FITTON: Well, you get a very hostile, defensive response, and just 
one person saying something isn't enough.  You need to write to the 
advertisers. We have confronted these folks at the stockholders' meetings. 
We have embarrassed them in public, and that is the only way these 
corporate types respond positively to these concerns.  You can't be nice
with them.  You need to say, &quot;You're going to lose money
if you engage in this sort of irresponsible programming.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you think, Sandy, when you tell them, &quot;You're
being an irresponsible entertainment producer&quot;?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, you've got to keep that two-way dialogue going. It 
is not enough just to walk away from the television, because when
you do that, you're saying that there's no hope for Hollywood
and that they're never going to change.
<p>
I really do believe there are a lot of good people in Hollywood who really 
do want to change. They need our encouragement and they need our support.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are going to get to hear more from Bob Knight after the 
break.
<p>
I would like to thank both of my guests and hope that people
will call us for more information about their excellent organizations.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will hear more about how the 
media has changed the portrayal of children and their behavior over
the years.  Is it hurting or helping them?  We'll find out after
this break.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're  back with more <i>Straight Talk</i> from the 
Family Research Council.
<p>
I would like to welcome Pete Banks to the show. Pete, a former police 
investigator and supervisor in the Child Abuse Unit is now the Director 
of Outreach at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
And joining us again is FRC's Bob Knight, who has researched the
sexualizing of our children.  Thanks so much for being here.
<p>
Pete, my introduction to your organization came years ago when I was
a reporter, and it was very impressive.  You all had a cataloguing
of materials that showed how children were being seen as sexual
objects and were working on trying to rein in that kind of problem.
<p>
What have you seen in terms of the sexualizing of children, and
what is your group trying to do about that?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, we are responsible mainly for the national child 
pornography tip line, and as such we assist the U.S. Department of 
Customs and the postal authorities in their investigation of child 
pornography.
<p>
You know, there is not a fine line.  The fact of the matter is, child 
pornography is against the law.  We are not talking about protected 
speech; we are not talking about free speech; we are not talking about 
First Amendment.  We are talking about victimizing children, not only 
when the pictures are taken but also when they are displayed, and if 
you understand that each time that child's picture is shown, they are 
being victimized again and again, and quite often that type of material 
is used to exploit other children, used as grooming tools for other 
children to say, &quot;Oh, you see, they are kind of happy, they are 
smiling; why don't you do the same thing?&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Have you seen in our entertainment media, which started 
off with adults, and a lot of people are going to be the caretakers 
of children, to children really being sexual agents on their own, what 
impact have you seen from that sort of change in the media?
<p>
MR. BANKS:  Well, you know, one of the things that we always don't like 
to see is the childhood or the innocence taken from a small child, and 
that in itself is wrong, and that is wrong when they are victimized by 
a child molester or victimized by any of the institutions in society, 
whether it be the media or otherwise.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is a concern of your all's?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Oh, certainly it is, yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And what have you been telling the police and the parents 
that you work with about that shift?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, understand that children that are victimized, not only 
does it harm them, but they also have the potential for when they grow up 
to be victimizers themselves.  I think this is something that we have found 
to be true throughout the abuse of children and throughout the sexual
exploitation of children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, I know this has been a real concern of yours and that 
some of your interest in the media came because not only was the media 
sending certain messages, but it was sort of changing the culture in 
particular for children. What have been your observations about this 
shift?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Well, the media are emitting a constant drum beat, and it 
is geared toward children, and it is that you are the main actor
here; you make up your own mind.  Only a wimp child would go to
his or her parents.  You see it all the time, and sometimes the
media promote things merely by examining them.
<p>
Case in point: a cover story in <i>USA Weekend</i> just a couple of weeks 
ago. It showed a picture of hundreds of kids, and it said, &quot;Why 
More Kids are Turning on to Pot,&quot; or something like that.
<p>
I remember during the 1960s when I was growing up that my interest in 
drugs was piqued by Time magazine and other magazines constantly 
saying, &quot;Look, everybody's doing it.  Everybody's doing it.&quot;
I felt weird because I wasn't doing it.
<p>
I got a chill when my son picked up the Sunday paper, and the first thing 
he saw was this thing, and he's going, &quot;Wow!  What's all this 
about?&quot; It is to the point where I don't want a mainstream magazine 
to come into my house anymore, because they are aiming it right at
my kid.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, there was an interesting study
not so long ago that Judith Reisman did, Dr. Judith Reisman, taking
a look at even in <i>Playboy</i> magazine over the last, I think -- 
what was it, Bob, 30 years? or since the beginning of the magazine --
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: -- that, more and more, the cartoons portrayed child sex 
rather than even adult sex in this adult magazine.  Has that been a trend 
that you have observed?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, just recently I remember seeing an advertisement
for some professional skaters, and one of the skaters was wearing
an outfit to dress up like a little child acting risque and everything.
You know, kids are naturally inquisitive and naturally risk-taking,
and we certainly don't want to be giving them more and more ideas.
<p>
You know, this is one of the things that happens on the on-line
services on the Internet, where they are able to go in and to
be whoever it is they want to be, and they wind up getting over
their heads.  They wind up getting in trouble because they are
making decisions because they haven't had the opportunity to go
through life to make the good decisions.
<p>
This is one of the concerns that we have about Cyberville.  We don't 
call it cyberspace anymore; we call it Cyberville, with citizens and with 
places. And the only difference between Cyberville and everything else is 
Cyberville has no zoning regulations, and Cyberville has no FCC.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. BANKS: So you can turn a corner and be anywhere.
At least there are some regulations, often effective, sometimes
not, that show what children see on commercial television, and
parents can make choices as to what they see on television.  But
in Cyberville, you have to be very careful about where your child
is roaming.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that the research indicates is that 
when it comes to sex acts in particular but in terms of children, 
child sex acts specifically, that we start with bringing down the 
barriers with visualization, like you said, showing alcohol, showing 
drugs, showing sex.
<p>
MR. BANKS: Grooming, it is called.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Grooming. And this is the kind of thing that, from MTV 
to, frankly, sitcoms, there is a lot of grooming going on out there, 
isn't there?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Yes, there is.  Yes, there is, unfortunately, that the 
taboos of yesterday are no longer in place, and I often wonder -- 
you know, when I retired from the police department, I kind of left
and I figured maybe we had two generations left in America before
we all killed each other, and I can remember so fondly that when
I was a kid, I mean, going to Mrs. Krischek's house with my little
bag on Halloween and getting a couple of potato pancakes and eating
them.  Can you imagine if your kid came home today with potato
pancakes?  You would throw everything out.
<p>
But by the same token, there were certain things that a child learned 
as they reached to adulthood when they are able to make the proper 
decisions, when they have had the exposure from the family.  But what 
we see now is kids without families.  What we see now is kids that
are growing up without any love, without any caring, without being
given any moral discipline by anyone.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: I mentioned earlier that the idea that the parent can be 
there and always monitor what the child is watching has fallen by the 
boards because of family dissolution.  Studies show many children watch 
hours of television and they are unsupervised.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Well, it is a national babysitter.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Yes, it really is, and it babysits because the mother or the 
father can get something else done in the meantime.  They can't be there 
every second. So they do the best they can.  They hope to leave the child 
in the hands of someone who is not going to exploit them.  But you
can't be so sure these days.  There is so much on there.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So where do we go from here?  There are tools like the 
Accuracy in Media and Media Research Center guides.  Frankly, Family 
Research Council has been interested in a P-chip, not a V-chip which 
would let the government or the entertainment media make some choices
for us, and if you buy technology, it blocks what we decide it
blocks; we have been in favor of a P-chip that a parent could
program in their own selection to block, depending on age appropriateness.
<p>
But what do you see out there?
<p>
MR. BANKS:  Well, you know, I wish we could program parents before they 
have children so that they can make good decisions, because it's a full-time 
job. We cannot put all of our eggs in the basket of technology.  We see 
that with the blocking mechanisms on some of the computers and everything
out there.  That is wrong.  Raising a kid is a full-time job,
and you need to make the right choices.  You need to ensure that
you elect officials that create the laws, that pass the laws,
that enforce the laws that protect your children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, I was talking to a parent just before I came in 
here. Sorry, I want to get your opinion on this.  She said she bought
every blocking mechanism possible, put them on the entire computer,
and then got on there and saw what was happening in some of the
chat rooms and was horrified.
<p>
MR. BANKS: Right. It's a challenge to the kids, and again, those areas are 
the, quote, unquote, protected areas. They are the free-speech areas, and 
you have to be very, very careful.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, it shows that you can't just depend
on shielding mechanisms.  Number one, your kid goes out there
and talks with all the other kids who haven't had a conscientious
parent shield them, so they pick it all up, anyway.
<p>
MR. BANKS: Right.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  The other thing is that why should the onus
be on the parents?  We've got to clean up the air waves.  This
is a little like that proposal by the President to bring back
school uniforms.  It may be a good idea for the wrong reason.
He said, &quot;Well, maybe now they won't get into fights over
expensive designer jackets.&quot;
<p>
So this is the typical liberal response. Instead of saying, &quot;Well, 
let's stop the crime,&quot; now make everybody wear uniforms.  So they say, 
&quot;Instead of stopping the trash that's coming out of the air waves, 
let's shackle all these parents to this new technological gizmo that's
supposed to help them.&quot;  It is avoiding the problem and treating
the symptom.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to have you back, Bob, to talk about 
your book looking at the impact of the media.
<p>
We have a few moments left.  What would you like parents to understand
about the world in which their children are growing up?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, what they need to understand is that the ground rules 
have changed.  It is no longer the way it was when they were children.
And the other thing is that they don't want to put their child
into a place where they're going to lose their childhood or their
innocence.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And is that the computer world today?
<p>
MR. BANKS: That is <b>the</b> world.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A lot to think about. I would like to thank my guests very 
much.
<p>
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shows you a clip from Gary Bauer's 
appearance on CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>. We'll hear what Gary has to 
say about the media. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>.
<p>
Gary Bauer had the opportunity to express his opinion on 
today's media during a recent CNN <i>Inside Politics</i> show. Whose 
responsibility is it to monitor what happens in our entertainment 
industry? Let's hear what Gary Bauer has to say on Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News"></center>
<p>
[CNN segment from April 11, 1995, follows:]
<p>
MR. BAUER: The fact of the matter is that American culture is a lot different 
than it was 10, 20 years ago and that there is a constant diet of 
glorification of violence, of sex, of anti-women attitudes, of things that 
are debased and depressing that are served up particular to our children,
and I think a lot of Americans are offended by it.
<p>
Look, you have to be Rip Van Winkle and be asleep for the last 30 years 
to not realize there has been an incredible change in the nature of what
is shown on TV and in the movies as far as language is concerned
and vividness of the images, et cetera.
<p>
I think the point there is that, constitutionally, the folks in Hollywood, 
like Mr. Scher(?) and others, are able to do almost anything they want, 
and I don't think anybody would challenge that.  But there is also such a
thing as being good citizens.  And I think what Bob Dole's hopes
-- and I believe he spoke in his speech of the concept of shame
-- I think Bob Dole hopes that people in Hollywood would start
being good citizens and be partners with the rest of us in trying
to raise children and to send messages in our culture that are
positive and uplifting rather than constantly focusing on death
and destruction, violence, and hostility and violence against
women.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
confronts the drug problem in America and asks whether there is a problem 
at all.
<p>
The Clinton Administration significantly cut back the Office
on Drug Policy, saying it wasn't really a problem.  Many believe
we are actually winning the drug war.
<p>
Well, statistics on drug use show differently.  The number of drug 
abusers, especially among teens, has risen significantly in recent years. 
The National Institute on Drug Abuse found that annual marijuana use, for 
example, among eighth graders more than doubled, from 6.2 percent in 
1993 to 13 percent in 1994.
<p>
The steep rise in marijuana use also crosses over to hard drugs. Hospital 
emergency cocaine-related cases rose from 101,000 cases in 1991 to 120,000 
in 1992, and during the same period we had that problem with heroin. 
Heroin-related emergencies soared from 36,000 to 48,000 cases.
<p>
As this battle rages and more lives are lost, we must ask ourselves, 
what are we doing wrong?  Well, tonight we will talk to some people who
are working together to answer that question and battling for
solutions.
<p>
But, first, let's hear from the Family Research Council's
president, Gary Bauer.  Over the past years, we have heard a lot
from Amnesty International and other groups fighting for human
rights in Bosnia or China, for example.  But we rarely hear of
some other rights and lives that are being lost because of the
persecution of Christians throughout the world.
<p>
Gary recently has been studying this travesty, and in fact, FRC's Marty 
Dannenfelser recently spoke before a Senate committee to bring this 
persecution to light.
<p>
So let's hear what Gary has to say about a topic which has not seen much 
air time as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Recently, Gary, you attended a conference by the Freedom 
House that dealt with the issues of persecutions of people of faith
worldwide.  What did you learn there?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, this is a really scandalous situation.  We all know that 
militant Islam is on the march in a good bit of the world, certainly 
throughout the Middle East and in many countries in Africa.  Along with 
that militancy has come an increasing amount of Christian persecution.
<p>
At this day-long conference in Washington, we got reports from
countries like Iraq, Ethiopia, Pakistan, others, Saudi Arabia,
where the persecution of Christians has gone so far that in Ethiopia,
for example, they are actually crucifying again those citizens
that they can identify as being practicing Christians.
<p>
We obviously feel deeply about this problem, not only about the fact 
that such persecution is taking place, but we also feel outrage at the 
fact that our own government, the Clinton Administration, particularly,
has been very insensitive on this.  The State Department regularly
releases reports on these countries that basically whitewash the
human rights abuses.  The State Department has caved in a number
of times to pressure from these countries on religious matters.
<p>
And so we want to really highlight in the months ahead what is
happening around the globe in these countries, many of whom receive
taxpayer dollars through foreign aid, and we certainly want to
up the pressure on the President to get serious about this issue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The events in Saudi Arabia were particularly interesting.
Ironically, the U.S. Government caved on issues relating to pornography
and a bar rather than dealing with the issues of people of faith.
Can you tell us about that?
<p>
MR. BAUER: That is really an incredible story.  Apparently, at the U.S. 
Embassy in Saudi Arabia, there was a tradition there of holding church 
services at the embassy for American citizens that would want to come by. 
There was a Catholic mass held and some other services.
<p>
The Saudi government demanded that those church services end and also 
demanded that the U.S. Embassy close an embassy-sponsored nightclub that 
American soldiers would frequent.  As you point out, the American 
Government, faced with these two demands, caved on the church services 
but insisted that the night club stay open.  I think it just shows
that when it comes to these kinds of issues, many in the State
Department really have a tin ear on these kinds of matters, and
that is particularly offensive to many American Christians.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that you talked about was that children
were being taken away from their families.  What did you learn
about that?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Kristi, it goes even beyond that.  There is widespread 
evidence of slavery again in many of these countries, only what is 
happening here is that Christian families are being broken up, and as 
part of this persecution, the children and the women are being taken away 
and literally sold into slavery in some African countries, again with almost 
no notice by the United Nations that usually is quick to point out human 
rights abuses, and certainly almost no attention being paid by the Clinton 
Administration on this issue.
<p>
We heard reports out of Iraq where Christians in Iraq that managed to 
escape that country into Turkey, they cannot get an interview with American 
State Department officials in Turkey. Instead, we insist that they be 
interviewed by the Turkish secret police.  The Turkish secret police are 
heavily influenced by radical Islam.  And so what happens is that these 
Christians that manage to get out of Iraq are sent back into that country to 
a fate that we can only guess.  At this point, the only thing we are 
exporting to Iraq are Christians, and that again is a tragedy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What would you recommend the U.S. Government to do about this?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Well, we need to be serious about human rights abuses
no matter who is involved, and certainly in these cases, which
is an area of growing abuse, we need to be very aggressive.
<p>
I think the State Department needs to start issuing regular reports
on this.  I think we need to make it clear that American foreign
aid will end unless religious persecution ends in these countries.
<p>
I would like to see the President appoint a special assistant
at the White House on this issue whose responsibility it would
be to brief him and the Congress on what it is we are picking
up through intelligence reports, and so forth.
<p>
And, last but not least, I certainly would like to see the Christian 
church arise from its sleepiness.  The church has really been behind 
the curve on this, and we quite frankly could take a page out of the book
of the Jewish community that has been very adept and very aggressive
any time a Jewish citizen anywhere in the world has been discriminated
against.  My hat goes off to the American Jewish community for
being aggressive on that kind of issue, and I think the American
Christian community needs to learn something from them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ironically, the person who is leading the fight for 
Christians being persecuted is a Jewish gentleman.  Isn't that a little 
odd to you, as well?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  That is right.  Michael Horowitz, whom I worked with in the 
Reagan Administration, has taken the lead on this issue and, quite 
frankly, has been frustrated because so many church organizations in the 
United States seem to show very little interest or seem to be fearful of 
actually confronting these countries who are engaging in this unacceptable 
persecution.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you see a parallel in the increase of persecution
of Christians worldwide and incredible support here in the United
States for a religious liberty or religious equality amendment?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think our founding fathers knew that persecution
is always just a day away, that liberties are very hard to maintain.
And I think that to the extent we turn a blind eye to persecution
in other countries, we set ourselves up eventually for not being
able to deal with persecution in this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much for being with us, Gary.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight
Talk</i> begins our discussion over ways to combat America's drug
problem.  As we look at stats, it is easy to see that we have
failed to win this tough fight.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Recently the Family Research Council hosted
a day-long seminar that brought together experts who have researched
and been personally involved in treating our Nation's drug problem.
Following the seminar, I had the opportunity to speak to some
of those experts.  In the upcoming discussion, you will meet Lt.
Col. Robert Maginnis, a policy expert now with the Family Research
Council, who has taken a look at some of the criminal efforts
involved in the drug arena; Dr. Sally Satel, a psychiatrist specializing
in clinical and policy areas of addiction medicine -- right now
she works with the District of Columbia's drug court -- and Bob
Peterson, a former drug czar from the state of Michigan and now
a leading consultant in the field.
<p>
Join me as we take a look at what these experts had to say.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much for joining us all today.  Bob, one of 
the things that the Clinton Administration told us as they gave some major 
slashes to the drug budget was that we didn't have the problem anymore so 
much; that drug use was down.  Is that your finding?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Not at all, Kristi.  As all the national surveys are 
indicating now, drug use, especially among young children, and especially
in regard to marijuana, has skyrocketed in the last four years.
And, really, we need to lay the blame to a certain degree on
the parents.  The parents of the sixties, who were experimenting
with drugs in a big way, are now raising children, and they are
giving them sort of a mixed message.  There is a value conflict.
They want to say, &quot;Well, don't use them,&quot; but at the
same time, the kids are starting to use them, and it is really
devastating this country and we don't even know it.
<p>
If you start looking at what is going on in the media, they are 
glamorizing drugs.  You start looking at what this is costing this 
country in a major way, billions and billions of dollars, far more it
is costing us than in reality what it is costing us to try to
suppress it, to reduce demand, to reduce the supply of drugs in
this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Sally, you are taking a look at people
who are in a court situation.  They have a drug problem.  Are
your numbers going down, or are you finding more and more people
coming to you for whom drugs are an element of the crime that
they are involved in?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Well, I think the data shows very well that heavy drug use is 
not going down at all, and the individuals I see are people who have been 
given a choice by a judge to either go to jail or go to a treatment program, 
and for many of them, even though they are well into their thirties, they
have never been in treatment before, though they have started
using drugs in their teens.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Are we seeing that it is possible for someone to have a 
minor marijuana use habit and that it ends right there?  You know, a lot 
of times people, when they talk about drugs, think that that there is an 
entry, a safe place where we can have recreational drug use.  Is that 
possible?
<p>
DR. SATEL:  Well, marijuana is considered a gateway drug.  I think
that one of the reasons it is a gateway to heavier drug use, to
harder drug use, is because of the criminal element that individuals
become associated with as they are obtaining the drug.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, you have done a lot with the prosecution, and you 
were at the Department of Justice and have been on the prosecutorial 
side. In your experience, is drug use and the prosecution of drug use,
do they go hand in hand?
<p>
MR. PETERSON:  Well, the two are certainly correlated, and that is what 
is important for parents to realize, is that even if your child doesn't 
use drugs, if drugs are being used, your child is at risk.  For instance, 
date rape is highly correlated with alcohol and drug use; accidents, 
with marijuana. When they decriminalized in California, the number of 
accidents or charges for driving under the influence or reckless driving
went up.
<p>
A recent study showed that, out of those who are tested,
who test negative for alcohol, who are driving recklessly and
dangerously, the vast majority have illegal drugs in their systems.
So your children are at risk from crime and from accidents regardless
of whether they are using or not.
<p>
The other thing with marijuana is that the potency has gone up.  It used 
to be -- &quot;It's not your father's Oldsmobile,&quot; they say.  Well, 
it's not your father's marijuana.  It used to be 2 to 3 percent THC, 
which is the psychoactive compound in marijuana.  Now some of it is
2 to 3 percent, but they have gotten it up to 30 percent through
hybrid breeding.
<p>
The other problem is that methamphetamine is back, which is another very 
dangerous drug, because people who take it who are unstable are a lot more 
likely to act out when they are under the influence of these drugs.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Are you finding that, as you look nationwide, if there is an 
area of the country where drugs are not dealt with strictly and quickly
-- you know, what is the word, &quot;swift and sure&quot; -- that
that does have an increase in users?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Yes. I just actually did a book on this, and what I found 
was that from 1960 to 1980, the odds of going to prison or jail for drugs 
dropped dramatically.  It went down like 374 percent.  From 1980 to 
1990, it went back up again.  Well, from 1960 to 1980, violent crime
went up something like 250 percent; murder reached its peak level
in 1980, when drug incarceration was at its lowest level.
<p>
In fact, we have this myth that we are tough on drugs.  Under the
federal system, the average amount of marijuana is 3.5 tons that
a trafficker has.  And for possession of marijuana and cocaine
and crack under the federal system, you are less likely to go
to prison for that than you are for a tax law violation, and you
will serve the same amount of time as a migratory bird offender.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The birds have it.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: That's right.  Drugs are for the birds.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, one of the things that we see at the Family Research 
Council when we try to track pathology is that people lie.  It is hard 
to get valid sex data because people don't want to be honest about their 
sexual habits.
<p>
The same problem exists in a way with drugs.  What are you seeing in 
terms of users?  How reliable is the data, and how many people are actually 
using drugs?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: It depends upon which survey you look at, obviously, and 
there are maybe 70 or 80 million Americans who are saying, &quot;Yeah, I 
have used it in a certain period of time, maybe, over my life.&quot;
The numbers are going to be elevated depending upon the cohort
of people you are talking about.  The number of kids, probably
13 percent at a fairly young age, and the numbers are going up.
Once again, it depends upon the sector, it depends upon the racial
breakdown.
<p>
I did want to say something following up what Bob said,
and I don't think a lot of our viewers may understand that when
you start looking at people that are incarcerated, the people
that are trying to say drugs are not a big problem will not acknowledge
that a lot of these felons that are in jail right now for violent
crimes were using or had used recently, prior to that crime, an
illicit drug.  And that may have had a role in their particular
lifestyle choice that led them to the felony which landed them
in jail.
<p>
Unfortunately, if we don't arrest the scourge of drugs
on our land, we are just to continue to see this, especially as
the young cohort of teenagers today grows older, or the young
kids that are being raised in some pretty dysfunctional settings
grow older and become the killers of the next decade, and we are
faced with a critical crisis that is going to be really promoted
by drug abuse.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Sally, right now we have a very strange situation 
where the government indicates that cigarette use is very, very bad, but 
maybe marijuana should be legal.
<p>
But as you look at the people involved in drugs, are cigarettes a gateway 
to marijuana, a gateway to harder drugs? Is it broken families? What are 
some of the risk factors for the people who actually end up being drug 
users?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Well, I think the first thing you mentioned was some sort of 
analogy between nicotine and other drugs, and I think that is a dangerous 
analogy to make. Certainly from a public health standpoint, tobacco is 
very dangerous -- lung cancer, heart disease, et cetera -- but in terms of 
erosion of family life, of moral values, of capacity to function in society
and to adhere to your responsibilities as a parent, employee,
a citizen, that is where drugs are trouble, and I don't see too
many people smoking cigarettes who cannot abide by the law.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is a fascinating point, because in the cigarette
discussion, one of the points that has been made occasionally
is that cigarettes are really just as bad as drugs.  But that
is not your experience.
<p>
DR. SATEL:  When they say that, they refer often, I think, to the addictive 
potential of cigarettes.  And, yes, it is hard to quit cigarettes.  On the 
other hand, the consequences for using cigarettes aren't as immediate and 
as dangerous as for using hard drugs.  So I think the analogy is strained.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going to take a look 
at the controversy surrounding crack cocaine and powder cocaine incarceration
rates. Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. As many of you may 
know, Rev. Jesse Jackson has made a lot of news lately talking about how 
the way in which we prosecute drugs is in fact racist; that crack cocaine 
offenders, generally black, are treated more harshly than those who use 
powder cocaine.
<p>
Bob, what is your perspective on that?  In our treatment of drug crime, 
do you see racist overtones?
<p>
MR. PETERSON:  I don't think it is racism.  What I have done in a study is 
I have looked at every crime -- violent crime, robbery, rape, murder -- 
and what I did is I measured the percentage of black and white victims
and then looked at the percentage of black and white imprisonments,
and what I found is that it always parallels the victim rate;
in other words, who is going to prison is based on who is being
victimized by these crimes.
<p>
Now, with the crack and the powder cocaine, they are identical chemically. 
They are identical substances. However, if you look at -- an analogy I would 
give is with an automatic machine gun and a hunting rifle and say, &quot;Gee,
they both shoot the same bullets, so they should carry the same
sentence.&quot;  One has a delivery mechanism that is a lot faster.
 The guy who is selling crack makes a lot more on an ounce of
cocaine than the one who is selling powder.  He is making more
profit and he is causing more immediate problems because of the
quickness that it goes to the brain, basically, and addiction
specialists say the quicker you get high, the quicker you drop
down, the quicker you get addicted.
<p.
The other thing is they use the federal crack laws as an example.  Under 
the federal crack laws, if you take the federal crack possession violators 
who are black and say what percent are they of the whole prison population,
it is six one-hundredths of 1 percent.  It is a very small population.
Eighty percent of those people were dealing, and the average
amount of crack they were dealing was 18,800 doses.
<p>
Now, does the difference have to be 100 to 1?  In other words, for 100 
grams of powder cocaine, should that equal 1 gram of crack?  I am not
saying that.  Maybe it should be 10 to 1.  You should look at
basically how much will an ounce of cocaine make of crack and
make it proportional.  So it does not have to be 100 to 1.  They
do have a point.  It might be a little too far.  But I do think
there is a definitely a difference, and the law has to recognize
that, and the reason there is a difference was because of the
devastation to the innocent victims in these communities where
crack ravaged their neighborhoods.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Have you seen drug crimes in general being weighted by race at 
all, or is it socioeconomic?  You said you took a look at the victims. 
What seems to mark the people who are most likely to be victims?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, for victims, of course, it is partly where you
live and who you are.  But young black males in this country are
victimized and murdered at a rate that is just appalling, and
people have to start paying attention to this.
<p>
Now, it was worse in the early 1970s when we had more lenient drug laws. 
The ratio was even worse.  But it is a very serious problem.  You know,
the number one likelihood of dying if you are a young black teenager
is murder.  And white America, all of America, has to start paying
attention to this.
<p>
But the answer is not to get weaker on drug crimes. Right now 70 percent 
of those who are even defendants for drugs are repeat offenders.  One 
in five have five or more prior felonies.  So we are not locking up a 
lot of first-timers, but if we concentrate on the first-timers with drug 
testing, fines, coordinated with treatment, we can avert the problem.
<p>
But the point is that it is based on victimization, and in fact for 
arrests, even though we incarcerate more blacks than whites for drugs,
we arrest more whites than blacks for drugs, even in the inner
city.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When we look at treatment options, Bob, you have taken a 
look at a lot of different things that are being tried.
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What is working?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Well, there are a few that seem to be working. Faith-based
organizations -- I can think of Johnny Garcia down in San Antonio,
who has a better than 80 percent success rate.  So faith-based
organizations -- and there is something about it that is just
turning people around completely, whereas a lot of traditional
programs don't have nearly that sort of success rate.
<p>
One comes to mind that we were talking about yesterday, and it has to do
with what happened in Vietnam.  You know, we would take the dopeheads,
the people on heroin, and they couldn't go back to the States.
They couldn't get on the Freedom Bird to fly out of Saigon until
they were clean and they were tested to be clean, and when they
were clean, then they could get on that Freedom Bird and come
home.  Bob mentioned yesterday to us in the conference we had
that 88 percent didn't return to using dope again.
<p>
And so that is a testimony to the fact, I believe, that self-will can 
govern to a certain degree this whole issue of treatment.  Now, of 
course, we are going to hear from Sally on treatment.  But I wanted 
to follow up just a second on what Bob said in that the politicians
in this country, I think, are listening to what the people are
saying, and the courts maybe aren't quite as sensitive, because
we have a clash over this crack-powder cocaine issue between what
the Sentencing Commission is telling federal judges to do and
what the politicians are passing mandatory minimums and saying
this is what you are going to do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: And that clash is really reflective of the differences
of opinion about how we should treat drugs.
<p>
And so, yes, we do have a crisis, and as Bob articulated very well, we 
have a crisis, unfortunately, with crack and young black drug dealers 
out there. But by legalizing it, that is no solution to this terrible 
scourge that is on our land.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Sally, some people don't think that treatment 
is a solution, either.  There is this sense that we have to legalize 
drugs, we have to treat crack cocaine more leniently, because there 
is nothing else that we can do. Is treatment a viable option when we 
are looking at people who are addicted to drugs?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Treatment is a viable option, and I always say, if you 
legalize it, I'll just have more business, because there will be 
more addicts.  I am sure of that.
<p.
But what I want to point out is that treatment is a very important 
component of any kind of drug strategy.  Right now there is a fair 
amount of relapse, especially among hard core users, when they come 
out of treatment.  But what is very important to remember is that
treatment may not work as well as we like, and I think it can
work a lot better -- and I can get to that in a minute -- but
it is very much a worthwhile investment.
<p>
The ratio of savings in costs averted of medical care, of criminal 
justice, property crime, employment time lost, the ratio of gain in 
those areas to money spent on treatment is in the neighborhood of 
one dollar for treatment to between four and seven dollars saved in 
those areas.  It is a very worthwhile social investment.
<p>
The second issue, though, is how to make treatment work better, and 
there are several things.  One very important principle in treatment
is retention.  The longer you stay, the better you do.  The problem
is, there is a high dropout rate.
<p>
One thing we should be thinking about very seriously is how to get 
people to stay longer.  Now, one obvious way to do that might be that we 
will make treatment more attractive.  Well, the point is, a lot of people 
don't want to come to treatment, and one solution is to compel them to 
come to treatment.
<p>
Now, we do that in the drug court where I work because the individuals 
are given a choice --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: They can go to jail, that's right.
<p>
DR. SATEL: Which some choose, which gives you an indication of the 
aversion some people have to treatment. Why? Because it separates them 
from their drug.  So we can use that sort of coercion through the legal 
system.
<p>
There is another strategy that I would like to see revived.  Laws are 
still on the books for this in most states, but they have not been 
used, and that is what is called the civil addict.  That is a commitment
procedure.  It is basically putting people in treatment against
their will.  These would be people who are so ravaged by drugs
that they can't even make decisions; they can't care for themselves.
They have subjugated all their other needs and responsibilities.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Perhaps the homeless, some of the homeless that
are so drug addicted?
<p>
DR. SATEL: They would be a key population.
<p>
Another important point I want to make is that studies have shown
some very nice work by a researcher at UCLA that you don't have
to want to.  Everybody thinks that in order to get better with
treatment, you have to want to; it has to be voluntary.  And what
he has shown is that people who were coerced into treatment through
these legal means did as well in five-year follow-ups in terms
of their employment, in terms of their abstinence, and in terms
of their uninvolvment with the criminal justice system as those
who voluntarily finished.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But in terms of you have to want to, if they didn't want 
to, how did those people without the legal ability to make them go, 
how were they put in?
<p>
DR. SATEL: No, they were put in.  That's my point.  Many of the people 
who finished were put in.  And then others did enter on their own
volition, of course, because of pressure from family or employer.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: I would say, with the point you raise, though,
about if drugs were legal, you would have more business, I think
you might go out of business, because the number one referral
source for treatment is the criminal justice system, and people,
as you know, generally don't seek it out a lot of times unless
they are pushed either by family or by the criminal justice system.
So I wonder if your business would be damaged because people
wouldn't be in treatment if it wasn't for the criminal justice
system.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going
to take a closer look at the marriage of prosecution and treatment.
Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>, where we are 
taking a deep look at what is going on with the drug issue in America. 
Right now we are looking at the marriage of prosecution and treatment.
<p>
Bob, you were saying that if drugs were legal, we might not have any 
more treatment.  What is your experience telling you?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, that the studies that I have seen show that the 
number one referral source for treatment is the criminal justice 
system, and what we are doing is increasingly becoming more successful
at using the justice system to both get people into and out of
treatment, but really, the basic aim is to get people off drugs,
whether they go to formal treatment or not, whether they go to
AA or NA, which are volunteer groups that are really the most
successful, and any good treatment program sends people to AA
and NA, which are anonymous groups.
<p>
In Michigan, for example, we had a program where, if a felon had a drug 
problem, and when they are released in the community, they sign a 
contract with the court, and it says I will be drug tested three times 
a week, so if I'm using, I'm going to get caught, because the cocaine
stays in your system at least a couple of days.  I am going to
be drug tested three times a week -- if it is alcohol, it could
be every day of the week -- and if I test dirty, I go to jail
the first time for three days, the next time for seven days, the
next time for 30 days, the next time for 45 days.
<p>
What we found was 77 percent over five years being drug tested that 
frequently were drug free and rearrested, whether they went to formal 
treatment or not, and the key is that some people need formal treatment,
and some addicts will get off without that.  They will get off
with the AA and NA.  And so you save resources if the court says
my focus isn't on going to treatment; my focus is you have to
be drug free.
<p>
So if you come in to me, I say, &quot;Look, here's a number. If you 
need help to get free of drugs, you call them. They'll help you. 
They've got your name.  But I don't care if you go to treatment. If 
you're not drug-free on Monday, bring your toothbrush.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Sally, what do you think about that?
<p>
DR. SATEL:  Oh, I think Bob is right that the criminal
justice system can be an excellent way to identify patients and,
for those who have to go to treatment, a great way to provide
leverage.  But I think what you were describing -- it is also
called coerced abstinence -- can be extremely effective.
<p>
Another dimension of the problem that may be useful in getting people
to decide to come off drugs is the fact that our society actually
enables quite a bit of drug use because entitlements are available
to people who use drugs.  We have supplemental security income,
social security disability insurance, veterans' benefits, AFDC,
public housing.  These all go to people who actively use drugs.
<p>
I think, for example, that what New York City is doing in terms
of considering drug testing for welfare recipients and heavy screening
of people who are entering public housing programs are very important
interventions.  If you kick the government props out from under
addicts, the world is going to start closing in, and they have
two choices:  stop or go to treatment.
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: I want to follow up on that in that in industry there 
are a lot of good programs today that we are not hearing about, and 
they are insisting upon testing, they are doing education programs, and 
they are putting the person's job on the line.  If they don't get clean
-- and they will provide help -- but if you don't get clean, you
don't have a job, and that is quite an incentive.
<p>
And parents who go through such a program, and they see their children 
begin to experiment with drugs, are beginning to communicate to them,
&quot;Look, you're going to ruin your life.  You need to get off
this stuff before it takes you down the primrose path.&quot;
<p>
Now, also, we need to consider what the message is that our kids are
seeing.  You know, they are out there listening to hundreds of
hours of bad music, some bad television, some bad movies, and
the media is really guilty of glamorizing drug use.  You know,
they think it makes them sexier, they think it makes them look
physically more powerful, that they are going to be smarter for
some reason, some pretty bad messages that are corrupting our
youth.  And somehow we have to turn that around.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It was very interesting.  On an episode of <i>Friends</i>, 
the hottest sitcom out right now, they had Marlo Thomas on as the mother 
asking the daughters, &quot;Where do we get the best drugs these days?
What's hot?&quot;  It was a very unfortunate attitude.
<p>
But I wanted to ask you, too, Sally, and have you follow up with this,
Bob, is defining drug use as a disability or an illness, is that
part of the problem?  So now you are disabled.  So here's a federal
supplement.  Do you see that as the wrong message to send about
drug use?
<p>
DR. SATEL: I think there is a problem with over-medicalizing
addiction.  Certainly there are biological and health components
to using drugs.  Their effects obviously affect the body, and
when someone is severely addicted, their brain really is compromised.
I mean, it's the old egg on the frying pan -- this is your brain
-- and they can't make rational decisions.  So there is certainly
a biological component, but biology isn't necessarily destiny
here, and I think there is a tendency for people to then feel,
well, the locus of control here is outside of me.
<p>
One very unfortunate manifestation of that was a program under 
supplemental security income which considered drug addiction a disability, 
so that if you were disabled -- in order words, if you were too 
intoxicated to work -- you could get supplemental security income.
<p>
Now, that program was examined by Congress a few years ago, and while 
it is still on the books as a disability, at least a treatment component
was built in and the benefits were made contingent upon attending
treatment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So once again it's the carrot and the stick,
and it is a big stick.
<p>
DR. SATEL: Oh, very much.  It is called contingency management in this 
field, and it can be very, very powerful.  I would like to see, as 
someone who has worked in the Veterans Administration for a while, I 
would like to see veterans' benefits, which can be very generous, up to 
$1,800 a month, I would like to see them be contingent upon veterans who 
have drug problems and who are mentally ill and have drug problems, 
contingent upon their compliance with treatment, taking their 
medication when necessary, and providing clean urines when asked.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Bob, is the disability issue a problem?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Oh, clearly, and I endorse what she said on the veterans. 
You know, we have a lot of young and old veterans that, for a variety 
of reasons, some of which, you know, they will go back to their days in 
Vietnam, and they will say, &quot;Well, because of the psychological 
impact of the devastation that I saw, I am high today on heroin.&quot;
Well, we need to help them work through it, but somehow we have
to test them, we have to facilitate the process of leaving drugs
behind, and clearly, that is a good example.  But there are other
programs, and we should not be spending government -- taxpayer
-- money out there to endorse and promote drug addiction.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Bob, some people think we are coddling our
criminals by having treatment as the first round.  Do you think
that that is true, that a disability way of looking at it is a
problem?  Or do you think treatment is the first line of defense
before prison is the way to go?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: I think enforced abstinence is the first line of 
defense, and whether that means treatment or not, I think again we 
are assuming that to get off drugs, you have to go to treatment, 
and all the studies show that is not true for everybody. As I said, 
88 percent of the Vietnam vets got off heroin without going to 
formal treatment.  We are talking about they did just as well whether 
they went and saw a counselor or did not.
<p>
So some people need formal treatment, some don't, but the focus on 
the criminal justice system has to be abstinence from drugs, not 
treatment.  We are not there to fill treatment centers.  It's there 
to make sure, when that person is released in the community, they 
are drug-free.
<p>
Now, the other thing is, I would not go into prisons and take the 
dangerous that are there -- 95 percent of our prisoners are repeat or 
violent offenders; they are not first-time drug offenders -- I would 
not take them out and put them on these programs.  I would take people
getting what I call meaningless probation.  I talk to kids, and
I say, &quot;How many know somebody on probation?  Do you think
that's serious?&quot; and they all start laughing.  Well, make
probation drug testing with progressive sanctions.  Make these
disability and welfare payments -- don't cut off the welfare mother
the first time she tests dirty; say now you don't get your benefit
for two weeks.  Now you don't get your benefit for three weeks.
Use it for behavior modification, but make sure you are going
to catch the person as soon as they do it and that you are going
to take progressively tougher action each time.
<p>
And this applies to parents, and I think that is the most important 
thing, is that everything we are talking about goes back to the home. 
I had the alcohol industry -- they have a thing called Sensory Council
-- call me, and they said, &quot;What could we do?  What could
we do legitimately that you would support?&quot;  I said, &quot;Well,
go out of business would be good.&quot;
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But they weren't willing to shut down their doors and go out of business. 
So I said, &quot;Well, the one thing I think you ought to do is, there's
a test, a saliva test, a little cotton swab saliva test for alcohol.&quot;
I said, &quot;Every parent of people from 11 to 20 years old
should have a supply of these.&quot;
<p>
I told my sons -- I have six children, and I have four sons and two 
daughters -- and I said to my oldest, I said, &quot;We run the Ronald 
Reagan School of Parenting.&quot;  And he said, &quot;What's that?&quot; 
And I said, &quot;It's called trust but verify.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So once again, Bob, we find that verified accountability 
and self-discipline are keys to success.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: That is right. You know, one of the things with treatment, 
when you tell people they can't govern their behavior, they have an 
excuse not to.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going to take
a look at some of the solutions that we as individuals and a society
can enact.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Recently there was a national drug strategy session here at 
the Family Research Council, and Bob, you directed this day-long event.
What was the goal for the meeting of the minds?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Well, we wanted to put together a straightforward, simple 
strategy that we could turn over to Presidential candidates and have them,
at the national conventions this summer, make part of their platforms.
We wanted to address the issues that we talked about today, and
we want to permeate the country with the message that drug abuse
is serious, it is not going to go away, we have to make it a national
priority, and we want those Presidential candidates to embrace
that and run with the ball.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And, Sally, you were saying that one of the things that 
we need to enact this program is some money. But it is who gets the 
money that is a problem. What were you indicating for us?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Money in terms of disability payments? Yes, my point was 
that as a clinician, the reason I got interested in these issues was 
because, when I worked at a hospital, all my patients were getting 
entitlement money, and they were turning around and using it to buy 
drugs.
<p>
Now, as a clinician, here I see that the monies they were 
getting to help them live better lives, basically to provide for their 
basic needs, were going to make their conditions worse; and when my 
patients had a concurrent mental illness -- if they had schizophrenia,
for example, it literally made their schizophrenia worse.  They
became more psychotic, more delusional, more agitated.  So what
we had was a situation where the money they were getting because
they were ill made them even more sick.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I would like each of you to go around.  You all participated 
in this discussion in last week's strategizing.  Bob, of the things that 
you all discussed, what do you think are some of the programs that are
really powerful from that law enforcement perspective?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, I think, first of all, it was very significant that 
the Family Research Council brought everybody together to do this,
because one of the big problems we have in this country, whether
it is law enforcement, treatment, or prevention, is that people
are not getting together to talk about this issue anymore, and
they are not pushing the issue forward, and they are not mentioning
it to the candidates, and whether it is President Clinton at all
his former State-of-the-Unions or whether it is the Contract with
America, the word &quot;drugs&quot; wasn't in either document.
So it is significant that we got together.
<p>
In the law enforcement area, one of the things we talked about was the 
drug testing of offenders with accountability.  Another thing was that 
the casual user -- we have to realize that that casual user is the one 
that is really fueling the drug problem.  We all like to focus on the
addict or on the people that don't have economic resources, but
it is that yuppie in Wall Street that is really fueling this trade
and getting away with it, and it is that Yuppie in Wall Street
that is more deterred by a minor jail sentence and sitting next
to some Bowery bums in the jail cell than the guy who is selling
drugs, let's say, in the inner city, because the guy in the inner
city, it's a badge of courage.  They have another notch.  I was
in prison again, you know, great job, well done.  But the guy
on Wall Street is deterred.  So those were two important things.
<p>
The other thing we talked about was the federal budget, that we
don't necessarily need more money, which I am sure Republican
candidates will be glad to hear.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Will be very glad to hear.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: The problem is reallocating the money we have. For 
instance, of the health care, the health care budget is, I don't 
know what, three to six times of any justice budget.
The total budget for state and local justice and for drug control
is 1.5 percent, okay?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, out of this health care budget, HHS -- our 
Department of Health and Human Services  -- allocates 1 percent of its 
budget, from what I read, to drugs.  The Department of Justice allocates 
50 percent.  So what does HHS say?  Well, if you want us to do treatment,
we have to take some of the Justice budget.  No.  If drugs are
driving 30 or 40 percent of your health care costs, Congress should
tell HHS, &quot;You shall allocate 30 percent of your budget to
drugs.  You find a way to do it.  Find the things that you are
over-allocating to, and you can have treatment on demand for everybody
in this country without raising a penny of tax money.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sally, from a treatment perspective, what were some
of the initiatives that came out of the meeting that you were
really excited about?
<p>
DR. SATEL:  Well, one thing I would like to see and we talked about 
was having more capacity for long-term residential treatment. This 
is treatment that lasts between a year and two years.  Its goal is to 
really socially transform the individual.  We are talking now about hard 
core users.
<p>
While the drug problem, as you are saying, may be fueled in large part
by casual users, the economic burdens are extracted by the very
heavy users.  These are people who, when they go to a place, for
example, like Phoenix House, what Phoenix House addresses is not
the drug; they address the addict and the notion that the person
has turned to drugs because of a deeper personal disturbance,
and there is a lot of rebuilding of character, of capacity, that
those treatment programs do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Fantastic.
<p>
Bob, I have to commend you.  After a long career in the military and law 
enforcement angles, you were the one that said this drug problem is a 
problem; let's get together.  This was certainly your brain child.
<p>
From a public policy standpoint, Bob, what are you excited about in
terms of this drug issue?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Well, it permeates all aspects of society.  It is 
driving our economy in a way that most people don't recognize. It is 
killing a lot of our kids, and it is killing a lot of older people.
<p>
But I see this issue really comes down to one issue, and that is 
leadership. The leadership starts at the top.  The President of the 
United States, like Ronald Reagan and Nancy at his side, needs to stand 
in front of every person in America and say, &quot;Don't do drugs. 
Drugs are bad.  They're going to hurt you.&quot;  Now, you get that 
sort of example, you identify the problem, you give them solutions, 
and you set a good role model.
<p>
Now, that has to go all the way down to the kitchen
table where Mom and Dad sit down with their son, their daughter,
and they do the things that Bob talked about earlier.  &quot;I
love you, but I'm going to test you.  I'm going to check out your
school environment, your friends, because I love you, and I want
to keep you off this, because I know this could devastate your
life.&quot;
<p>
So if we could get our politicians, our leaders, our
parents, our community leaders involved in this issue, as we must,
because it is a national emergency, then we can turn this scourge
around.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So as much as we are looking at treatment
and enforcement, for you it is a philosophical leadership issue
that is really causing some of the problems?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, if you have the leaders together, everything 
else is going to fall in line.  They are going to prioritize the 
funding, they are going to prioritize the law enforcement.  They are 
going to get the media whipped into shape to do the right sort of 
thing. You know, it is really leadership.  If we have good leadership
on this issue, we can defeat the enemy; we can win the drug war.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I would like to thank my guests for being with us
today, and I hope that you will call Family Research Council for
more information on any of these programs or some of the policy
related to drugs.  Please stay tuned.

<p>
Next week we will take a look at a sensitive, life-enhancing and 
life-changing issue for parents and children: adoption. If adoption 
is viewed as the best alternative to unwed pregnancy by the majority 
of Americans, why is it so hard for couples to adopt children in our 
own country?  We'll find out next week as we talk to individuals who 
have been affected and involved in the adoption issue when we bring 
you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Thanks 
for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
looks at an issue that seems to have been, in the past two decades of 
abortion discussion, swept under the carpet: adoption.
<p>
Although most Americans believe that adoption is the best response to 
an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, in 1991, 41 percent of out-of-wedlock 
pregnancies ended in abortion. Of the 44 percent carried to term, only 2 
percent of those children were placed for adoption.  Before 1973 when 
abortion was legalized, about one in five not-marital births to white 
women, for example, were placed for abortion.  But by the late 1980s, 
the number of children placed for adoption dropped drastically to one 
in 30.
<p>
This change has taken place at a time when rising infertility
rates show that one couple in four today cannot have children.
We'll delve into these issues and more in tonight's discussion.
<p>
But first, let's hear from Phil Olsen, the Family Research Council's
Vice President for Resource Development.  Phil and his staff are
in constant contact with the public, so they know what current
issues are resonating with American families today.
<p>
I had the chance to talk to Phil about some of those concerns, so 
let's hear his insights into what the media may not be telling you,
as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are very excited that Phil could join us today on 
Behind the Headlines.  What are people telling you today? You have 
been in the field.  It's hard to even see you sometimes in the office, 
Phil.  When you're out there in recent weeks, what are people saying, 
&quot;Look, this is the number one thing that I am worried about?&quot;
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  Well, I think that today, I think the thing that we hear 
the most is that they are very concerned about the direction our country 
is headed. They are very concerned about the moral decline that they 
see. They are very concerned about the disintegration of our society,
the difficulties that families have today just trying to be a
family.  And these are some of the things that we hear repeatedly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Are the political things here in Washington making
the top ten list of family concerns?  Are you finding it's more
fear of the personal and the breakdown in the personal around
them?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Well, I think that one of the things that we
continue to hear is that people seem to be very skeptical of the
media.  They don't feel like the media is shooting straight. 
They feel like the media is running a public relations campaign
for this administration, and I think that they are very puzzled
by some of that.  They want the truth.  They would like the straight
scoop.
<p>
I think that, given the truth, they have the ability to
make up their mind where they want to come down on the issues.
But I think that there is a general consensus that they are not
receiving the truth all the time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you think that explains in part the growth of groups 
like the Family Research Council?  You know, where are people going to 
go for that kind of information they are looking for?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I think that is absolutely the case.  I think that people are 
realizing that they need to look to organizations who can provide them 
with information that is reliable.  I think that that is something that 
has set the Family Research Council apart.  People have come to realize
that they can depend on the research that is produced by the Family
Research Council.  They can rely on the work that we are doing
here on their behalf.  I think, to be honest with you, that is
probably the primary thing that has led to the growth that we
have seen in the Family Research Council in just the last few
years.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that as you are meeting a lot
of people who are turning toward their family issues, is there
a thought that it is more the personal that is impacting or the
government?  Where are people concerned about in terms of the
impacts negatively on their family?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Well, again, I think that there is a range out there in 
terms of people's understanding of the political process.  I think 
there is a great frustration that exists, because they don't really 
understand a lot of what is happening in this country.  There has been 
for many, many years a sense that when you elect a representative and 
send them to Washington, D.C., they are going to do what is in the best 
interest of the family, or so you think.  And, unfortunately, in too 
many cases, the reverse has actually come to pass, where these elected
officials are not doing what is in the best interest of their
constituents.  They are being coerced into making decisions that
might be in the best interest of a small minority group or a small
special interest group, and that is not what is best for our country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Phil, we thank you so much for being with us in
Behind the Headlines and look forward to seeing you again.
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I thank you, Kristi.  It has been great to be with you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares insights of some experts who have researched the adoption issue.
We'll find out why adoption is no longer mainstream.  Please
stay tuned.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are talking about adoption.  I am joined by Gracie 
Hsu, a Family Research Council policy analyst, who has looked extensively 
at the legal entanglements that surround adoption.  Also joining me is 
Bill Pierce, President of the National Council on Adoption, whose 
organization is spearheading proposed adoption changes; and Chris Casey, 
Executive Director of the Campaign for the American Family, who is 
currently organizing an adoption seminar this spring. Welcome to the 
show.
<p>
Gracie, we certainly welcome you back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. You
have been studying adoption for a while.  What have you seen in
adoption trends?  We looked at some disturbing numbers in the
first segment about a tremendous decline.  What are you finding
out?
<p>
MS. HSU:  What we are finding out is that fewer teenagers
and fewer people who have unwed pregnancies and births are choosing
adoption.  Whereas there used to be maybe a significant number
of pregnancies that would end in adoption, and especially if they
were unwed, now we are looking at about 2 percent.
<p>
NCFA has done a great job in tracking these trends over time, but 
what we're seeing is that the laws, also, when it comes to adoption, 
have not been encouraging this; in fact, they have been trying to make
it so it is less popular, especially in foster care situations,
where it makes it even more difficult for adoptions to take place.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Bill, actually, I have been acquainted with your
organization for 10 years.  I have been here in Washington long
enough to say that.  What have you seen with the laws surrounding
adoption?  Are they hostile, actually, to its being accomplished?
<p>
DR. PIERCE: Well, they are, because if you think about it for
a second, our tax laws are one example.  Our tax laws provide
benefits for people through deductions if they decide to have
a child biologically.  Our tax laws even provide deduction if
someone medically decides to terminate a pregnancy.  But our tax
laws have no benefit whatsoever if someone tries to adopt.
<p>
So one of the things we have been trying to do, as Gracie knows and
as Chris knows, is to work for an adoption tax credit to be passed
at the federal level to make it possible for more people to adopt.
<p>
One of the big things that would help to really reprivatize adoption,
that would empower ordinary people, that would help change the
system in a dramatic way, would be to put a $5,000 refundable
tax credit as part of adoption.
<p>
The nice thing about it, it is one of those things which is bipartisan 
in its origin. We have both Democrats and Republicans that like it. Newt 
Gingrich thinks it's a great idea.  I was at the American Enterprise 
Institute the other day, and I heard David Bonior say that he would 
endorse it.
<p>
I think the challenge now is for us to see whether the Congress,
which is always talking a lot, can actually put a small, simple
piece of legislation together and put it through without turning
it into a Christmas tree and hanging everything that we would
like to see on one piece of legislation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But that's a fraction of adoption costs, are they not? I 
mean, what does the average adoption today cost?
<p>
DR. PIERCE: Well, there's a tremendous range, but I would say somewhere 
between $6,000 all the way up to $30,000.  But $5,000 would make the key 
difference for lots and lots of people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Chris, your organization has targeted adoption as something 
that is one of your goals. Why?
<p>
MR. CASEY:  Well, my father, the former governor of Pennsylvania,
Bob Casey, when he was governor, made adoption a top priority,
and he thinks that it's time for the national government to do
the same thing.
<p>
We have a lot of people out there who have done great things in the 
adoption area privately, but we don't see a national effort by our 
government to make it a top priority. We think it's time that that 
happened, and I think if that happens, if you have rhetorical change, 
in addition to legislation change that Bill has talked about, that people 
will start to see it as the positive, life-affirming option that it is, 
and I think then you will see that the number of adoptions start to 
increase, and, hopefully, through the work that we are doing, bringing 
people together to talk about the many problems and barriers that currently
exist in the system, we can have some real changes, I think, relatively
quickly.  I think that it is the kind of issue that has not seen
its potential on the national level, and I think it is a perfect
time for it, because we see the tremendous social costs that go
along with family disintegration.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, your father, who is a Democrat -- a lot of people think 
that this is a Republican issue, but it's really not -- chose adoption. Do 
you think because it was difficult in Pennsylvania or because he wanted 
to make it easier? Why adoption?
<p>
MR. CASEY:  Well, he has always been a strong pro-life advocate and has 
seen the tremendous dichotomy and schizophrenia, if you will, where people 
in this country will go to China, to Russia, to Latin America to adopt a 
child.  They will jump through all sorts of hoops and at tremendous 
personal sacrifice.
<p>
At the same time, when you have 4,400 children being
aborted every day, that is a situation that obviously is out of
balance, and I think he saw that operating on the state level
and wanted to do something on the national level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting that you would think adoption would be 
the common ground where pro-life Americans and people who support
some kind of legalized abortion would be able to come together.
But it doesn't seem like that is what really happens.  Gracie,
what is your experience?
<p>
MS. HSU:  Well, what is interesting is that public opinion polls 
overwhelmingly say that people are in favor of adoption. If you are 
given four options as to an unwed teenager who is pregnant, what should 
she do, the number one answer is always adoption.  That gets the most 
votes out of everything else. And the least popular is abortion, and in 
between there is marry the father and to have the baby and raise it 
herself.
<p>
But even though public opinion is high on adoption, what we are
finding is that people don't practice this, and much of the reason
why is because we see a social trend that says illegitimacy is
okay.  We are growing in illegitimacy statistics.  People are
having kids outside of wedlock in their thirties and forties,
even, and it is perfectly normal. People accept this.
<p>
There is also the fact that abortion really changes the entire 
equation; that once you have abortion, most people are concentrated 
on do I want this baby or do I want to abort.  They are not thinking
what is best for this baby.  They are not thinking child-centered.
They are thinking what is best for me in my circumstances.
<p>
And so until we can reach beyond the selfish need, and once they start
to focus on the child, then they do realize that adoption is the
best alternative.  But it takes a while to get there now.
<p>
DR. PIERCE: One of the things that strikes me as interesting about
the challenge that we face in terms of promoting adoption as we
should is that I think even if you put aside the issue of abortion,
which is obviously a key issue, and you just look at it from the
point of view of economic conservatism, there's a lot that needs
to be done, because in town -- and I have been in this city now
for 26 years -- I have heard very seldom what I would call the
economic conservatives, the libertarians, really focusing on adoption,
I think, the way they should.
<p>
I don't think that they understand that if you talk about welfare reform, 
if you talk about independence, if you talk about all of the issues that 
are critical to economic conservatives, that adoption is a real solution 
here. This is a way to take a pregnancy which is untimely and which may 
have tremendous social and economic negatives for a whole variety of
people and turn it on the flip side and make it an economic positive.
<p>
I mean, if you just take the comparison between a lot of state
laws that provide mandated insurance coverage for infertility
treatment -- infertility treatment is basically about a $35,000
procedure for a 25 percent chance of having a healthy baby.  Well,
if you compare that to adoption, adoption is, at most, on average,
a $15,000 cost for a 100 percent chance of having a healthy baby,
and economic conservatives should see that as a great bargain.
<p>
They should also see it as a great bargain in terms of preventing
welfare dependency, of preventing secondary pregnancies, of preventing
divorce because people got married when they were not really wanting
to.
<p>
So I think one of the things that particularly <i>Straight Talk</i>
and the Family Research Council has been great at doing is in
getting out to economic conservatives and giving the message to
them that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It costs less.
<p>
DR. PIERCE: -- leaving the issues of morality aside, economic conservatives 
should really start focusing also on the issues of adoption.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So many broken wheels end up with a broken-down adoption 
system, and I would like us to look a little bit at foster care.  You
know, one of the things that we have seen as an impact -- and
I would like you all to say what you all have seen -- in adoption
is the fact that in foster care, sometimes we are spending years
and years and years of a child's life not severing damaged parental
bonds and allowing that child to go out of the welfare system
and into a stable married home.  We are holding children sort
of in perpetual child jail.
<p>
The Gregory K. situation, for example, when the boy tried to divorce his 
mother, could have been resolved with a severing of a very damaging 
parental relationship early. I don't think that should be taken by any of 
us to think that we don't want to hold families together when possible. 
<p>
But tell me what you're seeing, for example, with foster care, where 
children are there for their entire life, transferred from home to home
with no future.
<p>
MR. CASEY: It's a very tragic situation.  We hear a lot of tragic stories 
of kids being bounced between the birth home and the foster home.
<p>
Foster care costs about $10 billion, the state and federal costs together, 
whereas, as Bill points out, adoption is basically a cost-free solution.
<p>
I think foster care was originally intended as a temporary home for kids 
and oftentimes ends up being semi-permanent; in some cases, permanent.
And it cannot replace an adoptive home where you have loving,
willing parents who will care for the child, and that is the option
we should be pushing.  We need to move away from the long, prolonged
waits and go to a system where kids are given a better chance
and taken out of an abusive home on a more timely basis so they
don't spend so much time in foster care.
<p>
DR. PIERCE: One of the things that reminds me of the foster care issue 
is, indeed, some material that I got from Chris's organization the 
other day. There is a case up in Philadelphia involving Baby Mitch, 
which is a perfect example of what we're talking about.  Here we're
talking about a newborn baby which was abandoned.  Usually that
baby would end up going into the public foster care system, rattle
around the system, and be lucky if, in a year or two, that child
ended up being placed for adoption.
<p>
Well, they did something really radical, and they turned the baby 
over to the private charitable sector, and they said, &quot;Find a 
home for this child.&quot; And that is one of the things that we think 
would make real good sense, and in fact one of the things that we 
have been trying to push on the federal level is something called the 
Abandoned Babies Act, which was introduced by Representative Fawell from
Illinois, and what he is basically saying is, &quot;Look, we're
not trying to take anybody's rights away, but we ought to jump-start
the system so that if a baby is abandoned, you get that kid through
the system in a hurry and you get that kid into a permanent home.&quot;
<p>
Quite frankly, I think that the way to do that is to do what they
did in Philadelphia and what they have done before in some states,
and that is to basically say, &quot;Look, we're going to take
the issues that have to be done by the state -- the police powers,
like protective services -- and we're going to leave that in the
hands of the public welfare department.  But the other things
that can be contracted out, that can be given to the private voluntary
sector, we're going to give them those things to do.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are getting a lot of calls at Family Research Council
every day, people who are interested in adoption, and I've got
a list myself of people who want more information.
<p>
Chris, you are getting ready to have a conference.
<p>
MR. CASEY: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We have very little time left.  Where can they call and 
what will they hear at your conference?
<p>
MR. CASEY: Well, they can call me at the offices, and the number is 
(703) 875-8724, and I will be happy to send them materials on the 
conference.
<p>
Dr. Pierce is helping us with the conference, and there are others, 
national adoption leaders, that we're going to convene.  We will have 
a seminar on May 9 here in Washington where we will bring together
experts to talk about the problems, and then in the fall we're
going to have a full-day conference in early October to expand
upon it and to talk about solutions.
<p>
I think one of the things that we would like to see is, if this 
government, the national government, can talk about putting 100,000 
cops on the street in high-crime areas, we think it's time that we 
worked towards the goal of 100,000 adoptions each year for the next 
five years. That would go a long way, we think, towards rebuilding the 
family in this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is very exciting, and I would like to thank my 
guests.  Call Family Research Council for more information.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we introduce
you to an attorney who facilitates adoption and a couple whose
unique experience in adopting a child you won't want to miss.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome Barbara Jones, 
an adoption attorney who has facilitated many successful
adoptions, and Benny Phillips, pastor of Fairfax Covenant Church,
and his wife, Sheree.
<p>
The Phillipses have six biological children, which is amazing in 
itself, but they are here to share the story about their youngest 
daughter, number seven, Julia.
<p>
Thank you for being with us today.  Thanks so much.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: Glad to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  This is so exciting.  We were talking about some of 
the legalities of adoption in the first segment, and it is very, 
very difficult.  But yours is a story that so many people call us 
about wishing they could adopt, and we get many, many calls.
<p>
Now, I am going to hold up a photo of your family. I think some 
people are going to have a hard time understanding
why, with this lovely family, you all had the yearning to adopt
and your passion for adoption.  Tell us why.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: Well, about, I guess, 10 years ago, 10 or 11 years ago, 
God just dropped something in my heart that some day we would be 
adopting, and at that point we had only two children, I think.  Time 
passed; we continued to have children, as you see, and as we got more
involved in the pro-life issues and talked to various people,
their experiences of how you can serve and help as far as the
pro-life movement is concerned, one of the ways we felt like God
would have us get involved is through possibly a crisis pregnancy,
and that is how this all developed, was through a crisis pregnancy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sheree, do you remember that day?
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS: The day that she came?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The day you got your child.
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  As a matter of fact, we were contacted by
a mutual friend about a very young teenage girl who had scheduled
an abortion but had consented to talk to a couple, particularly
a pastor, about her decision, and we had the privilege of going
to meet her, along with her mother, to speak with her, to encourage
her, to express love to her and concern for her, and we were delighted
when, just a few days later, she called and had canceled the abortion
and asked us to consider taking her baby.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's fantastic. And, Barbara, you helped facilitate that, 
I understand.
<p>
MS. JONES:  I had the great privilege of working with this precious
family.  Not only do they have a heart for children, but their
heart was very expandable.
<p>
I think some of the most exciting things that we went through were 
just the relationships that they were experiencing with the birth 
parents.  After they met the birth mother, they had the opportunity 
to go and meet the birth father, speak with him to see if in fact he 
was amenable to this particular family receiving his child.  That 
meant a great deal to him, and it established the rapport and the 
relationship for him to be able to relinquish his child as well and 
know his child would be in good hands.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What are you finding as you have been handling adoptions? 
So many people are deterred and intimidated by the legal barriers, 
really, to adoption.  What are you finding in your practice to be 
true about the legal barriers to adoption?
<p>
MS. JONES:  Well, much of it is myth.  With some of the media
cases -- Baby Jessica, Baby Richard -- there is a tremendous fear
that is really evident when you speak to adoptive couples.  But
as we educate them and point out in some of these cases there
were actual legal errors that may not have been proclaimed by
the media and teach them that the relationship can make such a
difference, just in meeting the birth parents.  I think education
is really a key.
<p>
Also, there are the statistics.  There is such discouragement that 
there are not babies to adopt, which in fact, there are babies to 
adopt, and it is showing families how to meet birth parents, to link 
up with them for adoption.
<p>
I think another concern is cost.  It is very costly, and as a result 
of educating, and people like Benny and Sheree, pastors, doing it in 
their church, many churches have established funds to help the families 
with some of the costs to defray them, and also to be able to point
out other areas, if there are grants available, to direct families,
even to teach them such things as they can take loans against
life insurance policies, home equity loans; also, churches many
times just take an offering for the family.  So to encourage them
that if they really have a heart for it, there is a way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What were you surprised about?  As you began to have a 
passion for adoption as a solution to abortion, what surprised you as
you were learning?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think probably the thing that surprised us 
the most was how quickly you emotionally get involved in the process 
and how, as we began the process of adoption, particularly a 
trans-racial adoption, just how your heart -- talk about expandable 
heart -- just how your heart grows and expands for this whole issue, 
and you get to a place where you really want to be able to provide not 
only these children with homes and environments but to be able to serve 
people who are in crisis situations, that this is a viable option, and 
the church can do something about it, and to instruct even people
in our churches that, hey, here's an opportunity for us to carry
out the mission, to broaden our evangelism, and to really make
a difference in people's lives.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of people are afraid to adopt.  Were you all 
afraid to adopt?  Were you afraid about being a media case where someone 
was going to come back and say, &quot;I changed my mind&quot;?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  I think for about 15 minutes, and after Barbara talked 
to us and we asked that question and she was able to educate us as to 
what is really going on, it dissipated, and from that point on we didn't
carry any concern whatsoever.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Tell me, Sheree, about the first moment that you saw 
the baby.  What was that like?
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS:  Well, it was a moment I'll never forget, because, to
be quite honest with you, I had some concerns about adoption.
Having had six biological children, having been told that we
would never have children, I received each of these children so
eagerly.  I was a little concerned, to be candid, that I would
have the affection and the love and the bonding that I experienced
with my biological children with an adopted child.
<p>
But because we were able to share the labor experience with our birth 
mom, we were able to be in an adjacent room and receive our little
baby girl, we heard her first cries and she was presented to us
still wrapped in her little newborn blanket, when the nurse walked
in and handed her to me, I can honestly say that in that moment
I knew this is my little daughter.  And the moments we had there,
an hour or so that we had with her, holding her, talking with
her, experiencing -- her maternal grandmother was there, and we
got to share that time with her -- was a precious moment.
<p>
For any adoptive mom that I speak with who has, understandably, 
similar concerns, I can say that the love that we have, the bond that
we share with our daughter Julia, is no different than that that
we have with our biological children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you find that as you -- you get to see this miracle 
regularly.
<p>
MS. JONES: I do.  One of the most fun questions is always to -- when 
I am working with folks that do have biological children or a biological
child and they are seeking to adopt or going through the process,
is to say to them afterwards, &quot;Please, tell me what it's
really like, because you've had the privilege of being a biological
parent and an adoptive parent.&quot;
<p>
Benny and Sheree were the two that did it best and in a most lasting 
way, in my memory. They said, &quot;Well, it's different but it's the 
same, but you love them just the same,&quot; and then the tears came, 
and they just can't put it in words, but what that showed me is that
there is truly a grafting into the heart, and they understand
more than us -- we were not adopted -- what it really is like
for the Lord to adopt children, that He loves us unconditionally,
and that always is the case.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Very much so.
<p>
You get to see a lot of people long term. What do you find? People 
adopt once; they want to come back and adopt more children. You hear 
some people saying, &quot;Well, sure, it's great maybe at that 
moment, but what about later?  Does the shine wear off?&quot;
What are you finding as that has been your focus?
<p>
MS. JONES: The shine doesn't wear off.  For some families, they are 
satisfied when there are two siblings because there is a brother or 
a sister in the family, and often through agencies that is the limit.
In the past it has been maybe two children per family.  So sometimes
they are content with that.
<p>
Then you meet the family like the family that is down in Florida, the 
owner of the Orlando Magic team who has many children.  Occasionally I 
work with couples where there is no limit, and they come back for more 
and more and more. There is no limit to their love and their household.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is very, very exciting, and we want to actually
let people meet Julia.  If you want to come on and bring her in,
and this is your oldest daughter, I understand?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We would like to have you --
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: This is Jamie.  She is not our oldest, she is our oldest 
girl.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Oh, your oldest girl.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  We have a son 18 -- come here, sweetie.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Great.  Come on in to Dad.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  And this is Julia.  Come here.  Look at the camera. 
Everybody wants to see your pretty face.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So what have you found as your family has adjusted to 
this newest child?  What myths about adoption do you laugh at now that 
you look back?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  Oh, wow!  I mean, we do laugh at the
myth that you can't love an adopted child as much as one of your
own, because I can't make a -- there doesn't seem to be anything
distinguishable to me in the way we relate to her and how we feel
about her as I did when she was her age, you know.  And the children
-- I mean, to watch these children relate to her and how they
have taken her -- as a matter of fact, the problem is her kind
of ruling things.  And so that whole thing of, you know, it's
different -- do you love, do you bond -- I find that that may
be difficult at first for some to get through that moment, but
you do get through it.  You really do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's very exciting.  Thank you for sharing your story.
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS: Thank you so much.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll hear
about the other side of adoption as we meet a young woman who
went through two different experiences in placing two children
for adoption.  Stay tuned for more after this break.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.  I would like to welcome back Barbara
Jones, an adoption attorney, and a good friend of Barbara's, Nicki
Scolaro, who has a unique and touching story to share about the
circumstances of placing two children for adoption.
<p>
Thank you very much, Barbara, for being back, and Nicki, for coming 
today. You placed two children for adoption, two different kinds of
adoption, closed and open, but tell us a little bit about why
that was a decision you made and how you came to make it.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: Well, the first time I became pregnant, it was a situation
where abortion was not even a thought to me.  I just was raised
in a background and the family environment in which we just didn't
believe in abortion.  So I knew from the moment I found out I
was pregnant I was going to go with adoption.
<p>
With the first experience, I ended up going away to a maternity home. 
It was a very sheltered environment.  Counseling was provided.  But it 
was different in that only half of the girls actually placed their 
children for adoption, so it wasn't that that was what everybody did. 
But I knew what I was going to do from the moment I found out I was
pregnant, and it was a closed adoption.
<p>
It was just a situation where I described the type of family in which 
I would like my child to grow up, and they named some prospective 
clients only in a description of them.  I didn't meet anybody.  I 
don't know any names.  It was very closed, and after I had Lauren, my 
first child, I left the hospital 18 hours later and I had an hour to
say goodbye to everybody I had lived with for four or five months
and leave.
<p>
I had no contact for the first couple of weeks after
I returned home with the agency, and it was just all very standoffish
after that, and in that respect it was just not a positive experience
for me, just because so much was left to the imagination, and
there was just not a lot of comfort there, because I wasn't given
any information about --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Did you have a lot of fear about where your child was 
or --
<p>
MS. SCOLARO:  Yes.  I didn't know anything about the family.  My main 
concerns with that situation are, if something were to happen, would 
anybody ever tell me? How do they feel about me?  Situations like that 
where it's just, you know, when you are left with your imagination, you 
can imagine some pretty terrible things.  And when I came home, it was 
just a very awkward situation for my family.  It was a hard thing to
handle, and I ended up getting in a bad relationship and getting
pregnant again.
<p>
Actually, I was planning on keeping my second
daughter, simply because the adoption experience was not a positive
one, and I just didn't think it was possible to do it again. 
So, about six months into my pregnancy, I realized I was no more
equipped at that time to be a mother than I had been before, and
I still wanted to finish college and do things with my life, and
I just didn't see anything positive coming out of trying to raise
a baby on my own.
<p>
So that's when I decided to adopt again, or place for adoption again, 
and I knew there had to be a better way to do it, and it just so 
happens that I was living with a family who took me in as an unwed 
mother, and his doctor's nurse wanted to adopt. So I just called her 
and was like, &quot;I'm pregnant; do you want to talk?&quot;  I mean, 
it was a very awkward situation.  It just seemed so unnatural, like, 
&quot;Hi, do you want my baby?&quot;
<p>
So we actually ended up meeting, and just by luck we just fell in 
love with each other.  She and her husband are just wonderful people, 
and they had adopted before, and it just worked out so perfectly. I 
mean, it just doesn't seem like anything at all went wrong. I became 
very close with them, and they were actually in the room when Katherine 
was born. In fact, I was spending the night at their house and I went 
into labor, so they took me to the hospital.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A very much better experience.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO:  Yes, totally the opposite extreme from Lauren's situation. 
And the comfort that I feel from knowing them so personally and seeing 
her house.  I know her dog and her older sister.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: I mean, there is just nothing left to my imagination. I 
don't have to wonder about anything, as well as for them, any questions 
she may one day have, they will be able to answer.  So it is a very 
positive experience.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think in the first -- there is a lot of discussion 
about how -- although a lot of women think adoption might be something 
they would like, that there really is a lot of need for counseling to 
deal with the emotions connected.
<p>
From your experience, would that have helped even the first time,
to have had someone there?
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: Oh, definitely, definitely. When I came home from having 
had Lauren, I was in this emotional wilderness, and they pretty much 
didn't tell me what it was going to be like as far as -- you know, all 
they talked about was, &quot;Oh, you get to start school in a couple 
of months,&quot; and they talked about me as far as what I would do for 
the rest of my life, but not in relation to the loss I felt with -- I 
mean, there is a hole there.  You get -- all these maternal instincts 
come, and there is nothing there to take care of, and it's a hard 
thing to deal with, and I think, had I had counseling at that time,
I more than likely would not have gotten pregnant again.
<p>
But I ended up, once I did get pregnant again, I realized I had to 
have some help, and I was in counseling for a while, and it totally
changed my life.  I mean, I really needed that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And now you're going to graduate from college soon and are 
looking toward law school and to a lot of other choices.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: Yes.  I am actually considering becoming an adoption 
attorney, because there is so much that I think needs to be changed. 
As we were saying before, there are so many myths about adoption
that people just have this horrific picture of it, and it really
does not have to be that way if you do it right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, Barbara, you are involved in these situations. What 
are you finding as you are dealing with young women making very hard
choices?  What do you find that you need to tell them?
<p>
MS. JONES: You mentioned the counseling. First of all, when I meet 
with a birth mom, generally, they have already matched with a 
prospective adoptive parent, or it might be a situation where they come 
from a crisis pregnancy center, and I will just give them free legal
counsel so they can factor that into the decision-making process,
whether they would actually be able to walk through it, and many
times that assists them in coming to that decision.
<p>
I think counseling is critical.  I have worked with birth moms who have 
been in total denial, told me that they never felt the baby kick, that 
when they went to the hospital, they were expecting maybe their period
was coming. There was such incredible denial, but then here's
the reality of a baby.
<p>
My favorite counselor with birth moms is in fact a trained social worker, 
but she is also a birth mother that placed a child six years ago, and 
she is so effective because she knows the issues of their heart. And 
when a birth mom can be -- if you can walk her through her grieving and 
all the things that she is going to be experiencing, it helps her to do 
the hard thing that she is doing and it gets her over that just really
difficult period and brings her to wholeness and healing again,
gives her hope.
<p>
So counseling is critical.  I think education is critical. Even in the 
legal relationship, working with birth parents, it is far more than just 
the law part, because in many ways you are a friend and you are walking 
them through those different stages.  You come to care very much for 
them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The grieving is something, I think, that people don't talk 
a lot about, even when you are making a decision that it is something 
that you're letting go.  How long did it take you to sort of grieve
and get over that?
<p>
MS. SCOLARO:  Actually, I can't say that it is something that ever 
really ends.  There comes a point where definitely you don't cry every 
day. It's a loss you have to deal with constantly.  I think, at least 
for me, I can say that it is just something -- I had to accept that this 
was just part of who I am now and part of my life, and you have to move 
beyond the shock of, oh, my gosh, this actually happened to me, or that
I actually did this, and you have to try to look at it as a positive
experience.  I mean, my life is much better, her life is much
better, this family is happier, and you have to just focus on
the positive.
<p>
But there are still moments when I think it is almost surreal, like 
I can't believe I did that, not in a bad way, but just it seems 
unbelievable.  But I think there is always going to be something, like 
it's very hard for me to imagine, when I do get married and have 
children, being happy about being pregnant or something like that. 
There is always going to be something there that I am going to 
associate with having children that will never leave me. It is like 
I will never forget that they exist. They will always be my first two 
children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure, absolutely. What are you finding -- you know, Nicki 
is thinking of, saying now the way to deal with it is to be positive. 
When you are talking to a birth mother, is it helpful to say, &quot;Let's
think of the positives&quot;?  What is helpful?  What have you
found to be helpful when you are there?  Because it is easier
for Nicki now to say, &quot;This is how I deal with it.&quot;
What is helpful when you are there talking with someone who is
considering adoption?
<p>
MS. JONES:  First of all, to let her know that it is her decision and 
no one is going -- we are not going to pressure her. It is also very 
important, I think, to esteem a birth mother, to tell her she is a woman 
of honor, and she is a woman of integrity, to hold her head high, because 
she is bringing life three ways:  to this infant, to her own body, not 
experiencing the ravages of abortion, and she may choose to give the gift 
of life to a family that is waiting.  So I think that is very important.
<p>
Also, the other thing that seems to just really stand out is the
relationship that birth parents establish with adoptive parents,
and sometimes they will tell you that the sweetest part about
adoption is the relationship with the adoptive parents, and some
will say that we're afraid we're going to miss them more than
we'll miss our baby, because we know in time we'll go our own
ways and separate.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much for being with us, both of you, and I 
really appreciate the stories that you're telling. When we return, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shows you a clip from CBS's <i>48 Hours</i>, 
which brings into light a whole new perspective on parenting
and who has the right to raise children.  Don't go away.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. Coming up, we've got a clip from <i>48 Hours</i> 
which takes a look at homosexual adoption, a very controversial topic.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>

[Clip from CBS <i>48 Hours</i>, February 22, 1996, follows:]
<p>
MALE VOICE:  . . .it really doesn't matter whether they have a father 
there or not.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Men and women are not interchangeable puzzle pieces.
<p>
MODERATOR: It matters to Kristi Hamrick and the Washington-based Family
Research Council, a conservative think tank.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  . . .the issue here is not two women who benignly want to 
set up a home; it is people actively seeking to rewrite the world, to 
rewrite the law, to rewrite child development into their own image.
<p>
MODERATOR: The judge who wrote the New York decision said that when it 
comes to the best interests of a child, stability and two parents at
home is more important than sexual orientation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The judge is wrong, because eventually these children are 
going to want to know, why wasn't there a father there for me, why wasn't
there a mother there for me, why do I feel like something is missing
when everybody tells me that I've got everything I need?  Because
they need both.
<p>
[End of 48 Hours clip.]

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with 
us to hear how you can get more information regarding the issues affecting 
you and your family.

<p>
Next week, we will bring you a look at a phenomenon sweeping our
country.  It's gambling.  Is gambling the pot of gold at the end
of the rainbow that casino owners promise?  We'll hear about it
from some national experts who have studied this issue and have
a lot to say.  So you won't want to miss us next week as we bring

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> invites you to share in a very special annual Family 
Research Council event, the Washington Briefing.

<p>

The 1996 briefing brought together people from across the nation
to hear from some of the [people] most able to provide insight
into America's politics and the challenges facing today's American
family.  The wide range of briefing speakers, from Congressmen
and Senators to journalists, to individuals engaged in pro-family
battles, provides inside-the-beltway knowledge [to] which we as
the public are not often privy.

<p>

So we hope you'll join us tonight as we present highlights of the 
1996 Washington Briefing.

<p>

To begin, though, let's hear from some of the leading freshmen in the 
House of Representatives.  Congresswoman Sue Myrick of North Carolina,
Congressman David McIntosh of Indiana, and Congressman George
Radanovich of California answer some challenging questions asked
by some of the Washington Briefing attendees.  These are questions
that you may have wanted to ask many times and questions that
you hoped reporters would ask but didn't.

<p>

So we've gone beyond the newscasts and ignored some of the true 
insights that they might uncover as <i>Straight Talk</i> brings 
you Behind the Headlines.

[Segment from Washington Briefing follows:]

<p>

QUESTION:  What can we do to get the truth out, and, number two,
why is it that our side of the story isn't being told, except
through underground mechanisms that some of us hear but nobody
else does?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  Some of us who have been up
there all this year have been fighting this battle since the day
we got there in trying the turn around the way the message is
communicated, what we say, what we do, and tell the truth about
what we're doing.  But we haven't been successful in convincing
the powers-to-be to get it done.  We aren't going to get it through
the national media. We have to pay for everything we get.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE RADINOVICH: What we want to leave here is emphasizing 
the fact that we need help in the form of volunteer effort and money in
order to get the message out.  But in addition to that, pray Psalm
37 continuously, because within your sphere of influence, there
is likely to be, I wouldn't say unlimited but an uncharted amount
of time for prayer, and that works.  You sit down and you pray
that prayer about what's going on in this country; you will, on
your knees, turn that election around, and I want to just totally
emphasize that.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

QUESTION: The Speaker was named the Man of the Year, and he 
certainly has had a great deal of energy in the contract, and we 
don't hear much from him anymore.  Does he still have the support 
of the freshman class and the Republicans in Congress, and what 
role is he going to play in this next year?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  Well, he does have support of the class.
I'll just say that.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  Yes, definitely.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  The freshmen are behind him.  There has
been a lot of media that has been trying to divide us and say
that there is a problem within the Republican leadership, and
so forth.  That is not the case.  Newt stepped back to do the
vision thing again, which is the Contract with America idea. 
That's what he is about.  That's what he's best at.  He has turned
leadership duties over to Dick Armey and rest of us who are in
leadership.  We all have liaison responsibilities with particular
bills that are coming on the floor.  That is something that hadn't
happened before.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  You'll see the freshman
class rise up in Newt's defense, and they will continue to try
to attack him, because he has verbalized and stood for the things
we believe in.  He, as Sue mentioned, is very consciously at this
point preparing for the next fall's election, and he realized
that during the Presidential primary it would be difficult for
us to have a lot of leadership coming out of the House of Representatives,
because people would be focused on choosing a nominee for the
party.  But if we laid the groundwork now, we could go forward
once the nominee is chosen or becomes apparent and work towards
this renewed agenda.

<p>

He came back and briefed all of us a few weeks ago after the break 
that this was his plan and how he was doing it, and we all went up to 
him and said, &quot;Let us help in any way possible, because we want 
to support exactly what you're doing there.&quot;

<p>

QUESTION:  This question may sound cynical, but I ask it in all 
sincerity.  You're only freshmen for one session, and this freshman 
class is so great.  How long will it be before your freshman class 
falls into lock-step with the old guard in Washington, and now we've 
got to count on more freshmen?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  I think we probably all want to touch
on that one, but I will just say that we and those of us sitting
up here who are in freshmen leadership per se work very hard to
make sure that doesn't happen.  We kind of serve as each other's
conscience.  We prod each other.  One of the strengths we have
is that we're all willing to take on different issues, and somebody
will honcho a different issue, which is why we've been able to
do a lot, and that's very good.

<p>

But when we got here, we decided [that] together we were a force and 
we had some power, and if we weren't together, we were nothing; 
individually, we can do nothing. So we work very hard to keep us 
together, even when we are not freshmen.  Those of us who come back 
will do the same thing, and we will, hopefully, be able to work with 
the new freshmen coming in to make sure they do the same thing.

<p>

It is very important to us that we keep that mind-set.  We try to 
remind ourselves who we are, where we came from, and why we're here all 
the time.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE RADINOVICH:  I think most of the freshmen that
have come in really were remarkable in one thing, and that was
that, as Sue said, they let you know who they were, how they thought,
and what they intended to do.  We did that formally through the
signing of the Contract with America, which was on September 27,
1994, and the election was after that, on November 8, 1994.

<p>

So that is something -- if anything else represents the change
that we bring or the beach head that we have established inside
the beltway, or however you want to put it, [it] is the fact that
we were clearly about who we were so that the voters across this
country who are smart, not dumb, knew exactly what they were getting
when they went to the polls, instead of trying to paint yourself
into something and then coming here and doing something else.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
presents more from the Family Research Council's 1996 Washington Briefing.
What can we do to help in the fight for pro-family issues?  Former
Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey, a leading Democrat, shares
his ideas after this break. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. Former Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey began our
1996 Washington Briefing, taking on the pro-life debate from a
unique perspective.  Let's hear what Governor Casey has to say
as we share with you FRC's 1996 Washington Briefing.

<p>

GOVERNOR CASEY: When I was governor of Pennsylvania, and I finished 
my service there in January of 1995, I saw first hand the root cause
of most of the social dislocation in our country, and that, of
course, as you well know and as this organization has championed,
the dislocation flows from the disintegration of the American
family.  Unless we try to reconstitute, as all of you know so
well, try to reconstitute that institution called the American
family, America will continue in a downward spiral.

<p>

Now, that is not being apocalyptic; I think that is being quite accurate
in terms of where we are in America today.  And I would say, if
one thing has become crystal clear in 1996 in the debate thus
far in the Presidential sweepstakes in America, it is, from where
I sit at least, not just the economy; it is also the culture.
And those candidates out there with a single-track message, who
talk only about the economy, don't seem to last too long.  It's
not that people are not interested.  Of course, we're interested,
and people want to know where America is going and where the candidates
out there today propose to lead us.

<p>

I would like to suggest two directions today, not exclusive by any 
means but important.  Number one, I think we've got to make adoption a 
number one national priority in the United States of America.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And I want to tell you why.  I ran a major state, no different from 
New York, California, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, you name it.  Thousands
of kids trapped in the foster care system; cost $10 billion, with
a B, $10 billion a year.  And all of the federal incentives, the
reimbursement systems, are in the direction of keeping those kids
in foster care, and they stay there too long, and when they leave,
they wind up too often either in the penitentiary or in the cemetery.

<p>

And why can't both parties stand up say, We disagree on a lot
of things, but there's one thing we can agree on, and that is
the most cost-effective, compassionate, effective alternative
for children in America today who find themselves trapped in foster
care is to make it easier for the adoption process to work, on
both the public side and the private side, so that the disincentives
in our federal reimbursement system are reversed in favor of urging
and giving incentives to states to take children out of foster
care and put them into adoptive homes where they will have a real
chance to be decent and law-abiding and happy and productive citizens.
Aggressive advocacy of adoption, I think, begins the process
of reconstituting the American family.

<p>

In my state of Pennsylvania in 1987, we joined with a group called One 
Church/One Child run by the Black Ministerium.  It began in Chicago and 
came to Pennsylvania. We teamed up with them at the state level, and 
over the next seven years, we placed 800 children, African-American 
children, in adoptive homes.  We began a new statewide initiative to 
press for adoption, to make it a top priority. We can do it and have to 
do it, it seems to me, at the national level.

<p>

Let me move now to a second proposal, and that is one with which 
you are very familiar:  Is America going to provide legal protection 
for the child or not? And how long do we have to wait?  We've waited 23 
years.  Another 25 years?  When is this debate engaged?  If not now, 
when, and if not you, us, well, then who?

<p>

Let me tell you what I am talking about.  We have an ideal opportunity 
right now, at a time of great spiritual and cultural renewal in this 
country, symbolized, I would submit to you, by the tremendous impact 
this organization and Gary Bauer and all of you have had in shaping 
public opinion in America.  I would commend to your reading this article 
here that I've brought with me today in the <i>Women's Quarterly</i>. 
It is written by a feminist, or at least a pro-choice person, whose
name is Candace C. Crandall.  It just came out.

<p>

She explains in this article why the pro-choice movement is suddenly 
playing defense. The title is -- you'll excuse me -- but &quot;The Fetus 
Beat Us.&quot; You see, we're winning this battle.  We're really winning
this battle.  It seems that too few of our own people realize
that we're winning this battle.

<p>

Look at some of the signs. The First Lady tells us abortion is wrong. 
<i>Newsweek</i> magazine. Kate Michaelman said that abortion is a 
&quot;bad thing,&quot; her words.  Henry Foster says that the 
abortion is a &quot;failure,&quot; his word, which he abhors. And 
Susan Estrich(?), who ran Mr. Dukakis' campaign, said, &quot;We're 
winning in the courts&quot; -- that is, the pro-choice side -- 
&quot;but losing in the streets.&quot;

<p>

Now, all of these signs and trends have made their demands on
the political system, and so in 1994, the Republican resurgence
in the Congress -- you've heard Mr. Steeper's(?) analysis of the
1994 returns when the number of people who voted for the Republican
Party in the congressional elections zoomed, catapulted, exploded,
from 27 million in 1990 to 36 million in 1994.

<p>

The Freedom of Choice Act went down the tubes, never got out of 
committee.  Medical schools aren't teaching young doctors about abortion 
anymore. Over 80 percent of the counties in America don't have abortion
clinics 23 years after <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. In 1994, pro-life 
congressional candidates won, by and large, and pro-choice candidates 
lost, by and large.

<p>

Two conclusions follow, from where I sit, from all
of this.  One, cultural issues are central to the emergence of
the Republican Party in the Congress of the United States, just
as they are, in my judgment, to the demise -- some would say the
disintegration -- of the Democratic Party at the national level.

<p>

The <i>New York Times</i> had a front-page story about two months ago
talking about the Democrats and the defections across the United
States at all levels, not just retirements in the Senate and the
Congress; in state legislatures, in local government all across
America.  I think this concern I am talking about here today is
what fundamentally drives that demise, because how can the party
which came into being and which prided itself on leaving no one
out and no one behind, prided itself on the protection of the
powerless, how can it write off -- since when did America write
off -- an entire class of people, especially the most vulnerable
of all, and say, &quot;There's nothing we can do.  The children
must die&quot;?

<p>

That's not America.  That's not who we are. That's not our American 
experience.  We've never accepted that before, except in one case in 
the 1860s when the Supreme Court said that African-Americans are 
non-persons; they have no rights. That mistake was corrected. The 
mistake of <i>Roe v. Wade</i> remains to be corrected. But it will 
be corrected, and it will be corrected, in my judgment, in our 
lifetime if we make this case and make it consistently and make it 
with passion and make it, if you'll excuse me, with a sense of outrage 
and say to the people of this country, &quot;What are they doing to 
America, when we have lost 30 million?&quot;

<p>

And what do we have to show for it? Are women more liberated or more 
free?  I ask you, when is a woman more free, when she is giving life 
or when she is taking it? And is America's true character to be found 
in an abortion clinic or in an adoptive home?  What is consistent 
with the essential goodness and decency of the American people?

<p>

I think our people understand that, and if we present it to them 
as a natural outgrowth of the American experience, of expanding the 
circle of the commonly protected and making the Declaration of 
Independence not just words on a page but words to live by, we're 
going to prevail, because I firmly believe that abortion is destined 
for the scrap heap of history. I believe that we've got to continue 
to speak for the child. And if we do, I believe this country will 
realize the potential that Jefferson had in mind when he said that 
these rights, the most important of which is the right to life, 
these rights come not from the state, not from the Congress, not 
from the Supreme Court, not from the state legislature, but from 
the hand of God.

<p>

That's the challenge that I leave with all of us here today.
Thank you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Please join us after the commercial break as we 
continue our 1996 Washington Briefing highlights with Rabbi 
Daniel Lapin.  You won't want to miss it.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.  Rabbi Daniel Lapin is a strong advocate
of the preservation of America's families through Judeo-Christian-based
conservative values.  Rabbi Lapin has influenced many with his
commentaries on the socioeconomic trends that have shaped this
country.  Let's hear what he had to say to FRC's Washington Briefing
attendees.

<p>

RABBI LAPIN: There are two different views of America
today.  There is the view held by the Boy Scouts of America, by
Family Research Council, and by so many other Americans, actually
a majority of Americans, who still remember that it is duty, it
is faith, it is intellect.  It's doing what we know to be right,
not what we feel like doing.  And feelings, while very important,
come second.

<p>

Let us take a look for a moment at two organs that
the good Lord has provided us with.  He has provided us with eyes
and ears.  Let's ask ourselves for a moment which of those two,
eyes and ears, is the avenue to the emotions and which one is
the avenue to the mind and the intellect.  Think for a moment.

<p>

Gentlemen -- this is a quiz just for the gentlemen -- have you
or any other male whom you know, at the present or at any time
in the past, ever become involved with a woman in an utterly unsuitable
relationship that was destructive, painful, and going absolutely
nowhere?

<p>

[Laughter.]

You do not have to raise your hands for this one.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I will take the answer as a yes from virtually all of us. When that 
happened to this man we all know, when this happened, was it because 
of the way the woman looked, or was it because of the way the woman 
spoke over the phone? Eyes and ears stand clearly for an emotional 
dominance versus an intellectual or obligation/faith/duty-driven view 
of the world.

<p>

While America was driven by words and by the ear, we were a nation 
that was capable of weighing things out, looking at the long term, 
being careful about things.  But as soon as we turned into a nation
that gets most of its information through the eyes, look what
happens.  Everything changes, and we are now -- every single debate
today is framed in emotional terms, everything.

<p>

What about the children?  Hillary Clinton made an entire industry, with 
her friends, out of the children, because that is a wonderfully 
emotional picture, and nobody stops to think that children shouldn't be 
Hillary Clinton's problem; it should be their parents' problem.  And if 
she wants to help children, she should help the parents, not the children.
We don't need a direct line from the government to our children.
We want that line to go through us.

<p>

We don't need schools where teachers are told, &quot;Be certain that 
your children are encouraged not to tell their parents about this 
part of the program.&quot; That is what children are taught in 
public school today:  &quot;Don't tell your parents about this. 
They won't understand.&quot;  We don't need that. But in an 
emotionally driven society, it is very difficult to deal with that.

<p>

Now, emotional is short term. It's now.  I've got to do something 
about it.  There's somebody starving. There's somebody hungry. 
There's somebody out there who needs help.  And there is no cause to 
ask oneself, what is the long-term impact?  And this is why it is that 
otherwise well-intentioned people, intelligent people, even 
intellectual people, would go for the welfare system as it is, 
because it is only reasonable if you bring up onto my screen a 
wretched, miserable, suffering human being. Ladies and gentlemen, 
is there anybody in this room who wouldn't feel driven by compassion? 

<p>

But don't do that to me.  I resent it.  You are robbing me of an 
opportunity to weigh it up intellectually. I don't want the picture of 
the starving person in front of me while I weigh this up.  I want to be 
able to think clearly for a few minutes and evaluate what is the most
effective way to help this problem long term.  But as long as
you are wrenching at my emotions, I can't do anything about this.

<p>

And that's why it is, in the book of Numbers, chapter 15, &quot;And
you should not stray after your hearts and after your eyes.&quot;
Heart, if you think about it, heart is a metaphor for the emotions.
Don't stray, says Numbers chapter 15, don't stray after your
heart and don't stray after your eyes.  You must have a heart,
and you must enjoy your eyes, but that's not a way to make decisions.

<p>

And that is what is happening.  The Peter Jenningses and the Dan
Rathers of the world are emotionally driven; they are visually
driven.  And the consequence is [that it is] very difficult to
maintain stable structures in society, because emotions are short
term; intellect and duty are long term.

<p>

This is why it is that Washington, D.C., is absolutely filled with the 
most wonderful single women, who truly desire to be married and to 
raise families, and it is tough to find guys that are man enough for the 
job, because we have been turned into an emotionally driven society,
not an intellectually driven one, and emotional is short term.
Short term, there are no benefits in marriage, particularly with
the wonders of the sex revolution that says that premarital sex
is just fine.

<p>

You have now eliminated the last possible, conceivable
-- well, that is perhaps not a good choice of word -- the last
possible reason why any man driven by short-term emotionalism
should ever contemplate marriage.  It's not possible.  Only with
the long-term view is that possible.

<p>

Now, what is the counter? If, indeed, we have become a society driven 
by the eye, driven by emotionalism, driven by the short term, that that 
is the final argument -- listen to our politicians sometimes; listen 
to public speakers.  You provide an emotional reason, and that's it. 
Everybody's satisfied.  That's the end of it.  It's non-refutable. You 
can't do anything about it.

<p>

This very hotel is running a campaign to add onto your bill for 
UNICEF, and there are pictures of children in need. It's tough. But 
you know something?  I'm not going to do it, because I am not 
convinced that the United Nations best knows how to make sure that 
that money goes into the tummy of a starving child instead of into 
that of a bloated bureaucrat.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And so there needs to be a restoration of the intellectual
faith aspect of life.  We've got to rebuild that, and I have two
very specific recommendations for you, two very specific recommendations,
recommendations that you can carry out with you to your families,
to your friends, to your neighborhoods, and above all convey these
ideas, if you would.  Tell them your rabbi sent you.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Convey these ideas as a proud religious conservative.  Let's come
out of the closet.  It seems everyone else has.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

There's nothing wrong with saying, &quot;I am a religious conservative,
and it is my religious belief that fuels my ideas,&quot; because
politics, ladies and gentlemen, is wonderful.  Politics is what
enables us to live with one another in spite of differences without
resorting to guns and fists.  We can talk our differences through.
And politics is nothing but applied values, and we must be proud
to say where our values come from, because there is no other way
to combat the drive of the heart which we should not follow, the
drive of the eyes which we should not follow.

<p>

And so my specific two recommendations are:  number one, reduce your 
TV watching by at least half an hour a day.  Now, just to give you the 
figures here, ladies and gentlemen, I have done this calculation over
and over and over again.  I can't believe it myself, but believe
me, it is true.  If you methodically cut out half an hour a day
of television watching, which I am sure every one of us can do,
you gain, over the next decade, six months of productive time.
Six months. Do you know what you and I could do with six months
of productive waking time?  That is the time that half an hour
a day of television will buy you.

<p>

But it buys you something much more urgent than that, and that 
is a reduction in your visual input, and it gives you an opportunity 
to get a little bit more verbal input, which is more balanced. How 
do you do that?  Practice conversation. Encourage people -- do you 
know that there are Americans that have the television on during 
family dinner? Don't do it. It's terrible.

<p>

Those are my two suggestions:  half an hour less television a day 
and only conversation when the family is together. It's going to 
be very tough, because a society that has overwhelmed itself with 
emotionalism and with imagery and with eye-driven content is going 
to find it very difficult to converse. Have you noticed that? People 
are awkward when there's nothing on and we are reduced to nothing 
but conversation.  We have lost the art, and it can come back.

<p>

And, fortunately, we have such a ready source of material to bring 
it back, and that's the Bible. There is something to talk about. 
There is something to talk about, and there is a way of latching 
onto any aspect of events of the day and using the time to analyze them 
from an intellectual point of view with no pictures.  Expose your children
to that.  Encourage other people to do the same.  It's a wonderfully
exciting experience.  But apart from the pleasure it brings, it
reduces the visual input, which makes the participants that much
less an emotional crowd.

<p>

And, ladies and gentlemen, I believe, as these crashing waves of 
cultural chaos threaten to engulf the very civilization that has bred 
us, it is only going to be a traditional Judeo-Christian vision of 
society, made possible by all of you here today, that is going to 
restore the health of our great country. And it will. It will because 
we are at the very beginning of America's third great religious 
reawakening.

<p>

The first one, in the early 18th century, brought about American 
independence. The second one, in the 1800s, laid the groundwork for 
the abolition of slavery.  And the third one, ladies and gentlemen, 
that we are right in the middle of right now is the one that is going
to restore the moral, cultural, and economic health of our blessed
land.  Tell them your rabbi said so.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will share more 
of the 1996 Washington Briefing as we hear from Oklahoma Senator Don 
Nickles.  He shares some exciting changes he hopes to accomplish in 
the upcoming months. Please join us after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. The 1996 Washington Briefing allowed us to hear 
from those in government who are ardently fighting for America's 
families.

<p>

Senator Don Nickles is a real leader.  We now share with you 
his perspectives on current issues pending on the Senate floor and
how those issues affect you and your family.

<p>

SENATOR NICKLES: I want to talk to you about a whole bunch of issues 
that are kind of pending, and I will go kind of fast and talk about 
those and encourage your involvement and encourage your input, because
a lot of these are very important to families, one of which, I
am just going to say, is one of our biggest items.

<p>

Many of us believe very strongly in balancing the budget, and we believe
we should not spend more than we take, and you say, &quot;Why?&quot;
Well, that is economic policy and that is prudent and that is
fiscal.  I will tell you, I think it is vitally important for
our kids.  I don't think it is morally responsible to be leaving
our children with decades and billions and now trillions of dollars
of unfunded debt that we have put on their shoulders.  So I think
it is high time -- well past time, frankly -- for us to balance
the budget and quit laying more additional debt on our children.
That is what the fight is for.  It is, are we going to morally
responsible?

<p>

We live in the greatest and the freest county in the history of 
mankind. That is a real blessing. God has blessed us. But we see a 
lot of challenges and in some cases some actions
that are taken either by President Clinton or maybe by Congress
that infringe on our freedom.  Maybe it is excessive debt.  Maybe
it is policies that are coming down from the administration that
really infringe on what I would call a family-friendly environment.
And when we see that, I think we have a real obligation to stand
up and say, &quot;Wait a minute.  That's wrong.&quot;

<p>

You know, it is not just fiscal issues.  I will just give you an 
example: welfare. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed two welfare
reform bills.  He campaigned that we need to end welfare as we
know it, and he always got applause.  I was one that was applauding.
We need to.  We have 334 federally defined welfare programs,
means-tested welfare programs:  if you meet this criteria, you
get the benefit.

<p>

We don't think that makes a lot of sense. A lot of us say, &quot;Wait 
a minute.&quot;  These government welfare programs are well 
intentioned; good intentions.  I don't fault the intentions of the 
authors of the proposals.  But what you have is program stacked on 
program on top of other programs, and the net result is that we have 
created a welfare dependency cycle where people are looking to 
government as their sole source of solutions to problems instead of 
to families, instead of to communities. Instead of developing an 
interest in trying to climb that economic ladder, they say, 
&quot;Give me a handout.&quot;  We have almost created a generational 
welfare dependency cycle.

<p>

We are going to have a debate before too long on minimum wage.  I am 
going to oppose their efforts.  And you say, &quot;Well, why?&quot;
Hey, I used to make minimum wage.  My wife and I have been married
now 27 years; she has still put up with me.  Our first jobs, we
both made minimum wage.  And, frankly, it wasn't enough.  President
Clinton and others say, &quot;Oh, no, we think it should be against
the law for you to have a job unless you pay such-and-such,&quot;
and therefore pricing some jobs out.  Maybe it is that janitor
service, maybe it is pumping gas, maybe it is sacking groceries.

<p>

But that might be that 16-year-old in Chicago that has some
open time during the summer, and so if he can't get a job, what
is he going to do?  And a lot of times people end up in the wrong
environment.  Instead of doing something good and positive, maybe
a job, and saying, &quot;Hey, this job doesn't pay enough, I need
to learn more, I need to get a better education, I need better
training so I can get a better job,&quot; they end up involved
in drugs or in crime, and so on.  And so to me that is an important
issue.

<p>

It is an important issue when we talk about crime. Unfortunately,
I notice President Clinton has got maybe an election year conversion.
He is starting to talk about his war on the drugs.  We just did
two papers talking about Clinton's about-face on the war on drugs.
He is now going to increase funding for the Office of National
Drug Control Policy.  What he didn't tell you [was] that in 1993
he reduced the office from 146 employees to 25.  What he didn't
tell you [was] he cut the office by over 80 percent in 1993; he
totally gutted the office.

<p>

When you talk about family values, it is interesting. You remember 
the Clintonites just ridiculed Vice President Quayle when he started 
talking about family values. Let me tell you something. Dan Quayle 
was right, and welcome aboard the Clintonites and others when you 
start talking about family values.  Family values are important.

<p>

I urge you to get involved.  I urge you to get involved in these 
campaigns, whether for House members or for Senators or for the 
President of the United States.  It is critically important, and it 
is not just so you can elect more Republicans.  I am a partisan 
Republican. I am chairman of the Policy Committee, and so on.

<p>

Find out where people stand on issues.  I will be very comfortable if 
this group will go out and find out where people stand on issues, 
regardless of party.  I will be very comfortable with whoever you support.
You find people that have character, people that believe in family
values, people that really think as you do on a lot of these issues,
whether you are talking about abortion, whether you are talking
about gays in the military, whether you are talking about who
should be surgeon general, who should be appointed to the Supreme
Court.

<p>

These are awfully important issues.  These are issues
of life and death.  These are issues that deal with the future
of our kids and our grandkids, so they can come back and say,
&quot;Yes, we really do thank God for the fact that we live in
the United States of America, because it is still the greatest
and the freest country in the history of mankind.&quot;

<p>

Thank you very much. God bless you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> gives you a look 
at issues being battled by our very own Family Research Council staff. 
Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. The Family Research 
Council staff works diligently to positively shape issues affecting 
today's families, from pro-life issues to cyberporn to gay marriage. 

<p>

FRC briefing attendees wanted to know some specifics on those issues, 
so they asked our staff. Let's hear those questions and answers on 
tonight's Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

STAFF MEMBER: It would seem like to me -- and I guess this is to Bob 
Knight and Bob Maginnis -- that a President that has pushed the 
homosexual issue as strongly as he has, that in itself would be enough 
to defeat a President, and I wonder why we haven't been stronger
on that, to use that against him.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  One problem is you don't see too many opposition 
figures out there in front on this issue, frankly.  It's a hard sell 
for us in Washington to persuade people to take it on, even though it 
is a clear winner with the American people.

<p>

Right now the Republican nominee will have a terrific opportunity 
to delineate the differences between the two parties should he 
choose to do so, and that is by taking up the gay marriage issue. That 
is going to be a monumental issue in this country during this year, 
during this election year.

<p>

You have to ask yourself how many politicians would want to be in
the position of voting against laws that uphold traditional marriage
during an election year.  I mean, this is a gift to anybody who
wants to take it up, and yet we frankly have been meeting opposition.

<p>

We are hoping that will change this year, because the marriage
issue is a winner.  The polls show that 71 percent of the people
in the state of Hawaii are against gay marriage, liberal Hawaii.
Polls show similar figures for the nation as a whole.  And given
that this is after about 10 years of mainstream media propaganda
about homosexuality with almost no answering except the work we
have done and some other groups, once the issue is joined and
the facts are out on the table, I can only imagine that those
figures will rise.

<p>

So the real problem is we need some leadership in the political 
realm to take up the cause that we know all Americans would 
respond to.

<p>

COL. MAGINNIS:  It has only been the Family Research Council -- and 
I can say that without any reservation -- that has really led the 
charge on this issue, that has held the fort.  We have been in the 
courts, and we are the only organization in the courts in this 
country battling the issue of homosexuals in the military.

<p>

One of these cases, probably the <i>Thomasson</i> or the 
<i>Abel</i>(?) case, will go to the Supreme Court this fall, and
we will have a decision this time next year which will tell us
what the Supreme Court thinks about this issue.  What the Supreme
Court tells us about this issue will have just about as much significance
as what they tell us about the Second Amendment out in Colorado.
Probably it is going to have a lot to do with some of what Bob
just outlined in regard to single-gender marriage, because they
cite all these military cases as evidence that there is no problem
with this.

<p>

I will tell you that the people on the Hill -- and
I have talked to a lot of them on this issue -- they run from
it because they are afraid of it.  People in the military -- I
talked to the chief of staff of the Army and to most of the senior
leadership.  They ran from it.  There are only a few people that
are willing to stand up and tell the truth.

<p>

STAFF MEMBER: I just wonder what is being done to get pornography off 
of the Internet.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Just in January, as part of the large Telecommunications
Reform Act of 1996, we had the Communications Decency Act, which
is specifically designed to deal with the accessibility of pornography
on the Internet.  So that was passed, and that was a huge victory
for us.  We worked for a long time on that, with other groups
as well.

<p>

Immediately after President Clinton signed the act, though,
the ACLU filed suit against the Communications Decency Act, saying
it was unconstitutional, and I am traveling to Philadelphia at
the end of this week for the trial in that case.

<p>

The ACLU thinks it is unconstitutional because they think any 
restriction on anything that can remotely be called speech or expression 
is unconstitutional. They are wrong, and they usually lose, and we 
expect that they will lose in this case, too.

<p>

What the CDA does is says that mild pornography, which adults have a 
constitutional right to get -- we don't like that, but that is the state 
of the law -- cannot be given to children, and that is on firm legal 
grounds. So the CDA is well within constitutional precedent, and we 
think it is going to be upheld.

<p>

Does that mean that there will be no pornography on the Internet? 
No, that is not what that means, because pornography laws are broken 
every day.  But the fact is, there will be ground rules, and there 
will be a law that a prosecutor can use to prosecute people who violate 
this new law.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares more of our annual Family Research Council's Washington Briefing. 
The 1996 briefing included nationally known speakers who informed FRC 
constituents about the most current and controversial events.  Key among 
the speakers were leading Senators and Congressmen detailing issues
affecting America's families.

<p>

The FRC Washington Briefing was also a wonderful reminder that the 
pro-family battle is not exclusively fought inside the beltway. Leaders 
from across our nation maintain the standards that ensure family values 
are not lost in today's societies. You will enjoy this exchange of 
national and front-line leaders in this briefing highlight.

<p>

But to begin, let's hear Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum's insight 
into what actually happens on the House and Senate floors.  For you 
C-SPAN junkies, the congressional voting process may seem routine, 
but for many the congressional language sounds foreign.  So Senator 
Rick Santorum provides a clear definition of that language and what 
changes need to be made so that our representatives can efficiently 
and effectively make positive decisions for American citizens.

<p>

To learn more, <i>Straight Talk</i> now takes you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">

<p>

[Segment from 1996 Washington Briefing follows:]

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM:  What makes the Senate slower than
the House?  It is called a filibuster.  I was in the House four
years; I have been in the Senate now a year and two months, although
it seems like I have been in the Senate four years, because we
just spend that much more time on the floor in debate and deliberation.

<p>

In the House, majority rules.  If you have 51 percent of the vote,
you can do anything you want in the House of Representatives,
anything.  You have something called a Rules Committee in the
House, which, every time a bill comes to the floor of the House,
there is a rule that comes with it that limits debate and limits
amendments.  If you want to offer an amendment on the floor of
the House, by and large, you have to get permission from the Rules
Committee to do so.  And if you don't get permission, you can't
offer the amendment.

<p>

So it is very much a majority-ruled and controlled
body.  The Rules Committee has nine Republicans and four Democrats.
So even if we lose one or two of our own, we still win.  So it
is very hard for the leader -- and the leader puts people who
are going to follow the leader on the Rules Committee.  So you
really have absolute control over it.

<p>

In the Senate, every bill that comes up, you can offer an amendment, 
whether it is germane or not germane.  We can be debating 
telecommunications, and we can have an amendment that deals with the 
Bosnian war; just no relevance at all.  And they can continue to offer 
it. Every day they can offer the same amendment.  Every bill that comes 
up, we can deal with the same amendment.  Many times we do deal with
a lot of the same.  Senator Wellstone has one of his favorite
amendments.  He offers it all the time.  We voted on it 10, 12
times.  But that can happen in the Senate.

<p>

Also, we have to have 60 votes to pass a bill.  Now, it only takes 51 
to pass, but to get to the passage, get to the vote on final passage, 
you usually have to break, at least in this Congress, we usually have 
to break a filibuster, which means we need 60 votes.  So we have to 
have 60 votes to get to passage, which really means you need 60 votes
to pass a bill, and you have this unlimited amendment which will
delay things for a long, long, long time.  So that is the problem.

<p>

The solution is actually a very simple solution, and that is get
60 Republican Senators.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
presents more from the Family Research Council's
1996 Washington Briefing, as we hear how we can make a difference
in reforming our current welfare system.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. At the 1996 Washington Briefing, Senator Dan
Coats spoke of hope and vision for truly impacting Americans who
are in need.  Let's hear how we can help transform lives and revive
our communities.

<p>

SENATOR COATS:  Something that has just been a passion of mine and 
something that I have been working on for nearly a decade is an issue 
that addresses not necessarily the political side of the question but 
the moral and spiritual side of the question.

<p>

I am encouraged from the standpoint that America today is talking 
about not only the failure of big government to address our problems 
but beginning to seriously examine the moral and spiritual and 
cultural decline that is taking place in this nation and beginning 
to ask questions about how we can revive the role of the family, 
the role of the church, the role of the spiritual involvement and 
values in terms of education, in terms of who we are as a people.

<p>

We are beginning to read in what normally would be considered liberal 
publications, we are beginning to hear from people who normally would 
be labeled as coming more from the liberal side, that the failure of 
the secular approach, the big government approach, must lead us to an 
examination of whether or not we can identify other successful 
approaches; and I am encouraged that that debate has begun.

<p>

Ten years ago, as the Republican leader of the Children, Youth, and 
Families Committee in the House of Representatives, I began, along with
some others, to look at the role of the government in addressing
some of these fundamental needs that exist in our society today.

<p>

That committee, in its first year of existence, traveled around
the country attempting to elicit from individuals speaking before
our panel identification of the problem and solutions to the problem.
And everywhere we went, it seemed that no matter who came before
us to propose the solutions, the bottom line of what they proposed
was more of the same.  &quot;Oh, this program could be effective
if we had some more funds to enlarge it, to broaden it, to reach
out.  No, we don't have positive statistics to give you right
now in terms of outcome, but if we could put more money into the
program, if we could put more effort -- and, by the way, we don't
have the money here, so you need to send it from Washington&quot;
-- everywhere we went in the country, no matter whom we talked
to -- rural, suburban, inner city, or whatever -- all the experts
came before us and said more of the same.

<p>

It was at one of our last hearings in Macon, Georgia, on the subject 
of the rural southern youth and the problems that they were 
experiencing, that the very last panelist to appear before our 
committee before we rushed back to Atlanta to get on a plane to come 
back to Washington was a humble black minister from the Macedonian 
Missionary Church of Waycross, Georgia.  I don't know how he got on 
the panel. I don't know who invited him.  I didn't know why he was 
there.

<p>

Rev. McKinney, as some of the members and staff were starting
to pack up their papers to get ready to go back to Atlanta, presented
some of the most eloquent testimony that hit the nail right on
the head.  He looked at us and said, &quot;I've been listening
all day, and what you Congressmen and women don't seem to understand
is that the problems that I have to deal with with the youth of
my area, mostly low income, mostly black, that's true,&quot; he
said, &quot;but the problems I deal with are the same as the problems
everywhere.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;Those problems don't just result
from a lack of good housing, from a lack of good programs, from
a lack of schools, lack of education.&quot;  He said, &quot;Those
problems go deeper than that.  What you Congressmen don't seem
to understand is that if we want to heal individuals, we have
to touch the whole person.&quot;  He said, &quot;Government can't
do that.  You see,&quot; he said, &quot;all of us are made up
of not just body and mind but soul and spirit, and if we can't
redeem and heal soul and spirit, no matter how much money you
pour into programs, no matter how many bureaucracies you establish,
no matter how many programs you send to us,&quot; he said, &quot;all
the money in the world will not solve the problems of these people,
because we have to heal their soul and spirit as well as address
the problems of body and mind.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;These young girls that come to me with child, no 
father taking responsibility,&quot; he said, &quot;they're looking 
for something to love.  They are looking for something that is much 
deeper than can be solved by a government program.  And these young 
black boys that come that have been fathering kids all over the 
community, they're looking for something to prove that they are a 
man.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;That is why you must begin to examine how we can utilize 
the role of the church, the role of the family, the role of charity and 
private organizations outside of government which can bring these 
spiritual values to bear on a spiritual problem.&quot;

<p>

From that point forward, I began the process of attempting to identify 
ways in which the government could shift its emphasis from government 
programs which can't address soul and spirit to programs that can address 
soul and spirit.  I realize that you have to get beyond government.
We have to find a way to utilize institutions that are not government
institutions so that those institutions can bring to bear the
spiritual content and effort that can truly make a difference
in lives that are hurting, that can reclaim lives and redeem lives.

<p>

I have examined programs across the country that are reaching
out and solving intractable problems by injecting a spiritual
renewal and a vision of hope and redemption in the people that
they reach out to.

<p>

All of that led to the culmination and development
of a program called Project for American Renewal that I have worked
on intensely for the past year and a half, pulling together a
number of ways in which the government can begin the process of
shifting from the public sector to the private sector, ways which
do not violate the Constitution in terms of government involvement,
but energizing those organizations and those entities, those institutions
that can truly reclaim our communities, pull families back together,
reclaim lives, and bring spiritual and moral values to the programs
that they engage in.

<p>

Heart and soul of it all, though, is a charity
tax credit which allows every taxpayer in America to make a choice.
You can send up to $1,000 of your taxes that are due to the Federal
Government, or if you have more confidence in your local church
program or your local charity or your local faith-based organization,
you can designate that $1,000 to that organization and offset
it against those taxes due.

<p>

The bottom line: provide a hope and a vision for renewal of American 
society, for bringing families back together, for reuniting communities, 
for involving faith-based charities and involving the church in ways 
that provide redeeming, life-transforming, real help to people that 
are in need.

<p>

I think our party needs that vision.  I think we need to 
stand for more than just simply more of the same.  We don't know what 
to do except pour more money into the Washington institutions or simply 
wash our hands of the problem and say, &quot;Well, we just hope it
works itself out.  Government can't do it, but we don't know who
can.&quot;

<p>

We know who can.  We know who brings the hope of change,
the hope of redemption, the hope that touches soul and spirit
as well as body and mind.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Please join us after the commercial break as <i>Straight 
Talk</i> continues our 1996 Family Research Council Washington Briefing 
highlights.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.

<p>

Washington State has a lot to be proud of in electing Congresswoman 
Linda Smith.  As a freshman, she has taken an extremely unpopular 
stance on making radical but, many believe, needed changes to 
government as we know it.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE SMITH: In this envelope are all the invitations of the 
nighttime events I could go to.  I can go to a Rock the House if I am 
a lobbyist and want to pay $500.  And I can go to a California Fiesta.
This is just the events I could go to each night from about 5
to 10 o'clock instead of reading the bills.

<p>

So when I got here and I got these, I go, &quot;Now, ooh, I didn't 
bargain for that.&quot; Of course, as a two-week write-in candidate, 
I didn't bargain for much of anything.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I am not a Republican first, though. I know where my source is. And 
so when I got to Congress as a write-in candidate, I looked at the 
place, I looked at those invitations that I got each night, and I 
couldn't do it.

<p>

The first invitation, I looked and here were the names of the 
committees on it, and at the bottom it said, &quot;PACs, $500.&quot; 
I picked up the next one.  It said, &quot;PACs, $1,000.&quot;  And 
then I went into training, and I found out I was expected to spend
three to five nights a week, three to five hours a night, going
to these events to raise money for my colleagues, and they would
do it for me, and the invitations were sent to the PACs and special-interest
groups that surround this place.

<p>

I decided I wouldn't do it for a very functional reason.  I didn't have 
three to five hours a day.  I hadn't run.  God had put me here.  Some 
people have spent two years, but I spent two weeks. And while I was 
here, I was going to get the job done, really kind of basic stuff.

<p>

But I went to a couple of receptions, and I realized not only could I 
not do that; I couldn't go.  Now, I am not holier than thou.  I have
run a corporation; I have been in the business community for years;
I have been in politics.  I am not a neophyte to this.  But the
first time one of the lobbyists came up to me and leaned towards
me and said, &quot;I was a friend in your last election,&quot;
I realized we had two languages, the language out in the real
world and here.

<p>

What that means is he had given me money into
my election, and he went right on to say, after he said, &quot;I
was a friend in your last election&quot; -- that means I gave
you a contribution; that's the translation -- he went on to tell
me what they wanted that was right on the floor right then. And
I go, &quot;Oh, this is really close.&quot;

<p>

Then I realized that what was happening is there are fund-raisers all 
around every night, Democrat and Republican, probably a dozen or more 
every night.  That's where the lobbyists go.  They pay to get in, $500
to $1,000, for members for their war chests -- that means money
you accumulate from special interests to make sure nobody runs
against you -- and that that was just an atmosphere where they
could come and find a certain number of members every night to
lobby the bill on the floor.  We were in session just about every
night, and we ran back and forth between these events and voted
and went back and forth.

<p>

I watched what was happening to these families, and I am not saying 
that they are all breaking up, but it will be amazing if they don't. 
Here was dad at these receptions every night, or mom, mostly dads, 
three to five nights a week, with everyone telling you you're wonderful 
-- of course, they want something -- giving you money, and then these 
families were having to figure out how to get home on the weekends, and 
if they got home on the weekends, how they were spreading their time 
between their family and their district, or moving their family here and
then having to choose between the district or the family here.
Bad situation.

<p>

I looked at this and thought, Now, why did God
put me here?  I don't believe God makes mistakes.  I was so overwhelmed
by it, and I don't mean losing control, I mean just I can't believe
this place operates this way.  I started looking and going, &quot;Why?
Why, with good people coming here, does it happen?&quot;

<p>

This is the way it happens, and I figured it out.  It's a trap.  Good
people get here.  They stay good, but they have to harden a little
bit to stay in it.  Now, some folks say, &quot;That's not fair,
Linda; it doesn't affect me.&quot;  I'll give them that.  Maybe
a few people it doesn't affect. But as soon as they get here,
this is what happens.  They arrange one of those events for you.
On it they put the committees that you are on; in fact, they
put the freshmen on key committees to raise money.  They then
call on the name of the chair and the committee, and they will
do this if you're a lobbyist, and they have your staff doing it
at night, and you pay people to do it, and volunteers do it.

<p>

Let's say that you're a lobbyist.  They will call you and they will
say, &quot;Hi.  I'm calling tonight.  I didn't see your name on
Linda Smith's event tomorrow night,&quot; the fiesta, California
Fiesta or whatever.  They make it sound like a party.  Who pays
$500 to go to that kind of party?  And then they pause.  I mean,
it is all scripted.  &quot;Well, are you coming?&quot;  They say
something about being busy.  &quot;Well, have you sent your check?&quot;

<p>

Now, this is just the way it goes, and not occasionally; that
is the scripting.  Tell me it's not affecting this place.  It
is affecting this place.  And even if you somehow in your heart
can feel it doesn't affect you, it does affect this place.

<p>

So when I decided that we couldn't do that, I started accumulating
all the invitations, and I realized that the committees are on
all of them.  The chairmen of the committees support you on them,
and you have four, and if you have four, you are going to need
to go to several hundred.  If you go to several hundred, how do
you get your work done?  How do you see your family?

<p>

So what we are calling for is a bill that basically terminates the 
flow of money here.  I want to tell you, it is not a partisan thing.
It is not a Democrat thing.  They built the system up real good.
And it's not a Republican thing.  We got the system.  But it
is a system that I don't believe will allow us to balance the
budget.

<p>

I have watched each appropriation bill come to the floor,
one by one, and I have watched the fight over such things as the
National Endowment for the Arts.  Now, even if you support the
National Endowment for the Arts, should it be added to our debt
each year, being that we are spending 20 percent more than is
coming in every year?  It would make sense that would go first,
wouldn't it?

<p>

What about the tobacco subsidy?  Some of these things
make sense they would go first, wouldn't they?  Do you know that
we couldn't take them out?  Now let's go to sugar subsidy, let's
go to tobacco subsidy, peanut subsidy. But they contribute a whale
of a lot of money around here.

<p>

Now, most people would say, &quot;They only support us because we 
are philosophically with them.&quot; Well, they were philosophically 
with the Democrats last year, then, because most of the groups gave 
two to one to the Democrats, and as soon as we took control, now they 
give two to one to the Republicans.  It is amazing how they philosophically 
shifted all in one year, isn't it?

<p>

Now, the big problem is right now we didn't build it, it isn't our 
fault, but we're in it.  So you're asking a lot of people to change a 
system in the middle of a war.  It would be like asking our freshmen to 
lay down their arms in the middle of a war when their opponents are coming 
in here and raising money, because this is a war for this century. I mean, 
this is going to be whether or not we change America.

<p>

So you have the freshman Republicans, especially, coming in and saying 
we're going to clean up the system, but they are terrified of not having 
enough money with a Democrat coming up against them, and it is mostly
that direction.

<p>

So here they are.  They look like a hypocrite if they stay in the 
system and talk against it, if they use it, but they know they're 
going to be got.

<p>

Now, I have a belief. It is called a Daniel standard, and that is 
what frustrates people. Once I get to the point where I believe it's 
wrong, I don't care where God sends me, I am going to go into that land 
and I am going to follow that standard.  Daniel went in and he didn't 
eat off the table.  But what did he do?  He trusted in God for his 
provision.

<p>

Now, what we would do here is, we come in, we have a choice.
Do we follow the way of this place, pretend it doesn't affect
us -- and maybe some people it doesn't -- or do we say, &quot;I'm
not going to do it.&quot;  I don't believe everyone is called
to the same standard.  I believe they are called to right as God
shows them, but sometimes He will show you right a little before
me because He is working on me somewhere else.  I believe it is
wrong to the point where I cannot hold fund-raisers here.  I can't
do it.  You only start believing you can do it when you get here.
The real world out there doesn't think it's the right thing to
do normally.

<p>

What we're doing with the measure that I am trying
to pass is just saying, let's change the system.  I am not even
asking that we change it in the middle of this war.  I am not
asking for a Daniel standard.  All I am saying is let's vote now
and not send any more freshmen into the system, not have them
have to look you in the eye and say, &quot;Yes, I took $10,000
from the tobacco lobby, but it didn't make any difference.&quot;
That is a horrible thing.

<p>

We are just saying, at the end of this year, change it. Change the 
system.  And then, I believe, when we come back, people are going to 
trust us to make those tough decisions.  But right now they look at it 
and it is all muddled, and they go, &quot;How can we trust people when 
this is happening?&quot;

<p>

We could lose our system, I believe, by the 
lack of trust in it and what we are doing here.  I believe it is a fight 
for the Democratic system, and I think it is also a fight for whether we 
have a balanced budget, because you remember all those balanced budget 
things, they are seven years long, at least.  But every year the 
lobbyists around this place -- not bad people; they would probably like
to go home to their families, too -- every year, the special interests
grow.  There are 14,000 lobbyists.

<p>

Do you really think -- and I will leave you with this -- that by the 
end of the seven years, we can really balance the budget, with the 
amount of special-interest money that flows to this place?  I don't. For 
me to keep my word to my district to go in and balance the budget and to 
clean the system up, I have to do what I'm doing.  I don't have any 
choice.

<p>

So you will see me standing and saying, &quot;If the Republicans
are doing it, they are wrong.  If the Democrats are doing it,
they are wrong.&quot;  The situation does not dictate that this
is right because the Republicans are in control.  And in fact,
because I think God raised us up in a different way, a lot of
us miraculously, we have a greater responsibility.  People are
looking to us and saying, &quot;Is this Congress going to be different?
Is it going to be different than the old one that built a shroud
of protection around itself and became elite, or are they going
to be really a Congress of the people?&quot;  And I believe that
we have a much greater chance of preserving this democracy if
we are a Congress of the people, but I know we have to follow
God's word.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll share
more of the 1996 Washington Briefing as we hear from well-known
columnist and commentator Robert Novak.  You won't want to miss.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. Robert Novak can often
be seen on CNN's <i>Capital Gang</i> and <i>Crossfire</i>, and one 
guarantee from Mr. Novak: he's not shy when it comes to voicing his 
opinions, which he shared at the 1996 FRC Washington Briefing.

<p>

MR. NOVAK: As I go around the country, Republicans are dispirited. 
One year after they were in ecstacy, conservatives are worried.  How
did that happen?  How did it happen?  In fact, in a time when
I think the world is getting more and more conservative, when
the efficacy of government and the reliance on politics is declining
in every corner of the world, we have what is the most liberal
President we have ever had in the United States.

<p>

How did Bill Clinton get elected in the first place?  Well, we had a 
three-way race and President Bush broke his word on taxes.  And something
else.  There was something positive that President Clinton did.
Bill Clinton and his running mate went around the country, two
bubbas on a bus, telling people that they were a new kind of Democrats;
they didn't believe in too much government, too much taxation.
They were populists.

<p>

You know, I got a kick out of Al Gore calling
himself a populist.  I have known Al Gore since he was 12 years
old.  How did I know him when he was 12 years old?  Well, his
daddy, Albert Gore, Sr., was a U.S. Senator when I covered the
Senate for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> a long time ago.  I was pleased
to be a guest in their home.  They lived, they had an apartment
in the Fairfax Hotel, where little Al grew up.  The Fairfax Hotel
was partially owned by the Gore family, and today the Fairfax
Hotel, if you want to go looking for it to see a historic site,
is the Ritz Carlton Hotel.  And, you know, ladies and gentlemen,
there are very, very few populists who grow up in the Ritz Carlton
Hotel.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Little Al went on to St. Alban's, which is the fanciest prep school 
in Washington, and from there he went to Harvard, where I am told he 
studied Southern as a foreign language.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Now, Bill Clinton didn't need to develop his southern
accent.  But populist?  Georgetown School of Foreign Service,
then to Oxford, Rhodes Scholar, back to Yale Law School, where
he met Hillary Rodham; and together they went to Texas, where
they ran the McGovern for President campaign in Texas, which was
one of the 49 states that George McGovern failed to carry for
President in 1972.

<p>

After that they got married, went to Arkansas,
and Bill ran for Congress, was defeated; ran for state attorney
general, was elected; ran for governor, was elected; defeated
for reelection the first time out, then came back and won three
terms as governor; and then, first crack out of the box, ran for
President and was elected.  Very unusual to do it the first time,
the point being that President Clinton has spent almost his entire
life either running for office or serving in office, and in fact,
most of the people in his administration, contrary to all the
evidence of the 20th century, believe that government is the solution
and not the problem.  This is -- and I have been through the New
Frontier, the Great Society, Jimmy Carter -- he didn't have a
name, thank goodness -- and this is the most liberal administration,
by far.

<p>

Our newsletter which we are writing this week, we have
done a state-by-state analysis on what would happen if the election
were held today.  You know, there is a kind of euphoria among
Republicans.  They think that even though they are behind in the
popular vote, they are going to win the electoral vote.  It doesn't
happen, friends.  If the election were held today, President Clinton
would win by an electoral vote majority of -- we haven't done
the final numbers, but I think it is going to be about 130 votes
in the Electoral College.

<p>

Now, does that mean that it's over; we can go home?  Would that I 
wouldn't have to suffer through this eight-month campaign.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But, no, there's a lot of pitfalls for the President.  Pitfall number 
one is Bosnia. Yes, there are 40,000 troops in Bosnia.  The bad news 
in Bosnia is that the snow is melting, the weather is spring, and maybe
these Balkan lunatics are going to start killing each other again
and our troops will get in the way.  I pray that that doesn't
happen, and I know you all pray that, too.

<p>

But, politically, there is very little margin of error for the President. 
He wants to get these troops out quick.  Let the Muslims and the Serbs
and the Croats start killing each other again.  Nothing is going
to be solved by our being there.  But let's get them out, because
the American people didn't want them there in the first place;
they still don't want them there in the first place; and Congress
didn't want them there in the first place, but they succumbed.

<p>

The second pitfall is Whitewater.  Whitewater won't go away. 
A lot of the sophisticated people in this town say Whitewater
is not important.  I have a lot of Republicans, even, who believe
that.  All of you should read a book called <i>Blood Sport</i> by Jim
Stewart, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter, definitely,
definitely not a conservative.

<p>

Mr. Stewart, not a Washington reporter,
not a political reporter, was approached by a friend of his, Susan
Thomases, the First Lady's right-hand woman -- or should I say
left-hand woman -- asked if he could write, they would give him
access, and could he write a book on Whitewater, meaning it would
be an exculpatory book.  He got interested. They didn't give him
the cooperation that was promised, but he has written a hell of
a book.

<p>

Just today I talked to a former U.S. attorney who, going
through the book, jotting down things, found eight violations
of statutes, criminal violations, felonies.  Will the First Lady
be the first First Lady to be indicted, or even to be an unindicted
co-conspirator?  No wonder they want to end the D'Amato hearings,
put a stop to this.

<p>

The third pitfall is the economy:  0.9 percent
growth in the last quarter.  The first two quarters of this year
are going to be low growth, no growth, or negative growth.  The
economy is weak.  And the interesting thing is, as Pat Buchanan
has understood, it is weakest on the people who are in the Democratic
voting base.  Republicans are doing pretty well.  Will it get
weak enough so that it turns against the President?  No President,
when there has been a perception of an economic downturn, has
ever been reelected.

<p>

And the fourth pitfall is what the American
people think of Bill Clinton.  There is the question of whether
the American people really do want Bill Clinton in the White House
for four more years.  The Republicans have disappointed them,
I think.  I don't think they see in Senator Dole a visionary leader.
But sometimes they will say, perhaps, with all their shortcomings,
the opposition is better.  Perhaps the American people will take
a look at the issues:  Do I want more government or less?  Who
do I think is best equipped to have a social revival in this country?
And is government the problem or the solution?  That is what
is going to make this, despite everything else, an interesting
campaign.

<p>

Thank you very much.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares insight from 
Family Research Council president Gary Bauer.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. FRC president Gary Bauer is known in Washington and
across the nation for standing firm when it comes to fighting
for America's families.  Let's hear his insight on tonight's Homefront
News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER: One of the central things that sort of drives what we are 
doing at FRC is the fact that for about 15 years now, all of the polling 
data has been showing that two-thirds of the American people think
that America is headed in the wrong direction.

<p>

What could be on their minds?  Why are they so filled with anxiety? Now, 
I suspect some of it is economic. There hasn't been real wage growth for
a large segment of the population for about 20 years.  There is
a great deal of concern about downsizing and all the issues in
the headlines.

<p>

But I don't really think, at the end of the day,
that it is a essentially economics that are driving the answer
to that question.  I think Americans are pondering the heart and
soul of America, and it is that which is troubling them about
the future, the sense that I think we all have that America is
one wrong turn away from a disaster.

<p>

Every place I go, people say to me, &quot;What in the world happened to 
us?  How did we get here?  When did these things take place?  How did it 
all just sort of transpire that we woke up one morning and this was where
we were living?&quot;

<p>

I think, clearly, one answer to this question
of how we got here is that, as a society, we have collectively
forgotten God.  I mean, there is just no doubt about that in my
mind.  Now, that is a very impolitic thing to say in Washington,
D.C.  If you go up to a congressional committee or before some
reporter and you say, &quot;You know, the reason we're in this
mess is because we've forgotten God,&quot; that's a pretty unusual
thing for someone to say in Washington, even today.

<p>

But it's clear. I mean, isn't it clear to you all that that is at the 
core of the problem?  This is a terribly ironic thing that has happened
in the United States.  All over this city -- you've passed them
probably in the bus and when you've been walking around in the
last day and a half - there are monuments in this city where there
are words etched in the stone that make it clear that our liberty
comes from no man but from God.  Those monuments reflect the founding
of America.

<p>

Lincoln called us the almost chosen people, and he
called us that for a reason.  Every one of us have, either in
our pockets, or you ladies, in your purses, money that says, &quot;In
God We Trust,&quot; and the phrase has become as devalued as the
money it is printed on.

<p>

Now, to listen to the cultural elite in
this city, you would think that the biggest problem facing America
is that men and women like you, men and women of faith, may actually
get into the public square, plant your feet, and not move until
you have changed the country.

<p>

I would hope you would remember that the biggest threat facing 
America is that you will not do that.  You are the only ones that 
can explain to the American people the importance of the family to 
civilization. Nobody else is going to do it.  You are the only ones who 
can make the case for racial reconciliation, because you know we are 
all created equal by God, that we are equal in His sight, and that is the
foundation upon which a society gives equality to all people regardless
of their race or their creed or their economic background.

<p>

You are the only ones that can do that.  You are the only ones that
can explain, ultimately, the sanctity of human life and why life
can't just be put up to a vote every couple of years depending
on changing mores.  If you don't get into the public square, plant
your feet, and stand for these things, I am absolutely convinced
that America will fall in the next century as surely as it would
from economic collapse.

<p>

What's the second reason that we've gotten
into the mess we're in today?  I think the second reason is our
failure as a culture to teach our children who we are, what this
experiment was all about.  The research on this is absolutely
clear.  Each generation of young Americans knows less about their
heritage, about who they are, about the shoulders of the giants
upon whom they sit as Americans than the generation before it.

<p>

Now, the trend line here is clear.  A country for whom its children
are forgetting the basics or are never taught the basics is a
country in trouble.

<p>

I would like to suggest to you tonight that
we are not going to reform American education in the next year,
the next five years, or the next ten years, so we are going to
have to take it upon ourselves to make sure that our children
know the minutes of the last meeting, that they know about the
values that the country was built upon.

<p>

We have to teach our children who said, &quot;Give me liberty or 
give me death&quot; and who said, &quot;I have a dream.&quot; We need 
to teach them about what happened at Normandy, what happened at 
Concord Bridge, what happened on Pork Chop Hill, and how their liberty 
was born and nurtured in those places. We need to show them what 
Constitution Hall looks like, what good music sounds like, what the 
lady in New York Harbor stands for, why there was a Berlin Wall and what
the forces were that brought that wall down.

<p>

We need to teach them about Ruth and Naomi, Jonathan and David. In short, 
it is up to us to teach them to love the things we love and to honor
the things we honor, because nothing less than that will do.

<p>

Finally, I think the third thing that has happened is that we are in 
the process in America of separating virtue from liberty.  If we 
separate virtue from liberty, which is what the society in this 
culture is doing today, then the consequences are inevitable.

<p>

I think I have talked to some of you before about the absolutely 
incredible reaction to the death of Jerry Garcia, the lead singer of 
the band, the Grateful Dead.  But the thing that astonished me was,
here's Jerry Garcia that never got out of the sixties.  The man
was a dope addict and an alcoholic his entire life.  And yet when
he died last year, the culture treated his death as if a great
hero had passed from the scene.  It was one of the lead items
on all the evening news.  I watched United States Senators leave
committee hearing rooms to go out into the hallways and speak
to banks of cameras to say how much their lives had been touched
by Jerry Garcia.

<p>

There is something wrong, ladies and gentlemen,
when people like Jerry Garcia are held up as great heroes and
yet one-half of American 16-year-olds cannot tell you the correct
half-century the American Civil War took place. That's a problem.

<p>

And I suppose that there is no issue that is a clearer example
of the separation of virtue from liberty than the issue you have
heard about time and time again in the last day and a half, and
that is the sanctity of human life.  I mean, this is the marker
issue.  I suspect that there are probably some of you who would
maybe prefer that we not harp on it so much.  We can't stop harping
on it.

<p>

I believe it defines who we are as a country, and if we
ever rolled back abortion on demand, almost every other issue
we were dealing with, I think, would fall into place in a very
short period of time.  This issue is at the core of what our liberty
means and the role that virtue plays in moderating that liberty.

<p>

And so this organization, the Family Research Council, will
never back off on the abortion issue.  Men and women like you
who bring new life into the world, who stand for these values,
who will do anything for blood of their blood, flesh of their
flesh, that is courage, and that is what the Family Research Council
will stand for as long as I am here and this great staff that
you have met is here, and with your help.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
discusses a critical issue which is sweeping our country, making 
headlines nationwide, and causing a stir in American families:  the 
possible redefining of marriage to include homosexual unions.

<p>

We will be talking to Robert Knight of the Family Research Council, 
who has thoroughly researched the homosexual activist movement and their 
attempts to dramatically change family life as we know it. And we will
also bring you Anthony Falzarano, who, as a former homosexual,
knows well the inside story on homosexual culture and the attempts
to increase its influence by changing our laws.  These attempts
to redefine marriage will affect all of us, from the filing of
our taxes to our schools, to our workplaces, and beyond.  You
need to understand this phenomenon.

<p>

But first, let's hear from the Family Research Council's president, 
Gary Bauer.  Yesterday, Gary and I talked about a pivotal decision which 
may be made this very evening by President Clinton, whether to veto the 
Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act or to align himself with the majority of
Americans and majority of House and Senate members, who have clearly
stated that they strongly support the lifesaving act.

<p>

You will hear a lot of stories on this veto, but first, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> will take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thanks so much for being with us today.

<p>

Just last week, on Good Friday, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act
was finally sent to the President.  It was passed overwhelmingly
in both the House and the Senate.  It is a piece of legislation
that deals with a procedure in which the child is delivered into
the birth canal; moments from birth, a scissors stabbed into the
base of his skull; living brain tissue suctioned out; and this
is an abortion procedure that would be banned except to save the
life of the mother.

<p>

The President has been very clear that he intends to veto this bill. 
What do you think this says about the state of the abortion debate 
today?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  We probably should have given a disclaimer to the viewer 
who might not have wanted to hear that description.  It's incredible 
to think that in America we are actually aborting babies in the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth month of pregnancy using that procedure.

<p>

The country is deeply divided over abortion.  We all know that, Kristi. 
But every poll that I have seen shows that the American people 
overwhelmingly find this procedure to be reprehensible, to be grotesque; 
in fact, most Americans react in disbelief when they hear that it is 
something that goes on in clinics today.

<p>

So, for me, to hear the President of the United States say basically 
that he is going to fall on his sword over this; that he is so committed 
to abortion on demand that even these third-trimester abortions will 
continue under his Presidency is something that, in my mind, makes him 
an extremist on this issue.  I just don't know any other way to describe 
it. And it just seems sort of unusual, because he has really tried
in the last year or so to picture himself as being middle-of-the-road,
and I think he has been quite convincing with some Americans.

<p>

But here is an issue that gets past the rhetoric, goes right to
the heart of the debate in America about our liberty and how it
should be used, and the President has made it clear he is going
to stand with the National Organization for Women and the radicals
on this issue, and I think it is going to hurt him politically.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  One of the interesting things about this particular
abortion debate was that people who had never cast a pro-life
vote in their entire history voted for this particular ban.  What
do you think this says about the President's statement and his
advisors' statements that this particular abortion bill will work
for him?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I don't know.  You know, the White
House does polling every night.  It is the first White House in
American history to do that, so you would expect them to have
a finely tuned sense of American public opinion.  I can't imagine
how in the world this issue would work for him, and quite frankly,
on an issue involving life and death, I would hope politicians
of all stripes would stop looking at these issues about what helps
them and what hurts them and start making judgments that are filled
with some sense of compassion and some sense of the sanctity of
life.  It just seems amazing to me that anyone would try to make
a political calculation over something this important.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, this bill does deal with the life-of-the-mother 
exception. If this procedure would be needed to save the mother's 
life, it would be available, but not for some of the other reasons,
not for elective abortion, for example.

<p>

This is the first time since <i>Roe v. Wade</i> that any abortion 
restriction at all has been made possible.  Why do you think that 
there has been a kind of restriction available now?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, when you really think about it, people say 
that we have been debating abortion too much. Actually, we really 
don't as a society get to debate it really at all in any meaningful 
sense of the word.  The courts have driven this issue for over 20 
years, and no matter where you stand on the issue, the courts have had 
the trump cards. They keep throwing down their aces and stopping the 
American people from doing much about abortion one way or the other. 

<p>

This was the first time in a long, long time that the Congress of the 
United States actually had a real bill dealing with a real abortion 
issue that they had to debate and then vote on the record about.  I
think that is the important thing here.  These politicians in
the Congress knew that the whole country would see their vote
and would be able to ponder the meaning of those votes, and I
think that is why the final vote was so overwhelming.

<p>

Every once in a while, I tune in to C-SPAN that often will allow 
callers to comment on what is going on on the floor of the Congress, 
and what struck me was the just almost endless numbers of calls coming
in from people who would say, &quot;I'm pro-choice, but I can't
possibly support something like this.&quot;

<p>

So I think that is why this vote was so significant, and I think it 
reflects where the American people are on the abortion issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, you pointed out to me a poll out just this week 
which indicates that the majority of Americans in fact are actually 
pro-life or leaning toward pro-life.  What do the numbers tell us 
about people's sentiments toward abortions?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Yes, this is an area where there is great misunderstanding. 
The media generally says almost without question that Americans are 
&quot;pro-choice,&quot; which generally is interpreted to mean they 
favor abortion on demand.

<p>

What the polling data has shown for over 25 years and continues to 
show in 1996 is that about one-third of the country believes that 
abortion should be unrestricted totally. The other two-thirds of 
the country either wants abortion severely restricted
or doesn't want any abortions at all.  So to the extent that there
is a consensus in America, it is much more toward the pro-life
side.

<p>

Now, people get confused about what words like &quot;pro-choice&quot;
mean. That's why I always look at polls that get very specific:
Would you be in favor of abortion in this case or that case?
And when you ask that kind of question, it is clear that Americans,
two to one, take a generally pro-life position.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: This particular debate has been surrounded by a lot of 
powerful symbolism, first-time symbolism.  For example, the leaders of
the Catholic Church in America met in the park outside the White
House in pouring rain to pray and to ask the President not to
veto this particular bill.

<p>

Politically speaking, how do you think American Catholics will 
respond to a veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think that what happened outside the White 
House just a few days ago was an incredible moral statement by the 
church that on this issue they would stand up to the President, 
even though they have some issues that they are in agreement with 
him on.

<p>

I think the interesting thing will be what will the average American 
Catholic -- and, for that matter, the average American evangelical -- 
do when they go to the voting booth in November on this kind of issue. 
There are a lot of issues that voters weigh, but presumably, men and 
women of faith are going to weigh issues that go directly to their 
faith first and foremost when they vote.

<p>

And so I think the President does run the risk of losing a lot of 
evangelical and Catholic votes if he follows through with his threat 
to veto this bill.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you think, Gary, that President Clinton will veto 
this bill, or is it possible that he might change his mind?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think that the signals over the last couple of weeks 
have been so clear and so pronounced that he almost would look foolish 
at this point. He really has backed himself into a corner.

<p>

The other thing is, there are some very important groups that the 
President has to have the support of, some of the radical feminist 
groups, groups like Planned Parenthood, the National Organization for
Women, and so forth.  These groups are important parts of the
liberal coalition in the United States, and I think the President
is afraid that if he vetoes the bill, he will get criticism from
groups he is going to be counting on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The pro-life story can be put up against the Unabomber 
story right now, ironically enough. We have seen some very unfortunate 
and horrible shootings at abortion clinics and, after 30 peaceful years, 
an attempt to smear a lot of pro-life Americans, saying that these shooters
are representative; and then a man who by news accounts is a radical
environmentalist bombs quite a few people and in fact was involved,
they say, with Earth First, even killing people on an Earth First
hit list.

<p>

It has been interesting the way in which these two stories
have been handled and how people on both sides have been characterized.
What is your take on the way these pro-life and environmentalist
issues have been played?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, there clearly is a double standard, but first of all, 
let's make clear that everybody understands that we condemn, obviously, 
the abortion clinic shootings. Those have been terrible, terrible events, 
and the people responsible for them ought to be punished and sentenced 
to the full extent of the law.

<p>

What has been unfortunate, however, is the effort
of the pro-abortion side to take these incidents and blame them
or try to hang them on everyone who is pro-life.  I travel all
around the country, and I see tens of thousands of people sacrificing
financially and otherwise to help women in crisis pregnancy.
You've got crisis pregnancy clinics all over the country.  These
abortion murderers don't represent the pro-life movement.

<p>

But as you point out, here we have the Unabomber, who appears to be
an environmentalist, a radical environmentalist, associated in
some way with the group Earth First -- more investigation will
have to be done about that -- and yet the media is generally silent
about that connection.  The same media that wants to try to hang
a deranged killer at an abortion clinic and use him to smear the
whole pro-life movement is relatively silent when it comes to
using the Unabomber to raise questions about whether radical 
environmentalism has gone too far.

<p>

So I guess I would just ask that the standards be the same here. If 
pro-life rhetoric can be held to be responsible for a deranged 
individual, then I don't see how radical pro-environmental
rhetoric can't be held to the same standard when it comes to somebody
like the man that has been alleged to do these bombings.  Clearly,
the liberal bias of the media comes through time and time again,
and it is certainly pronounced in this case.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One last question, Gary.  As you know, President Clinton 
has tended to veto pro-life measures or to deal with abortion-related 
bills in the dead of night or on the weekend or sometimes in the middle
of, even once, a bombing that the United States was involved with.

<p>

What is your analysis on when this particular Partial Birth Abortion
Ban Act will be handled?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think the best prediction is that it will happen late 
on a Friday when most of the media is already focused on other things, 
or it will happen on a day when there is big news someplace else, 
either foreign policy news and so forth.

<p>

This White House has shown a very clear pattern
of doing things it doesn't want the public to focus on at times
when the media is not going to be watching very closely, and I
suspect the same thing will happen on this.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you so much, Gary, for being with us.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Thank you, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we will begin our
discussion regarding same-sex marriage and how it could dramatically
influence society both today and forever.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as
the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband
or wife, one woman and one man.  As basic and familiar as the
definition may sound, the literal and fundamental meaning of marriage
may undergo a drastic change if homosexual activists have their
way.  Currently across the nation, the battle to redefine marriage
and family is being waged.  Studies, statistics, and basic common
sense tell us that marriage between a man and a woman stabilizes
sexuality and provides the best environment in which to procreate
and raise children.  This has been found true both in research
and in all of recorded history.  The family, based on a committed
man and woman, exists as the foundation of society before recorded
time.

<p>

Yet homosexual activists seek to legitimize their relationships
by forcing acceptance of same-sex couples under the law.  It has
become clear that the mere tolerance of homosexual relationships
is no longer enough.

<p>

Some may question whether the decision to allow same-sex marriage 
would really do that much damage.  But those people may want to ask 
themselves whether they are willing to have businesses required to 
have family health benefits for homosexual couples, to have their 
children taught in school that homosexual sex is the moral equivalent 
of marital love, and to endorse adoption of children by homosexual 
couples.

<p>

Marriage has been revered and protected throughout the world because 
that specific and special relationship benefitted not only the people in 
them but the societies as well.  Legally destroying the exclusive territory
of marriage to achieve a political end will not provide the real
benefits of marriage to homosexuals, but it may be the blow that
the shattered American family does not survive.

<p>

To help us understand just how much a decision to redefine marriage to 
include same-sex relationships could change all of society, I am joined 
by two special guests:  Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for
the Family Research Council, who has been one of the most influential
pro-family leaders in bringing this issue to light in research
and analysis; and Anthony Falzarano, Executive Director of Transformations
Ex-Gay Ministry, who works daily with men and women trying to
free themselves from the gay lifestyle.  Both are the most eloquent
experts on these issues today.

<p>

Welcome to the show.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Great to be here.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Thanks for the introduction, too.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You're welcome.  Most of the time you're one amongst
many anti; it is only fair that you're acknowledged for the 
contributions that you both have made.

<p>

I wanted to start -- as I talk about this issue, as you all both 
do very eloquently, so many people do not understand why we should 
care.  You know, look, they're already out there. There are already 
homosexuals and lesbians in relationships.  So they have a marriage 
ceremony.  What does it hurt?  And I ask you, what does it hurt?

<p>

Bob, I will start with you, and then Anthony.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, a lot of people don't realize that what they're 
seeking is not so much acceptance for individual relationships as a 
larger goal, which is acceptance within the law, which forces it on 
everybody else.

<p>

See, when you have a couple homosexuals who say, &quot;Well, we want to
commit to ourselves,&quot; and then they go have a ceremony, they've
got that right in this country.  It's a free country.  But when
they bring the law into it, they bring us all into it.  They tell
us all that this marriage license is now the same as mom and dad
over here, and that cheapens mom and dad's marriage license, because
suddenly that marriage, the word &quot;marriage&quot; doesn't
mean what it used to mean.  It's not a very specific, defined
thing.

<p>

When you do that, when you bring a counterfeit version
in, that hurts the original.  It hurts support for the original
within the law.  People have worked very hard over the years to
support marriage within the law by setting aside specific benefits
for it, protections.  You know, spouses can't testify against
each other in trials, and all kinds of things.

<p>

Support for these kinds of special set-asides would erode if the 
institution itself suddenly ceases to be that special man-woman 
unique relationship that is the heart of civilization.

<p>

We can't do without it, and that's the bottom line.  The state knows 
that. Even if the state didn't believe that any religion was valid -- 
Christianity, Judaism, Islam, anything -- they would still support 
marriage because it has such a wide array of social benefits.  There 
is no society on Earth that has functioned without marriage, and there 
are many that have gone into the dust bin of history as soon as they 
cheapened marriage:  Rome, Greece, some of the middle Chinese dynasties.
When marriage became cheapened, the social fabric began to unravel.

<p>

And we're seeing that in this country.  We have already cheapened
marriage with easy divorce.  We have prenuptial agreements, we
have people living together.  It has already hurt marriage.  But
this would be the final blow, to say that it doesn't even have
to be a man and a woman.  It could be two guys.  And if you're
at that point, why not three guys or four guys?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There are so many interesting countervailing trends right 
now. You have a move to get rid of no-fault divorce because we say
divorce has unraveled our society.  You have men's movements saying
we need fathers involved with their children.  And then you have
this whole homosexual activist movement saying, Oh, all of that
is null and void; we really just need to expand and have it mean
even less than it does today.

<p>

Anthony, you understand this very well.  Why do you think it matters 
whether or not we legally change the definition of marriage?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: This is extremely important. I would obviously agree 
with Bob.  Basically, the homosexual, let's say the political gay 
community, is out to destroy the traditional marriage, heterosexual 
marriage, that God has designed for us. God deemed that the male 
would leave his parents and cling onto the female and the two would 
become one.

<p>

Basically, our country was founded on those Judeo-Christian 
values, and God has blessed our country because we have stood for 
those values. But over the last 25 years we have seen an incredible 
deterioration of those values.

<p>

What the gays are up to is, they can't change the church in our 
country.  They can't change the mainline church. They can't change 
the Roman Catholic church.  They can't change the mainline Protestant 
church's view of homosexuality:  it is sinful behavior.

<p>

So, basically, what they started with in 1973 was going to the 
next most important authority, which was the
American Psychological Association, and they pushed homosexuality
out of the <i>APA Journal</i>, and when the APA decided that they would
take homosexuality out of the DSM-III, which is the official digest
of mental illnesses in this country, with that they now had permission
from an authority to go to our Federal Government and go to our
state government and say, &quot;See, these professionals do not
consider this to be a mental illness; therefore, you are discriminating
against us, and you are going to have to give us our rights.&quot;

<p>

And now they are trying to get gay marriage pushed onto our country,
because then they can now go after the church, and they can say,
&quot;Well, the American Psychiatric Association says we're normal,
the Federal Government, the state government says we're normal;
therefore, if you don't start hiring us in that local Catholic
church or that local Protestant church or in that Christian day
school, we're going to sue you, and if you don't conform, the
Federal Government is going to take your 501(c)(3) status away
and is going to take your full tax-exempt status away; therefore,
many of these churches will not be able to survive.&quot;

<p>

It's just like Georgetown University was forced to have a pro-gay group
on their campus, and it's against Catholic teaching.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Georgetown, a Catholic University that we have to mention.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  Yes, and they get federal funding from the government.
And if you take that $40 or $50 million away, whatever that figure
is, Georgetown University will be out of business tomorrow.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it is interesting to note not only how accurate
that prediction is for future society but present society.  A
gentleman in Seattle, for example, that called Family Research
Council not too long ago.  He was a business owner, had hired
a gentleman who was a homosexual as an accountant.  They did not
have the business to keep him employed, and so they had to lay
him off, and a suit was filed that it was homosexual discrimination
because this gentleman played Christian music in the business
that he owned.  Because of that, he is fighting an expensive lawsuit
on antidiscrimination grounds saying that his faith is the problem,
and it's an extraordinary case.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Here are some other cases.  Shell Oil Company on the 
West Coast, there was a homosexual higher level executive who used the 
company fax machine and the xerox machine to make fliers advertising a 
gay orgy. You know, it was a very explicit flier.  Well, that's not 
conduct suitable for a high executive at Shell Oil Company, so they fired
him.

<p>

He came back and said, &quot;Well, you fired me because I'm
gay.&quot;  So under California's gay rights law, he sued; he
won millions from Shell Oil Company.

<p>

That's what we're talking about whenever you're talking about gay 
rights. You're talking about giving somebody a gun to put at the head 
of anybody who disagrees with them, whether it's the Boy Scouts, whether 
it's a local dry-cleaning establishment or a giant corporation like
Shell Oil.

<p>

That's another reason we're fighting this whole gay
marriage idea, because when you create something that's immoral,
which gay marriage certainly is, by any stretch, by any religious
value system and tradition, and then you put it into the law,
you make everybody who disagrees a moral outlaw.  You make people
who disagree find themselves the target of civil suits, harassment
at work.

<p>

I just got a call today from a guy who works for a federal
contractor, and he has been fired from his job by a homosexual
supervisor who had been hiring homosexuals, and they found out
he was Christian and harassed him and finally fired him.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Amazing. And it's only the beginning.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: It's just the beginning.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  This is only the beginning.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And we're going to have to hear more
about this after the break.  Please join us after the commercial
break as we continue to discuss the homosexual agenda regarding
marriage and family. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing the drastic ramifications of 
changing marriage to including same-sex relationships, and I am joined
again by Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for the Family
Research Council, and Anthony Falzarano, Executive Director of
Transformations Ex-Gay Christian Ministries.  Thank you so much
again for being with us.

<p>

There is a lot of activity going on in Hawaii right now, and, Bob, 
we are going to get to you on that in a second, where the law is 
being a frontal attack.

<p>

But, Anthony, one thing that has been interesting to me in a lot of 
the homosexual activist literature is there's this myth out there that 
most homosexual relationships are two men, two women that have been 
together for 30 years and that we're merely going to legalize with this 
change something that is already taking place.  And yet the gay literature
is very clear that not only do they want to call the relationships
marriage; they don't want their marriages to be the same as what
we would call good marriages.  Could you explain that?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Yes.  Well, basically, it is all propaganda.  They cannot 
sell short-term marriages to the American public.  They cannot sell
a marriage where there are three guys living in sin together.
So, basically, they choose, a certain amount of gays -- and there
are a certain percentage that are together in monogamous relationships,
but I can assure you, they are an extreme minimum.  Most homosexuals
are still highly promiscuous, even in the age of AIDS.  And, basically,
they get these people, they look all scrubbed, all American, they
have a house with a white picket fence in Falls Church, Virginia,
and you just think, Wow, they're just wonderful people; how can
we discriminate against these people?  And, basically, they are
pushing this pro-gay agenda onto the American public.  If they
can get --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But the gay literature -- one thing
that has been interesting to me is the gay literature has come
right out and said we can't keep monogamy in our definition of
marriage.  We may have a significant relationship we'll call marriage,
but things like monogamy and fidelity, faithfulness, and lifetime
kind of till-death-do-us-part commitments are a little unrealistic.
So we want it to be marriage, but we don't want it to be monogamous.

<p>

It has been a strange delinking of monogamy.  But why do you think
that has --

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  Well, it's political.  Basically, they want to be 
able to get, if they have a boyfriend and they
work at AT&amp;T, which is a very pro-gay organization right now,
they want to be able to have that boyfriend have insurance benefits.
I mean, you can hook up with a guy who is your friend who has
AIDS and he has no health insurance, and that's very sad, but
in our country he would never be denied health care, but with
certain corporations you're going to get better health care, so
they can claim that they are in a monogamous relationship, and
therefore, you have to extend benefits to my boyfriend.

<p>

I mean, there are a lot of reasons why they are doing this, but what we
really have to focus in on is this is an attack on Judeo-Christian
values in this country.  This is an assault on traditional Judeo-Christian
marriage, and if the American public falls for this and allows
homosexual marriage to be officially recognized in the courts,
you are opening up a whole can of worms.  You are opening up the
insurance industry, the wills.  A lot of times if someone has
--

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Education.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  -- education -- you know, this is my boyfriend. He 
can bring this boyfriend into class and introduce him to 12-year-old 
children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure.

<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  It's a whole can of worms, and it's so
beautifully packaged by organizations like the Human Rights Campaign
Fund.  I mean, I was on a show with the director of that organization,
and she was quoting -- I don't know where she got her statistics
from, but she was quoting a study that says that America really
is for gay marriage.  And when she started giving off her data,
she said, &quot;Well, in this study, 48 percent are undecided.&quot;
I said, &quot;Well, where are you getting this propaganda from?&quot;
I said, &quot;What kind of study would have credibility where
48 percent of the study is undecided?&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Is &quot;I don't know,&quot; right.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  America is against gay marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, yes.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  And, hopefully, they will never accept it, or the 
wrath of God will come upon this country.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, interestingly enough, Hawaii has been the 
spearpoint state for driving gay marriage into the country, and 
yet, apparently, the spear point got a little blunted this week. 
Bob, what happened?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Boy, did it!  Well, it started last week. They released 
the latest poll of Hawaiians, and what had been a 71 percent figure 
opposing same-sex marriage rose to 74 percent.  That was reported 
in the major Honolulu newspapers. The percentage just keeps rising 
as people understand the threat that gay marriage, so called, poses.

<p>

But yesterday there was a major victory in the Senate.  There was a 
bill that went through the Senate unanimously, 24 to nothing, banning 
same-sex marriage, reaffirming the state's commitment to one man-one 
woman marriage, and stating the reasons for it.  This was all done 
because a court case is coming up in Hawaii in a circuit court, sent 
down from the Supreme Court, expected to be heard in August, in which 
three couples have challenged the marriage license law.

<p>

The Supreme Court had told the state of Hawaii, find a compelling 
interest to preserve one man-one woman marriage or we are going to 
open it up to same-sex relationships.

<p>

So now the Senate has moved. Liberal Hawaii, liberal Democrats and 
moderate Republicans and some conservatives, all voting to preserve 
marriage.  That has got to send a signal to the courts, and it should 
send a signal to the rest of America that you don't want this, folks.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: People don't, I think, understand [that] to redefine 
marriage is to open -- some things we are going to talk about in the 
next segment, adoption of children, to change our educational system,
to say that any kind of sex practice is morally neutral.  Here
we are struggling with rising STD rates and you have a growing
abstinence movement and just plain an attempt to decrease sexually
transmitted diseases among kids and a crippling infertility rate,
and then we are going to say that all sex practices, despite these
horrible figures, the sex that you have is insignificant.

<p>

There are all these strange counter-trends going on, but I think one
of the interesting significances of Hawaii is, if Hawaii, that
one state, changes their law, the rest of the nation is changed.
Bob, could you explain that for the viewers?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Because of the full faith and credit clause of the 
Constitution, states are supposed to recognize licenses from out of 
state, like a driver's license.  If a gay couple from, say, Ohio flies 
to Honolulu, gets married under a brand-new gay marriage law in Hawaii
and goes back to Ohio, they can present their marriage license
and say, &quot;Look, you have to recognize it with all the benefits
and status and privileges it brings.&quot;  That gives Ohio a
huge problem under the full faith and credit clause.  If they
don't recognize it, the gay couple is going to haul them into
court and say, &quot;You're denying us our basic human rights.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Based on the Constitution, even.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Based on the Constitution.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  And what is incredible about
that is that a lot of states are adopting anti-gay marriage laws
right now, but, you see, the gays aren't concerned about that.
They are going to go up to the Supreme Court, which will override
the state laws, and that is what they are really up to, taking
this up to the Supreme Court.  They are assaulting the American
public right now.  They are extremely organized, and if they don't
win in Hawaii, they are going to hit California; they are going
to hit another liberal state; and eventually, they are going to
try to break through.  That is what they are up to.

<p>

If the American public doesn't wise up to this, then evil thrives 
when good men and women do nothing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I can tell you one thing about the --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You're going to have to tell me this after the break, 
because we are going to hear more about this.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> 
returns, we will hear more about how same-sex marriage affects the family 
and America's children.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.

<p>

Legalizing same-sex marriage not only touches the lives of those
involved in the relationships; it also affects America's children
by opening the door to gay adoption and much more.

<p>

To shed light on this, back again are Bob Knight and Anthony Falzarano.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Again.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Are we eloquent still?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Eloquent and continuing to be eloquent.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But I wanted to let you wrap up one point before we
get into the real reason why so many of us are fighting this,
which is for today's children.  But why is it, Anthony, homosexuals
and lesbians have made tremendous gains in societies?  I mean,
Hollywood and really in the job and a lot of different settings.
Why do they keep coming?  Why now gay marriage?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I am the director of an ex-gay ministry.  I am a former 
homosexual myself.  I was gay for nine years before I got saved and 
became a Christian and the blood of Jesus Christ washed over me.

<p>

Basically, I had no problem getting an apartment if I made enough money,
just like anybody else.  No one ever turned me down for an apartment.
There are certain gays out there that just want to push into
the landlord's face that I'm a homosexual and you can't keep me
out.

<p>

Basically, homosexuality is a neurosis.  It's healable, it's
treatable.  We are ministering to 6,000 former homosexuals in
the Exodus network.  Basically, homosexuality is a stunting of
psychosexual growth.  They are children inside, and any parents
out there -- you know, when your kid is spoiled, he'll keep coming
at you and keep coming at you and keep coming at you until you
give him a whack on the bottom and say, &quot;Enough!&quot; and
then the child will stop.

<p>

The American public has got to start treating the homosexual community 
in that way. They've got to say, &quot;Enough is enough.  You have 
enough benefits. You can live in your subculture, but please do not 
push this on our Judeo-Christian values.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And the reason why they're stunted, I think you need 
to bring that up.  A lot of people were molested; there were some 
serious events in their lives.  We know from psychological
research that powerful and crushing events do stunt growth.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Of course. Eighty percent of the people that have
come to Transformation in Washington have been sexually abused
as children.  Ninety-eight percent of them did not bond with their
same-sex parent.  And, basically, that is the main cause of homosexuality.
And when we treat those symptoms with the love of the Christian
church, people start to recover from homosexuality.

<p>

We see people go on to heterosexual marriage.  We put marriages back 
together. We see people go on to seminary.  These people don't necessarily
want to be gay.  They are being sold a bill of goods by the political
pro-gay factions that are in this country, and we need to get
the word out that you don't have to be gay and that there are
options, and I believe that many homosexuals, if they knew that
they had an option, would take that option to become ex-gay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, one of the things that you have been studying has
been the sexualizing of children and the way in which children
have become a political football.  But they are the real goal
here.

<p>

It was interesting, during the gay march here in Washington,
D.C., one of the constant chants was, &quot;Ten percent is not
enough; recruit, recruit, recruit,&quot; which kind of flies in
the face of their biological argument.

<p>

Why are children the key issue here with the gay marriage debate?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, because when you legitimatize gay marriage, you 
really can't say no to adoption of children in same-sex households, 
because you have destroyed the gender distinction, the idea that men 
and women are different, complementary, have something special to offer
each other and to their children.

<p>

It is kind of the Equal Rights Amendment. It is creeping in through the 
back door saying men and women are interchangeable; there is no 
difference, so let's not make any distinctions at all.  That's what 
it's all about. That's why it's not just live and let live, have a gay 
couple down the street get a marriage license.  It's so much bigger than
that. I think what has not been said often enough is that children
really do need a mother and a father.  A little boy needs to have
a father to learn what it is to be a man and to have his growing
masculinity affirmed, and he needs to have a mother for that mother
love, and to watch both parents interact and see how men should
treat women, women should treat men, how they both treat each
other as husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, and their relationship
with their children.

<p>

In a gay household, these same-sex households that are now adopting 
children, the child immediately doesn't have a father or a mother, 
one or the other, so the kid is already at a disadvantage. Then the 
child sees a distorted view of sexuality because of the homosexuality 
going on, and then that child is intensely curious about what men 
and women do together, what relationships they have.

<p>

I know a guy who has just entered jail, tragically,
because he grew up in a lesbian household.  He still loves his
mother and doesn't really blame her, but he said, &quot;You know,
as a boy in a lesbian environment where it was intensely anti-male&quot;
-- that's all he heard, this bitterness toward men -- he said
that he felt totally disenfranchised, began having sexual problems.
He eventually became a voyeur, and he is in on a peeping Tom
charge.  He was so curious about how normal people have sex. We
have other people that are cases like this.

<p>

One case will not a principle make, but this guy is a symptom, and it 
shows that without a dad in the house to set him straight, he really 
ran into a lot of problems.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  That is right.  There is a case in the Rhode Island 
court system right now.  This poor father called me, and he says, 
&quot;I need help.&quot;  Basically, his wife left him for a woman, 
and basically, there is a custody fight over the two girls, two young 
girls in the family.

<p>

Basically, the judge said to this young father, &quot;Look, I'm not 
concerned if your wife is a lesbian.  I want to find out who is the most
suitable parent to take custody over these children.&quot;  And
he describes how unstable his former wife's girlfriend is, and
to expose two pure young girls to a lesbian relationship -- it's
child abuse, and I can't believe the courts would even consider
giving custody to this woman.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  But if you get same-sex marriage, the courts are going 
to have no choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They'll have no options.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Because marriage is a privilege,
and it's a benefit, and the state really does set a big fence
around it to protect it.  So if the state thinks enough of that
relationship to give it all these special benefits and says this
is okay, you will have no defense against homosexuals saying,
&quot;We want children, too.  We're going to have them, and by
the way, we're going to teach them that homosexuality is okay
in the schools.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But the reason why we benefit [from] marriage is 
because marriages benefit society.  It is not a random social gift. 
People fare better, children fare better.

<p>

I want to thank my guests.  I want to encourage people to call
and write these different organizations for more about this. 
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> will show you some video clips 
highlighting the homosexual marriage and adoption issues. Don't go 
away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council></i>.

<p>

Robert Knight has appeared on many confrontational
television shows, and tonight we will share a couple of those
with you as Bob discussed some same-sex marriage and homosexual
adoption issues.  Let's take a look at clips from ABC's 
<i>Nightline</i> and <i>Oprah</i> as we bring you Homefront News.

<p>

</center>

<p>

[Segment from ABC <i>Nightline</i>, September 25, 1995, follows:]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Marriage is the uniting of the two sexes.
That's the definition.  So when homosexuals say, &quot;We want
the right to marry,&quot; they've already got it, but they don't
meet the requirements.  The requirements are --

<p>

MR. KOPPEL: Defined by whom?  Defined by whom?  Requirements as 
defined by whom?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Every major culture on the planet, all major religions. 
I mean, Ted, come on.  You're talking as if marriage hadn't existed, 
something we invented to oppress homosexuals, and that's nonsense.  
It is the building block.

<p>

MR. KOPPEL:  No, no, no.  What I am doing, Mr. Knight --
and forgive me; we should let our other guests have a chance to
get in here, too -- but what I am saying is that marriage -- you
refer to marriage as though it was some unchanging institution
that has not in any manner been modified over the years, and clearly,
it has.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, it has not been modified to the extent
that the homosexuals are asking, which is to eliminate an entire
gender from it.  It's the bringing together of the two sexes.
Once you don't do that, you leave an entire gender out, that
makes it something else entirely.  It's not the same psychological
dynamics, emotional dynamics.  Homosexuals do not do what mom
and dad do in the bedroom.  They don't provide children the role
models that mom and dad do.  It's an entirely different animal
and doesn't deserve the same benefits that society gives marriages.

<p>

[Segment from Oprah, January 26, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: -- and that is why kids ought to be in marriages, not in 
gay households.  They need mothers and fathers.  Okay?

<p>

I want to ask the viewers.  I want to ask the viewers, do they really 
think their mom could be replaced by two gay men; or their dad, their
father, by two women?  Sexuality is not a small thing.  Boys need
fathers.  Girls do, too, so they understand men.

<p>

GUEST: People need loving parents.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Love is great, okay?  Love is great, but sexuality is 
important.  There are two different, complementary
sexes.  You guys are pretending people are interchangeable and
there's no difference.

<p>

GUEST: There's no pretending anywhere.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  There are a lot of people who are screwed up with
their gender identity because they didn't bond with their fathers
or their mothers.

<p>

GUEST: The question here is we're talking about
protecting children.  Lesbian and gay families do exist, and the
question is, are we going to protect the children here?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, we should.

<p>

GUEST: Are we going to entitle the children to child support?

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  I will tell you this.  May I just
interrupt this?  I've done this show before.  I've been down this
road, and years ago we did this show and I was so moved by the
children.  If you ask the children, the children will tell you
they want to be in a family where people love them, whether they
are two men, two women, a woman and a man.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

If you ask the children, that's what the children will tell you. 
The children just want people -- want to be loved and nurtured and
guided.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Okay, if a child told you, &quot;I'd rather
have three or four parents than two,&quot; would you say, &quot;Oh,
that's okay.  The kid wants it, so it must be right&quot;?  Who
do we decide?  Aren't we adults?  Come on, parents know better
than children know what they need.

<p>

GUEST: Listen. Look at society --

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  I'm just saying, ask the children.  Ask the
children, if they have a choice between being in a home with a
man and a woman who did not care for them or a man and woman who
had all these problems, divorce and fighting, arguing, abuse and
all that --

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  You can't compare a worst-case scenario
with something that's totally different.  You could say, well,
is a kid better off in a burning house or over here in a safe
gay household?  I mean, you could invent thousands of scenarios
like that.  Let's not be absurd.  There's a mountain of evidence.

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  Robert, I wasn't trying to be absurd, you know.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, I'm sorry.  That's how it came across to me.
There are mountains of evidence that show that kids do best in
mom-and-dad families.  You can't deny it.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
presents insider information from those who attended the recent 1996 
National Education Summit.

<p>

Education affects the pro-family movement on many levels, and there is 
no shortage of controversy.  One recent example is the constant battling
over public school curriculum, which deletes key historical events
but somehow manages to teach children an amoral value system,
complete with bad advice on sex.  It seems clear that as a country
we can no longer ignore the fact that educational standards, measured
by students' knowledge and performance, have drastically plummeted.

<p>

The 1996 National Education Summit was supposed to address that
learning crisis.  The conference was organized by IBM CEO and
chairman Lou Gerstner, Jr., with the help of the governors and
other high-ranking businessmen.  But will their solutions for
a broken school system help your children?  Stay tuned to learn
more.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Cathy Cleaver, Family Research
Council's Director of Legal Policy.  Cathy has been involved heavily
in an issue that affects all families and all children, pornography.
Because of numerous court cases attacking the legal boundaries
around our children, the pornography industry has a lot of power
today, but there are some key legal battles in the works.  Stay
with us as Cathy fills us in on what the pornographers don't want
you to know about what goes on behind the headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Cathy, thank you so much for being with us today on Behind 
the Headlines.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It is my pleasure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There has been a lot of news out recently from Los 
Angeles and New York and now Philadelphia on pornography and the 
telecommunications bill, pornography on the Internet, and reading 
the news reports, is it fair to say that it would be smashing blow 
to the First Amendment if we see restrictions on the Internet?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  I love the way you put that, and that is really how 
to phrase this question.  The ACLU and others who are fighting to 
get this new computer pornography law restrained make just that point: 
If we don't have free-flowing pornography to every child in America, 
we have lost our valuable First Amendment freedoms.

<p>

That's ridiculous.  Most courts think that's ridiculous, and we are 
counting on that.  The Supreme Court, of course, has said we don't 
have to have that, that pornography is not a measure of our freedom; 
rather, it is a sort of low-level type of speech that we need to 
tolerate at some levels, but certainly we don't need to have our 
children tolerate it.

<p>

So I believe that the challenges that are going on across the country 
are just the same challenges we have always seen and that our side 
will be successful.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Just yesterday, you were in Philadelphia at the court 
case there.  Tell us a little bit about what's going on there and 
how it will affect parents.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: In February, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was 
signed into law by President Clinton. Part of that act included the 
Communications Decency Act, which is simply a law that says adults 
have no right to knowingly give pornography to children over computer 
systems.  Makes sense.

<p>

Well, the ACLU and other groups immediately filed a lawsuit saying
that this is going to ruin our cherished freedom of free speech,
and we have this drama played out in a federal court in Philadelphia.
I have attended every day of the hearing, and it has been quite
a show, with sex experts saying that children should see pornography,
that it's not harmful; other people saying that the Internet will
just cease to be if this restriction is in place.

<p>

The Department of Justice is defending the law, and they are doing a 
good job. I was pleased to see that they are vigorous in their defense
of the law, and I believe they believe in its constitutionality.
Certainly Janet Reno and the policy makers at Justice had some
trouble in 1994 with child pornography and weakening the statute,
and we don't see a replay of that yet.  Frankly, I don't think
they have the political capital to waste on another debacle like
that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of people may not remember what the
Clinton Administration did on that child porn case, where essentially
they tried to change the law to say that if a child who is being
molested appears to be participating in all of this, that somehow
they are at fault.  It is an astounding legal principle, isn't
it?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It was a terrible burden to put on the prosecution,
and I would say that it would really bring any child pornography
prosecution to a screeching halt.  It would never be prosecuted
under the types of burdens that the Justice Department at that
time was suggesting.  But that was turned around, public outrage,
and healthy public outrage and efforts from all groups, including
the Family Research Council.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We hear a lot from the American Civil Liberties Union 
that somehow, if we don't have pornography on the Internet, the 
Internet will cease to be, as though perhaps it were created, we must 
assume, for the purpose of transmitting hard core, obscene images. But 
what is the ACLU's history on pornography?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It is very radical. They lead the charge in trying to 
legalize child pornography, even hard core child pornography where a 
child is shown being raped. The ACLU believes that once a video or 
a magazine of this child's rape has been produced, it is a sacred 
text that must be protected by the First Amendment.

<p>

They are out of touch. We wouldn't want to live in an ACLU world. 
And, thankfully, our courts have not bought in to their arguments. 
But they keep trying, and they are trying again here, with the same 
sort of notion, that someone should be allowed to intentionally give 
a child pornography. And the ACLU, of course, also believes that 
children have a right to see pornography.

<p>

So they are leading the charge against the Communications Decency 
Act, along with People for the American Way, the American Library 
Association, and the cast of characters that we have seen time and 
time again who defend the pornographers and their right to make 
profits in selling this kind of material.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A typical comeback from the pornography industry
and the so-called First Amendment people is that it's the parents'
problem, it's the parents' responsibility.  How do you respond
to that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Well, I say time and again that no law
is designed to fill the role of a parent, and neither is this
law, nor has anyone suggested that this law is to substitute for
a parent.  Rather, parents are no match for an $8 billion to $10
billion a year pornography industry.

<p>

There is a role for government to play in protecting children or 
protecting anybody that is weaker in society from elements that are 
stronger in society. That's what our criminal laws are all about, 
and we have criminal laws that prevent an adult from exploiting a child 
through pornography. That is a consistent theme we have seen in 200 
years of laws. And that is the same theme we have with this law.

<p.

Parents certainly have a role, and there is no one taking that role away. 
But they need help.  They can't do it alone.  And the responsibility 
should always remain on the shoulders of that person who is dealing in
harmful material, just like in the instance of toxic waste or
something like that.  If you emit toxic waste in your business,
you have a responsibility to curb that.  Similarly, if you are
distributing pornography, you have a responsibility to keep it
from kids.

<p>

That is really a legal principle that we as a society
have embraced that has been fought by these civil liberty groups,
but we have embraced that, and the courts have upheld that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Let's say that a parent really does buy the ACLU line
and accepts the fact that they are supposed to be the sole defender
of their child.  Is it possible for a child to really block pornography
and obscenity from their home with the blocking technologies today?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Absolutely not.  We have seen many instances in
which parents have tried to employ this blocking technology, and
pornography has still reached their children.  Pornography that
is attached to an e-mail message, for instance, is not blocked
by the software.

<p>

During this hearing, very interesting testimony from SurfWatch, the 
leading software filtering company right now. I have nothing against 
SurfWatch or the filtering companies, and they will provide somewhat 
of a help to parents.  But they want to be a substitute for a law.

<p>

Yet, in the hearing, they admitted that they miss 800 pornographic sites 
per month. And they say, &quot;Well, that's not so bad.&quot;  Well, I 
think parents think that's bad. That's a lot of sites of material that
could just ruin a child's mental health, frankly.

<p.

So it is ridiculous to think that sort of technology can be a complete 
substitute for a law.  We are left with hoping that pornography 
distributors will, of their own, decide not to harm our children. 
History has not shown that that is a good assumption.

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A lot of people are not aware that, under American law, the 
way in which we have regulated communication is the way in which 
something is transmitted, so that you cannot send something threatening
through the mails, for example; you cannot sell pornography without
some kind of adult supervision; you have to have a restricted
access.  So we have really regulated transmission of information.

<p>

As we look at the Internet, a new way to transmit information,
are we seeing any new laws being made?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: With this new medium, all we're doing is importing laws 
that our country has embraced for decades.  There is no new legal theory 
at play here.  It's the same old principle that people who distribute
pornography cannot distribute it to children.

<p>

It is interesting, because every time a new technology develops, first 
of all, pornographers rush in and exploit that technology, sometimes 
drive it, I am sorry to say, drive its development.  And then, secondly, 
the porn defenders come in and say, &quot;Well, pornography law can't
apply in this technology.  Certainly videos are different than
magazines, and certainly pornography laws shouldn't apply to videos.&quot;
That's what we heard in the early 1980s, if you can believe it
or not.

<p>

Well, that argument failed, and we have seen that with
television, telephone, cable, and now we are seeing it with the
computer and with the Internet.  It's the same old song, and it's
really nothing new that this new computer porn law is doing. 
It's just relatively different because it's a different medium.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Taking a look at some of these different transmission
issues right now, there's a new law in California dealing with
a new way of distributing pornography, newsstands, magazine racks
right next to other newspaper boxes that actually sell hard core
pornography. What's your involvement in that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: I love this new law in California.  For all its troubles 
with pornography, California has come up with some good, innovative 
laws to protect communities and families.  One such new law is a law 
against pornographic news racks.  What we are seeing springing up in 
California are news racks right on the street, next to the regular news, 
with hard core pornography.  So any child with 25 cents can receive
that magazine.

<p>

Well, there's a new law now that says those news
racks that distribute hard core porn cannot exist unless they
are supervised 24 hours a day by an adult, or unless they are
accessible only by adult tokens.  That makes sense, because then
adults can get the material that they might have a right to get,
but certainly children cannot.

<p>

That is causing such a stir in California, and we are filing a brief 
in support of that law. We think that law is fully constitutional. And 
actually, the consequences of this lawsuit are really grave.  If we 
were to lose this one, then I would venture to say we will see 
pornographic news racks popping up all over the country.  So this is a 
crucial case for communities and families.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you, Cathy, so much for being with us today on 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: You're welcome.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
begins our inside scoop from those who attended the 1996 National 
Education Summit.  Are America's leaders serious about making positive 
changes in our children's education?  Stay tuned to find out.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Reading, writing, and arithmetic were once the core of 
education. Yet there are students across the United States today who 
actually graduate from high school lacking these basic skills.

<p>

Clinton's national education standards and Goals 2000 both promised to 
fill the gap and prepare students for life.  But questions among parents
and educators arose regarding these standards.  Were children
going to be better educated, well read, insightful, and intellectual?
Or will they merely be illiterate but politically correct?

<p>

Burdened with the cost of teaching basic skills to many entry-level 
workers, corporate America decided to get involved.  Lou Gerstner, Jr.,
CEO and chairman of IBM, spearheaded a movement to evaluate our
education system and began by organizing the 1996 National Education
Summit.  Governors, CEOs, and policy makers from across the country,
including President Clinton, attended the summit in an attempt
to agree on a newly improved standard.

<p>

This commitment to educational excellence, which was documented and 
signed by all the governors, seemed like a step in the right direction. 
But what about the voices of those who were visibly not in attendance, 
including conservative leaders with strong grass-roots appeal, private 
school representatives, and, most importantly, parents?

<p>

Developing a sound education policy may not seem controversial, but 
experts agree that parents, educators, and corporate America still have
a long way to go.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To tell us just how far we have to go to actually see 
improvement in our children's education, I am joined by Robert 
Morrison, Family Research Council's Special Assistant to the 
President, whose experience at the Department of Education well 
prepared him for his policy role today.

<p>

We also have Michelle Easton, president of the Virginia State Board 
of Education.  As a representative of Governor Allen, Michelle has
acted as a key pro-family advocate.

<p>

And also joining us is Carolee Adams, who attended the 1996 National 
Education Summit on <i>Straight Talk</i>'s behalf, our own special 
correspondent.

<p>

They are all here to talk to us today, and welcome to the show.

<p>

Michelle, let's start with you.  You were there with Governor Allen, 
and although IBM organized the event, was very powerful as a force, 
ostensibly, everybody said, well, this is really a governors' event. 
So you were there with the governor.  Why don't you tell us the good
news, if there was any.

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Well, there was some good news. Every governor was allowed 
to bring along one staff person and asked to bring one business person, 
and I was his staff person.

<p>

Governor Allen went to the meeting with some 
serious concerns about the policy summit statement that had been drafted, 
and he was very successful in persuading the other governors to make
some changes to that document, to make it more acceptable to those
of us who feel the Federal Government has almost no role in education;
that is for the states and localities to make decisions, and preferably
localities to the greatest extent possible.

<p>

He was given credit in the press for that. The <i>Washington Times</i> here, 
I have an article, the day after the summit:  &quot;Summit Policy Position 
Altered.&quot; And it says, &quot;Led by Governor Allen, they rewrote the 
policy statement to better reflect conservative views and reaffirm that
the states and not the Federal Government play the major role
in education.&quot;  So that was a success of the summit, that
all the governors voted for a statement, and the CEOs voted, also,
affirming that it is not the Federal Government where decisions
should be made about education; it is states and at the local
level.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, you are experienced in education.  A
long time back, I remember Ronald Reagan was going to get rid
of the Department of Education, very much affirming the position
that the states had a role by getting rid of the federal role.
Obviously, that did not happen.

<p>

Maybe you can tell us at the beginning of our conversation, in a 
nutshell, what the bad news was.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, unfortunately, the summit had an opportunity
to really make some gains.  They could have talked very seriously
about what we think is the most important reform in education:
letting parents choose safe and effective schools for their children.

<p>

Regrettably, those who led the summit pushed that pretty much
off the agenda and ruled it out of order.  We think they are incorrect
in that respect.  When parents can choose an excellent public,
private, religious, or home school, that in itself brings about
high achievement, high standards, and safe schools.

<p>

It is an irony, because business, including Lou Gerstner, Jr., the 
chairman of IBM, they continue to tell us what it is they seek from 
our education system, what they are hoping to get from our graduates. 
The schools that we champion, the schools that we highly respect and 
encourage, are the very schools that do the job that business says it 
wants done.

<p>

So we think as more corporate executives who weren't perhaps
at the summit or whose voices weren't heard at the summit, especially
as those who are small business and entrepreneurs, those who are
actually responsible for 90 percent of the new jobs and new goods
and services, when they find out how much bureaucracy is going
to be added on as a result of Goals 2000, as a result of certificates
of initial mastery, we think they are going to join into a national
movement to repeal Goals 2000, get rid of the Department of Education,
and not to impose national standards and a national curriculum
on America's communities.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, Carolee, we were blessed to have our own special 
correspondent in you there, and you are also a home schooler yourself, 
and you certainly represent a new wave.  And it is interesting. Family 
Research Council has done some polling that home schoolers are made up 
by a lot of interesting constituencies -- some Perot people, some 
independent-minded people, real popular with certain 1960s radicals 
and conservative pro-family Americans. Did you see your interest in 
other kinds of educational opportunities represented?

<p>

MS. ADAMS: No, unfortunately. I certainly am a proponent of children, 
students, being accountable for things that they learn in school. In 
my community we are spending $16,500 a year per child to educate 
children, so they should be accountable.

<p>

However, we have chosen to home school for a number of different reasons. 

<p>

In my interview with one of the governors, I said to him, I brought to 
him the situation, I said -- it was Governor Tommy Thompson -- and I 
said, &quot;I'll bring to you a situation of a little boy by the name of 
Tommy. And Tommy is a real wiggly Willie, and he doesn't want to sit
still in his seat, and he can't read, can't write.  He is incorrigible.
His teacher doesn't know what to do with him, so his momma pulls
him out of school.&quot;

<p>

Now, if his momma hadn't pulled him out of school, we wouldn't have 
had all the lights, the camera, and the action, because it's Tommy 
Edison that I'm talking about. And so I asked Governor Thompson, I 
said, &quot;What are you going to do with a little boy by the name of 
Tommy Edison?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, we'll give him a second 
test.&quot;

<p>

This is where I feel we have a sincere problem of understanding about
different learning styles, the necessity of parental involvement,
and that standards are important, technology is important, but
there is a lot more to it than that, and home schoolers would
be encouraged, from Governor Thompson's words, to participate
in the forum, and I know that they already are being tracked with
certain types of governmental programs, and that is regrettable.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Virginia has been very lucky to have Governor Allen
taking a real leadership.  There are all kinds of educational
reforms out there, charter schools.  From your perspective at
a state level, why is the state better able to have a role in
education, and how can the states better accommodate people like
Carolee?

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Well, the state is better that the Federal
Government simply, plainly, common sense, because it's closer
to the people.  But the local level is even better in terms of
making decisions and spending money.

<p>

In Virginia, our local school districts have a tremendous amount 
of autonomy.  Now, there is a fair amount of money that comes from 
the state level, and it varies by jurisdiction. The poorer 
jurisdictions get more state money than the more affluent ones. 

<p>

But in Virginia what we have been trying to do under the leadership 
of Governor Allen and how his State Board of Education -- he has 
appointed the majority of members of that now; it took a couple of 
years to get that - is to have the state's role be very limited but 
very useful.

<p>

The first thing we did is we decided we wanted to set up 
some academic standards in the core academic areas of English, science,
math, and history.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The pragmatic core subjects, not how do you feel about 
math but whether you can do it.

<p>

MS. EASTON: That's right. It took over a year. These are the standards
of learning here, and I have an 800 number if your listeners might
want to get a copy of them.  They are not perfect.  They are not
perfect by any means.  But you won't find in here anywhere how
do you feel about something.  It's what do you know, what do you
know.

<p>

This was our first step in trying to have the state set
a framework.  Now, we don't tell schools how to teach this.  We
don't tell them what books to use.  We don't tell them what methods
to use on the local level.  Now, these are public schools only.
In Virginia, mercifully, we leave the private schools alone pretty
much.

<p>

We set out the standards, then devise a set of state tests.
Did you learn this stuff?  The tests that our kids currently
take, for the most part, in the public schools are called norm-referenced
tests where they are measured against some mass of children, and
the results come out, and they are very confusing.  We want to
test kids, did you learn your history?  This is straightforward
history, kindergarten to 12th grade, a series of tests, and then
we want to publicize the results of those tests.

<p>

Then what happens? We want to let localities decide what to do.  We want 
to create a dynamic so there are rigorous academic standards, there are
good tests on them, a lot of information -- are you learning this
stuff?  Do you know your history?  Do you know your English? 
Do you know your science? -- and then let localities do what has
to be done.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to want to hear that 800 number really fast 
and come back.

<p>

MS. EASTON: Okay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Give us that 800 number.

<p>

MS. EASTON:  It is 1-800-292-3820.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Grab a paper and pencil.  You can write that again after
the break.  Please join us after the commercial break as we continue
to discuss educational change with our group of insiders.  Stay
tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am joined again by some experts who are actively involved 
in efforts to restructure education. We have again Robert Morrison, 
special assistant to Gary Bauer at the Family Research Council; Michelle 
Easton, president of the Virginia State Board of Education; and Carolee 
Adams, a home-school mother and long-time education activist and our own 
<i>Straight Talk</i> correspondent. Thank you again for being with us. 

<p>

When we left before, we were taking a look at the fact that Virginia -- 
you know, a lot of the reason why people are upset about standards
is the standards have not been very academic; they have been quite
philosophical:  you know, how do you feel, what do you think about?
Virginia has tried to do something different, and you have an
800 number where people can get a sample.  Give that again.

<p>

MS. EASTON: Yes. It is 1-800-292-3820, our new, rigorous, knowledge-based,
academic Virginia standards.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Bob, you are tracking what all 50 states are doing 
and were at the governors' convention, National Education Summit, 
looking at all 50 states.  How does what Virginia is doing, pragmatic 
work, compare to what is happening or what you fear might happen?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, we are very complimentary of Virginia. We 
definitely approve of what Governor Allen has done in resisting the 
idea of further federal encroachments in the education area. We 
applauded when Governor Allen stood up very tall and straight and 
said, &quot;No, we don't want to do this. We want to go back and bring 
authority back to where it belongs, to localities, to elected school 
boards, to parents.&quot; Governor Allen has been a champion in that 
regard.

<p>

In other states, we commended Governor Merrill in New Hampshire [who] 
has not applied for Goals 2000 funding; Governor Keating in Oklahoma; 
Governor Foster in Louisiana. Out in California, Governor Wilson is not
taking Goals 2000 funding.  So we think there should be a national
move to resist the kind of bureaucratization of education and
the dumbing down, frankly, that has come from Goals 2000.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But, Bob, I think one thing that is interesting is a
lot of people have this very false perception that the Federal
Government is paying for education; that if we get rid of the
Department of Education, we have just de-funded our schools.

<p>

But you have an interesting formula.  It is like a dollar's worth,
one dollar in every hundred?

<p>

MR. MORRISON: Yes, right. In Montana I think the figure came out 
to something like $1.50 per student that they would have gained if 
they took the Goals 2000 money. But the Goals 2000 money works in 
another way.  It's not very much and it doesn't help you a whole 
lot, but as it is often said, the worm doesn't have to be very big 
to conceal the hook.  So if you just bite, you're hooked.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How is that?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, because Goals 2000 is very, very directive in
terms of what you are going to do.  You are going to have to restructure
your schools.  You are going to have to have your programs approved
of by various people.  Right now they've got a new entity that
may be approving of your standards in history, math, science,
and English.

<p>

We have already seen the initial efforts nationally
out there for history standards.  The first two efforts have been
a disaster.  The first effort was so horrible for national history
standards that the U.S. Senate voted 99 to 1 to reject them.

<p>

So they went back to the drawing board, and they said, &quot;Okay,
we are, after all, historical revisionists.  We can revise.&quot;

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

So they took 15 months, they revised, and the second
set comes out, and they tell kids that in national history standards
we have to think that Goals 2000 is a good idea because these
standards endorse Goals 2000; we have to think that redesigning
the family, redefining the family, is a good idea because they
define the family in the history standards as a group from which
we receive love and support.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.

<p>

MR. MORRISON: Well, that's nice, but that's not all families do and 
it's not all they are.

<p>

They also make a bid for equalization of school
funding.  What has this got to do with U.S. history, we might
ask.  Nothing.  That's the whole point.  A lot of what is in there
has nothing to do with it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So what we find is that the Federal Government throws 
in maybe one dollar per child and then demands control over how you 
spend all the rest of your money.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  When I served in the U.S. Department of Education,
some of the career civil servants there, good folks that they
were, said, &quot;We couldn't be doing all these bonehead things,
Bob.  You got us all wrong. We only provide 6 percent of the funding,
just 6 cents out of the dollar.&quot;

<p>

So finally, after two weeks of orientation, I asked one of these fine 
folks, I said, &quot;Have you ever been to India?  Have you ever seen 
the mahouts in India? They are very small guys.  They only weigh about 
100 pounds. They only weigh about 6 percent of what the elephant weighs.
But they've got this stick, and when they jab the stick behind
the elephant's ear, the elephant goes the way they want him to.&quot;

<p>

And that is the problem we face.  Even when you have good reforms,
the Federal Government can make it impossible.  I just have one
example.  Ohio attempted to have an eighth grade reading requirement
for high school graduation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.

<p>

MR. MORRISON: And you would think that President Clinton would say, 
&quot;Good for you.  You're at least raising standards.&quot;  His 
Education Department sued the state of Ohio not because eighth grade was
too low but because it was too high.

<p>

MS. EATON:  And yet President Clinton came to the summit and gave a 
speech that could have been written by George Allen or Ronald Reagan, 
saying, &quot;Oh, we need to have tests; we need to have accountability; 
we need to hold children back when they don't perform.&quot;  It almost 
makes you feel that he says one thing and does another.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, imagine that.

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  You know, George Allen is one
of my favorite choices for Bob Dole's Vice President, so I'm on
your side.  However, I will say this.  Governor Allen said to
me that this was not a tops-down procedure; this is a bottoms-up
procedure.  But I have a great concern that that isn't going to
happen that way.

<p>

As an example, at the final press conference,
Lou Gerstner got up.  He is the chairman of IBM.  He said that
these transcripts and the certificates of mastery, everything
is going to be ready in one year's time.  Now, if a child doesn't
have that transcript or doesn't have that certificate, then they
can't get a job.

<p>

Also, I sensed that the child is also going to
be geared -- I mean, this is the third wave.  This is your new
industrial revolution becoming a technological revolution.

<p>

I was reading Alvin Toffler's book about the third wave, and he cited
that when we were moving from an agrarian society in the early
1800s over to an industrial society that covertly the children
were being trained to do things in a methodical way; that they
were able to get up on time, be at school on time, do this on
time, so that they could get a job and be there from 9 to 5.

<p>

So whatever we are going to be educating the children in school today
is going to have to fit.  This is what the CEOs want, particularly
those who are using modern technology to a large degree.  They
are going to have these kids come in well trained to use technological
equipment.

<p>

I heard one of the governors say or one of the CEOs
say, &quot;We have enough lawyers.  We have enough philosophers.&quot;
However, we can't overlook the fact that we still need lawyers
and we still need philosophers, and education is not to give them
a job.  Education is for the sake of education.

<p>

I am not a liberal thinker at all, but I think the entire summit lost out 
[in that] the systemic problems of education were not addressed, and I 
believe Governor Ridge wanted to.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We don't have a lot of time left, but maybe in one 
minute, Michelle, you could sum this up, because one thing that has 
not been addressed, this was really set up by corporate America for 
corporate America's goals, which are not necessarily the goals of a 
parent, that their child be well-rounded and well-read. Quickly, what 
would you see corporate America's goals were?

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Well, I think one reason the scope of the summit was so 
limited, and we didn't get into things like school choice and 
school-to-work and other issues like that, is when you have 50 
governors -- liberals, conservatives, Republicans,
Democrats -- to get them all to agree on something is very difficult.
So they focused very narrowly on standards and on more technology
in schools, and that was clearly what the CEOs wanted at this
particular meeting.  It was something they thought they could
get through, get everybody to vote for, and I think with some
of the changes that Governor Allen and some of the other conservatives
got in, where we keep stressing that there is not a federal role
in those things, it was successful in that sense.

<p>

But it is certainly true that there are many, many other issues that need 
to be addressed and discussed, and there are some CEOs that are more 
interested in training students for jobs, while others, big and small 
business, really are more interested in what many of us want, which is 
children with good basic skills and knowledge to come into the workplace
and then they will train them for the specific jobs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to find out if that's a brave new world
or a new horizon, and in a moment, when <i>Straight Talk</i> returns,
we'll hear about how our country's educational system is still
in need of an overhaul, and we'll find out more after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once again my guests, 
Robert Morrison, Michelle Easton, and Carolee Adams, all of whom 
attended the 1996 National Education Summit.

<p>

Now, Carolee, you were talking before the break about corporate
America, something which you are quite experienced in.  You were
a vice president for Citibank, I think, for 15 years and a manager
of people, and so I think you can appreciate the fact that you
would like your workers to read and write and use the computer.

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  Oh, absolutely.  There is no doubt.  I mean, a large
corporation like IBM, as an example, spends an exorbitant amount
of money on training, retraining, I mean teaching them how to
read and write, but also college-level students.  I know a friend
of mine who works for a major consumer goods -- it's food products
-- and he has his Ph.D. in food chemistry.  He said, &quot;We
assume that when they get out of college, they know nothing. 
We retrain them from the beginning.&quot;  So the corporations
have to cut back on their expenses.  They are very competitive.
The words that kept emanating out of the conference were, &quot;We
want to compete in a global marketplace.&quot;  So the children
have to come in well trained.

<p>

However, I am deeply concerned that this entire philosophy is not 
akin to the American spirit.  We have not heretofore before -- and I 
think Governor Hunt said this -- we have never done this before, and there 
is a book out called <i>The Coming Revolution in Education</i> by a Professor 
Boyce out of the University of Georgia, and he said that we haven't in 
the past created a school system to really fill jobs, and --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But is that the purpose of our school system?  I mean,
is that an appropriate purpose?  Schools make just workers?

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  No, that's not.  The purpose of the school is to educate
them.  A liberal education is supposed to give them an opportunity,
particularly your K-12 grades. They are there to experiment with
a lot of different things. Am I going to be a great mathematician,
a scientist, an artist, a wonderful mother?  I mean, that is something
that -- you know, they are dropping out home economics out of
a lot of courses in high school.  That's not required.  I have
a real problem with that, and so that is for colleges to do.

<p>

I was at a conference on the stock market on Wall Street, and there
was a gentleman, head of a major exchange, and he kept talking
about how the CEOs and the teachers were going to revamp the educational
system.  No, no, no.  It's parents and students [who] have to
be included, and I found that missing at the education summit.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Did you find that missing, as well, Bob, because
I know that is one of your primary concerns, that we are losing
the purpose of education.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, sure.  One of the things that -- we share this 
with business at all levels. Parents have a great stake in a quality 
education for their children. They also have a great economic stake in 
their children's education. You will find very few parents who are 
indifferent, don't care whether their children are able to get a job 
after they finish high school or college.

<p>

So there's a tremendous incentive for parents to get the best education 
for their kids. When parents can choose their children's schools, they 
routinely choose a school that will have high standards.  No parent wants 
[his child] to go to a school that does poorly and that kids are ill 
prepared, and the parents are very harsh when they find that that's what
the school has done.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What is the statistic?  I mean, certainly in Washington, 
D.C., the President and the Vice President both send their children to 
faith-based private institutions. You were telling me the other day 
that the majority of public school teachers' children were also in 
private schools.

<p>

MR. MORRISON: In many major city school systems, you will find 30, 40 
percent, 50 percent in some.  One of the debates with Keith Geiger, the
president of the National Education Association, when Bill Bennett
charged him and said that 50 percent of Chicago teachers had their
kids in private schools, and Geiger said, &quot;No, it's only
40 percent.&quot;

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Well, four out of ten.  The other teachers had their kids in suburban 
school districts.

<p>

Our point is that there are excellent public schools, excellent private, 
religious, and home schools.  Parents choose the best school they can 
get.

<p>

As to the summit and the failure that we saw in the 
summit, it is [that] the difficulty is the old New Hampshire phrase, 
&quot;You can't get there from here.&quot;  By taking over more and more
power to a national entity, they are describing a new board, a
new agency, a new creation that they want to build which will
have power to bully states that are good --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tell us about that.

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Many of the CEOs and many of the governors
were very supportive of a notion in the draft summit statement,
which we did manage to amend somewhat, which would have created
a new national organization -- just what we need -- to help states
share information about creating standards and reform, to compare
standards to each other, to European nations.

<p>

Governor Allen said, &quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute.  This makes me 
uncomfortable. It has the smell of a governmental thing.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Oh, no, no, no, it's not governmental, just all of us getting 
together.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;Why do we need it?  If you want Virginia's 
standards, get on the Internet, get to our web site.  There you've got 
them. Do you want to talk to us about how we did it?  Give us a 
call.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Oh, well, we need it to help us coordinate and do this more
effectively.&quot;

<p>

What he did manage to do was to give us all
respite on it, and they took the language out of the statement
that said this would happen instantly, and it was made into they'll
come back with a proposal in July to the governors.  But, I mean,
what a worrisome thing.  Just what we need, another national organization,
another bureaucracy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And what would it do?  I mean, what would it do that 
the Department of Education hasn't done badly?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Set the standards, set the tests, and decide
what happens to the kids or the schools or the administrators
if the kids don't pass the tests.

<p>

Now, some of the things that are going to happen if you don't get the 
certificate of initial mastery are you won't get a driver's license, 
you won't be able to get a job at 16 or at 18 or go to college.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So what would home schoolers do, for example?  Are they 
going to be --

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  They will conform or else.

<p>

MS. ADAMS: That is what Governor Thompson said. &quot;They will be 
encouraged.&quot; And so I think that that is --

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Government doesn't encourage.

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  Those were kind words.  I found people
speaking differently throughout my interviews.  This was going
to be, you know, bottoms up not a tops down.  I think it's tops
down.  I think we have to be honest about this.  For the most
part, not all states perhaps, but if you're going to have an IBM
which gets people from every one of our states, then those 50
states are going to have to -- somebody in Idaho is going to say,
&quot;Well, I want my child to work for IBM.&quot;  &quot;Well,
you don't participate in the program.&quot;  And they are going
to be encouraged to participate, home schoolers, private schools.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Which is a Soviet system.  I mean, let's be honest.
The Soviet system preprograms your path and you get there --

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  It is much more -- it is actually probably more
-- to be fair about it, they are talking openly.  Mark Tucker
of the National Center on Education and the Economy urged Hillary
and Bill Clinton to take a page from the German book. <i>Newsweek</i>
magazine says we're going to move toward a German system.

<p>

But <i>Newsweek</i>'s business section, in the same issue, April 8, 
talked about the German system and the &quot;German disease&quot; --
12 percent unemployment rate, higher than that youth unemployment
rate, great concern, skinhead phenomena, a little bit of the kind
of Pink Floyd record, just another brick in the wall.

<p>

MS. EATON: The problem with the European model is when you take a kid 
in tenth grade or ninth grade and you train him for one job and then
that company goes bust or he gets fired for some reason, and he
is not prepared to shift to another corporation, to another job.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think we have gone for a broad vision in America.

<p>

You get our last comment.

<p>
MS. ADAMS:  Oh.  I have encouraged the CEOs that I have met, if they're 
going to work hard to improve their bottom line, they do as much as they 
can to lobby congress to enable parents to parent once again, whether 
that be increased tax exemptions or some method of reducing the $484 
billion a year that we spend on education rather foolishly right now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have been privileged to have you all with us, and I hope 
people will call for your standards, or you can call the Family Research
Council.

<p>

When you return, <i>Straight Talk</i> will show you a clip from
Gary Bauer's appearance on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>. We will hear what
Gary has to say about education.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>.

<p>

Gary Bauer made an appearance on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> following
a decision made by a Queens, New York, school superintendent who
advocated teaching first graders that the homosexual lifestyle
was the moral equivalent of marriage.  Gary met some hard and
fast opponents when discussing this issue with Bob Beckel(?) and
Deborah Haffner(?), executive director of the Sex Information
and Education Council.

<p>

Let's hear what Gary has to say as <i>Straight Talk</i> presents 
Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

[Segment from CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>, December 8, 1992, follows:]

<p>

MR. BECKEL: -- Gary, two pages out of 430 or so in a recommended
curriculum.  You guys take this thing and the yahoos in Queens
take this thing, and they blow it into a big deal.  We talk about
it on television.  Isn't this really what -- let's talk about
it for what it is.  It's fodder for you guys to put in your direct
mail pieces to raise a lot of money to fund your right-wing causes
under the guise of pro-family, when really what you are is a reactionary
crowd who are cutting out a whole segment of society.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Bob, you know, you are in your usual emotionalism.  Nobody 
sent any direct mail to the Hispanic and black parents in the Queens
School District who are vehemently objecting to the idea that
their children ought to be taught that homosexuality is normal
and on a par with the heterosexual family.

<p>

If Deborah wants to read <i>Heather Has Two Mommies</i> to her children 
at home, that's her business.  But when she and Fernandez and others try 
to take our tax money to teach first graders that these are acceptable 
lifestyles, they are crossing a line that has nothing to do with direct 
mail.

<p>

You don't have a right to overrule parents when they feel uncomfortable
about teaching their children something.  The parents of Queens
have been very clear about this.  They don't want their 6- and
7-year-olds being taught about strange lifestyles.  They want
their kids to be taught reading, writing, the history of this
country.  If the schools in New York would do that, they would
turn out successful students.

<p>

MS. HAFFNER: Gary, what about --

<p>

MR. BAUER: I would love to see parents have a chance to vote
on that.

<p>

MR. BECKEL: The parents just decide everything in the school?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  On controversial social matters, parents ought
to have a right to tell how their tax dollars are going to be
used, not to vote on what history is going to be taught, not to
vote about what math is going to be taught, but when you get into
areas of values, parents have a right to have input.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with 
us to hear how you can get more information regarding these issues 
affecting you and your family.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. If you would like to receive more 
information about our organization, tonight's guests, or the topics 
discussed, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

Next week we will be discussing an issue not often seen in secular 
news coverage:  religious liberty and Christian persecution around the 
world.  We will hear how thousands of people are sacrificing their 
lives for a faith which they refuse to deny because their government 
demands it. Could America be headed in that direction?  We'll find out 
next week as we bring you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Thanks for watching.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
delves into an issue which Americans seem immune to, Christian 
persecution. Within the last year, many eyes have been truly opened 
through the people with whom we will speak tonight to the plight of 
Christians around the globe.

<p>

Last week a front-page <i>Washington Times</i> article
told of the tragic life of Robert Hussein.  In 1977 he had a brief
encounter with Christianity while in the United States, and he
decided to learn more by persistent Bible reading.  After much
thought, he accepted Christ as his personal savior.  Two years
ago, he publicly called himself a Christian and began witnessing
in his Islamic-run homeland.  Since then, Mr. Hussein has been
rejected by his family, including his two small children, arrested,
and threatened with death.  But his story is not unique, and you
will hear more about these tragedies and what is being done to
save these lives later in the show.

<p>

But, first, those of you watching the show are going to witness 
some Family Research Council history in the making.  Still under 
construction, a bit of FRC's future was taped just yesterday so 
<i>Straight Talk</i> viewers could get the inside scoop from Doug 
Werk, Vice President for Administration.

<p>

Thanks to the generosity of two Michigan families, FRC will go
a new direction later this year.  To learn more, let's go Behind
the Headlines.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doug, a lot of people may wonder why we are standing here 
in front of the National Museum of American Art.  But this is a very
exciting location for Family Research Council's future, and you
as the Vice President for Administration have really been working
on a dream to make something happen.  Could you tell us why we
are here at G and Eighth Street?

<p>

MR. WERK: 801 G Street, Kristi, and you are absolutely right.  It really 
is a dream come true for us at Family Research Council, because we are 
in need of a new home, and this is where our new home is going to be. We 
are going to be the primary tenants of a building that I am going
to tell you about in just a few minutes.

<p>

But I want to point out why this particular place is so important, this 
particular area. Not only is this National Museum of Art a beautiful 
edifice, but over here you have the Martin Luther King Library, which is
important to the entire Washington, D.C., area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's a very big research library.

<p>

MR. WERK: Oh, it is, and a lot is accomplished there for this city.

<p>

On the opposite corner, cater-cornered in back of this new construction 
here, will be the home of the Secret Service, where we will have 2,900 
Secret Service agents patrolling this area.

<p>

You see that large building down at the end of the block there with the 
glass walkover. That's a large office complex, and there is also a huge 
shopping center there.

<p>

This is an historic church right there with that dome on
it.  This is the Baptist church of downtown Washington, D.C.,
Calvary Baptist Church, which happens to house the Young Life
for the District of Columbia.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of our viewers are involved in Young Life, and that's 
an exciting organization.

<p>

MR. WERK:  It really is.  Chinatown, of course, is on the back
side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One block over and there you are.

<p>

MR. WERK: One block and there you are.

<p>

But I think, also, we should point out that these large cranes over 
here are preparing the hole for the new sports arena complex. And so, 
right around the corner and down the block will be the brand new sports 
arena.  And so it is an exciting area and an exciting time for us as we 
prepare for our new home.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Take us through that building. We've got six floors, Doug. 
Maybe you could just run through what is going to be located on each 
floor, more or less, and then we are going to get to go see the site a 
little bit closer up.

<p>

MR. WERK:  There are a couple of things that I want to point out.
First of all, we could only go up so high.  We could only build
a building as tall as the National Museum of Art.  And so that's
the reason for the six floors.

<p>

Also, we had to put a certain amount of space into a museum. So the 
bottom floor is going to be all public-access area. On the right-hand 
side as you enter the building from G Street, we will have a museum, we 
will have some history not only of our country but history of the Family 
Research Council. We will have a bookstore there where folks can come 
and pick up materials that we produce, as well as outside materials.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There are some exciting things for kids to do there,
too, with computers.

<p>

MR. WERK:  Absolutely.  We'll have some interactive computers that 
the kids and all family members can use.

<p>

The second floor will be where the administrative group will have its 
offices. On the third floor we will have our resource development 
group. The fourth floor will be our executive wing, where Gary Bauer
will be housed, and also, we will be able to have our board of
directors' meetings in a very large conference room.

<p>

The fifth floor is policy group, and a lot of the research and analysis
work will be done on the fifth floor. And the sixth floor is kind
of an area where --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To be announced.

<p>

MR. WERK: To be announced.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are here on the actual site right now with Andy 
Busey(?), who is our project superintendent kind of managing the site, 
and I know Doug has said great things about you. How long does a 
six-floor building like this -- we've got one level of parking -- how 
long does something like this normally take?

<p>

MR. BUSEY: Generally about a year.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: About a year. So our project -- how are we doing on our time
frame?

<p>

MR. BUSEY: Oh, we're doing pretty good.  We are going to
be right in there, a little bit less than that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, it's exciting.  Andy, thanks so much, and we're going 
to look forward to seeing the building.

<p>

MR. BUSEY: All right. Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So, Doug, we are on the fourth floor, which
is as high as they would like us to go and still be safe.

<p>

Well, Doug, we are standing in a building that has represented your
passion and your time and really a life's work, in a way.  What
are you most looking forward to?

<p>

MR. WERK: I think I am looking forward to the day when we can cut the 
ribbon and actually take possession and see what God has for us here in 
Washington to further the work that we do.  That's going to be exciting 
for me. It's going to be the culmination of a lot of earnest, hard 
effort, and I am excited to see the excitement of our people as we 
move over here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And for our friends and supporters from
across the country who are going to be seeing this segment, when
can they come to Washington and see this building that you have
been working on?

<p>

MR. WERK:  I am hopeful that we will move in sometime in the first 
two weeks of November, and shortly after that, we are going to have 
a ribbon-cutting for our staff and invited guests.  Then we are going to 
have an open house, and we are going to invite any and all that would 
want to see our home, not only in the District but from across the 
country. So that is going to be fun to do, probably before the end of 
the year and the winter sets in again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, when they do, I hope that our friends and supporters 
take the time to write to Doug Werk and let him know what a great job he 
has done. Thanks so much for being with us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

MR. WERK:  Thanks for having me, Kristi. Appreciate it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares with you a man who courageously raised his voice for those who 
have no voices of their own as they suffered persecution for their 
faith. Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Every week, millions of Americans put on their Sunday 
best and attend the church service of their choice, whether it be 
Catholic, Protestant, Episcopal, Baptist, or any other denomination. 
For the many Americans who walk up those church steps or sit in a 
synagogue pew or conduct weekly Bible studies in their homes, it can 
be easy to take for granted the freedom to worship that we share with 
our countrymen.

<p>

Only recently in cases such as school prayer have Americans even
questioned their religious liberty.  Yet, throughout the world,
millions of people daily risk their lives by taking a stand for
their belief in Jesus Christ.  Persecution, including torture,
slavery, exile, and death, tests the faith of those who refuse
to deny their savior, and their stories are told in headlines
from the <i>New York Times</i> to church bulletins.

<p>

In Sudan alone, 1.5 million people died at the hands of Islamic rulers, 
and at least 25,000 children, some as young as six years old, have 
been documented as being sold into slavery.  These outrageous acts of 
persecution sweep across the continents, from the Middle East to Thailand,
to Africa, to China.

<p>

Recently the Clinton Administration has been criticized for ignoring 
these atrocities while conducting business as usual with those who 
perform them.  In testimony before the House International Relations 
Subcommittee earlier this year, witnesses presented a cry for help 
for the lives of those suffering and for U.S. involvement in stopping 
the slaughter.

<p>

[Congressional testimony segment follows:]

<p>

WITNESS: So far, the U.S, Government has largely turned a deaf ear 
to this rising tide of terrorism and these human rights violations.

<p>

[End of congressional testimony segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yet, today, little has changed.  As government
officials mull over these proceedings and lives continue to be
lost, people of faith consider the words of the psalmist:  &quot;For
your sake, we face death all day long.  We are considered sheep
to be slaughtered.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As we just saw, and as shocking as it may seem, millions 
continue to lose their lives for their faith even today.  To share with 
us an expos&eacute; of these worldwide travesties is Michael Horowitz, a 
senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and director of the Project for 
Civil Justice Reform.  Welcome to the show.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Glad to be here. Where's your helmet, by the way?  You left 
it somewhere.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I left my helmet in the office.

<p>

Michael, I can't think of anyone better to talk to us about what is 
happening to people of faith around the world, and it is ironic that 
that job is distilled almost to one man.  How did you get involved 
with that?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, you have overstated it.  There's a
growing army of people.  It has in a way been easier for me to
do it, and really, to answer your question, I'm a Jew, and it
has been much easier for me, therefore, to blow the whistle, to
prod, to provoke, and to shame Christian leaders into taking the
kind of action they can.

<p>

You know, we have people, like the people
coming on your next segment, who have been the flickering candles
trying to keep this word alive.  My job has been to broadcast
the extraordinary work that they have done, and I have been one
of many in doing it.  But as a Jew, it has been easier in many
ways for me to do it, and for one particular reason.  Christians
around the world today have become the targets of choice for the
thug regimes around the world, the radical Muslim regimes, the
remnant Communist regimes.

<p>

What is going on with Christians, particularly
evangelicals and Catholics, is so similar to what happened with
Jews in Europe as Hitler came to power.  Three things.

<p>

<li>First, the bad guys could demonize them.  They're different. They 
provoke envy, and they're powerless.  And, also, they represent -- 
Christians do -- threats to these thug regimes.  Because of their 
faith, they're beyond the reach of bribes and threats, which is what
these regimes live on.

<p>

<li>Two, the elites -- governments -- don't care.  At our best, our 
government has been indifferent.  Typically, we have been hostile to 
the claims of Christians who have been persecuted.  You know, the
elites in Washington, when they think Christians, they think,
Oh, these are the persecutors.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that is how they are described time and time 
again.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Sure. And in Bosnia, a terrible story, just fills all of 
their predispositions.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  But the idea that Christians are the victims -- as 
indeed they are, more than any other group in the world, and by orders 
of magnitude, and reigns of terror against them are growing -- is so 
foreign to the way Washington insiders and elites and national media 
tend to think, that we have been hostile to them.

<p>

<li>And, finally, the Christian community has been silent, just as the 
Jewish community was as Hitler began to rise to power.  And I'm not 
going to let that happen as long as I have any voice within me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You said earlier that although the Christians are 
powerless, they are envied in these countries.  Why would they be 
envied?  If they're powerless, if they are merely trying to live 
moral, quiet lives, what provokes envy?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, of course, they are successful to the
extent they are given a chance to be.  They live lives of faith.
They are powerless against mob sentiment whipped up against them.
Within their communities, often you find charges of apostasy
being weighed in against good, popular, successful teachers, successful
businessmen.  It's easy to get your competitor out of business
if you wave and scream, call him a Christian, then get a bunch
of mobs to burn down his home.  And that's what is going on.

<p>

Governments around the world are spending millions to make tapes, 
scurrilous tapes, calling Christians evil, worse than that, and these 
tapes are circulating.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Not unlike the films the Nazi government
made.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Precisely, precisely.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Have you been surprised, after what we witnessed in the 
Holocaust -- and it has got to be the most documented event in history, 
the demonization of a race and a faith to the point that they could
justify that kind of mass murder.  But then we see today Christians
in the Sudan being crucified, murdered, sold into slavery.  Are
you surprised that this could happen again, it seems to me very
quickly?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Nothing surprises me on this Earth. When
good men and women remain silent, anything is possible.

<p>

Now, again, we don't have that kind of holocaust that the Jews 
experienced except, as you point out, in Sudan.  It's getting there. 
As Nina will say, as Mr. Jacobson will say, we've got as many as 
30,000 Christian children yanked from their homes by a radical 
Muslim regime and sold into slavery.  That's going on.  And yet 
here's Farrakhan going to the head of Sudan and calling himself a 
great ally and no voice raised against it.

<p>

Well, we've got to raise our voices.  And when we do, as we are now 
beginning to do, as the Christian community is beginning to do, people 
are listening. The <i>Washington Post</i> the other day had an 
extraordinary column entitled &quot;Christians Have Rights, Too.&quot; 
The writer, who is the deputy editor of the editorial page, said that 
we in the <i>Post</i>, in the media, are responsible for not taking 
seriously these kinds of claims, and he said that this was an important
movement.  He called it the most interesting foreign policy issue
of 1996, and he said if the Christian community organizes, it
will make foreign policy harder with Saudi Arabia, with China,
but, he said, lives will be saved. And I think we're going to
save some lives here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As a Jewish gentleman, you are correct, your voice rings 
even more resolutely when you speak on these things, and there has 
been a kind of quiet growth of a partnership of Jewish men and women 
of faith with Christian men and women of faith.  You look at the 
Judeo-Christian heritage. It's easy to understand why.  And yet that 
has not been common. Why do you think there has been that quiet 
gathering, and why you particularly?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, I think, in the wake of
the Holocaust, the Christian community has understood the price
that always gets paid, ultimately, when there is a kind of religious
bias that goes on.  But there is something else that has happened
that has been so interesting in this case.

<p>

As I began to write about the persecution of Christians, I would be 
greeted with silence from the Christian community, and I would say to 
some of the leaders of the Christian community, &quot;You know, if I 
had written about anti-Semitism going on, you would be overwhelming me 
with phone calls saying, 'How can we help?'&quot;  Because the 
campaign against Soviet anti-Semitism, one of the most successful human 
rights campaigns in recent history, would not have been possible without
the active commitment of the Christian community.  And so I said,
&quot;How can you be so powerful, so caring, so moral, so strong
in your voice when Jews have been involved, as they were in the
Soviet Union, and so silent when your own are at stake?&quot;

<p>

That question cannot really be answered, and I think it has been
one of the things that has moved leaders of the Christian community
to the kind of action they have taken.  Now we have people like
Jim Dobson, Gary.  Chuck Colson has been an extraordinary leader.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A powerful voice.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Richard Land of the Southern Baptists; they have begun 
raising their voices. And the National Association of Evangelicals 
issued an extraordinary statement of conscience on this subject.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to hear more about this in a second. 

<p>

Please join us after the commercial break as we share with you more 
courageous and tragic stories of those standing for their faith. Stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am joined by people who have witnessed the horrors of 
Christian persecution and are making efforts to save lives around the 
world. I welcome back Michael Horowitz, director of the Project for 
Civil Justice Reform; James Jacobson, president of Christian 
Solidarity International; and Nina Shea, director of Freedom House's 
Puebla Program on Religious Freedom.  Thank you for being with us, 
everyone.

<p>

We were just talking with Michael at the beginning about kind of the 
context in which we have found silence.  But you all certainly have not
been silent, and your voices are being heard more loudly.

<p>

Nina, let's start with you.  Your organization focuses on the kinds
of tangible persecution that occurs.  What have you all witnessed?

<p>

MS. SHEA: That is correct, Kristi.  We have been monitoring and
testifying in Congress, writing about persecution of Christians
in China, in Vietnam and Sudan.  We have sent missions to these
places.  China has one of the largest Christian movements in the
world today, rivaling our own, and they are the most persecuted
in the world in China. China has more Christians in prison than
any other country in the world, and we have cases, for example,
of one man who is an evangelical Protestant who is in prison now
for three years because he, quote, propagated the book of Genesis.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What does that mean?  Because you hear propagation
of the gospel and proselytizing.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  He was simply holding a Bible study session in his home. 
It's called the house church movement. They are underground. They are 
arrested and punished severely if they are caught.  So they are not 
allowed to have their churches.  They meet in their homes and read the 
Bible, they sign hymns.

<p>

Mike Horowitz is absolutely right in saying that
the West has been indifferent to the fate of these people.  Our
own Ambassador Sasser went to China this winter, in February.
I met with him a few days before he went, and he had never even
heard of the house church movement at the time that I met with
him.  That was a couple of days before he left.  Though he was
well briefed on other important human rights issues in China,
he had never heard of the house church movement and knew nothing;
he was totally ignorant about the fact that they are being persecuted.

<p>

We have another person in prison on our case list, in our database,
from China who was simply praying without authorization, was the
charge against him.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So what? They have to apply for a permit to pray?

<p>

MS. SHEA: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How can you pray with authorization?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  They have to register with a Communist, atheist-controlled 
organization in order to pray.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And then the penalty for that would be prison.
I prayed without the permit.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Prison.  Prison and hard labor. They are forced to work 
virtually as slaves in motorcycle factories, in brick factories, 
for 13 years, 20 years, indefinite sentences, because there is no 
due process in China.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to go to James and hear a little bit 
about the Sudan, but I wanted to touch first on -- it has to be 
frustrating, then, for you, with China, to have most favored nation 
status, to consistently get economic benefits while at the same time we
see huge human rights violations.

<p>

There was actually a cartoon -- I think it was in the <i>Washington 
Post</i> this week -- where it showed Bill Clinton straddling two boats. 
One said &quot;China's Economic Future&quot;; one said &quot;China's 
Human Rights Violations,&quot; and he was doing a little splits, 
trying to hold the two together.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  That's right.  Well, unless and until the Christian
churches raise their voices, human rights is always going to lose
out in the MFN debate, because the commercial interests are intense,
and they are lobbying, and the Christian voices are very weak
at this point.  We must start speaking out for our brethren who
are being persecuted in China and in Sudan and in Vietnam.  We
have a lot of influence in Vietnam, a lot of influence in Saudi
Arabia, where there is not a single Christian church allowed.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

MS. SHEA: Even our own -- and this is another example of insensitivity 
of the West -- even American citizens are not being defended by our 
government in their right to practice religious freedom.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, Saudi Arabia is an interesting example where the 
embassy recently said that they were going to fight the government to 
be sure that pornography was distributed in Saudi Arabia, which was 
against their faith, but they went ahead and shut down the on-base, 
on-embassy church because that was offensive.  An interesting kind of 
decision to make.

<p>

MS. SHEA: That is right, yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sudan, though, I know has been chilling a lot of people 
because prison and torture, these things are real and terrible, and we 
are hearing about crucifixions from Sudan.  What has your organization, 
James, found to be true?

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Yes.  Christians around the world need our help,
support, and prayers now more than ever.  We really welcome Mr.
Horowitz and his voice crying out in the wilderness, basically,
on this issue.

<p>

In Sudan, though, the horrors of radical Islam
are really magnified there like never before.  We have a situation
where the government of Sudan is controlled by this radical group
called the National Islamic Front, and anybody that doesn't convert
to their radical branch of Islam is basically -- they must convert
or die.  We have tremendous, incredible stories coming out of
Sudan.  My organization has spent a great deal of time there with
workers in the country doing everything we can to help alleviate
the situation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I have to think that those workers are in fear for their 
own lives while they are there.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: Absolutely.  They risk their own lives and livelihoods. 
A lot of our co-workers have families, and we have a lot of prayer 
before they go in.  We really emphasize that, prayer protection before
they go into these places.

<p>

But in Sudan we have a situation where, that we know of, about 1.5 
million people have been killed.  We have a situation where there 
are between 5 and 6 million refugees. My organization can confirm 
about 25,000 children that have been taken into slavery.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And when you say taken into slavery, there have been 
some recent articles about sex slaves, labor slaves.  What kind of 
slavery, if you could be, unfortunately, more graphic for our 
viewers?

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Yes.  I don't know how graphic I should be for this, 
but you can just imagine.  It is true. The young ladies are taken 
and used as sex slaves, concubines. The young men, they are used as 
things such as human blood banks for the army of the National Islamic 
Front.  Slave branding goes on. Every type of just horrible job, these 
slaves are given.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Mike, you were talking earlier about a lot of people
hear what is happening in Sudan and see some of the Islamic countries
being so brutal and are fearful of some of what that means in
terms of the impact of the Islamic faith.  But you had a point
that you wanted to make on that.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, I am so glad you raised it, because what is really 
going on here is an effort by crazy, radical thugs to hijack one of the 
great faiths of the world.  For much of its history, Islam was as 
welcoming of strangers as Judaism and Christianity; in some decades even
more so.  And so what you have are these radical guys using religion
to perpetrate murder and intolerance.  That is what is really
going on.

<p>

One of the most compelling things that has come out
of this effort that we have been making are the voices we have
heard from the moderate Muslims in these countries who are also
targets of death by these thugs, and they say to us, &quot;Thank
God you're raising it.  Create a constituency in America to protect
the weakest, to stand up to these thugs, and we will be protected.
Democracy will be preserved.&quot;

<p>

That is the case always. When thugs want to practice murder and 
death and kill democracy, what they do is pick a vulnerable 
religious community and make them scapegoats and torture them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is an interesting trend.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Stop that; you've stopped the thugs.  And
that is what the Muslims are telling us.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Nina, I know that you have seen these same kinds of things, 
this horrific abuse of faith to kill those who don't convert.  What are 
you seeing as you look worldwide?  What trends are moving your 
organization?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Well, what we are seeing is, in the aftermath of the
Cold War, Christian persecution coming to the fore, and it is
emerging in the remnant Communist countries.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why do you think that is?  Why the remnant Communist 
countries?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  They are terrified of Christian churches because they have
a transcendent truth.  They do not believe that the Communist
Party and the Communist ideology is their ultimate power.  And
they also resist corruption and bribery and uphold the dignity
of the individual, which is an anathema to Communist ideology.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So a democracy that might be based on faith -- you
know, &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident&quot; -- that
is threatening.

<p>

MS. SHEA: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we are going to have to hear more about this in a 
second.  I want to come back to that point. When <i>Straight Talk</i> 
returns, we will hear more about efforts to fight global Christian 
persecution and how you can become involved in helping save lives. 
Join us after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once again tonight's 
guests, who are battling for the lives of those standing for their 
religious faith around the world: Michael Horowitz, James Jacobson, 
and Nina Shea.  Welcome back to the show.

<p>

For people who are connoisseurs of news, which I
must say our viewers really are, when you are looking at the newspaper,
trouble spots come to mind.  I would say we would all agree that
Sudan would seem to be the most egregious example of what is going
on.  But what else?  Where else in the country should people be
watching?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Great swaths of the Middle East and Northern
Africa, in the Muslim world; for example, Algeria, Saudi Arabia,
Pakistan, even Egypt, Iraq, Iran.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Very powerful and in the news.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: I would only add here, it's not only the official 
government action.  Often you have, quote, friendly
governments like Pakistan, like Ethiopia, with which I am particularly
familiar, where the government is weak and appeases the radical
terrorists.  And when we are silent here, it means there is only
one squeaky wheel on that issue, and so the terrorists are given
rein.  So Egypt, Pakistan, and Ethiopia are three countries where
the presidents of the countries probably would abhor that kind
of thing and yet where the terror is phenomenal and growing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It has been interesting to see the Clinton Administration
commend the leaders of some of these very countries that seem
to be most appalling, and we are certainly seeing Bill Clinton
right now reach out particularly to China and Asia, and that seems --

<p>

MS. SHEA: That is right.  China and Vietnam are two big abusers
of religious freedom for Christians.

<p>

That brings up another point, which is the insensitivity of the 
administration in certain aspects regarding Christian persecution. 
For example, political asylum. Christians have a very difficult 
time getting political asylum in this country.  We know of a case 
of a Sudanese Christian whose employer was assassinated for his 
faith.  He was told by his bishop to leave the country to save his 
life.  He got here, and he has been in an immigration prison for the 
last three years awaiting deportation. His application was turned 
down because he could not define the doctrine of transubstantiation, 
a doctrine which Catholic priests study for a year in theology school, 
to the satisfaction of an immigration judge.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Think of this, Kristi.  This is a country founded as a 
haven for victims of religious persecution.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: And here we are turning, shutting the gates to Christian
victims of persecution.  You know, the administration has issued
guidelines saying that if somebody has, if a woman has a feminist
complaint, and they are often real, open the doors.  But I once
went to one of the leading immigration lawyers, told her about
a case of my Ethiopian friend whose has been hung upside down
for hours as pastor of the leading secret evangelical church,
had hot oil poured on his feet, had his feet lashed with steel
cables, was arrested after he returned to Ethiopia after years
of exile, told the immigration lawyer about it.  I said, &quot;Can
you get asylum for him?&quot;  She said, &quot;Can he pass through
the eye of a needle?&quot;  That is really what our government
is doing.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  In our organization, we are trying to
get the administration to do something even more basic than immigration
policy, and that is just to recognize that these things are going
on.  They ignore it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly. To acknowledge it.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Just to acknowledge it.  We want them to recognize
it and condemn it.

<p>

One of the activities that we have launched into is a national 
petition drive on Sudan.  We just want President
Clinton to speak out on behalf of these persecuted Christians
in Sudan.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You can hear the President talk about
opening the doors for asylum for homosexuals and opening the doors
for asylum possibly for women who face female circumcision, but
not for Christians being crucified.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: That is correct.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  A perfect example of that was at the Beijing Women's
Conference that the United Nations held last summer.  That conference
produced a 127-page document on abuses against women around the
world, and they were all sorts of abuses, everything from environmental
to financial abuses, and so forth, spousal abuse.

<p>

There was not a single mention of chattel slavery in that document. To 
me that would be absolutely the first thing I would put in there, is the
fact that Christian women and girls are being sold into slavery
for as little as $15, the price of two chickens, in Sudan.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And you would think that would be offensive.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: And the First Lady is so outspoken on children's rights 
and children's issues.  Why is she ignoring 25,000 children being enslaved 
in Sudan?

<p>

MS. SHEA: Exactly.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: It is beyond imagination, really.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  But, you know, one of the things -- I am
not even looking for the administration to recognize the problem;
I want the President to live up to promises that his administration
made as our movement first began and then reneged on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And there was pivotal meeting on that.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Yes. We had a great meeting that Nina hosted with 
Christian leaders from around the country. Jim was there.  Major 
Christian leaders of major churches with major ministries.  Gary Bauer 
was, of course, there.

<p>

After that movement, the President and the administration made 
two commitments:  one, that they would appoint an advisor to the 
President for religious persecution, with real power to
investigate and report; and, two, that he would make a speech
to the National Association of Evangelicals on the subject.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Two rather simple things.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Yes. After the president of the National Association was 
called into the Oval Office to speak with the President, who said, 
&quot;I'd like to do it,&quot; two weeks later, the NAE got a phone call 
from the White House saying, &quot;You know, we don't think the President
can do it.  There's not enough money in his budget to fly to your
convention in Minneapolis,&quot; said a White House official to
the NAE.

<p>

We want to hold the feet of the President to the fire.
You know, he could have been such a hero, even in political terms,
to the Christian community.  And yet the lobbyists from the State
Department, from Saudi Arabia, from the business-as-usual crowd
in China got to him.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Well, he would have been a hero if he had done it, and I 
would have happily participated in helping the President gain credit 
for doing the right thing. He is doing the wrong thing.  We need to
hold his feet to the fire.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes.  There was apparently money to fly to the sticks 
to throw a log in a ditch but not money to fly to talk about 
Christians being sold and murdered.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: To make matters worse, as Nina mentioned earlier, we have 
an ambassador to China who has never heard of the house church movement.
So not only do they not live up to promises, but they send an
ambassador there that has never heard of the house church movement
in China, which is amazing.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Richard Land, who is the director of the Christian 
Life Commission of the Southern Baptist Church, in congressional 
testimony, made a striking proposition which Chuck Colson has agreed 
to and many of us are thinking about, and that is, let's have a 
couple of million Christians write letters to the White House saying, 
&quot;Come home, Jim Sasser, to take a little seminar on the house 
church movement.&quot; There may be more evangelical Christians in 
China than there are in the United States today, all underground 
and persecuted.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems likely, doesn't it, Nina?

<p>

MS. SHEA: Yes.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: And let's keep him here until he passes a pop quiz and 
knows what is going on about it.  That would send such a neat signal
to all of the State Department wet-finger-in-the-air crowd.  Ignore
the fate of Christians at your peril, friend.

<p>

So I think we are going to look to do that.  I think we are also 
hoping to organize, and Nina is also going to host a meeting in May to 
see if we can organize a Christian persecution Sunday in this country --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Fascinating. Good idea.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: -- to have thousands of pulpits talking about this on 
some Sunday in September.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: On some Sunday in September. You know, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> viewers will have to get an update on that.

<p>

What can people do? I think it is clear that, number one, they could 
write the President. And as we near the end of our segment, what else 
could people do?  They could call you all.  Give your phone number. 
You have this card to talk about this.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: Right. Just give us a call. We have a simple 800 number. 
It is 1-800-323-CARE. That is 1-800-323-2273.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And what will you ask of them?

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Well, first of all, we'll put them on our
monthly newsletter mailing list.  They will get a free newsletter
every month that talks about religious oppression around the world,
what they can do about it.  We have a series of petition drives
each month that they can participate in.  We ask people to pray.
That is the most important thing, first of all, is to pray for
persecuted Christians around the world.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Nina, you have a phone number as well.  Give the phone 
number and tell us what will happen.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Yes.  Okay.  Our number is 202-296-5101,
and you can call collect, and we will put you on our mailing list
as well, and you will get an urgent action alert every time we
hear of a new case of a Christian either imprisoned or tortured
somewhere or someone who is dying in prison from pneumonia or
some disease, who is in a critical situation.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: I cannot begin to tell you what heroes these people are. 
They have been at it when nobody was listening.  That is the real test 
of a good person.  These are the people who go to heaven, the people
who do it without glory and keep it alive, and it is because of
their effort --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you hope will change, Mike?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, I think we want to make this country sensitive
to the fact that there is this persecution going on, because,
you know, the great human rights issue as we enter the 21st century
is religious persecution.  The great hope for the 21st century
for my children, so that it not be as bloody a century as the
20th century was, is that free men and women can worship God.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  If God is alive in the 21st
century, my kids are going to safe.  We weren't so safe in a century
in which God was said to be dead.  So we are really talking about
the freedom of all people, not only Christians, in the effort
to protect these Christians around the world who have become the
targets and the symbols of what freedom is all about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to thank all my guests and note we had hoped 
to have a pastor on who had suffered persecution and, unfortunately,
could not because he might have been tracked down by the Immigration
Service here and deported, even though he is here saving his very
life by that.

<p>

Thank you, my fine guests.  I hope you will call
or write.  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shows you how religious
liberty is being defended in the United States as we hear testimony
before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.

<p>

Cathy Cleaver, FRC's Director of Legal Policy,
testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last fall, supporting
an amendment which would prohibit discrimination against religious
expression.  Let's hear what Cathy has to say as <i>Straight 
Talk</i> presents Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

[Segment from Testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
October 25, 1995, follows:]

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: On behalf of Gary Bauer and the Family Research 
Council, I want to express our sincere appreciation for the 
opportunity to address this distinguished committee on the critical 
issue of religious liberty.  I also want to appreciate, Mr. Chairman, 
your having these hearings. We think they are vital.

<p>

The First Amendment is not internally inconsistent. The Establishment 
Clause was designed to prevent the State from coercing a religious 
belief.  The Free Exercise Clause was designed to prevent the State 
from interfering with the exercise of religious beliefs.  Thus, the 
religion clauses were designed to work hand in hand to promote 
government neutrality with regard to religion.

<p>

In the last several decades, however, the Supreme Court has wrongly 
interpreted the clauses to be antagonistic to each other.  The Court 
has created a false conflict between the religion clauses, which must 
be reconciled in each case, and the Establishment Clause prohibition 
has been the usual victor.

<p>

On October 20, this committee heard testimony from a distinguished
panel of experts who discussed the history of interpretation errors
in First Amendment religious clause jurisprudence and the efforts
to correct those errors by federal statutes.  I will not repeat
this testimony, nor will I refute the argument that nothing need
be done, for the acceptability of that position is increasing
waning.

<p>

I also won't discuss the issue of government-sponsored
or teacher-led prayer, and I think it doesn't serve this debate
to continue to debate that issue.  It is not the issue being promoted
or supported.  It is not being presented to this committee, and
it is not being supported by legal experts who favor an amendment
or a federal statute.  So I think it would do us all well to stop
arguing that; no one is arguing it in earnest.

<p>

I will attempt to explain our preference for a constitutional amendment 
rather than a federal statute and address certain specific concerns 
that have been raised in the public debate.

<p>

The Family Research Council supports an amendment to the Constitution 
clarifying the First Amendment's prohibition of discrimination against 
religious expression and against persons, groups, or organizations in 
access to government benefits or protections on account of the religious 
character or their speech or identity.

<p>

We do not favor changing the First Amendment in any way.  Rather, we 
support an amendment which would correct the Supreme Court's 
misinterpretation of the First Amendment.

<p>

For purposes of discussion this morning, I will center my comments
on the draft proposal garnering considerable support and presented
to this committee on October 20.  It is the proposal, the second
amendment that Senator Biden read earlier.

<p>

This language would, in effect, say to the government, do not 
discriminate against persons on account of their religious beliefs; 
and to the Supreme Court, do not construe this non-discriminatory 
treatment to be a government establishment of religion.

<p>

The fact that some civil liberty groups call this amendment extreme 
does not make it so. It is a negative mandate upon government: do 
not discriminate and do not misconstrue.  It bestows no new rights; 
it apportions no new responsibilities.

<p>

Some suggest that the Court is coming
around on its own, obviating the need for an amendment.  I would
say that the 5-4 decisions from the Supreme Court do nothing to
advance the notion that things are clear in this area; that we
have statements from Justice Souter saying that the government
need not be neutral toward religion; and other things that do
not suggest that we are through debating this issue.  The Religious
Liberty Amendment could be thought of as a religious amendment.

<p>

In closing, this principle of neutrality is not new; it is the
aim and result of our First Amendment's religion clauses, properly
understood.  A Religious Liberty Amendment could restore this
saving principle so that our First Amendment would not be used
to promote the empty state religion of secularism but to promote
true freedom and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment in truth,
to which every American is entitled.

<p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>.  I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> presents two incredible women who 
have committed themselves to making a difference.  Theirs is 
not a random sentiment but a focused love for those children 
who have suffered the most severe physical, emotional, and 
sexual abuse.

<p>

Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson founded 
Childhelp USA more than 20 years ago, and it has become the 
largest national nonprofit child abuse treatment and 
prevention organization.  We had the opportunity to visit 
the Alice C. Tyler Village of Childhelp East to see how 
children's lives are benefitting from Sara and Yvonne's life 
work and the work of Childhelp staff and volunteers from 
across America.  You won't want to miss seeing the 270-acre 
Virginia facility that houses children ranging from 2 years 
old to 12 years old. 

<p>

Like the more than 3 million other children who 
endure abuse each year, these children long for healing, 
both physically and emotionally.  Tonight's show will help 
you understand why Childhelp USA serves as a lifeline to 
suffering children across our nation. 

<p>

In addition to the staff of Childhelp USA, the 
volunteers provide a crucial aspect in the healing of abused 
children, from organizing fund-raising events to purchasing 
a child's birthday gift.  I had the opportunity to talk to 
Connie Olsen, a vice president of the Childhelp USA Board of 
Directors, Chairman of the Alice C. Tyler Village of 
Childhelp East, and wife of someone close to us here at 
Family Research Council, Phil Olsen, Vice President of 
Resource Development. 

<p>

Connie's Childhelp involvement began in California 
and continues here on the East Coast and nationwide.  So let 
us now bring you an inspirational story not often heard in 
the broadcast or print news coverage as we take you Behind 
the Headlines.

<p>

</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Connie, you're a national board 
member with Childhelp.  There are a lot of good 
organizations.  This is certainly a phenomenal one. 
But why this one?  Why did you choose it? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I graduated from social work from 
Utah State University, and when I had children I stayed 
home, and when my youngest one was 4 years old, I started 
looking for something outside the home, a charity to get 
involved in, and someone approached me and asked if I wanted 
to be a part of a chapter in Orange County, California, to 
raise funds for an organization called Childhelp USA for 
battered and abused children.

<p>

So I did a little bit of research, found out what 
they did, what they were about, and thought, This is for me. 
This sounds great.  So I took a tour of the Village and 
joined the chapter.  That was in 1981. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So as a person who had not been 
involved full time in working with abused children, what 
impressed you about Childhelp?

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I think the thing that impressed me 
the most was the dedication of the volunteers, as well as, 
when I took a tour of the Village, the dedication of the 
childcare workers that worked with the children.  I could 
see that they were really there not because they were 
burdened by what has happened to these children but because 
they really felt there was hope for them, and I was so 
impressed with the process that they used with the children 
to try to heal them.  That is what really impressed me. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As a board member, what are your 
goals for Childhelp? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  The goals that I have as a board 
member are to try to help raise the funds to do the 
necessary treatment that is necessary for the children, from 
the art therapy to the animal therapy to excursions for the 
children, to anything that is needed to help them build 
their self-esteem, get a good education. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You have gotten to see some really 
troubled kids come into this program.  I mean, how would you 
describe the lives that you have seen so that people can 
understand the kind of trauma we are talking about? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  Well, as I think you have probably 
been told, the children that we get at the Village out here, 
their last resort is a psychiatric ward.  So the average age 
of our children right now is age 5 and 6.  They are really 
young.  We have children that have just finished their last 
dose of chemotherapy.  We have children that are 
handicapped. 

<p>

You look at these cute little beings, and you just 
look at the trauma that they have been through already, and 
they are only 5 and 6 years old.  It just touches your heart 
and makes you feel so good.  Even if it is as a volunteer, 
there are just certain things that you can do, whether or 
not to go to a toy store and get different donations for the 
therapy that they have in art or whatever it might be.  But 
the cases are severely abused. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What makes the biggest difference in 
the lives of these kids? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I think it is the fact that they 
realize that when they come here that they are not going to 
fail, and the staff knows that they are not going to fail, 
that they are going to work with them until they are 
successful, and they don't accept failure.  And I think that 
that is probably, for many of these children, the first time 
that they have ever gotten that feeling from an adult. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Is there any special child that 
comes to mind that you labor for here at Childhelp USA? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  When I lived in California, I was a 
special friend to a little 4-year-old girl.  One of the 
other reasons I got involved with Childhelp was that I could 
involve my children, too, in the process.  And so we had 
this little 4-year-old girl who was our special friend, and 
we were able to take her on different excursions away from 
the Village.  So even now, after -- that was in 1984, and 
even now, I think about that little girl and -- she had been 
sexually abused -- and the things that she had gone through. 

<p>

Even as a volunteer, you get tired, and you are 
knocking on doors, and you get people slamming the door in 
your face sometimes, and you are just a volunteer.  But when 
you think back at the children and why you are there, I 
think that is the special thing in your heart that keeps you 
going.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What one thing would you like people 
to know about Childhelp USA?  This is the first time maybe 
they have even heard of it.

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I think the most important thing is 
that they really care for children, and they sacrifice and 
do anything that they can do to really make that child feel 
better about themselves, learn forgiveness, and understand 
what happened to them the best way that they can.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Connie, thank you so much for being 
with us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  Thank you for asking me.  This was 
great.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shares with you two women who are dedicated 
to the prevention, treatment, and research of child abuse.
Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I had the opportunity to visit a 
wonderful facility where abused children find a home and a 
safe haven, and I also had the chance to meet with two women 
who made it all possible for these abused children to 
receive healing. 

<p>

Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson were 
introduced to the critical need for such an organization 
more than 25 years ago, and <i>Straight Talk</i> now takes 
you on a visit to the East Coast Childhelp USA Village. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA: Childhelp is one of the leading 
organizations fighting child abuse across America.  We deal 
in research, prevention, treatment, and we are trying to 
make a difference in this world and turn these children that 
have been abused into wonderful citizens where they will not 
continue that abuse, that cycle, and we are making great 
headway.

<p>

We are very thrilled that so many people in this 
country now are aware of child abuse, because when we 
started our efforts in that direction, very few people knew 
about it, nor were they really sure that it was happening.  
And so the laws have changed, the issues are at hand, people 
know exactly where to go most of the time for help.  We have 
the National Child Abuse Hot Line, 1-800-4-ACHILD, and 
people can call there for help, whether an adult or a child 
in distress. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, you say your goal is to stop 
the cycle of abuse.  So what do you mean by that?  I mean, 
these children come in and they are injured.  What kind of 
cycle would go on? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, we try to turn that child 
around.  The first thing you do is deal with their self-
esteem and build their potential where they know that they 
are a human being that is loved.  They have been told so 
frequently that they're a bad kid.  They're the ones taken 
out of the home, and so they feel that they're the ones that 
have done something wrong.  You have to assure them that 
they are a loved individual that can give back to this 
world.  And once you deal with them in therapy and in 
treatment and give them what they need to become whole 
again, you can turn a child around.  In fact, it is easier 
to turn a child around than it is an adult sometimes; in 
fact, most of the time.  They are like little sponges that 
take to heart the love and the care. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Their self-esteem is just rock-bottom 
when they arrive, and we try to make them feel good 
about themselves, and whatever is their interest, we try to 
work with them and build that, whether it is art or animals 
or whatever; it all plays a part of their self-esteem. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, people need to understand we 
are not talking about children who are having trouble 
reading.  Childhelp deals with a special kind of child.  
What kind of child would be involved in the program? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, these are the most difficult 
cases, children that really can't fit into an ordinary 
foster home, as an example.  In fact, many of them have had 
failed placements, as they call them.  They are like rubber 
balls going from foster home to foster homes because the 
foster homes are not always trained to care for these 
children.  They are not therapists, and these are children 
that are hard-core cases that need to be dealt with in the 
milieu that we have at our villages of Childhelp. 

<p>

The staff is tremendous in these villages.  They 
have to have a lot of care.  They have to have a great deal 
of patience, and they do wonderful work in turning these 
children around, and these are, as you say, not ordinary, 
just the ordinary child-abuse cases, so to speak; these are 
children that really come from mental hospitals quite 
frequently because of their emotional impact or, if they did 
not go to the villages, would end up in a hospital such as 
that.  So they definitely are hard core. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You know, also, a great part of 
the healing is love, and the staff really have a lot of love 
in their heart for these children, and we have had children 
who have arrived and they couldn't walk, they couldn't talk, 
and it's wonderful to see the staff work with these children 
and get them to walk, and maybe they are 2 and 3 years old 
and they're still in diapers.  But it's wonderful the love 
that they give these children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  These are children that have been 
molested, been abused, been beaten, been severely neglected 
and are generally underdeveloped on a multitude of levels? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  There is no question about that. 
There are so many different -- we will say this about every 
child that comes to the Village.  They are all emotionally 
battered, emotionally disturbed.  You would have to be to 
live through what they have been.  But every child is an 
individual.  They have their individual problems, and that 
is why each one has a specific program for them that is 
dealt with in how to deal with the child. 

<p>

We were at a staff meeting this morning looking on 
to see how that twice a day they have these meetings to 
determine how that child is doing and progressing and 
changing the modality of how they're being with that child 
if that child is not responding. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  They work with them as an 
individual.  It is wonderful. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  They say that if you even attempt 
fund-raising broadly, that people cannot connect with that, 
but for people who are involved in helping others, that they 
have to do it specifically; that it is better to have 
someone support a specific child, better to have someone 
work for a specific goal.  Is there a child in your mind, or 
one or two children that you think of when you go out to try 
to make it happen, to try to bring in money, to try to work 
it?  Tell me about the children in your minds that you're 
thinking, This is a hard day, but today I'm doing it for 
this child. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  I think that when you break down a 
case, that is always the best, to think of one specific 
child, as you said.  There are 3.1 million cases of child 
abuse that are reported, but for every one reported, there 
are three to four that go unreported.  But when you bring it 
down to focus on one child's problem, you and I can relate 
to that. 

<p>

There are many favorite stories that Yvonne and I 
have.  One little boy had been locked in a closet all his 
life, and he had come to our Village, and we really raised 
him.  This is the Village on the West Coast.  We cared about 
him very, very much, because we had watched him develop from 
a child that could not speak and was so withdrawn.  He had a 
little limp.   

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  He didn't develop right. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  His foot turned in because of the 
fact that he had been locked in that closet for so long. 

<p>

But we saw him through actually the time he was 12 
years old, and he was adopted by a minister and his wife.  
And so when we followed his case, to know that he could turn 
out to be even a human being, it was wonderful to see. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  With this same little boy, 
remember, we always have a Christmas program every year, and 
the children put on the play, and he was one of the first 
children at our Village on the West Coast.  We were all 
there together, and we had a couple of people who sing on 
the Lawrence Welk Show come and sing with the children, 
Guy(?) and Rolna(?). 

<p>

They were playing the guitar and singing, and all 
of us, we were baking cookies and singing Christmas carols 
and everything, and this particular little boy went up and 
looked at the guitar and looked up in their faces.  He had 
never heard music before.  And just a simple thing like 
that --  

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  He didn't know where it was coming 
from. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  He didn't know where it was coming 
from, but he had never heard it before, and then he loved 
it.  He thought music was the greatest. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We also had two children that were 
brother and sister that were raised with a group of dogs, 
and they really acted like dogs.  They would bite, they 
would bark.  Our staff had to deal with them on a one-to-one 
basis for a long time and really teach those children 
everything, how to go to the bathroom, how to eat correctly, 
and they were really something when they came to that 
Village.  We saw them shortly after that, and to see them 
just a few months later as an angel in the Christmas 
program --

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Again! 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  -- it really rewards us, because we 
do work very, very hard every day to bring in the money to 
keep our facilities going, and that is not an easy task. 

<p>

Sometimes when you get so tired, you think, well, 
maybe we should sit back and let someone else do it.  But we 
realize that our hearts are so in it, and we are so 
dedicated, that somehow we can tell the stories first hand, 
what is happening. 

<p>

The reward is to go to the Village, like we are 
here today, and see what is going on with the children and 
know that they are cared for and they are being turned 
around. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing 
child abuse.  Let's hear how Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime 
Fedderson began their efforts to heal broken lives and 
hearts of children.

<p>

You were actresses. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And somehow you got invited to go 
overseas on a trip to look at international children.  How 
did that happen? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Well, we were actresses in the 
1950s and 1960s, and they interviewed like 500 actresses to 
go overseas to entertain the servicemen, and we were the two 
selected, and they didn't even know we knew each other.  So 
it was meant to be, for sure.  But we went overseas in 1959, 
in October, and we went through one of the worst typhoons in 
the history of Tokyo. 

<p>

We were very young, and we took our little 
dictionaries with us, and we went out to see some of the 
area that had been hit so severely, and when we did, we 
found 11 little children huddled together on the street 
trying to keep warm, and their little hands were cracked and 
bleeding. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  It was so cold.  It was horrible, the sight. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, it was so sad. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  They grabbed us and tried to get under our coats --

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  They got under our coats. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  -- to keep warm.  It was really a 
tragedy that we had never seen. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  That is right.  We kept saying, 
"Do you have a <i>mama san</i>, do you have a <i>papa san</i>?" 
And they would say, "No, no," and we learned that these children 
were orphans, and they were Amerasians; they were American-
Japanese children, and they didn't have a home.  And so, 
through our military connections, we were able to place them 
in a home with a wonderful Japanese lady who had already 
taken 10 others off the streets in her home. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And when you went home, you raised 
money to help support those children? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Yes.  Well, before we left, we were 
<i>mama sans</i> of 21 children instantaneously.   

<p>

But then they started leaving children on the 
doorstep and up the block with notes pinned on them, "For 
the orphanage of mixed blood."  And so it ended up, before 
we came back to the States, we had over 100 children 
completely entrusted in our care, and that is when we came 
back to the States and began International Orphans, Inc., 
and from there we built onto that orphanage and built three 
other orphanages in Japan.  So we had four orphanages in 
Japan before Congress asked if we would do the same thing in 
Vietnam.  And so we went into Vietnam and built five 
orphanages, a hospital for orphans, and a school. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  So that is what we did overseas, 
and our work was kind of completed over there, and then 
Nancy Reagan said, "You know what?  You're looking for a new 
project here in America.  Why don't you look into child 
abuse?"  This was about 25 years ago, and we really hadn't 
read much about it at that time. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We thought she got it wrong. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  So, anyway, we got a small grant 
from Sacramento.  We looked into the problem, and of course, 
we learned that it was the number one killer of infants at 
that time.  Can you believe that, 25 years ago? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  But, you know, before that, we 
organized a Vietnam baby lift and brought the children over 
to this country.  We did not care for those specific 
children in an orphanage site, but each one of those were 
adopted the moment that we took them off the plane.  It was 
then that we went into the child abuse arena and ever since 
have been in that. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And we are standing now at the site 
of what is going to be definitely the premier child abuse 
treatment center in the United States, probably the world.  
I mean, what do you think about in a moment like this? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Well, I think at one time in our 
life we thought we were going to be actresses and one day 
get married and have children, which we did.  But at the 
time when we found these little children on the streets, we 
thought we were just going to help them and that this was 
why we were selected to go over there, to help these 
precious little ones through the storm and find a home for 
them.  We didn't dream at that particular time that it would 
unfold like it has, and now we are one of the leading 
organizations to help abused and neglected children here in 
America. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  At that time we had no idea that God 
had planned this for our mission in our life, and we are so 
glad that He did, because it means that our life has been 
fulfilled in a glorious way to help these children become 
whole again. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You both are mothers, but in a way 
you probably feel like mothers to a large family. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Oh, absolutely.  And we even tried 
to keep up with the children, the 11 that we found on the 
streets in Japan that caused us to start this whole thing, 
and I guess we are grandmothers and maybe great-grandmothers 
by now with those children. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  It is true. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Because we started so long ago, 37 
years ago.  But it is wonderful to see them turn out well 
and to come back and say that it made a difference in their 
life. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, you all have been friends for a 
long time. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Almost 40 years. 

<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So how would you describe, each of 
you, the thing that your friend brings to this special task, 
because you know each other better than probably almost 
anyone.  This is a very special task.  What special skills 
-- you know, describe each other.  What are the special 
skills you each bring? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Well, I think we both have the 
heart for children and the love for children. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, Yvonne deals with the 
volunteers a great deal. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Yes, I work a lot with the 
volunteers. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And she has a lot of patience, and 
she deals with them very well.  I do more the business end 
of it.  But she really knows how to handle those chapters 
and do well with them. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  We have a lot of wonderful 
volunteers.  We have chapters on the West Coast, the East 
Coast, down south, up north, and they work very hard for the 
children, and they are special friends to the children, and 
that means an awful lot.  They pay for their child's 
birthday party, and then they contact them all year long, 
and they have their picture.  But it is very nice for the 
volunteer and also for the child that that child has a 
special friend besides the staff that they see every day. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is really important for the 
children, isn't it, giving them other kinds of connections? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right, because sometimes they do 
not have parents involved.  Sometimes they do, but sometimes 
they don't.  So that's their very special person in their 
life.  And when they put on a program, like at Christmas, 
they always look for their special friend, because it's like 
having a parent out there watching them.  So it means a lot. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  In fact, we have had children come 
back to the village at times to tell us and thank us for 
their time, but to tell us about their reflection of those 
years at the Village.  And one the things they recall most 
is about their special friend and that someone was not 
really paid to look after them but wanted to do that and 
cared about them and reached out to them.  So it made a big 
difference in their life. 

<p>

Some of the things that we say to children that 
you think really didn't make a dent and you're not getting 
to them, later in their life, they recall that and will tell 
you that it really did and that they appreciate the time and 
effort and the care that you gave them.  And so that was 
wonderful for us, to be able to see our graduates, so to 
speak, come back and let us know what it meant in their 
life. 

<p>

This one particular little girl I am thinking 
about had a scrapbook in her arms, and she sat down and went 
over the pictures with us, and she said, "These were the 
best years of my life."  And it really did something to us, 
because if those were the best years of her life, then we 
had accomplished something. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Where all are there Childhelp 
organizations and centers? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We have a village on each coast, 
east and west, and then we have an advocacy center, a sexual 
abuse advocacy center, in Knoxville, Tennessee, and one that 
was opened in Manhattan, New York, in conjunction with 
Cornell University, and then we have foster homes and group 
homes.  We have survivor programs and, of course, one of the 
main programs is our National Child Abuse Hot Line. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Amazing.  How many calls do you get 
a year? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We have reached the capacity of 
300,000 a year.  It's more like between 150,000 to 200,000. 
That was the year that we had <i>Scared Silent</i> with Oprah 
Winfrey, and it was shown at the same time on all three 
networks, and so our phones really went bonkers.  But we are 
hoping to be able to answer more and more calls as we 
expand.

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And as we're on TV more, like this 
show, it really helps, because people hear the number and 
they use the number.  They call.  And we hope that people 
will if they need help. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
continue our discussion with those who are fighting for 
America's abused children.  Join us after this break. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. We are sharing with you 
my visit to Childhelp USA East Coast Village and my 
discussion with Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson, the 
founders of Childhelp. 
	Ironically, in a way, you all both were on the 
<i>Ozzie and Harriet Show</i>, which is the program that people 
often sort of derisively say, "Well, family values people 
want to recreate Ozzie and Harriet.  And yet we have seen 
since those days a rise in child abuse numbers and a 
breakdown in the family that has been unprecedented.  What 
is different today than was true of the time when you all 
were both really television stars? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Our American values. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right, the morals. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Our values have broken down.  The 
dysfunctional families that you're seeing today.  People are 
not taking time with their children to teach them the right 
pathway in life.  And so we notice a big difference, and we 
think that's why we are having so many cases of our children 
not being cared for, the gangs. 

<p>

You know, when you treat a problem like child 
abuse, you're covering more territory than just that; you 
are really counteracting a lot of social ills all the way 
through the pathway, because you are dealing with juvenile 
delinquency up to the hard-core criminal, because it has 
been proven that the largest percentage of those that are 
incarcerated have been abused as children. 

<p>

So until we change the other spectrum, the other 
funnel, get the money to the child's issue, we are not going 
to see a change.  We have to get to that child to make the 
difference for our future. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Think of how the movies have 
changed and think of how TV has changed.  I know since we 
were in the movies in the 1950s and the 1960s, they are more 
violent, and the sex that is shown, and everything has 
changed.  It influences the children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There are statistics that would say 
that one in three girls and one in five boys will be 
molested.  Do you believe that? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Oh, we definitely believe that.  In 
fact, I think that we heard of some new statistics that have 
just come out that are even larger than those figures.  I 
don't think that America knows yet what we're doing to our 
children.  We have to wake up.  And, yes, it is wonderful 
that we are more aware of what's going on than we did, say, 
10 years ago, or, as you say, when we were in the movie 
industry.   

<p>

But America still has to wake up and really band 
together to make that difference.  And if we don't, then 
we're going to lose America, a lot more than just our 
children.  That's what counts. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You know, when we got involved in 
this 25 years ago, it was kind of kicked under the rug.  It 
was around, child abuse, but we were the first organization 
to do a television special, to make people aware of the 
problem.  And I think people are more aware.  We have 
changed our laws, which we need to still change more, but 
because of that, they are reporting more, and so we are able 
to do something about it, and that is very important. 

<p>

We worked very hard to get to the young children. 
As you know, our ages are from 2 to 12, and we feel that the 
younger we can get them, the sooner that we can turn those 
children around, because the older they get, the more set in 
their ways and the more abuse they have had, so it is harder 
to turn those little lives around. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Help people understand.  When they 
say one in three girls and one in five boys molested before 
18, does that mean parents need to be afraid of actual 
physical, sexual molestation?  I mean, what are we talking 
about?  Is there a range of behaviors? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Training our children to be aware.  
We have a wonderful program right here that is working out 
of our Washington, actually our Virginia office, and that is 
the Good Touch, Bad Touch, training the children when they 
are in grammar school and on up how to deal with that, what 
they should look out for.  And when you educate them, they 
will be aware. 

<p>

We just have not educated our children well 
enough.  We haven't educated our children who have children 
how to be good parents.  And so I think that we are seeing 
somewhat of a change in that direction where we are trying 
to put the emphasis on that, where it belongs. 

<p>

But the age of a child -- you want them to be able 
to trust people, and you want them to be loving and kind.  
However, they have to be aware of strangers and what to do 
and what not to do. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  A lot of times they are not 
strangers, though; they are people they know, and that 
really complicates the problem. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is scary, because I think we 
are all pretty good at telling children, Run away from a man 
who wants you to get in his car. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right.  But when you say it's your 
stepfather or your stepmother or something like that, or 
uncle --  

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Who is the general perpetrator?  
Tell us about them. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Generally, it is someone they know. 
It's either their own parent, their stepparent, neighbors, 
relatives, that type of thing.  And that is scary because, 
naturally, these are the people whom the children do trust. 

<p>

One thing that we should all be aware of is the 
fact that we should listen to our children.  When the 
children often tell you what has happened, let's say if the 
father or stepfather, the perpetrator -- the mother kinds of 
pushes it off or says, "Oh, you're just making it up," 
instead of really listening to what your child has to say.  
And that is an emphasis that we would like to make, to 
listen to your children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Have you found the 1-800 number to 
be a good way to get to some of those children? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, yes. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Oh, absolutely.  That hot line is a 
lifeline.  The thousands of lives that have been saved that 
we know about personally that have been saved through that 
hot line -- you realize how valuable it is.  The children 
really don't know where to go.  They're afraid to tell their 
mother, or they've told their mother or whomever -- their 
father, their teacher -- they haven't listened, they haven't 
responded.  They don't know what else to do. 

<p>

But when they call 1-800-4ACHILD, we will tell 
them what to do, and we have the capability of patching that 
call in where a child does not have to hang up and redial 
another number, let's say in Paducah, Kentucky.  It patches 
them right in to the appropriate authority with that child 
on the line, and then we take care of the situation from 
there with the local, let's say, child protective services, 
sheriff's department, or whatever. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And it's 1-800-2ACHILD for the 
hearing impaired. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Reaching children is one powerful 
audience, but it does seem that having a center so near 
Washington, D.C., gives you an opportunity to reach another 
audience.  Is this Virginia center specifically located to 
talk to some of the men and women in the Nation's Capital? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, actually, Yvonne and I had 
that in mind.  We wanted a place near Washington, because so 
many of the politicians that we had called on prior, they 
wanted to come to the Village on the West Coast to see what 
we were doing, but they couldn't come that far. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And some of them have. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Yes, many of them have, but many of 
them couldn't.  And so we said it would be nice, where they 
are really setting policies and dealing with the issues, if 
we had a place near Washington that they could come and 
couldn't make too many excuses of why they couldn't be 
there. 

<p>

And so that was our target as far as being near 
Washington, and that is why this is not too far away.  It is 
45 minutes from Dulles Airport, to give you a sample of 
time.  And so we have had politicians here on the spot to 
see how the child abuse is being dealt with from this angle. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I was a police reporter and a court 
reporter and have seen many horrendous cases myself and a 
lot of child-molesting trials, and it is very difficult to 
find a place to send children who have been severely abused. 
Your waiting list has got to be pretty tremendous. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  It is. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  It is, but we're building new 
cottages.  There will be one going up for 16 more children 
imminently, and perhaps two.  We are hoping that we will 
receive enough money that we can do two at the same time for 
32 more children.  And so the need for expansion is great.  
We're hoping that people will open their hearts and their 
pocketbooks so that we can do more. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Kristi, we're so excited about this 
because this is our new Village, so to speak.  New cottages 
will be built there. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Great.  It's beautiful! 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Sixteen to a cottage, and it will be 
like a little neighborhood in a cul-de-sac.  So the very 
first cottage will be built now on this specific ground, 
starting either this month or the beginning of next.  So 
we're very excited to see this happening. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You'll have to come back and see 
it after we complete the homes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We will. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Yes. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And see the children running around -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And this will open up a lot of doors. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  This 
is so needed. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We need more cottages, as you're aware. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, I can imagine. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We have beautiful land on which to put it. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is wonderful. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  So we are thrilled that more 
children will be healed right on this spot. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares 
more from Childhelp USA.  We'll also discuss how you can 
become involved in changing the broken lives of abused 
children.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.] 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We now bring you the 
conclusion of my visit with Childhelp USA founders Sara 
O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson.  You'll hear more about 
why their vision for abused children is so needed and how 
you can become a part of that vision. 

<p>

The best change in law from your perspective was 
the laws to take a child out of the home?  What was the best 
change that took place since you got involved? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  To protect those that came forth to 
say they suspected child abuse, whether it was a teacher, a 
pediatrician, the next-door neighbor.  They were afraid to 
say that because -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Because they could get sued. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  -- if they went to court and the 
judge would decide, well, the child could have fallen down 
the step and therefore broken his arm, then that person 
could turn around and sue that doctor or whomever, and he 
was not protected in any way.	 

<p>

And so now, you know, in every state you can be 
prosecuted for not, in certain areas, I mean as far as 
teachers are concerned, and pediatricians, et cetera, you 
are mandated by law. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What is the next change that's 
needed in the law? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, there are many changes we 
would like to see in the law.  We would like to see that 
children that are taken out of their home are cared for in a 
better way and that more money would be put in where we had 
more social workers to be able to take care of the children 
and take the children out in the first place, because it's a 
proven fact that now a large percentage of cases they can't 
do anything about; they can't even go to somebody --  

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Have to leave them in the home. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  It is just those children who are in 
immediate danger most of the time that can be helped. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  If it's a life-and-death 
situation, then they remove them, but, unfortunately, many 
others need to be removed, also, for a time, anyway.  And we 
are not going around trying to take anyone's children from 
them, but on the other hand, if they need help and if the 
child needs to be removed for a while, then we're for that, 
of course. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We are not protecting our children 
like we should. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a strange situation when it 
comes to molesters, because the research is clear that 
molesters are serial offenders, generally molesting, from 
your research, 117 children per person, and that is very 
chilling to people, as well. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Yes, it is. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What would you tell parents who are 
concerned that something might be happening to their 
children?  What are some danger signs? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, danger signs, you mean of the 
child to -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  For the parent to be aware of.  As 
they look at their child, what might clue a parent in that 
there is something there to be concerned about? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Definite mood changes.  You mean of 
the child themselves? 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Definite mood changes, a child going 
inwardly that maybe had been very much of an extrovert, or 
vice versa.  Any time that a child complains of certain 
hurts on their bodies, when their personalities change, 
their emotions change, which is readily to be seen when 
something like this happens, quite frequently. 

<p>

Many children try to put it out of their minds as 
if it didn't happen and cover it up, which, of course, then 
is a major problem as they grow older.  But usually, if a 
parent knows their child, they will notice a big difference 
in what has happened due to that trauma. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Also, I think, if a child doesn't 
want to be with an uncle or an aunt or someone alone, that 
the parent should think about that and listen to the child, 
because environment there's probably a reason that the child 
doesn't want to verbalize because that person is a relative 
or a friend and they might get in trouble for saying, 
because maybe they've been told, "This is our secret; don't 
you dare tell or I'll do something to your mother or your 
father," or whatever.  So the child has to keep that secret. 

<p>

But they may be trying to tell you something in a 
different way by, "I'd rather not go alone; I don't want to 
go over there to visit so-and-so, and if I do, please don't 
leave me alone with that person."  Think about it. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  I knew of an actual case of a child 
that loved Cub Scouts, and all of a sudden, he didn't want 
to go, and of course, the parents were saying, "This is 
ridiculous.  You're almost through with this term, and if 
you don't want to next time, but you must finish out this 
term now for your Cub Scouting."  This little boy screamed 
and yelled and did not want to go, and it was because the 
Cub master was molesting those children.   

<p>

So I go back to the fact that we have to stop and 
listen to our children and hear what they are saying to us. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right.  That's so important. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As you work with the children here 
at the EastCoast Village -- and there's the West Coast 
Village -- you are hoping to do something in the lives of 
those kids.  What are you hoping to accomplish in the lives 
of children as they leave? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Grow up and be good citizens and 
not abuse their children. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And to give them inner light and let 
them express their own potential, their own little 
individual being, to fit into the network of society and let 
them know that they are cared about and loved, and teach 
them to love themselves, as well. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You have to love yourself before 
you can love others. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And a good bit of your program helps 
bring out their passions.  You have painting and riding and 
a variety of things. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  That is very important. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And that was really different from a 
lot of programs which were rather antiseptic and almost 
jail-like.  What was your vision when you were looking at 
something to build for kids? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Our vision was that Yvonne and I 
wanted to build a home that would really be homelike.  So we 
visited all around the United States different facilities.  
Now, keep in mind this was almost 20 years ago. And the ones 
that were supposed to be the best -- we went to New York, 
Michigan, all over the place, and we visited, and we were 
horrified.  The rooms for the children were not bright and 
cheerful at all.  Many did not even have bedspreads in the 
rooms or pictures hanging. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  They were all white. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  The therapy they talked about, they 
were lucky if they saw a therapist once every three months.  
And so, knowing that, we said, You know, we would like to 
change the thinking, frankly, from our social service field 
and deal with a place that would be where we would want our 
own children to be if they had to be in a place like that. 

<p>

And so every room that we decorated, every program 
that we insisted upon to go in from the beginning, was done 
with that in the back of the mind.  What would it take for 
our child to be rehabilitated and feel loved and nourished 
and in a homelike setting?  And that's where we were coming 
from. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And when my daughter was growing 
up, she used to love to go to the Village and ride the 
horses, and I think she wanted to move there. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So that had to really touch your 
hearts as mothers, then. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, yes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To walk around and think of your own 
children. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  That's exactly right. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And that was the criteria on which 
we opened our first village of Childhelp in California. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And, you know, it pleases us 
because the children, our children, have never resented the 
time that we have spent with the children at the Village.  
We have always made them feel a part of it.  And now they 
are involved in our work, which really makes us very happy. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic.  So for the people that 
are watching and would like to get involved, what can they 
do to help?  What kinds of things are there?  And we are 
obviously going to show a number.  But how do people get 
involved? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, we have chapters and 
auxiliaries affiliated in every place where we are, and 
there are many things volunteers can do, from hands-on 
situations where that is feasible and they are trained 
volunteers.  We can do that.  But, also, there is so much 
work behind the scenes.  So we can use anybody that is 
willing to help, almost. 

<p>

The Special Friends program is very important, 
too, but that only comes about if you are a member.  So we 
are saying to call and we'll find a place, hopefully, for 
that volunteer who wishes to make a difference. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What one word, or couple of words, 
but how would you describe, then, overall, as you look at 
your life's work, how would you describe it? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Busy. 

<p>

[Laughter.] 

<p>

Very rewarding, though. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Extremely fulfilling. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Very. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And I don't know what we would have 
done with our lives without this, even it has consumed our 
life, that we feel that we were brought here for that 
purpose --  

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  No question about that. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:   -- and so we're very pleased that 
we're able to do it. 

<p>

[Segment from Childhelp Dinner Event follows:] 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Childhelp has survived and prospered 
for 37 years just because of people like you who have been 
willing to volunteer their time and to share their money.  
There is nothing that cannot be accomplished when a 
community agrees to roll up its sleeves and do whatever it 
takes to make life better for its children. 

<p>

I want you to know that you're champions.  Every 
single one of you in this room is a champion.  So on behalf 
of the children we serve, I stand here in their stead to say 
thank you. 

<p>

mothers from suburbia to the inner city who share their 
insights into motherhood when <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i> returns. Thanks for watching.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> celebrates Mother's Day just a few
days early.  Mothers are such an influential part of a
child's life and possess the privilege and opportunity to 
shape the lives of little ones.

<p>

We all like to talk about our moms, sometimes 
lovingly, sometimes in frustration, but, unfortunately, in 
our cultural conversation, it is rare that mothers are 
revered and the art of motherhood, honored.  So we think it 
is important that on this special holiday we highlight the 
joys and pains of motherhood.  In fact, I had the chance to 
speak with mothers whose lives are different in a variety of 
ways but all share the experience of motherhood.  Tonight, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> brings you their insights, experiences, and 
wisdom. 

<p>

And since I am not yet a mother, I asked a good 
friend to help me along.  Charmaine Crouse Yoest is a mother 
of two, former Deputy Director of Policy for the Family 
Research Council, a contributing editor for <i>Policy Review</i>, 
the Heritage Foundation magazine, and author of a new book, 
<i>Mother in the Middle</i>.

<p>

Charmaine, thanks for being here with me today. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Thanks, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We probably couldn't tape-record most of our 
conversations.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But I am looking forward to hearing more about 
your book, <i>Mother in the Middle</i>, and I wanted to start 
off by saying here once a year we take the time as a culture 
to talk about motherhood, but even recently a lot of the 
stories are very negative.  You know, on Mother's Day we'll 
have stories on why our mothers have ruined our lives. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Yes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Why do you think motherhood has been 
so disrespected? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, that was the most fascinating 
thing about the research for this book, is there have been 
several different reasons.  The most current, of course, is 
feminism, and I think that we made a big mistake in the 
women's movement of trying to say that our whole identity 
was going to be wrapped up in the workplace.  And so if you 
go that direction, then motherhood and children becomes an 
impediment.  So I think that is one of the biggest reasons. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We'll be talking more later, but 
first let's hear what blessings motherhood has brought to 
the women with whom I spoke.  They are special women from 
inner-city Washington to the suburbs, and I know that I 
learned a lot, and I hope that you, too, will have the 
chance to learn and relate to their experiences of 
motherhood. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  One thing I would say we get from 
children, it has been my experience, is unconditional love. 
I think sometimes parents see themselves as loving their 
children unconditionally, but for most of us, we chose to be 
parents.  But none of our children chose to be born. 

<p>

MS. SUTHERLAND:  I didn't realize what holding 
your own child the first time would be like.  I mean, it 
really for me was like falling in love with somebody, almost 
like when you fall in love with your husband.  It was just 
-- that's an experience that you can't have with somebody 
else in your life except your own child. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  The blessing is first for me, 
and then the daily hard toil is nothing compared to the 
blessings and the joys. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  It's a joy that cannot be explained, 
cannot be felt until you decide that you're going to do it. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  My perspective is not they're a 
burden and they're work, but just that they're a true 
blessing from the Lord, and I just have learned to delight 
in them.  It has really made my life more joyful. 

<p>

MS. VAILES:  When your children come along, you 
see them as blessings, and the burdens hit you afterward. 

<p>

MS. HARDISON:  No amount of money or personal 
affirmation can replace those things of molding young 
children, watching them develop.  It's incredible. 

<p>

MS. ANDERSON:  They'll just come up to you and 
they'll put their little hand in your hand, and there's 
nothing any better than that. 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  You get appreciation for the 
little things that make up for the bigger world, and I think 
sometimes you miss that if you're not a mother or not 
involved with children, because children will stop and say, 
"Look, look at the flowers," or, "Look at the bee," "Look at 
the butterfly," and you know, you're just walking past all 
that stuff, and you'll miss it.  And I think they kind of 
bring you back to, you know, where you should be focused. 

<p>

MS. LEE:  You know, there are certainly 
sacrifices, and I could be in a bigger house or wearing 
better clothes or, you know, whatever.  But I don't think 
I'd be any more happy than doing what I'm doing now. 

<p>

MS. SMITH:  Just the little things she's learning; 
it's really a joy, and she's just the delight of my life. 

<p>

MS. THOMAS:  I mean, I'm constantly aware of, oh 
my gosh, what an awesome job, and they're looking at me.  
I'm like their first person that they're really thinking, 
this is how people ought to be.  It's pretty humbling. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  Children love you unconditionally, 
and I think that that's, in my view, a blessing from God, 
because it gives me a different insight into the love of God 
to see this little person who's going to put their arms 
around you regardless of what happens.  Or we've been harsh 
with them, or if they've been disappointed, they still love 
you, and they do that from the beginning, even before they 
learn to speak.  They have ways that they learn of 
expressing their love. 

<p>

The other thing I would say is that children have 
a certain manner of expressing like fresh and creative 
things, and so I try to listen to my children very 
carefully, because there's so much that they say to me that 
I haven't taught them, and so I have an opportunity to learn 
from them, and that's really a blessing. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You all are experienced mothers now. 
But what advice would you have liked to have known before 
you became a mother? 

<p>

MS. SUTHERLAND:  Breastfeeding doesn't come naturally. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I mean, just to be intensely practical, nobody 
told me that.  I thought, you know, you're equipped 
biologically to do this; that's the way the Lord intended it 
to happen.  And that, at least in my experience, and I know 
in the experience of a lot of women, that is just not the 
way it happened.  And nobody told me that. 

<p>

I think those first early weeks with your first 
child especially are really critical to your self-esteem as 
a mother, because you're doing it the first time, and those 
kinds of things like breastfeeding and just caring for them, 
you can easily feel like you've gotten in over your head. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  It's something that you never can 
probably hear enough, is that the best-laid plans of 
yourself and how you think that life is going to be gets 
changed, and God has the best-laid plans, and I know most of 
my friends know, and you know, that I have a little girl who 
is three, and she had some mild disability issues, and we 
thought, you know, this would be our special child. 

<p>

We had our son Mack back in October, and he has 
very severe disability issues.  He's at home with us right 
now, on a respirator, and with a variety of physical and 
neurological difficulty. 

<p>

But it is still, with all the responsibility and 
the hardship and challenges, the joy is incredible, and I 
would always tell that to anyone.  No matter what happens 
with your child, no matter how challenging.  The joy is 
incredible. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  I wish I knew or maybe someone had 
told me -- you know, you hear all the time, almost like a 
cliche, that it goes by fast, but I don't think I really 
appreciated that.  My older daughter is six now, and she's 
going to kindergarten, and next year she'll be gone most of 
the day, and as I mentioned earlier, just learning, making 
sure that despite the pressures and whatever stress you 
might have in your life of raising children, that you are 
delighting in your children.  You're looking into their eyes 
and into their faces, and you're taking that time out to 
read them a story or to have the quality time with them that 
can so easily seem to be squeezed out, out of a day, and all 
those things I don't think I really -- it took me a good 
three years of raising my children to learn those lessons, 
and I wish I had known ahead of time. 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  Because I am an educator, 
it's so funny.  You know, you can teach a sister one year, 
and in two years or the next year you can get a brother, and 
they're so different, and I would say, "How do they come 
from the same house and they're so different?"  And I would 
say that all the time. 

<p>

But when I had my own, I realized how they could 
come.  You know, the gene pool is mixed together and you 
come up with whatever you come up with.  My kids are night 
and day.  But I used to always say, "How do they come from 
the same household?  Do they have the same mother?"  And it 
is so amazing, and people tell you, "Kids are not the same." 
I knew they weren't the same.  I knew that. 

<p>

My father used to always say to us, "Fair is not 
equal," and I never understood that until I became a parent. 
He would always say, "Fair is not equal," and I didn't 
understand what that was until I had my own. 

<p>

MS. THOMAS:  I just find that I really had to 
become a better person myself.  You know, I just thought I 
was a pretty cool kind of person, that I was a pretty 
patient.  It wasn't a natural thing, but I had been working 
on it, and I thought I had that pretty well in order. 

<p>

There's nobody that challenges that like a little 
toddler.  Nobody.  I mean, nobody has made me that mad in my 
lifetime. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

You know, of anything that I have done, and just 
learning to love beyond that, learning just to keep self-
control over that, because, I mean, he's precious to me.  I 
mean, I'd die for him in a heartbeat.  But he's driving me 
nuts.

<p>

And just learning to give that to God, the part 
that I'm just out of control over, and just being the adult 
and stepping back and what do I need to do in this 
situation.  Sometimes it's the discipline, sometime it's 
just an extra hug, that they've been attention-deprived that 
day because you've been running around too much, and that's 
really what the problem is, and it's just really hard to 
discern that and not take it as a personal affront. 

<p>

MS. LEE:  Before I had children, I worked and I 
had this immaculate house and great meals, the kind that Mom 
made every night when you came home.  And now it's like, 
"Well, honey, Spaggetios or hot dogs, which is it?  You got 
a choice." 

[Laughter.]

<p>

It's just really difficult at the end of the day 
to muster that energy to get in there and cook and get the 
house clean, because, you know, you feel better about 
yourself if you look good and your house looks good and your 
husband comes home and goes, "Wow!  I've got a perfect wife 
here.  I've got a perfect wife that's a mom, too."

<p>

So I have really had to just step back and say, 
Okay, I'm not perfect; my house isn't going to be perfect, 
and we're just going to do the best that we know how and be 
happy with that.  So I'm learning to change my level of 
happiness. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  When I had my first child, I went to 
classes and I was sort of soaking up all this advice which 
turned out to be irrelevant. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And so the lessons that I did get, I didn't have 
the experience of wanting to trust them because nobody told 
-- there were some things that happened that nobody told me 
or warned me they would happen.  So I said, well, this is 
such a --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Like what?

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  Well, just that, you know, when you 
take the Lamaze class, it's supposed to be so easy and so 
simple to just have this baby. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And it wasn't like that at all.  And I'm saying, 
"What did I take these classes for?"  None of this stuff 
that was supposed to happen in the class happened, and all 
of the stuff that wasn't supposed to happen, did.  And so I 
began then to sort of not trust the official sort of line 
about even how you have a baby.

<p>

But I recognize that each mother is different.
Your bodies are different.  You just sort of bring to that 
process a whole different sort of sets of strengths and 
weaknesses and disabilities, et cetera.  So, so much of it, 
you just have to learn by experience.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shares more about motherhood, and we want 
you to join us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We're celebrating Mother's Day 
in our own unique way, and I am joined by Charmaine Crouse 
Yoest, who is not only a mother of two but also an author 
and national spokesperson on family issues.  She also 
happens to be a very good friend of mine, and I am happy for 
the opportunity to share this special show with her. 

<p>

Well, Charmaine, we just saw the first of three 
segments looking at real-life moms talking about real-life 
problems, and I think the one thing that I was really struck 
by was that nobody said it was easy; everybody just said it 
was worth it.  I think sometimes in the discussion of 
motherhood there's this insinuation that it's going to be 
easy, that you can do it. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Well, you know, I think the thing that 
really struck me, as well, about that is this element of 
surprise.  You're surprised by the fact that it isn't easy, 
but the surprise over the joy.  We heard that over and over 
again with those women, and that is so much what we heard, 
too, doing interviews in the book, is that, you know, 
motherhood has been so devalued in our society that when you 
get into it -- well, you remember when I had my kids.  I had 
the same thing happen to me. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST: I was, you know, a little bit hesitant 
about getting to this whole mom thing, and all of a sudden, 
my kids were there, and it was just unbelievable how -- you 
know, nobody can tell you.  That's a cliche, but nobody can 
tell you what it's going to be like ahead of time. 

<p>

I think that that is a natural thing, but in our 
society today it's accentuated, and that turns into being a 
problem when we've got this whole system that is geared 
towards women taking six weeks of leave and then going 
straight back into the work force. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right, and the book that you were 
mentioning was your new book, <i>Mother in the Middle:
Searching for Peace in the Mommy Wars</i>, which I really liked,
because there is a conflict, I think.

<p>

Well, maybe there doesn't have to be, but there 
certainly is a conflict that is described between the fact 
that we as women can achieve many things, and motherhood is 
an aside, as though motherhood is not an area where I 
achieve, or motherhood is not even important for me to 
attempt to achieve, like you do the motherhood thing, yes, 
whatever, maybe, maybe not.  But your career -- you know, 
here's success. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But it's not easy. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Well, I was really struck -- in doing 
the research for the book, we went back and did kind of a 
content study of some of the women's magazines, and one of 
the articles that really jumped out at me that is always in 
my mind was from <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, and they said, "Can You Be 
Somebody and a Mommy Too?"  And the whole idea was, they 
said -- of course, the article was saying yes, you can be 
somebody, but still, that title just continued to stick with 
me, because I thought, you know, that's the subtle message 
that we're sending to the next generation of women, that 
being somebody and being a mommy is not the same thing. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST: So I think that's a real problem for women today.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting, because I think 
there is a big generation gap between <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine 
and MTV, Generation X, and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, because 
in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, I think the message is very 
clear, and not just the <i>Journal</i>, not to slam on them, but 
there was an article you and I were commenting on not long 
ago where a woman was commended as being this female worker 
of the year, and she had been cutting deals on a phone while 
she was in labor and was back to work the next day, and she 
got an award for that.

<p>

MS. YOEST: Yes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And you and I were talking about 
where were her priorities, and then you contrast that with 
Generation X data that says that they're the group of people 
who have most suffered from a lot of broken homes, and most 
say they want to change their work day to accommodate their 
family.  What did you find?

<p>

MS. YOEST:  You know, it's funny.  Since we're 
friends and this is a more informal discussion, I will tell 
you honestly, one thing that has struck me in terms of the 
aftermath of the book is you see some of the -- I go through 
this myself -- you see some of these articles.  There was 
another article in the <i>Journal</i> where they were highlighting 
these really top women, and the whole point of the article, 
Kristi, was that these women had achieved so well because 
they had wonderful time management skills.

<p>

So I walked around for the rest of the day going, 
"Oh, gosh, so that's all it really takes, is great time 
management skills."  But, you know, that's a bogus message 
to be sending to women that if you just manage your time 
correctly, then you're going to be able to hold down a full-
time job and be a perfect mom to your kids.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST:  And it was really kind of comforting 
to me because I was doing an interview later that day with 
another mom who has four children, and she is running a 
business out of her home, and I mentioned this article to 
her, and the conflicted feelings I had had reading it, and 
she just laughed.  She said, "You know, I was one of those 
women.  Everybody looked at me and thought I had it 
together.  I had great time management skills," she said, 
"but I knew that my family, and particularly my kids, were 
suffering." 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right. Don't you think that -- you 
and I have talked a lot about it -- that we have to expand 
our definition of womanhood?  So I ask you a leading 
question:  Don't you agree with me? 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But we have defined womanhood as we were oppressed 
economically, so now, the real woman today has the best 
resume on the planet, rather than that women are very 
relational, that the husbands and men in their life and 
their families are important; and, significantly, at the 
Family Research Council, we have seen a lot of data	 that 
says most women during the first five years of their 
children's life would like to adjust their work schedule to 
accommodate that, rather than a lot of our federal 
proposals, which are all organized toward getting women back 
to work, because work is what women really want, isn't it? 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And isn't that a little narrow? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, that's what my passion is all 
about with this whole issue, is that <i>Parents</i> magazine just 
ran a study.  They surveyed 18,000 of their readers, and 
they found that only 4 percent of those 18,000 women wanted 
to be holding down a full-time job.  Sixty-one percent of 
them wanted to have a part-time job.

<p>

So I'm looking at this and saying, You know, but 
our federal discussion is all centered on day care, as if 
that is what women want.  And what we found in talking to 
women was that that was not what they wanted, that they were 
really struggling with this issue of how to put their 
children first. 

<p>

Going back to another thing you were talking 
about, in terms of the issue of sacrificing for your 
children, I think one of the difficulties in talking about 
this issue and that I struggled with as I wrote the book is 
that there are no easy answers.  You can't come down and say 
that, okay, here's the perfect work/family balance.  You 
know, we subtitled it, <i>Searching for Peace in the Mommy
Wars</i>, so we kind of wrestled with this question, what is
peace?

<p>

Well, peace is not necessarily that everything 
will be easy.  And in today's society, in our secular 
society, people equate difficulty with something being 
wrong.  Everything should be easy.  But, you know, the truth 
is that children are a sacrifice, and we have to come to 
grips with that. 

<p>

Kind of to tie that a little tangentially into 
another thought is that this has to start with women, 
because if we keep waiting for society --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To fix it. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: -- to revalue women, yes -- but if 
women don't value children, then why should anyone else?  
The problem is that feminism has, for decades now, wanted to 
make it out that men and women were exactly the same.  The 
problem with that is, you can't get away from the fact that 
women do have this intrinsic biological connection to their 
children that, just by force of nature, is different than 
what it is for the man.  And so I look at that and say, 
Okay, as one of the women mentioned, you know, breastfeeding 
is a pretty important component of raising your child.  
That's a vital connection to your child. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And it's hard. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  And it's hard.  And if the mother 
doesn't value that, then why would the father?  Why would 
society? 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right. 

<p>

We're going to talk more about the difficulties 
and challenges of motherhood. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, 
we'll gain more insight into motherhood and the issues 
facing mothers today.  Stay with us. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. With Mother's Day just around 
the corner, tonight we are sharing some real-life motherhood 
experiences.  In fact, let's hear what these mothers had to 
say about some of the hard lessons they have had to teach 
and learn from their children. Join us.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What lessons did you find hard to 
teach your children?  What were things that were difficult 
to transfer, values or skills or just the kinds of things 
they need to be the people you wanted them to be? 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  Well, I'm still at the 
teaching stage, so what I'll say is, it's so amazing how -- 
because my kids are close in age -- you want them to share, 
and sharing is a big thing.  So you want to teach them to 
share, and I was on this mandate about a year ago.  I'm 
going to teach them to share.  I don't care.  They're going 
to learn to share, and dah-dah-dah-dah, and I gave them all 
these biblical points of why they should share, you know, 
all of the stuff, until I realized they were sharing.  It's 
just that they have to work it out, and if I just kind of 
stay out of it, they will share.  As long as I'm giving them 
love and support, they'll work it out.  But, you know, 
you're so into, when they're two and three, they're going to 
learn to share.  But, eventually, if you live what you 
teach, they'll learn it, so it's kind of easy. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  That's true, what Sabrina is 
saying, and I, too, want to teach the sharing, but I want to 
teach what a strength it is to share and to give, because 
the world is about keep, get, take from whoever else and 
just keep for yourself.  I would like to teach my children 
that that is a position of weakness, and the sharing and 
giving is the real position of strength, and I'm trying to 
work that in. 

<p>

My mother says that it's difficult, but if I 
remind myself that this is a four-year-old, he's not going 
to exhibit this behavior today, it becomes less difficult.  
I feel I'm putting things in that perhaps I'll see in the 
future, and I have to remind myself that he's not going to 
learn it in two minutes, three minutes.  It may be years, 
but soon, I hope that he reflects the kind of behavior I'm 
nurturing now. 

<p>

MS. SUTHERLAND:  Loving seems to come naturally to 
children if you give them an environment in which it can 
flourish.  They're just so loving and responsive.  But all 
of the other things, like manners and not screaming, you 
know, just all the things that toddlers learn, are hard, I 
think.  It's hard to shape somebody gently and with respect 
to who they are, so that you don't feel at the end of the 
day that you've kind of beaten them down but that you've 
really nurtured them. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  If it's this kind of challenge when 
they're two and a half -- I've got a three-year-old -- what 
the challenges are that are ahead of us and how much harder 
it's going to be to teach them to respect your body, to 
respect other people, to learn the harder the things they're 
going to be met with in grade school, now -- unfortunately, 
in grade school and middle school -- and I am in awe of that 
responsibility, of getting prepared for that and learning 
what I need to learn to be able to help them through that. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  I think, ideally, as a mom, you 
need to be confident and secure and kind of as if you've 
already done it, but you're really doing it for the first 
time.  So again, with my three, I feel like, as the years 
have gone by, I am getting more confident and secure. 

<p>

But probably the area I struggle a lot with is 
just, as we have been talking, the area of discipline.  I 
think part of that has to do with, you know your own 
boundaries; you know what's appropriate, because I find it 
hard to -- I put off disciplining them, and you see that 
children -- they need it.  You know, they need to learn 
boundaries.  They need to learn what's right and wrong, and 
they need to see that there's consequences. 

<p>

And so I have seemed like I learn this repeating 
lesson that the more I put it off, the harder it is for me 
and the harder it is for them.  As a friend of mine once 
said, you can't as a mom expect to be popular.  You have to 
be willing to be unpopular.  And that's true, because even 
after I have disciplined, I want to run in and have that 
close bonding and friendship, and I need to restrain myself 
and say, you know, let there be distance and let my kids 
learn the hard lessons of life. 

<p>

MS. ANDERSON:  With the discipline and stuff, you 
know, the kids will say to me, "Mom, you know, I don't like 
you very much." 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I'm like, "Well, you know what?  I'm not liking you right now, 
either." 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I'm like, thank God we still love each other, you 
know.  I said, "There's nobody in the world I love more than 
you."  I said, "Sometimes we don't like each other very 
much."  But it's a hard thing to teach them that you still 
love them even in that discipline time and stuff. 

<p>

MS. VAILES:  Other people have a lot to do with 
and a lot to say about how the children come up.  "Don't let 
those children run in the church."  "Don't let them do 
this."  And it's difficult.  Patrice and I know that because 
of our differences, and it makes me reflect on the 
differences that I had with my own mother in raising them. 

<p>

So I'm learning to stay out of things and let her 
handle it.  You know, they're her children.  It's difficult, 
but I'm learning. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that motherhood has 
been severed from womanhood in the discussion of it?  
There's a lot of focus on work, women as people who make 
money, women as people who have a career.  What about focus 
on women as people who bring the next generation to life? 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  Well, I personally feel 
that, in the African-American community, mothers generally 
worked, if not full time, at least part time, so I think 
that we were excluded from the discussion, anyway, and now 
that they're including a discussion of working women and 
working mothers and whatever, we are more included in the 
discussion, and I think before we were excluded, and I don't 
think that was an issue for our community, generally, 
because most of us worked.  My mother worked, my grandmother 
worked, her grandmother worked.  I am from a lot of women 
that worked.  I work.  I'm sure my daughters will work. 

<p>

So I think that that whole issue wasn't an issue 
for us, and I think that we're now becoming included.  And 
there are still African-American mothers that don't work and 
stay home with their children, which is wonderful, too.  But 
I think that now we are more included as a community. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So you would say most women work. Go ahead. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  I would say that, in terms of how 
womanhood relates to motherhood, one of the most important 
things a woman can do, a mother can do for her children, is 
to have and to convey to them a strong sense of her own 
identity, and it's not like, well, I'm less than or I'm 
subordinate or I'm weak or I don't have any potential.  But 
I think that the mother's sense of herself gets conveyed, if 
not through words, through behavior, to the children, so 
that I would like to think that whether I work or don't 
work, that I live my life in such a way that I'm an 
inspiration and an encouragement to my children to become 
all that they can be. 

<p>

But we live in a society that has peculiar ways of 
sort of pigeonholing mothers and women so that you have this 
role and not that role, and I think that that can really be 
a problem.  Especially in the black community, that's a 
problem.  We get so stereotyped and even demonized and 
denigrated.  You know, well, you're a mother; you're not 
this and you're not that. 

<p>

My perspective is that whatever I achieve, 
whatever I accomplish, it is for my children; it's a major 
part of my being there for them as an example, as a role 
model, as an inspiration. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  Yes, I agree with what Cheryl 
says, and somewhere mothering is lost on society.  I think 
there is the physical mothering of having our children and 
nurturing them, and also, there's the spiritual mothering 
for me, and that is the woman that works in her community, 
that is working at school, in the offices, the president of 
a company or whatever.  It's a whole nurturing, bringing to 
birth, giving life to whatever -- babies, careers.  It's a 
whole world of things that today's world doesn't see, 
doesn't grasp. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll 
talk further about motherhood today.  Join us after this 
break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. I'm joined again by 
Charmaine Crouse Yoest, who is helping me, a future mother, 
decipher roles of mothers today in America.  Welcome back, 
Charmaine.

<p>

MS. YOEST: Thanks.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  My mother would pay to know when. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But to kind of springboard off the conversation 
that we just saw with the group of mothers, it was 
interesting talking about the fact that mothers are a 
spiritual force and a broader force and have a bigger 
influence than, you know, five minutes with my kids and I'm 
off to make my real impact in the work world.  Did you find 
that in your research? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  You know, that's a real linchpin of 
what I'm thinking about in motherhood here and what we're 
talking about in the book.  It's just that children have 
eternal value, and when our society became more secular, we 
lost that appreciation for anything that has to do with the 
eternal.  And so, as a result, I think that was a huge part 
of the devaluing of motherhood. 

<p>

It was really kind of interesting to me to look 
back to history and to see if we had any kind of model for 
what motherhood could be.  In the early 1800s, mothers were 
put up on a pedestal, they were revered, for precisely the 
reason that she was mentioning, that they had a force in 
society.  The power that they held as the women who were 
raising the next generation of Americans was very deeply 
honored, and they were seen to have influence in the wider 
community, not just within the home. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Isn't it Winston Churchill who said, 
"The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world"? 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And there was a real valuing of the 
impact that women had in the lives of the people around 
them, broader merely than work. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, and we have just lost an 
appreciation for that.  The most moving thing to me, we tell 
in the book the story of Harriet Beecher Stowe.  She was the 
woman who wrote <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, which is partially 
credited with igniting the Civil War.  The genesis of that 
book, she told a friend once, was in the summer when she 
lost her baby son to cholera.  As any mother who has gone 
through that experience, she was so grief-stricken, and 
shortly thereafter, after her son died, she started hearing 
stories about slave mothers who were just viciously ripped 
apart and separated from their children forcibly, never to 
see their children again, sold into slavery.  She just so 
identified with the pain of losing a child that she sat down 
and wrote <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>.

<p>

When I heard that story, I thought, you know, 
that's what motherhood is all about.  Making a difference in 
the larger society, having your own personal experience 
connects you into the wider society at large, and giving 
your actions a motivation that is more important than just 
your small family. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It was interesting, looking at some 
business models lately, I think what was powerful was that 
in a lot of ways a lot of workplaces are structured after a 
masculine role model where it is very linear -- you do this, 
you do that -- where they said that women managers were more 
relational and built teams on the strengths of individuals, 
while men liked to designate and delineate a task and build 
it on the strength of the description or the formula. 

<p>

We have been tempted to say that the formula is 
right and the relationships are wrong, and I think, in a 
broader perspective, women bring to business and to the 
community an appreciation for those relationships that is 
different. 

<p>

I was interested to see some chamber of commerce 
data recently that said that the majority of start-up 
businesses in America today are begun by women looking for 
options and are doing it in niche businesses. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Yes, and in fact, do you know that 
women have a very rate of success with home-based 
businesses?  This is a real growth industry. 

<p>

I was struck, to play back to the last piece, the 
one woman who was saying that she comes from a long line of 
mothers who have worked, and one of the points that we 
really wanted to hammer home in the book is that women have 
always worked.  Work is not a shameful thing. 

<p>

I think that we can sometimes, in this whole 
debate over women and work, from a conservative Christian's 
perspective, sometimes there can be a bondage that women 
feel in that if they need to work or if they are working in 
some way, that that is wrong.  But that is kind of twisting 
a biblical model of work.  It's okay to work.  The point is 
that our children do come first. 

<p>

And so what we are really wanting to bring into 
the public discussion is, if women need income, they don't 
necessarily need a job.  How can we be more creative in 
looking at our society and making it easier for women to 
augment their income through home-based work, through part-
time, through flex-time, through job-sharing?  There are so 
many exciting options out there, particularly with the 
technological age. 

<p>

Debbie, my co-author, and I wrote this book 
together and only got together once over the course of 
writing the book.  We did it all by computer.  And it's 
amazing to me.  It's so exciting, the opportunities that are 
out there. 

<p>

I think it's sad to see women who are struggling 
so hard, wanting to spend more time with their children.  
That's what we heard over and over again from women as we 
talked to them for the book.  And they're not getting any 
support for thinking creatively in the broader society.  All 
you hear women's activists saying is, "Well, women need more 
day care."  I don't think that's what real women are saying. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, women don't want that.

<p>

I was really struck by some day care data recently 
that 50 percent of children under 18 are cared for by their 
mother who is staying at home, and of the remaining 50 
percent, one third of those are cared for by mothers and 
fathers flexing their work schedules so one of them is 
always there; one third of them are cared for in a household 
with extended family, and a very small percentage of that is 
maybe a nanny; and of the remaining one third of that 50 
percent, only that small percentage chose an institutional 
day care setting.

<p>

But the conversation is all as though this is what 
women want -- we want a place to send our children to -- 
when I think that people's patterns are clear that we want 
to keep our children close, even if we need to earn extra 
money. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly. That's what so frustrating, 
is that the national debate doesn't reflect the mother in 
the middle, the woman who is struggling and saying, "How can 
I be with my own children?"  That's what troubling to me as 
a public policy person and as a mother, is to see almost 
this train coming down the track.  Even the Republican- 
dominated Governors' Conference called for more day care 
money in the welfare reform bill. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  So I see our public policy discussion 
going an entirely different direction than where I think the 
women of America are going, because I was very encouraged in 
terms of talking to women.  I felt like there is a real 
renaissance of revaluing motherhood across our country, of 
women saying, "I'm going to draw a line in the sand, and 
this is what's important to me, and I'm going to make this 
decision for my family whether I get patronized or not." 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Especially, I think, among younger 
mothers, and we're going to get to talk more about that 
later.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we're going to share 
more from mothers who give their advice to women considering 
having children.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. We are continuing our 
celebration of motherhood.  Let's hear some advice from a 
diverse group of mothers to women who are considering having 
children.  Let's see if that biological clock is worth 
listening to.

<p>

Today in America, one in four couples is 
infertile, and the number is growing, and there are a lot of 
factors that are playing into that.  For children up for 
adoption, there are 40 certified, on-a-waiting-list, 
available couples per child. 

<p>

So there are a lot of women who are going to see 
this television show that would like to be where you are, 
would like to have children.  And just thinking about them 
for a second, or people who are just grappling with this -- 
there are a lot of women who don't have children -- my 
husband and I, we don't have children yet -- here on 
Mother's Day, what are your thoughts for those women out 
there who wish that they were among you? 

<p>

MS. LEE:  I try to tell my friends now that are in 
the mid-thirties or early thirties that are putting off 
motherhood -- "Oh, I'll be a mom some day.  We're not ready 
for it yet" -- I say, because we had a very difficult time 
conceiving with our first child, and I just can't tell them 
enough, "Don't wait.  If this is what your heart's desire 
is, don't wait.  The career can wait.  You have a lifetime 
of a career after your child is grown.  But this is the time 
right now where you have the energy, your body is physically 
ready."  I just would advise them to go ahead and get going 
on it, put the priorities first.

<p>

MS. VAILES: I was very happy to have my children.
I guess the one thing that I would like to stress is being 
there for them and being open to hearing what they have to 
say.  I used to say that the Lord blessed me because I don't 
show my panic; it comes much later.  So my children could 
tell me anything.  It's the communication that helped me 
learn, helped me grow, helped me become more flexible.   

<p>

It got to the place that they used to tell their 
friends, "You need to talk to my mother," about problems or 
whatever was going on with them when they saw things that 
needed to be changed.  And they would come to me with 
everything.  So it's very easy, now that they are adults, to 
have open communication. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  For me, having been a public health 
nurse -- and I have had opportunity to travel quite a bit to 
Third World countries -- I have always had a desire to 
adopt, and as you talk about the statistics, I would 
encourage people that there is something you won't have, 
having your own, and yet there are other special things you 
will have if you're able to adopt.  And that is something 
that I still hope, in the future, that we might be able to 
do even though we have been able to have our own, because 
the world is a needy place.  There are needy kids out there, 
and it just takes a little bit of love.  You've got people 
here that desperately want children and children here that 
desperately need homes. 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS: Women that don't have 
children, they need to pray to see if that's what God wants 
them to do, because God's wishes are different for everyone, 
and there might be a role for you as an extended family 
person that might be much needed in comparison to you 
raising your own, and you have to pray about that. 

<p>

I know that I prayed before I started having my 
children, because if you met me about five years ago, you'd 
say, "She's having kids?" 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

So I was like, mmm, I don't know if I want to do 
that.  So you have to pray and you have to wait and see what 
His answer is. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  You don't know what's down the road 
for you when you start trying.  Maybe you conceive 
instantly, and that's great, because so many of us don't 
have that luxury, and what a nice surprise to find that out. 
Otherwise, you may find out you've got some difficulties and 
you need the time to work through it, and you can't do that 
when you're 38.  You don't have that much time. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  I would have missed -- how do 
I say this? -- the whole world of mothering if I didn't have 
children, because for me there was all this mothering that 
needed its connection or its contact, and it's all of what 
they have said and just a whole lot of other things in me, 
and I needed to make contact with that that needed my 
mothering, and I would have missed all of that without 
children, and it's all of your teaching and your learning, 
the prayerfulness, the growing up, just everything that you 
bring to that need, your purpose to that need, and that's 
what I would have missed, and I am glad I had the blessing 
to connect.                                                   

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  You have to love children.  I mean, 
that's the most important thing that you do as a mother, is 
to love them.  I mean, that's your job, that's your 
responsibility, that's your basic obligation, is to love 
them, to lead them; that is, to give them some sense of 
direction, some sense of boundary, some sense of discipline, 
some sense of orientation when they lose their way, to lead 
them; that is, to be the parent, be the adult, at least as 
long as they are needing that; also, to listen to them. 

<p>

There are so many children whose behavior 
indicates that they don't have anybody to listen to them or 
who will listen respectfully to what they have to say and 
will sort of give them a sense of self-esteem and of their 
own worth by saying, "Well, you're important.  I'm going to 
listen to you.  You have something to say."  Or, "I'm 
interested in how your day was, or what your ideas and your 
thoughts are."

<p>

This is important, this listening, because I think 
that the more we invest in listening to our children, the 
more we kind of help them to become socialized and to just 
realize, well, I'm an important person.  I have something to 
contribute, something to say.

<p>

And then the last thing is to learn from them and 
to recognize that parenting is a learning experience.  Even 
if you have studied developmental psychology, it seems that 
once you have mastered, sort of, as a parent the stage where 
they are, they have a way of leaping to the next stage, and 
then you've got to catch up and say, "Okay, this way of 
dealing with the child has got to grow as parent." 

<p>

This is what I am experiencing as a mother, is 
that I am learning how to be a mother from them as I have 
watched them go through their changes and their growth and 
their development.

<p>

But my commitment, again, my obligation is to stay 
with that process and not to say, "Okay, well, you just go 
ahead; I'm going to stay stuck right here."  And as you are 
probably aware, there are adult parents of adult children 
who get kind of stuck at a particular stage of mothering, 
and then it's really difficult for that adult child, because 
it seems to me that the overall goal and purpose of 
parenting is to do everything you can to prepare that child 
to be an independent, interdependent human being, an adult, 
and not to sort of put them in some sort of perpetual 
childhood because of your own emotional needs or whatever. 

<p>

So the goal is that they can really reach their 
full potential as adults, but this listening, this loving, 
this sort of learning from them and this leading them, for 
me, is what motherhood is about. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the 
break.  Stay with us to hear how you can get more 
information regarding issues affecting you as a mother or a 
father and your family.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. I 
would also like to thank Charmaine for all her insights. 

<p>

Charmaine, we just heard a lot of really good 
advice from some moms.  In the little bit of time we have 
left, what advice would you give women searching for peace 
in the mommy wars? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, you know, Kristi, it was really 
inspiring to talk to women who have been so creative in 
finding their own peace.  We have a whole chapter of stories 
we tell of women who have found a situation that really 
works for them. 

<p>

I think the message that we wanted to send women 
home with was that you can make your own life, what you want 
it to be, that there are opportunities out there, and that, 
as women, we need to be aggressively moving into the 21st 
century and staking out the territory and saying this is 
what motherhood of the next millennium is going to look 
like. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST: And we can create our own terms and 
our own situation in a creative way that isn't dictated by 
what the activists are saying they think motherhood should 
look like.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, it has been unfortunate, a lot 
of the women who say they're for women are just for big 
resumes and abortion, and you think there's a little more to 
womanhood than that. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: A lot more. Yes, exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to want to have you read 
this book.  If you'd like to receive more information about 
the Family Research Council, tonight's guests, or get a copy 
of Charmaine's book, please call us at 1-800-225-4008. 

<p>

Next week we'll be discussing a chilling issue 
facing us today:  euthanasia.  You won't want to miss this 
potential impact that will come with a contract with death. 
Please join us when <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i> returns. Thanks for watching.
