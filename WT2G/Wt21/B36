<b>TEXT:  U.S. IMPROVES OFFER IN WTO BASIC TELECOM TALKS
<br>(Restrictions on submarine cable landing licenses lifted)</b>

<p> Washington -- The United States has improved its offer to open its market to foreign telecommunications firms in an effort to help bring to conclusion an international accord on basic telecommunications services, says Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jeffrey Lang.

<p> In a press release issued November 13 by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) in Geneva, Lang said he hopes the new U.S. offer and one from the European Union will provide a basis for other countries to improve their offers on market access to their telecommunications sectors so that an agreement can be reached by the February 1997 deadline.

<p>The new U.S. offer would remove restrictions limiting foreign access to submarine cable landing licenses, he said.  It is the third improvement of U.S. offers in these talks.

<p>Following is the text of the USTR statement:

<p> (begin text)

<p> The United States has again improved its market access commitments in the WTO negotiations on basic telecommunications.

<p> Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jeff Lang announced in Geneva that the United States had removed the restriction limiting access to submarine cable landing licenses.  "As a result," Ambassador Lang stated, "if the negotiations succeed, the U.S. will provide national treatment to WTO members with regard to access to licenses to land submarine cables in accordance with its laws and regulations."

<p> This is the third time the U.S. has improved its offer -- previous improvements included market access and national treatment in the local Telecom services market and adoption of a set of agreed regulatory principles to govern the telecom sector.

<p>The United States also revised its offer so that it is technology neutral and includes all market segments of basic telecommunications services.  These changes do not reflect any substantive change but are in line with a growing consensus among negotiators that schedules should be standardized and should be technology neutral, especially to clarify which members intend to open their satellite-based services markets.

<p>Ambassador Lang noted that "there is not much time left to conclude these negotiations and significant progress must be made by the Singapore Ministerial Conference if we are to succeed by February."  In this connection, Ambassador Lang welcomed the improvements in the offer of the European Union.  "The revised US and European offers provide a solid basis for the United States and the European Union to obtain more and better offers from other WTO members at Singapore," said Ambassador Lang.

<b>TEXT:  GARDNER ON HELMS-BURTON LAW BEFORE WTO DISPUTE PANEL<br>
(Issue poses risks for the new World Trade Organization)</b>

<p>Washington -- Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Booth Gardner says that the European Union's request for a dispute resolution panel within the World Trade Organization (WTO) to discuss the U.S. LIBERTAD Act (Helms-Burton law) concerning Cuba could pose a threat to the organization.

<p>"We do not believe that recourse to a WTO trade panel will lead to a resolution of this dispute," Gardner said in a statement in Geneva before the WTO Dispute Settlement Body November 20.  "On the other hand, we do believe that proceeding further with this matter would pose serious risks for this new and invaluable organization, which is only in the early stages of its development."

<p>Following is the text of the statement:

<p>(begin text)

<p>This matter is on the agenda today as a result of a second request by the European Communities, acting for itself and its Member States, for a dispute settlement panel regarding certain provisions of the LIBERTAD Act and other U.S. measures governing U.S. economic relations with Cuba.  When this matter came before this body a little over a month ago, the United States explained that the measures the EC included in its request for a panel reflect longstanding U.S. foreign policy and security concerns with regard to Cuba.

<p>The LIBERTAD Act, in particular, was enacted in the immediate aftermath of the shootdown by Cuba of two unarmed civil aircraft in broad daylight and without justification, in blatant violation of international law.  The Act is designed to promote a swift transition to democracy in Cuba, a goal that we, the EC, the Member States and many other governments share.

<p>Moreover, certain of the other measures included in the EC's panel request have been in force for some years -- or decades -- and have been expressly justified by the United States under the GATT 1947 as measures taken in pursuit of essential U.S. security interests.

<p>As we said in October, given the foreign and security policy concerns underpinning decades of U.S. relations with Cuba, and in the light of the common interests we share with our European friends in regard to Cuba, the United States is surprised and concerned to find our differences over Cuba raised before a multilateral trade forum.

<p>The United States very much regrets that the Community and the Member States today have seen fit to move those differences one step further in the direction of a WTO panel.

<p>The United States reiterates that our dispute with the Community is not fundamentally a trade matter and thus is not of a nature that we should ask a trade panel to decide.  There is no suggestion that any of the measures raised by the Community reflect trade protectionism.

<p>We do not believe that recourse to a WTO trade panel will lead to a resolution of this dispute.  On the other hand, we do believe that proceeding further with this matter would pose serious risks for this new and invaluable organization, which is only in the early stages of its development.

<p>In closing, the United States would strongly urge the Community to explore other, more appropriate and fruitful avenues for pursuing its interests in this controversy.

<b>TEXT: WTO AGREEMENT TO ELIMINATE TARIFFS ON INFO TECHNOLOGY<br>
(Entry into force depends on others signing on)</b><br>

<p>Singapore -- Trade ministers meeting in Singapore have agreed to eliminate tariffs on trade in information technology products in phases by 2000, the so-called information technology agreement (ITA).

<p>Ministers from 14 trading partners accounting for 80 percent of trade in this sector concluded the agreement December 13, the final day of a World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting.

<p>The ITA should enter into force by April 1997 if other countries sign on to bring the critical mass to 90 percent of global trade in the sector.

<p>Toward eliminating tariffs by January 1, 2000, the participants would reduce them in stages on July 1, 1997, January 1, 1998, and January 1, 1999.

<p>Some of the products covered by the agreement are identified by Harmonized System headings, some by name, and some by both.

<p>Participating in the agreement so far are most of the major suppliers including the United States, the European Union (EU), Japan, Korea, and Singapore.  Six others have indicated their intention to sign.

<p>Following is the text of the ITA, including the ministers' declaration and the annex on modalities and product coverage:

<p>(begin text)

<p>
MINISTERIAL DECLARATION ON TRADE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS

<p>SINGAPORE, 13 DECEMBER 1996

<p>Ministers,

<p>Representing the following Members of the World Trade Organization ("WTO"), and States or separate customs territories in the process of acceding to the WTO, which have agreed in Singapore on the expansion of world trade in information technology products and which account for well over 80 per cent of world trade in these products ("parties"):

<p>Australia                     Japan

<p>Canada                        Korea

<p>Chinese Taipei                Norway

<p>European Communities          Singapore

<p>Hong Kong                     Switzerland

<p>Iceland                       Turkey

<p>Indonesia                     United States

<p>Considering the key role of trade in information technology products in the development of information industries and in the dynamic expansion of the world economy,

<p>Recognizing the goals of raising standards of living and expanding the production of and trade in goods;

<p>Desiring to achieve maximum freedom of world trade in information technology products;

<p>Desiring to encourage the continued technological development of the information technology industry on a world-wide basis;

<p>Mindful of the positive contribution information technology makes to global economic growth and welfare;

<p>Having agreed to put into effect the results of these negotiations which involve concessions additional to those included in the Schedules attached to the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, and

<p>Recognizing that the results of these negotiations also involve some concessions offered in negotiations leading to the establishment of Schedules annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol,

<p>Declare as follows:

<p>  1. Each party's trade regime should evolve in a manner that enhances     market access opportunities for information technology products.

<p>  2. Pursuant to the modalities set forth in the Annex to this Declaration,     each party shall bind and eliminate customs duties and other duties and charges of any kind, within the meaning of Article II:1(b) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, with respect to the following:

<p>     (a) all products classified (or classifiable) with Harmonized System (1996)("HS") headings listed in Attachment A to the Annex to this Declaration; and

<p>     (b) all products specified in Attachment B to the Annex to this Declaration, whether or not they are included in Attachment A;

<p>through equal rate reductions of customs duties beginning in 1997 and concluding in 2000, recognizing that extended staging of reductions and, before implementation, expansion of product coverage may be necessary in limited circumstances.

<p>  3. Ministers express satisfaction about the large product coverage     outlined in the Attachments to the Annex to this Declaration.  They     instruct their respective officials to make good faith efforts to finalize plurilateral technical discussions in Geneva on the basis of these modalities, and instruct these officials to complete this work by 31 January 1997, so as to ensure the implementation of this Declaration by the largest number of participants.

<p>  4. Ministers invite the Ministers of other Members of the WTO, and States     or separate customs territories in the process of acceding to the WTO, to provide similar instructions to their respective officials, so that they may participate in the technical discussions referred to in paragraph 3 above and participate fully in the expansion of world trade in information technology products.

<p>Annex: Modalities and Product Coverage

<p>Attachment A: list of HS headings

<p>Attachment B: list of products

<p>

<p>ANNEX

<p>Modalities and Product Coverage

<p>Any Member of the World Trade Organization, or State or separate customs territory in the process of acceding to the WTO, may participate in the expansion of world trade in information technology products in accordance with the following modalities:

<p>  1. Each participant shall incorporate the measures described in paragraph     2 of the Declaration into its schedule to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, and, in addition, at either its own tariff line level or the Harmonized System (1996) ("HS") 6-digit level in either its official tariff or any other published versions of the tariff schedule, whichever is ordinarily used by importers and exporters. Each participant that is not a Member of the WTO shall implement these measures on an autonomous basis, pending completion of its WTO accession, and shall incorporate these measures into its WTO     market access schedule for goods.

<p>  2. To this end, as early as possible and no later than 1 March 1997 each     participant shall provide all other participants a document containing (a) the details concerning how the appropriate duty treatment will be provided in its WTO schedule of concessions, and (b) a list of the detailed HS headings involved for products specified in Attachment B.  These documents will be reviewed and approved on a consensus basis and this review process shall be completed no later than 1 April 1997. As soon as this review process has been completed for any such document, that document shall be submitted as a modification to the Schedule of the participant concerned, in accordance with the Decision of 26 March 1980 on Procedures for Modification and Rectification of Schedules of Tariff Concessions (BISD 27S/25).

<p>     (a) The concessions to be proposed by each participant as modifications to its Schedule shall bind and eliminate all customs duties and other duties and charges of any kind on information technology products as follows:

<p>         (i) elimination of such customs duties shall take place through rate reductions in equal steps, except as may be otherwise agreed by the participants.  Unless otherwise agreed by the participants, each participant shall bind all tariffs on items listed in the Attachments no later than 1 July 1997, and shall make the first such rate reduction effective no later than 1 July 1997, the second such rate reduction no later than 1 January 1998, and the third such rate reduction no later than 1 January 1999, and the elimination of customs duties shall be completed effective no later than 1 January 2000.  The participants agree to encourage autonomous elimination of customs duties prior to these dates.  The reduced rate should in each stage be rounded off to the first decimal; and

<p>        (ii) elimination of such other duties and charges of any kind, within the meaning of Article II:1(b) of the General Agreement, shall be completed by 1 July 1997, except as may be otherwise specified in the participant's document provided to other participants for review.

<p>     (b) The modifications to its Schedule to be proposed by a participant order to implement its binding and elimination of customs duties on information technology products shall achieve this result:

<p>        (i) in the case of the HS headings listed in Attachment A, by creating,where appropriate, sub-divisions in its Schedule at the national tariff line level; and

<p>        (ii) in the case of the products specified in Attachment B, by attaching an annex to its Schedule including all products in Attachment B, which is to specify the detailed HS headings for those products at either the national tariff line level or the HS 6-digit level.

<p>Each participant shall promptly modify its national tariff schedule to reflect the modifications it has proposed, as soon as they have entered into effect.

<p>  3. Participants shall meet periodically under the auspices of the Council     on Trade in Goods to review the product coverage specified in the     Attachments, with a view to agreeing, by consensus, whether in the light of technological developments, experience in applying the tariff concessions, or changes to the HS nomenclature, the Attachments should be modified to incorporate additional products, and to consult on non-tariff barriers to trade in information technology products. Such consultations shall be without prejudice to rights and obligations under the WTO Agreement.

<p>  4. Participants shall meet as soon as practicable and in any case no     later than 1 April 1997 to review the state of acceptances received and to assess the conclusions to be drawn therefrom.  Participants will implement the actions foreseen in the Declaration provided that participants representing approximately 90 per cent of world trade in information technology products have by then notified their acceptance, and provided that the staging has been agreed to the participants' satisfaction.  In assessing whether to implement actions foreseen in the Declaration, if the percentage of world trade     represented by participants falls somewhat short of 90 per cent of world trade in information technology products, participants may take into account the extent of the participation of States or separate customs territories representing for them the substantial bulk of their own trade in such products.  At this meeting the participants will establish whether these criteria have been met.

<p>  5. Participants shall meet as often as necessary and no later than 30     September 1997 to consider any divergence among them in classifying     information technology products, beginning with the products specified in Attachment B.  Participants agree on the common objective of achieving, where appropriate, a common classification for these products within existing HS nomenclature, giving consideration to interpretations and rulings of the Customs Co-operation Council (also known as the World Customs Organization or "WCO").  In any instance in which a divergence in classification remains, participants will consider whether a joint suggestion could be made to the WCO with regard to updating existing HS nomenclature or resolving divergence in     interpretation of the HS nomenclature.

<p>  6. The participants understand that Article XXIII of the General     Agreement will address nullification or impairment of benefits accruing directly or indirectly to a WTO Member participant through the implementation of this Declaration as a result of the application by another WTO Member participant of any measure, whether or not that measure conflicts with the provisions of the General Agreement.

<p>  7. Each participant shall afford sympathetic consideration to any request     for consultation from any other participant concerning the undertakings set out above. Such consultations shall be without prejudice to rights and obligations under the WTO Agreement.

<p>  8. Participants acting under the auspices of the Council for Trade in     Goods shall inform other Members of the WTO and States or separate customs territories in the process of acceding to the WTO of these modalities and initiate consultations with a view to facilitate their participation in the expansion of trade in information technology products on the basis of the Declaration.

<p>  9. As used in these modalities, the term "participant" shall mean those     Members of the WTO, or States or separate customs territories in the     process of acceding to the WTO, that provide the document described in     paragraph 2 no later than 1 March 1997.

<p> 10. This Annex shall be open for acceptance by all Members of the WTO and     any State or any separate customs territory in the process of acceding to the WTO.  Acceptances shall be notified in writing to the Director-General who shall communicate them to all participants.

<b>TEXT: SINGAPORE WTO MINISTERIAL DECLARATION
<br>(Ministers reach ITA accord, set up trade working groups)</b><br>

<p>Singapore -- Trade ministers from more than 120 countries have concluded a week-long ministerial that reached agreement in a number of key areas, topped by an Information Technology Agreement (ITA) among a number of the major participants to eliminate tariffs on a range of high-technology goods by the year 2000.

<p>In a final communique issued on the final day of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) December 9-13 first ministerial meeting, the ministers also committed to conclude by next February an agreement on basic telecommunication services.

<p>There was little progress on discussions to allow more countries to join the 128-member WTO, the most prominent of the accession applications coming from China.  The communique states that it is important that the applicants offer "meaningful market access commitments," and that the WTO would work "expeditiously" to bring these countries into the WTO system.

<p>On a U.S. initiative to include labor standards in the WTO work program, the communique includes a brief statement that the International Labor Organization "is the competent body to set and deal with these standards," but that the WTO members also "reject the use of labor standards for protectionist purposes."

<p>The ministers agreed to set up a working group to examine the relationship between trade and investment and another to study issues relating to trade and competition policy, including anti-competitive practices.

<p>And they agreed to another group that would study transparency in government procurement practices, with the idea of moving toward an international agreement on this issue.

<p>The ministers further agreed to uphold commitments made in the Uruguay Round global trade accord that calls for moving forward with new agricultural trade liberalization negotiations beginning in 1999.

<p>The WTO members approved a plan of action to help the poorest countries that includes technical assistance but makes no mention of a proposal by WTO Director General Renato Ruggiero to eliminate tariffs for the world's poorest countries.

<p>The WTO said it would organize a meeting in 1997 with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) that would examine how to improve trade opportunities for these poorest members.

<p>The ministers expressed disappointment that a number of member countries have failed to notify the WTO, as required under the Uruguay Round accords, when trade measures or legislation are enacted.

<p>Following is the text of the final communique:

<p>(begin text)
Purpose

<p>
1. We, the Ministers, have met in Singapore from 9 to 13 December 1996 for the first regular biennial meeting of the WTO at Ministerial level, as called for in Article IV of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, to further strengthen the WTO as a forum for negotiation, the continuing liberalization of trade within a rule-based system, and the multilateral review and assessment of trade policies, and in particular to:
-- assess the implementation of our commitments under the WTO Agreements and decisions;
-- review the ongoing negotiations and Work Programme;
-- examine developments in world trade; and
-- address the challenges of an evolving world economy.
Trade and Economic Growth

<p>2.  For nearly 50 years Members have sought to fulfill, first in the GATT and now in the WTO, the objectives reflected in the preamble to the WTO Agreement of conducting our trade relations with a view to raising standards of living worldwide.
The rise in global trade facilitated by trade liberalization within the rules-based system has created more and better-paid jobs in many countries.  The achievements of the WTO during its first two years bear witness to our desire to work together to make the most of the possibilities that the multilateral system provides to promote sustainable growth and development while contributing to a more stable and secure climate in international relations.

<p>Integration of Economics; Opportunities and Challenges
3.  We believe that the scope and pace of change in the international economy, including the growth in trade in services and direct investment, and the increasing integration of economies offer unprecedented opportunities for improved growth, job creation, and development.  These developments require adjustment by economies and societies.  They also pose challenges to the trading system.  We commit ourselves to address these challenges.

<p>Core Labor Standards
4.  We renew our commitment to the observance of internationally recognized core labour standards.  The International Labour Organization (ILO) is the competent body to set and deal with these standards, and we affirm our support for its work in promoting them.
We believe that economic growth and development fostered by increased trade and further trade liberalization contribute to the promotion of these standards.  We reject the use of labour standards for protectionist purposes, and agree that the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-wage developing countries, must in no way be put into question.  In this regard, we note that the WTO and ILO Secretariats will continue their existing collaboration.

<p>Marginalization
5.  We commit ourselves to address the problem of marginalization for least-developed countries, and the risk of it for certain developing countries.  We will also continue to work for greater coherence in international economic policy-making and for improved coordination between the WTO and other agencies in providing technical assistance.

<p>Role of WTO
6.  In pursuit of the goal of sustainable growth and development for the common good, we envisage a world where trade flows freely.  To this end we renew our commitment to:
-- a fair, equitable and more open rule-based system;
-- progressive liberalization and elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in goods;-- progressive liberalization of trade in services;
-- rejection of all forms of protectionism;
-- elimination of discriminatory treatment in international trade relations;
-- integration of developing and least-developed countries and economies in transition into the multilateral system;  and
-- the maximum possible level of transparency.

<p>Regional Agreements
7.  We note that trade relations of WTO Members are being increasingly influenced by regional trade agreements, which have expanded vastly in number, scope and coverage.  Such initiatives can promote further liberalization and may assist least-developed, developing and transition economies in integrating into the international trading system.
In this context, we note the importance of existing regional arrangements involving developing and least-developed countries.  The expansion and extent of regional trade agreements make it important to analyze whether the system of WTO rights and obligations as it relates to regional trade agreements needs to be further clarified.  We reaffirm the primacy of the multilateral trading system, which includes a framework for the development of regional trade agreements, and we renew our commitment to ensure that regional trade agreements are complementary to it and consistent with its rules.  In this regard, we welcome the establishment and endorse the work of the new Committee on Regional Trade Agreements.  We shall continue to work through progressive liberalization in the WTO as we are committed in the WTO Agreement and Decisions adopted at Marrakesh, and in so doing facilitate mutually supportive processes of global and regional trade liberalization.

<p>Accession
8.  It is important that the 28 applicants now negotiating accession contribute to completing the accession process by accepting the WTO rules and by offering meaningful market access commitments.  We will work to bring these applicants expeditiously into the WTO system.

<p>Dispute Settlement
9.  The Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) offers a means for the settlement of disputes among Members that is unique in international agreements.  We consider its impartial and transparent operation to be of fundamental importance in assuring the resolution of trade disputes, and in fostering the implementation and application of the WTO agreements.  The Understanding, with its predictable procedures, including the possibility of appeal of panel decisions to an Appellate Body and provisions on implementation of recommendations, has improved Members' means of resolving their differences.  We believe that the DSU has worked effectively during its first two years.  We also note the role that several WTO bodies have played in helping to avoid disputes. We renew our determination to abide by the rules and procedures of the DSU and other WTO agreements in the conduct of our trade relations and the settlement of disputes.  We are confident that longer experience with the DSU, including the implementation of panel and appellate recommendations, will further enhance the effectiveness and credibility of the dispute settlement system.

<p>Implementation
10.  We attach high priority to full and effective implementation of the WTO Agreement in a manner consistent with the goal of trade liberalization.  Implementation thus far has been generally satisfactory, although some Members have expressed dissatisfaction with certain aspects.  It is clear that further effort in this area is required, as indicated by the relevant WTO bodies in their reports.  Implementation of the specific commitments scheduled by Members with respect to market access in industrial goods and trade in services appears to be proceeding smoothly.  With respect to industrial market access, monitoring of implementation would be enhanced by the timely availability of trade and tariff data.  Progress has  been made  also in advancing the WTO reform programme in agriculture, including in implementation of agreed market access concessions and domestic subsidy and export subsidy commitments.

<p>Notifications and Legislation
11.  Compliance with notification requirements has not been fully satisfactory.  Because the WTO system relies on mutual monitoring as a means to assess implementation, those Members which have not submitted notifications in a timely manner, or whose notifications are not complete, should renew their efforts.  At the same time, the relevant bodies should take appropriate steps to promote full compliance while considering practical proposals for simplifying the notification process.

<p>Developing Countries
12.  Where legislation is needed to implement WTO rules, Members are mindful of their obligations to complete their domestic legislative process without further delay.  Those Members entitled to transition periods are urged to take steps as they deem necessary to ensure timely implementation of obligations as they come into effect. Each Member should carefully review all its existing or proposed legislation, programmes and measures to ensure their full compatibility with the WTO obligations, and should carefully consider points made during review in the relevant WTO bodies regarding the WTO consistency of legislation, programmes and measures, and make appropriate changes where necessary.
13.  The integration of developing countries in the multilateral trading system is important for their economic development and for global trade expansion. In this connection, we recall that the WTO Agreement embodies provisions conferring differential and more favourable treatment for developing countries, including special attention to the particular situation of least-developed countries.  We acknowledge the fact that developing country Members have undertaken significant new commitments, both substantive and procedural, and we recognize the range and complexity of the efforts that they are making to comply with them.  In order to assist them in these efforts, including those with respect to notification and legislative requirements, we will improve the availability of technical assistance under the agreed guidelines.  We have also agreed to recommendations relative to the decision we took at Marrakesh concerning the possible negative effects of the agricultural reform programme on least-developed and net food-importing developing countries.

<p>Least-Developed Countries
14.  We remain concerned by the problems of the least-developed countries and have agreed to:
-- a Plan of Action, including provision for taking positive measures, for example duty-free access, on an autonomous basis, aimed at improving their overall capacity to respond to the opportunities offered by the trading system;
-- seek to give operational content to the Plan of Action, for example, by enhancing conditions for investment and providing predictable and favourable market access conditions for LLDCs' products, to foster the expansion and diversification of their exports to the markets of all developed countries;  and in the case of relevant developing countries in the context of the Global System of Trade Preferences;  and
-- organize a meeting with UNCTAD and the International Trade Centre as soon as possible in 1997, with the participation of aid agencies, multilateral financial institutions and least-developed countries to foster an integrated approach to assisting these countries in enhancing their trading opportunities.

<p>Textiles and Clothing
15.  We confirm our commitment to full and faithful implementation of the provisions of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC).  We stress the importance of the integration of textile products, as provided for in the ATC, into GATT 1994 under its strengthened rules and disciplines because of its systemic significance for the rule-based, non-discriminatory trading system and its contribution to the increase in export earnings of developing countries.  We attach importance to the implementation of this Agreement so as to ensure an effective transition to GATT 1994 by way of integration which is progressive in character.  The use of safeguard measures in accordance with ATC provisions should be as sparing as possible.  We note concerns regarding the use of other trade distortive measures and circumvention.  We reiterate the importance of fully implementing the provisions of the ATC relating to small suppliers, new entrants and least-developed country Members, as well as those relating to cotton-producing exporting Members.  We recognize the importance of wool products for some developing country Members.  We reaffirm that as part of the integration process and with reference to the specific commitments undertaken by the Members as a result of the Uruguay Round, all Members shall take such action as may be necessary to abide by GATT 1994 rules and disciplines so as to achieve improved market access for textiles and clothing products.  We agree that, keeping in view its quasi-judicial nature, the Textiles Monitoring Body (TMB) should achieve transparency in providing rationale for its findings and recommendations.  We expect that the TMB shall make findings and recommendations whenever called upon to do so under the Agreement.  We emphasize the responsibility of the Goods Council in overseeing, in accordance with Article IV:5 of the WTO Agreement and Article 8 of the ATC, the functioning of the ATC, whose implementation is being supervised by the TMB.

<p>Trade and Environment
16.  The Committee on Trade and Environment has made an important contribution towards fulfilling its Work Programme.  The Committee has been examining and will continue to examine, inter alia, the scope of the complementarities between trade liberalization, economic development and environmental protection.  Full implementation of the WTO Agreements will make an important contribution to achieving the objectives of sustainable development.  The work of the Committee has underlined the importance of policy coordination at the national level in the area of trade and environment.  In this connection, the work of the Committee has been enriched by the participation of environmental as well as trade experts from Member governments and the further participation of such experts in the Committee's deliberations would be welcomed.  The breadth and complexity of the issues covered by the Committee's Work Programme shows that further work needs to be undertaken on all items of its agenda, as contained in its report.  We intend to build on the work accomplished thus far, and therefore direct the Committee to carry out its work, reporting to the General Council, under its existing terms of reference.

<p>Services Negotiations
17. The fulfillment of the objectives agreed at Marrakesh for negotiations on the improvement of market access in services - in financial services, movement of natural persons, maritime transport services and basic telecommunications - has proved to be difficult.  The results have been below expectations.  In three areas, it has been necessary to prolong negotiations beyond the original deadlines.  We are determined to obtain a progressively higher level of liberalization in services on a mutually advantageous basis with appropriate flexibility for individual developing country Members, as envisaged in the Agreement, in the continuing negotiations and those scheduled to begin no later than 1 January 2000.  In this context, we look forward to full MFN agreements based on improved market access commitments and national treatment.  Accordingly, we will:
-- achieve a successful conclusion to the negotiations on basic telecommunications in February 1997;  and
-- resume financial services negotiations in April 1997 with the aim of achieving significantly improved market access commitments with a broader level of participation in the agreed time frame.
With the same broad objectives in mind, we also look forward to a successful conclusion of the negotiations on Maritime Transport Services in the next round of negotiations on services liberalization.
In professional services, we shall aim at completing the work on the accountancy sector by the end of 1997, and will continue to develop  multilateral disciplines and guidelines.  In this connection, we encourage the successful completion of international standards in the accountancy sector by IFAC, IASC, and IOSCO.  With respect to GATS rules, we shall undertake the necessary work with a view to completing the negotiations on safeguards by the end of 1997.  We also note that more analytical work will be needed on emergency safeguards measures, government procurement in services and subsidies.

<p>ITA and Pharmaceuticals
18.  Taking note that a number of Members have agreed  on a  Declaration on Trade in Information Technology Products, we welcome the initiative taken by a number of WTO Members and other States or separate customs territories which have applied to accede to the WTO, who have agreed to tariff elimination for trade in information technology products on an MFN basis as well as the addition by a number of Members of over 400 products to their lists of tariff-free products in pharmaceuticals.

<p>Work Programme and Built-in Agenda
19.  Bearing in mind that an important aspect of WTO activities is a continuous overseeing of the implementation of various agreements, a periodic examination and updating of the WTO Work Programme is a key to enable the WTO to fulfill its objectives.  In this context, we endorse the reports of the various WTO bodies.  A major share of the Work Programme stems from the WTO Agreement and decisions adopted at Marrakesh.  As part of these Agreements and decisions we agreed to a number of provisions calling for future negotiations on Agriculture, Services and aspects of TRIPS, or reviews and other work on Anti-Dumping, Customs Valuation, Dispute Settlement Understanding, Import Licensing, Preshipment Inspection, Rules of Origin, Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary Measures, Safeguards, Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Technical Barriers to Trade, Textiles and Clothing, Trade Policy Review Mechanism, Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and Trade-Related Investment Measures.  We agree to a process of analysis and exchange of information, where provided for in the conclusions and recommendations of the relevant WTO bodies, on the Built-in Agenda issues, to allow Members to better understand the issues involved and identify their interests before undertaking the agreed negotiations and reviews.  We agree that:
-- the time frames established in the Agreements will be respected in each case;
-- the work undertaken shall not prejudge the scope of future negotiations where such negotiations are called for;  and
-- the work undertaken shall not prejudice the nature of the activity agreed upon (i.e. negotiation or review).

<p>Investment and Competition
20.  Having regard to the existing WTO provisions on matters related to investment and competition policy and the built-in agenda in these areas, including under the TRIMs Agreement, and on the understanding that the work undertaken shall not prejudge whether negotiations will be initiated in the future, we also agree to:
-- establish a working group to examine the relationship between trade and investment; and
-- establish a working group to study issues raised by Members relating to the interaction between trade and competition policy, including anti-competitive practices, in order to identify any areas that may merit further consideration in the WTO framework.
These groups shall draw upon each other's work if necessary and also draw upon and be without prejudice to the work in UNCTAD and other appropriate intergovernmental fora.  As regards UNCTAD, we welcome the work under way as provided for in the Midrand Declaration and the contribution it can make to the understanding of issues.  In the conduct of the work of the working groups, we encourage cooperation with the above organizations to make the best use of available resources and to ensure that the development dimension is taken fully into account.  The General Council will keep the work of each body under review, and will determine after two years how the work of each body should proceed.  It is clearly understood that future negotiations, if any, regarding multilateral disciplines in these areas, will take place only after an explicit consensus decision is taken among WTO Members regarding such negotiations.

<p>Transparency in Government Procurement

<p>21. We further agree to:
-- establish a working group to conduct a study on transparency in government procurement practices, taking into account national policies, and, based on this study, to develop elements for inclusion in an appropriate agreement;  and

<p>Trade Facilitation

-- direct the Council for Trade in Goods to undertake exploratory and analytical work, drawing on the work of other relevant international organizations, on the simplification of trade procedures in order to assess the scope for WTO rules in this area.  
22. In the organization of the work referred to in paragraphs 20 and 21, careful attention will be given to minimizing the burdens on delegations, especially those with more limited resources, and to coordinating meetings with those of relevant UNCTAD bodies.  The technical cooperation programme of the Secretariat will be available to developing and, in particular, least-developed country Members to facilitate their participation in this work.
23. Noting that the 50th anniversary of the multilateral trading system will occur early in 1998, we instruct the General Council to consider how this historic event can best be commemorated.
Finally, we express our warmest thanks to the Chairman of the Ministerial Conference, Mr. Yeo Cheow Tong, for his personal contribution to the success of this Ministerial Conference.  We also want to express our sincere gratitude to Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, his colleagues in the Government of Singapore and the people of Singapore for their warm hospitality and the excellent organization they have provided.  The fact that this first Ministerial Conference of the WTO has been held at Singapore is an additional manifestation of Singapore's commitment to an open world trading system.

<b>TEXT: WTO PLAN OF ACTION FOR LEAST-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES<br>
(Proposes exploring preferential market access)</b><br>

<p>Singapore -- Trade ministers at the World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting in Singapore have adopted an action plan to assist the least-developed countries that are members.

<p>The plan approved December 13 proposes, but does not require, that developed country members explore ways for giving preferential market access to the least-developed countries in line with WTO rules.

<p>It also encourages implementation of the Uruguay Round textile agreement and acceleration of other Uruguay Round commitments by WTO members in ways that benefit least-developed countries.

<p>The plan also identifies ways that WTO members could offer least-developed countries technical assistance to meet their own WTO obligations and to take advantage of other members' obligations.

<p>Concerning the idea for a WTO preferential tariff scheme applicable to least-developed countries only, the plan says only that individual WTO members may study its feasibility.

<p>Following is the text of the WTO plan of action:

<p>
(begin text)

<p>WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION
MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE
SINGAPORE, 9-13 DECEMBER 1996

<p>COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED
WTO PLAN OF ACTION
FOR THE LEAST-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

<p>At its meeting on 7, 8 and 13 November 1996 the General Council approved the following draft WTO Plan of Action for the Least-Developed Countries and agreed to submit it for adoption by the Ministerial Conference.

<p>Preamble

<p>  1. The WTO Decision on Measures in Favour of Least-Developed Countries      provides for WTO Members to adopt positive measures in favour of least-developed countries.  Other WTO legal instruments contain additional provisions for, inter alia, enhancing their trading opportunities and their integration into the multilateral trading system.  The implementation of these commitments remained a priority for WTO Members.  Similar objectives have led to initiatives launched by other agencies including the United Nations, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the International Trade Centre (ITC), the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

<p>  2. A comprehensive approach, bringing together national efforts and those      of the international community, is required to achieve growth in least-developed countries through appropriate macroeconomic policies, supply-side measures and improved market access.  Least-developed countries wishing to take advantage of the opportunities provided for in some WTO Agreements to attract foreign direct investment should be assisted.

<p>  3. This Plan of Action offers a comprehensive approach and includes measures relating to the implementation of the Decision in Favour of Least-Developed Countries, as well as in the areas of capacity-building and market access from a WTO perspective.  It envisages a closer cooperation between the WTO and other multilateral agencies assisting least-developed countries.  This is also in conformity with the Marrakesh Declaration on the Contribution of the WTO to Achieving Greater Coherence in Global Economic Policymaking, a central purpose of which is to contribute to the expansion of trade, sustainable growth and development of developing countries, including least-developed countries, through the closer cooperation of the WTO with the World Bank and the IMF.

<p>  4. The WTO Plan of Action will be applied in respect of the least developed countries designated as such by the United Nations which are Members of the WTO.

<p>
I. Implementation of the Decision on Measures in Favour of Least-Developed Countries

<p>  5. While the Decision on Measures in Favour of Least-Developed Countries contains calls for action, the following could contribute to a more effective implementation.

<p>       a. The WTO Members shall step up their efforts to improve the capacity of least-developed countries' to meet their notification obligations.

<p>       b. An effective review every two years in the Committee on Trade and Development (in accordance with its terms of reference) on the basis of reports by the Chairpersons of the relevant WTO Bodies and other available information of the implementation of measures in favour of least-developed countries.  This should coincide with the Ministerial Conferences.

<p>       c. The WTO Bodies are invited to identify means to assist least-developed countries in implementing their WTO commitments.

<p>       d. The Committee on Trade and Development will explore ways of ensuring greater disclosure of the application of the Uruguay Round provisions in favour of least-developed countries (1); and, of increasing efforts to disseminate information relating to those provisions.

<p>     (1) For example, by improving the flow of information, in particular (a)      from Members offering the benefits to Members potentially using them and (b) from all Members to the Committee.

<p>
II. Human and Institutional Capacity-Building

<p>  6. In the Guidelines for WTO Technical Cooperation, least-developed countries are priority beneficiaries.  The Members of the WTO shall ensure that this priority is assigned to least-developed countries, and in accordance with the Guidelines, the effectiveness of the technical cooperation will be continually evaluated against this priority.

<p>  7. With a view to assisting in the institutional capacity-building in the area of trade, the WTO shall work with other relevant agencies to develop a comprehensive approach and outline a division of labour, in particular with UNCTAD and the ITC, as well as with UNDP, the World Bank, IMF and Regional Banks.  The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD should also be involved.  With regard to supply-side constraints, priority should be attached to export diversification and facilitating the implementation of commitments to allow least-developed countries to benefit from the new market opportunities deriving from the Uruguay Round.  The WTO should cooperate with other relevant institutions in order to encourage a favourable investment climate.

<p>  8. Joint WTO/ITC training courses could be organized for public sector officials and the private sector.

<p>  9. The WTO should explore the availability of resources for the provision of technical assistance to least-developed countries by developing countries with successful experiences in trade.

<p> 10. The participation of least-developed countries' officials in WTO meetings would be financed by strictly voluntary contributions.

<p>
III. Market Access

<p> 11. The initiatives proposed below are presented as options to be examined by WTO Members in the light of the Singapore Ministerial Conference to improve the access to the markets of exports of least-developed countries.  Further consideration should be given to additional multilateral action and coordination in this endeavour.

<p>        -- Developed country Members, and developing country Members on an autonomous basis, would explore the possibilities of granting preferential duty-free access for the exports of least-developed countries.  In both cases exceptions could be provided for.

<p>        -- WTO Members should endeavour to make use, when possible, of the relevant provisions of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing to increase market access opportunities for least-developed countries.

<p>        -- Whenever provided for in the WTO Agreements, Members may decide to extend unilaterally and on an autonomous basis, certain benefits to least-developed countries' suppliers.

<p>        -- WTO Members should pursue, on an autonomous basis, preferential policies and liberalization undertakings in order to further facilitate access to their markets for least-developed countries' exports, such as an early implementation of Uruguay Round undertakings.

<p>
IV. Other Initiatives

<p> 12. The Secretariat shall provide factual and legal information to assist acceding least-developed countries in drawing up their Memorandum on the Foreign Trade Regime, as well as their Schedules of Concessions for goods and Commitments in services.

<p> 13. In accordance with its mandate, the WTO shall endeavour to work jointly with other relevant multilateral and regional institutions to induce investment in least-developed countries as a result of new trade opportunities.

<p> 14. Individual Members may study the feasibility of binding preferential tariff rates in a WTO preferential scheme which would be applicable to least-developed countries only.

<b>TEXT:  USTR PRESS RELEASE ON WTO RULING ON JAPAN LIQUOR TAXES<br>
(WTO finds Japan's foreign liquor taxes discriminatory)</b>

<p>Washington -- The Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has upheld the complaint against Japan concerning Japan's taxation of certain distilled spirits, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) said in an October 4 press release.

<p>"Once again, we have used the WTO procedures to open markets," Acting USTR Barshefsky said.  The WTO decision attacks a major barrier to U.S. exports of Bourbon whisky, vodka and other distilled spirits to Japan.

<p>Following is the official text of the press release:

<p>(begin official text)

<p>U.S. WINS WTO APPELLATE CASE AGAINST JAPAN

<p>Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky announced today that the WTO Appellate Body has decided in favor of the complaint brought by the United States and others against Japan concerning Japan's discriminatory taxation of distilled spirits.  The decision attacks a major barrier to U.S. exports of Bourbon whisky, vodka and other distilled spirits to Japan.

<p>Japan is the second largest export market for U.S. distilled spirits.  Exports have reached $100 million per year even in spite of the heavy taxes on whisky and other Western-type distilled spirits, which are many times the taxes on shochu (a traditional Japanese spirit).  The WTO dispute findings confirm and strengthen a 1987 GATT ruling that Japan's liquor taxes discriminate against imports.

<p>The United States, the European Community and Canada initiated WTO dispute settlement procedures against Japan in July 1995 concerning Japan's taxes on distilled spirits.  Japan appealed the panel decision on August 9, 1996.  The Appellate Body ruling, circulated on October 4, 1996, finds that Japan's tax system discriminates against imports, and recommends that Japan be requested to change its tax system to eliminate the discrimination.

<p>"Once again, we have used the WTO procedures to open markets," Ambassador Barshefsky said.  "Given the long-standing nature of this dispute, we will work to ensure prompt implementation by Japan."

<b>TEXT:  USTR PRESS RELEASE AT END OF WTO MINISTERIAL MEETING<br>
(Praises sweeping info-tech agreement, WTO process)</b><br>

<p>Singapore -- Acting U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Charlene Barshefsky hailed a sweeping new agreement to eliminate tariffs on global information-technology products by the year 2000, reached during the first World Trade Organization ministerial meeting December 9 to 13.

<p>The Information-Technology Agreement (ITA) was formally endorsed on the final day of the ministerial by 28 countries, representing about 85 percent of global trade, the USTR said in a December 13 press release.  Six additional countries also declared their intent to sign the agreement.  Once these countries take action, the total trade represented by the signatories will exceed the 90 percent of global IT trade needed for the agreement to take effect.

<p>The agreement covers trade in semiconductors, telecommunications equipment, computers and computer equipment and software products.

<p>Achieving the ITA during the WTO ministerial was a key U.S. priority.  The U.S. delegation, headed by Barshefsky, held bilateral and small-group discussions with the European Union and other primarily Asian countries on the periphery of formal meetings throughout the ministerial.

<p>According to the USTR press release, the United States also is pleased with the progress made by the ministers on such issues as transparency in government procurement, core labor standards, basic telecommunications services negotiations, agriculture, investment and competition.

<p>The following is the text of the USTR press release:

<p>(Begin text)

<p>Singapore -- Acting United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky today announced a sweeping Information Technology Agreement (ITA) to eliminate tariffs on global information technology products -- semiconductors, telecommunications equipment, computers and computer equipment and software products.

<p>The information technology (IT) sector represents a trillion dollars in global production.  Trade flows based upon the 1995 volume of $500 billion  represents the baseline for "critical mass" in IT product coverage.  For the agreement to take effect, participating countries must constitute at least 90 percent of global IT trade.  In addition to countries formally endorsing the agreement today, commitments were also received from a number of other nations.  Malaysia, Philippines, and four other countries declared their intent to join the agreement.  Together these six countries comprise about 6 percent of global IT trade.

<p>In addition to the United States, the 28 countries signing the agreement are Australia, Canada, Taiwan, European Union (counted as 15 countries), Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and Turkey.

<p>Countries participating in this agreement will eliminate tariffs on information technology products by the year 2000 on a wide range of technology products, recognizing that limited exceptions may be required.  Technical details on staging -- the pace at which product tariffs are reduced from current levels to zero by the year 2000 -- will be worked out in Geneva.  The Geneva discussions begin in January 1997 and culminate with an April 1, 1997 review of country-specific schedules of commitments and the percent of world trade covered.

<p>The agreement will become effective on July 1, 1997 at which point countries will begin to see immediate benefits; it is anticipated that in some product areas such as semiconductors that staging would be accelerated dramatically, well in advance of the year 2000.

<p>President Clinton called from the White House on Friday morning to congratulate Ambassador Barshefsky on the Information Technology Agreement.  She outlined the benefits of the agreement for increased world trade including the new economic opportunities for American business expansion and job creation that are likely to occur as a result of the agreement.  Currently, the IT industry in the U.S. employs 1.8 million Americans with 1995 exports running at over $90 billion in IT goods.  She praised the President's personal efforts on behalf of the ITA, noting the decisive boost the ITA received when the APEC leaders endorsed the initiative at the recent APEC meeting in Manila.
 
Trade ministers have agreed that their technical experts will address detailed product staging issues immediately at the WTO in the weeks ahead -- the conventional procedure in tariff reduction agreements.

<p>With regard to other issues in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration, Ambassador Barshefsky noted that some important progress was made with regard to a number of U.S. objectives:

<p>Procurement.  The study on procurement is intended to be the first step toward an agreement on transparency practices in government procurement which should serve to reduce the influence of corruption.  This initiative will -- as we continue to push it -- help create an environment where businesses can expect a fair shake in competing for contracts with foreign governments.

<p>Labor Rights.  Since the Eisenhower Administration, the United States has sought a framework from which to pursue its objectives on core labor standards in the context of global trade.  By core labor standards the United States' means the right of association, right to collective bargaining prohibition on child labor, non-discrimination in employment and prohibition on forced labor.  This negotiation was extraordinarily difficult and the convergence of views achieved is no small accomplishment.  It establishes a balanced framework for how this issue should be dealt with in the future.  The effort made at Singapore will help ensure collaborative efforts between the WTO and the ILO.

<p>Basic Telecom.  Good progress was also made this week on advancing the negotiations on basic telecom.  Following a meeting co-chaired on Monday by Ambassador Barshefsky and FCC Chairman Reed Hundt a number of countries announced that in January they will present new or improved offers.  The United States is hopeful, as a result of this week, it will be able to conclude these talks successfully in February by getting high quality offers from a critical mass of countries.

<p>Agriculture.  One of the key issues in the Conference was to review implementation of Uruguay Round commitments and enforcement of obligations.  This is of particular importance to U.S. agriculture.  Today's Ministerial Declaration guarantees that negotiations to continue the reform process in a number of areas, including agriculture, will remain consistent with the timetable agreed to in Marrakesh.

<p>During her remarks, Ambassador Barshefsky highlighted that the groundwork for the 1999 negotiations will go forward in 1997 and outlined its importance to American agriculture.

<p>She noted that U.S. agriculture still faces serious impediments around the world.  Import barriers, state trading enterprises, export subsidies and unjustifiable sanitary and phytosanitary regulations still hamper U.S. agriculture exports.  The outcome of this Ministerial offers us the opportunity to attack these problems head-on.

<p>Ambassador Barshefsky also praised the private sector and congressional delegations for their participation in the WTO process.

<p>Investment.  On this subject, the United States is satisfied that the WTO work program on investment will not endanger the OECD investment negotiations in Paris, which are scheduled to conclude in May 1997.  The purpose of the OECD negotiations is to obtain a high-standard multilateral investment agreement that will protect U.S. investors abroad.

<p>Competition.  The United States' position on this issue ensures that work on competition will not threaten our laws which protect the principles of fair pricing and fair competition.  We should not undo work within the WTO on anti-dumping issues that has barely begun.  The work plan must focus on the problems of cartels and other private anti-competitive behavior which can impede U.S. exporters' access to foreign markets.

<p>Textiles.  Nothing in the declaration will have an impact on our existing trade policies with regard to textiles.

<b>TEXT: U.S. AGRICULTURE SECRETARY GLICKMAN ON WTO MINISTERIAL<br>
(Praises reconfirmed commitment on agriculture)</b><br>

<p>Washington -- Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman has praised trade ministers meeting in Singapore for reaffirming their commitment to conduct negotiations on agricultural trade starting in 1999.

<p>Glickman made the statement December 13 upon conclusion of the World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting.  He said the Singapore Declaration from that meeting assures that momentum continues in reducing barriers in agriculture trade.

<p>Following is the text of Glickman's statement:

<p>(begin text)

<p>A major step was taken today in Singapore that will enable American agriculture to count on more open world markets in the future.  The first Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization endorsed a continuation of trade reforms in agriculture, initiated in the Uruguay Round two years ago, through a preparatory process that will lead to a new market-opening negotiations in 1999.
I am pleased that the world trading community recognized the importance of a strong reaffirmation of the agreement reached by trade ministers in Marrakesh in 1994 to begin discussions on further liberalization of agriculture trade even before implementation of the Uruguay Round agreement is finished in the year 2000.
This process will enable us to continue our efforts to further reduce import barriers, establish disciplines on state trading enterprises, eliminate export subsidies and remove unjustifiable sanitary and phytosanitary regulations.  With the growing importance of world markets to U.S. agriculture, it is vital that momentum to expand opportunities be maintained.  The Singapore Declaration will ensure that this happens.
While we gear up to move this effort forward next year in Geneva, we will also continue our efforts to ensure full implementation of commitments in existing agreements, whether multilateral, regional, or bilateral.  We will continue our efforts, using all the tools available to us, to respond to exorbitantly high tariffs, such as those maintained by Canada in a number of commodities, unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary regulations, and other trade-distorting measures around the world.
I would like to express my appreciation to Acting U.S. Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, who headed the U.S. delegation in Singapore, for her successful efforts in ensuring that agriculture remains a top priority in the WTO process.  I would also like to thank the members of the U.S. private sector who participated in the Ministerial process.  Their contribution clearly had a major positive impact on the outcome of the talks.

<b>TEXT: JOINT U.S., EU STATEMENT ON WTO AND COMPETITION POLICY<br>
(Work program won't affect antidumping standards)</b><br>

<p>Singapore -- The United States and European Union have released a joint statement saying the competition provisions in the just-concluded World Trade Organization Singapore Declaration address antitrust issues and "will not affect domestic antidumping standards and provisions."

<p>Following is the text of the joint statement by Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Sir Leon Brittan, vice president of the European Commission:

<p>(begin text)

<p>On Friday, the United States and the European Community jointly agreed on the following statement clarifying that the WTO Singapore Declaration regarding competition is specifically directed at a work plan addressing antitrust issues and will not affect domestic antidumping standards and provisions:

<p>"We warmly welcome the decision of the Ministerial conference held in Singapore on 9-13 December to set up a working group to consider competition (antitrust) questions in the WTO.

<p>"This will enable WTO Members to discuss the international dimension of competition policy and the increasing need for international cooperation in this area.

<p>"As this is a new area of work for the WTO, complementing the Organization's existing activities, the group's work should not be extended into matters already dealt with by the WTO and its various committees.  We expect the group to focus on the international dimension of competition (antitrust) rules.

<p>"It was agreed in Singapore that no negotiations will take place without an explicit consensus decision among WTO Members."

<b>TEXT:  USTR GAINS IPR COMPLIANCE IN PORTUGAL THROUGH WTO CASE<br>
(Patent-related provisions of TRIPS agreement)</b>

<p>Washington -- The office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) announced that the United States and Portugal have come to an agreement concerning Portugal's implementation of the patent-related provisions of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), administered by the World Trade Organization.

<p>"We are pleased that we are now in a position to withdraw this issue from further consideration under the auspices of the WTO," said Acting USTR Charlene Barshefsky.

<p>U.S. GAINS IPR COMPLIANCE IN PORTUGAL THROUGH WTO CASE

<p>Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky announced today that the United States and Portugal have formally settled WTO dispute settlement proceedings brought by the United States on Portugal's failure to implement fully the patent-related provisions of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), administered by the WTO.

<p>In 1995, Portugal amended its patent law to implement the TRIPS Agreement obligation to provide a patent term that lasts at least until twenty years from the date the patent application is filed.  Portugal applied this term to patents granted in the future, but refused to recognize that the TRIPS Agreement also obligates it to apply this term to patents still in effect on January 1, 1996.  Several U.S. companies complained that they stood to lose significant revenues if the longer TRIPS patent term was not applied to their existing patents.  The United States initiated WTO dispute settlement procedures against Portugal on April 30 with respect to this matter.  As a result of initiation of these procedures, Portugal now accepts that it is obligated by the TRIPS Agreement to extend at least the 20-year term to all Portuguese patents still in effect on January 1, 1996, and has issued a decree to implement this obligation.

<p>"U.S. success in settling this case demonstrates that the WTO dispute settlement process can be an effective forum to enforce U.S. rights," Ambassador Barshefsky said.  "We welcome Portugal's recognition of its WTO obligations, and its implementation of those obligations.  We are pleased that we are now in a position to withdraw this issue from further consideration under the auspices of the WTO."

<b>UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT: BARSHEFSKY ON WTO MINISTERIAL
<br>(ITA accord equivalent to billion dollar world tax cut)</b><br>

<p>Singapore -- Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky says that the "landmark" agreement to eliminate tariffs on hundreds of global information technology products is equivalent to a global tax cut totaling thousands of millions of dollars.

<p>The Information Technology Agreement (ITA), concluded at the first ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization that concluded in Singapore December 13, will go into effect once countries representing 90 percent of world trade in the products covered under the accord sign the pact.  Currently, 28 countries representing 84 percent of global trade in information technology products have committed to the ITA, Barshefsky said.

<p>"There is absolutely no question that implementation will begin in 1997," she said in a press conference here December 13 following the ministerial conference.

<p>Barshefsky also expressed satisfaction that ministers gave the go-ahead to the WTO to begin studies of transparency in government procurement, investment and competition policies.

<p>Barshefsky said that good progress had been made at the WTO meeting on advancing negotiations in basic telecommunications services and on reaffirming Uruguay Round commitments to move forward with negotiations on agricultural sector liberalization in 1999.

<p>She also commented on the mention of labor issues in the WTO declaration and the importance of collaboration between the WTO and the International Labor Organization in assuring continued public support for trade agreements negotiations.

<p>Following is an unofficial transcript of the Barshefsky briefing:

<p>(begin transcript)

<p>Let me say that I have been looking forward to this press conference because this is the first time I have sat down in five days.  Let me first introduce the people who are up here, my deputy Jeff Lane, our chief ITA negotiators Dorothy Dwoskin and Andy Stoler.  Andy also is our number two in our Geneva office.  There are many other people whose names I would like to go through, Matt Rohde and Barbara Chattin, Clayton Parker, Margaret Sullivan, and, I apologize, but any one of a number of people who have been working just day and night to bring the ITA to fruition.  But of all, I particularly want to single out Dorothy Dwoskin for her tireless, absolutely tireless efforts.

<p>Let me also begin by thanking the Singapore Government, and in particular Minister Yeo, who with very deft handling was able to bring to conclusion a ministerial declaration that dealt with many subjects formally of contention among the ministerial participants, whether on agriculture or textiles, competition policy, labor standards, investment.  All these issues presented complexity and his very able skillful handling of these matters is what helped bring the ministerial declaration to conclusion.  Also Director-General Ruggiero, who helped put everything together, the ministerial declaration as well as his assistance with respect to the ITA.

<p>I would also before I begin, thank all of the countries who worked so hard with the United States to reach what really is a landmark agreement with respect to information technology.

<p>Just a short while ago, President Clinton phoned, and he expressed has delight with the outcome of the ministerial and also his personal gratitude to the many countries that participated.  In particular, he wanted me to express his gratitude to the APEC nations which contributed.  As you know, the President was very forceful at the APEC meetings in Manila with respect to the need for APEC leaders to endorse and work toward conclusion of an ITA by the Singapore Ministerial.  That goal having been achieved, the President wanted me particularly to thank his APEC colleagues for this achievement.

<p>The Information Technology Agreement, which was achieved, will eliminate to zero tariffs on hundreds of global information technology products, whether semi-conductors or telecommunications equipment, computers, computer equipment, software, a huge gamut of products.  Product coverage at present represents five hundred billion dollars, one half trillion dollars, in global trade.  That is based on 1995 figures, so the half trillion figure is quite understated relative to what we knew was a significant important in trade in these products in 1996.

<p>The movement to zero by the year 2000 in all of these products really constitutes a global tax cut.  It means that the creation of the information superhighway will he encouraged and promoted, not taxed.  It means that countries, which produce and export these products will gain not only from tariff productions, which are very significant, but also with respect to what we know happens when tariffs are reduced.

<p>We know from 50 years of GATT experience, you reduce tariffs, trade increases exponentially, and that is exactly what will happen here.  So we have not only the savings from a global tax cut, which for U.S. industries, based on last year's figures, would have totalled over up a billion dollars, but you have, in addition, the spur of a very rapidly increased trade volumes and trade values in these products.

<p>Countries that participate in the agreement will eliminate tariffs on IT products by the year 2000 on a maximum range of product coverage.  In a very few limited cases, and this is spelled out with quite particularity, in limited cases, it may take a few more years beyond the year 2000 to get to zero tariffs.  And, of course, the United States position in Geneva, for months and months, has been absolutely that flexibility needs to be built into the agreement on IT products because, of course, we are dealing with economies that are both very developed but also much less developed, but the exception from zero by the year 2000 are explicitly "limited".

<p>Let me talk a minute about the schedule that is set out in the documents that you will review, if I can find my schedule.  If you'll bear with me for one moment.  It was right here.  O.K.  This is all spelled out in the documents that you will see. 13 December, 1996 is our ministerial declaration.  It specifies the countries that have already, and the document is about 23 pages long, that have already committed to the ITA.

<p>Let me read you the list of countries.  It is 28 countries representing 84 percent of global trade in IT products.  Those countries are Australia, Canada, Chinese Taipei, the European Communities -- that is the EC fifteen-- Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States.

<p>Apart from these 28 countries, three additional countries have told us, and have issued letters of intent today, which you will see, that they intend fully to participate in what is going to be a short Geneva process, and I will take you through the schedule, and to participate in the ITA that will bring total global product coverage, I'm sorry, total trade volume coverage to 94 percent.  Our threshold for automatic implementation of the agreement is 90 percent, or approximately 90 percent, of global trade coverage.  With the 84 percent commitments today, (and) what will be an additional nine percent within the next week or two, there is no question this agreement is a full go ahead.  There is absolutely no question that implementation will begin in 1997.

<p>Let me then go through the chronology for you as to what happens now.  13 December is today.  That's the ministerial declaration, copies of which will be available when the copy machines can churn them out. 31 January, 1997, so at the end of January, technical discussions in Geneva must be completed.  The technical discussions revolve around the staging out of the tariffs between now and the year 2000.  The agreement specifies that tariffs will be cut one quarter, one quarter, one quarter, one quarter, the first tranche beginning July, 1997, and ending in January, 2000.  But the agreement also specifies that all of that may be accelerated for countries which wish to do so, and the agreement specifies that there is some alternative form of staging provided you get to zero in 2000.  That's acceptable as well.

<p>I've had extensive discussions with the European Union over the last three days, and will have further discussions in Geneva.  It would be our hope that, at a minimum, we and the European Union would accelerate our tariff cuts.  We would not wait to the year 2000 to go to zero, but those discussions will happen in Geneva.  Then on March 1, 1997, this is the deadline for submitting all of the staging cuts which have been agreed.  So all the technical details are then formally submitted in document form.  On April 1, 1997, that is the deadline for all the countries to review everything that has been submitted, and to determine whether two criteria have been met for the automatic implementation of the ITA beginning in July.

<p>Criterion number one: Do we have approximately 90 percent of global trade in IT products covered?  We're already there.  We know that is going to be a yes.  Number two: Are all countries satisfied with the staging commitments that have been made, that is the way the tariffs will be cut to get to zero.  I have absolute confidence the answer to that will be yes as well.

<p>Then July 1, 1997, is the deadline for tariff bindings.  One of the important points of this agreement is all the tariff cuts will be bound.  They cannot be raised again.  This is very significant, particularly in the developing world, where many tariffs are not bound firmly but can float within a range.  These tariffs are all bound.  July 1, 1997, is the deadline for tariff binding and the first tariff cut.

<p>January 1, 1998, deadline for second tariff cut.  January 1, 1999, the deadline for the third January 1, 2000, deadline for the final cut, that's zero.  In the limited circumstance in which additional time is needed on specified products that will have already been spelled out in the schedules and agreed to, as part of the two criterion that have to be satisfied, and then those cuts will proceed.  However, it has been agreed they will be staged.  All this has been spelled out and is agreed to already formally by 84 percent of world trade in these products with the other nine percent coming on board before we begin our process in Geneva in several weeks.

<p>Now, let me say simply that in the United States about 1.8 million jobs are hinged to high technology products, and in the last four years alone, even though the U.S. faces very substantial tariff barriers around the world to these products, U.S. exports in these products has increased 42 percent.

<p>Imagine the rate of increase when tariffs are at zero.  Let me give you a few examples.  In countries like Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines, tariffs are as much as six times those in the United States on a variety of products.  In semiconductors in Europe, for example, some tariffs are as high an 14 percent.  U.S. is at zero.  So the benefits of the agreement certainly for the United States will be substantial, but the benefits for Asia, for Europe and other countries will be equally substantial.

<p>As a final point, let me say that the ITA agreement delivers on the focus of the President with respect: first, to the importance of the multilateral system as an on-going vehicle for trade liberalization; second, the importance of Asia to the United States economy; and third, the importance of market access as a means to foster our own domestic economic prosperity as well as a means to foster global growth.

<p>I would repeat again that but for the President's accomplishments at the Manila leaders' meeting with respect to the ITA commitment by the Asian nations there would have been no possible way to have this agreement emerge here at Singapore.

<p>Now let me spend just one moment on the Singapore declaration, which is the first declaration, of course, that's come out of the meeting.  It is the other document that you will see today, with regard to the issues in that declaration, the United States is very pleased.  We think a very good balance has been achieved in the document, and the aims that we sat out to accomplish by and large I think we have achieved.

<p>On procurement, transparency in government procurement, there is agreed that there will be a study which will explicitly lead to an agreement on transparency in government procurement.  This was a principal United States objective because access to government procurement markets worldwide is terribly limited, and we know many of those markets are characterized by substantial bribery and corruption.  The greater the transparency, the greater the due process in government purchasing, the better chance the United States and other countries have to compete on a level playing field.

<p>Second, with respect to labor rights, since the Eisenhower Administration, the United states has sought a framework from which we can pursue our labor objective in the context of global trade.  We are talking about core labor standards, as you know, as enunciated by the ILO and by the UN.  This is an area where the interests, the underlying interests, of developed and developing economies are the same, and this was very clear from the discussions that were held.  As you may know, the core labor standards issue dominated three days of discussions among the ministers.  The interesting thing was that for all the parties present the commitment to observing core labor standards, the commitment to increasing prosperity and social welfare, is unquestioned and viewed by the developing world, an well as the developed world, as an unquestioned series of principles, so that has never been in doubt.

<p>For the United States, the debate has never been about protectionism, on the one hand, or barriers, on the other.  It has been to achieve an enunciated consensus on the critical importance of worker welfare and the critical importance of striving to maximize worker welfare as we do trade agreements.

<p>As you see from the ministerial declaration, or you will, we have achieved explicit reference to core labor standards and commitments to core labor standards.  In the 50 years of GATT, we were never able to do that.  And in addition, the document notes that there will continue to be an existing collaboration between the WTO Secretariat and the ILO Secretariat, which coordinate already on many issues.

<p>The declaration also makes plain principles with which the United States absolutely agrees: that labor standards should not be used for protectionist purposes and that genuine comparative advantage of lower wage countries should not be undermined.

<p>I'd make one additional note.  That in the chairman's summing up statement additional comments were made with respective to the subject pertaining to the WTO agenda and likewise.  In the heads of delegation plenary, which was held immediately before the closing session, the chairman made clear, upon reading the same statement, that his statement was his own, there was no consensus on his statement, that the legal consensus and binding consensus is that which appears in the ministerial declaration.  We think that this is very important and needs to be noted.

<p>In basic telecommunications, very good progress was made this week in advancing the negotiations on basic telecom.  Reed Hundt, the chairman of our Federal Communications Commission, and I co-hosted a meeting on Monday (December 9) with a number of delegations interested in the global talks on telecommunications services liberalization.  We expected perhaps 10 or 12 delegations.  We had 32 delegations, virtually all of which represented ministerial level.  There was an increasing amount of interest in these talks.  Some countries indicated their offers would improve.  We encourage that.  We hope the ITA agreement will lead toward improvement in those telecom offers, after all the IT agreement are the cars and the trucks on the road, but the telecom agreement is the road.  So, we hope the ITA agreement will lead to better offers in the telecom area.  Certainly, as you all know, as we have said repeatedly, the United States must see -- must see, improved offers from a variety of nations if the talks are successfully conclude on February 15.

<p>On the subject of agriculture, one of the key issues was to look at the implementation of Uruguay Round commitments.  For the United States, this is particularly important with respect to agriculture.  The ministerial declaration says that the reform process will continue, that we will remain true to the timeframes set out in Marrakesh, which means negotiations begin in 1999, which means the preparatory work will be completed by 1999 for those negotiations.  This is very good news for U.S. agriculture.  But, let me say, U.S. agriculture faces serious impediments around the world.  Import barriers, state trading enterprises, export subsidies, unjustifiable and non-scientific sanitary and phyto-sanitary regulations hamper U.S. exports.  The outcome of the ministerial gives us an opportunity to attack these problems head-on, but these problems most be resolved.  Let me say that with respect to agriculture, there was a very large U.S. agriculture delegation that came here at considerable sacrifice, and we are very grateful for the work that they did.

<p>On investment, the U.S. goal had been a modest work program which would not interfere with completion of investment negotiations on-going now in the OECD.  That aim has been accomplished.

<p>With respect to competition policy, we have ensured that work on competition will not threaten our laws which protect principles of fair pricing and fair competition.  The work plan is expected to focus on the problems of cartels and other private, anti-competitive behavior which can impede foreign market access.

<p>All in all, I apologize for the length of this explanation, but all in all, the United States is very pleased with the outcome of the first ministerial conference, as well as with the outcome of the ITA negotiations.  We look forward to continuing a leadership role in the WTO, and we look forward particularly working in Geneva toward the implementation of the ITA agreement, July of 1997.  With that, let me please invite questions.

<p>QUESTION:  It has been a long stated goal of the Clinton administration that trade agreements have to be a two-way street.  How does that philosophy jell with the ITA and its application to China?  Are you extending these deals to China on an MFN basis without China making commitments, or how do you expect to handle that issue?

<p>ANSWER:  First, let me say that, as in any tariff negotiation, you want a critical mass of those countries who are the major producers and exporters so that you avoid free riders.  This is why we set a very high threshold on the kick-in for the ITA.  We have already achieved it, but the threshold will be approximately 90 percent of global trade covered.  This is, of course, as you know, an agreement within the WTO, and we will certainly look at the question of its application to China as we proceed.

<p>Q:  There is no decision yet on China?

<p>A:  We will look at that as we proceed.

<p>Q:  There was so much agreement and unanimity in observing core labor standards and the ILO convention.  Why were three days spent on just negotiating words to be put into the declaration?

<p>A: I think that's a very good question, because, as you know, the question is:  What is the proper role of the WTO as a trade institution with respect to the issue of core standards or, more broadly, worker welfare?  This is a complex debate.  For some countries, the link is obvious and apparent.  For other countries, a linkage is to be avoided between WTO or trade agreements, on the one hand, and worker issues, on the other.  That is the ideological debate, and the text attempts to reconcile the ideological debate by putting forward principles with which we can all agree.  No one wants to use labor standards for protectionist purposes, and if there is a genuine comparative advantage in the developing world, no one wishes to put into question that genuine comparative advantage.  But by the same token, it is acknowledged well the ILO and WTO do work together.  That is the fact.  It is current reality, and the importance of the declaration is the explicit indication of the continuing collaboration that will occur in the future.  But the ideological debate is, as I have described.  As a practical matter, as a practical, political matter, the issue is really not very far apart.  The WTO is committed to trade liberalization through trade agreements negotiation.  If working people, whether in the United States, or the European Union, or in Indonesia, or Brazil, or Argentina, or Mexico, or Russia, if working people believe trade agreements threaten their jobs, if working people believe trade agreements lead to workers dislocation, there will be an erosion in the constituency for trade agreement and trade liberalization, and the foundation and existence of the WTO itself will be threatened.  As a practical matter, if working people don't believe these agreements are in their interests, politicians who are elected by working people won't be able to negotiate them, and that threatens the free trading system.

<p>We, therefore, must as a practical matter, ideology aside, recognize that issues of worker welfare and worker rights are absolutely a part of the trade agreements debate, whether ideologically one is happy about that or not.

<p>Q:  Just a technical clarification on ITA.  You may have misspoken, or I may have misheard you.  Before you said three additional countries have today told us...that will bring the total coverage to 94 percent.  Your press release says six other countries bring it from 85 to 91 percent.  What other countries?

<p>A:  I do apologize.  Three are Asian countries.  Three are not.  I apologize.  It is six.  We are correct in our release, and I misspoke.  We have the 28 countries that are listed.  That is the 84 percent.  Six additional countries -- three Asian, three non-Asian -- have already provided their intent to actively participate in Geneva and to join in the ITA.  For these countries, by and large, the problem had to do with not enough time to really go through the product coverage scope.  They just needed more time.  That will then increase the coverage to above the trigger threshold.

<p>Q:  Above 90 percent?

<p>A:  Yes.

<p>Q:  Above 94 percent?

<p>A:  Whatever the number was in the release.

<p>Q:  The number would be just over 90?

<p>A:  I thought the number was 94.  I thought that was the secretariat number, but let me ask Dorothy (Dwoskin).

<p>Q:  What Dorothy is saying is (it is) safest to say "just above 90" because the data are preliminary but, as the secretariat worked out the data, their initial projection was 94 percent.  In any event, we will be above the threshold, whether it is just above 90 or 94 percent, we will be above the threshold.

<p>A:  Let me make one comment on the product coverage.  You will receive a 14-page product coverage document.  That has been agreed.  This is the summary.  The 14-page single space document is the summary of the product coverage.  Were we to go through the products, the sub-products and the sub-sub-products, you'd be looking at a massive, massive, massive document.  So this was the summary, which we thought would be the easiest and, in terms of copying, the cheapest thing we could provide.

<p>Q:  If I am not mistaken, I think you said that the study with regard to competition should not threaten our roles, you said.  Do you include in those roles say legislation on anti-dumping?

<p>A:  Oh, no question.  There's no question that from the point of view of the United States and, indeed, also the European Union the anti-dumping laws are not on the table.  No question about that.

<p>Q:  Is that the understanding at this ministerial meeting is undertaking this study on competition and investments?

<p>A:  The study on competition is intended to focus on competition policy (anti-trust) -- in other words, anti-competitive practices that would impede market access, private anti-competitive practices largely.

<p>Q:  Oh, yes, it's to my surprise, but I just wanted to have confirmation.

<p>Q:  Given your remarks about the importance of Asian countries in securing a deal on the ITA, would the U.S. be sympathetic to looking at an Asian candidate as a successor to Renato Ruggiero?

<p>A:  I don't want to respond to that.  Renato Ruggiero has...is it two years left on his term, 1999?  So come ask me in 1999.

<p>Q:  As part of this collaboration between the ILO and the WTO, would you see the WTO as promoting, endorsing, enforcing core labor standards?  Secondly, Sir Leon Brittan has been talking about this millennium round that he wants to launch by the year 2000.  After this meeting in Singapore, are you convinced that such an inter-sectoral round is necessary?  You know, a global comprehensive world trade round.

<p>A:  With respect to your first question, plainly, labor standards are set in the ILO.  There is no desire on the part of any WTO member, including the United States, to set or define labor standards in the WTO.  So there's no question about that.  With respect to the notion of a global round, there really has been virtually no discussion.  One of the goals of the United States -- and perhaps an over-arching goal of the United States in this ministerial meeting -- was to establish the principle that the WTO was in many ways fundamentally different from the GATT system.  One, that the WTO would be a forum in which members, trade concerns could be discussed -- whether it is this core labor standards issue, or agriculture, or competition policy, any one of a number of issues.  That principle has been established.  This is a forum in which ideas and discussion even of controversial issues can take place.  Number two:  of principal importance to the United States was to establish the fact that major trade liberalization could occur through the WTO without having to call for a global round, without having to wait for a global round.  Because if we had to wait for a global round for the next bit of liberalization, the world would be waiting perhaps until well after the turn of the century, and then if the Uruguay Round in a guide, they would wait another eight years after that.  We wanted to establish the notion that we could proceed a pace with market opening, with trade growth on an absolutely routine basis.  The ITA establishes that principle.  Both of those goals were very important to the United States and to many other countries here, and I think the WTO will be strengthened for those goals having been achieved.  Thank you very, very much.

<b>TEXT:  USTR'S STOLER ON TRADE AND LABOR STANDARDS
<br>(Calls for fundamental human rights in the workplace)</b><br>

<p>Singapore -- The United States is aiming to help the World Trade Organization (WTO) recognize the intrinsic relationship between trade and international labor standards so that the WTO can gain the confidence of workers, a U.S. trade official says.

<p>Andrew Stoler, the deputy chief of mission in the U.S. Trade Representative's Office in Geneva, said December 8 that "only trade bureaucrats can make a distinction between trade liberalization and the concerns of people in the workplace."

<p>Speaking to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) the day before the opening of the WTO's first ministerial meeting December 9-13 here, Stoler said "If we cannot mobilize support for more global trade, at risk is the ability to increase trade further, and at some point, the globalization that trade bureaucrats take for granted will become threatened."

<p>Stoler was speaking for Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, who had to cancel because of trade negotiations in Tokyo.

<p>In Singapore, the Clinton administration is seeking the creation of a WTO working group to examine the issue of trade and labor standards, as mandated by U.S. trade legislation.  They have encountered resistance from several nations, who fear that such a working group could result in the creation of new multilateral rules that would erode the competitive edge gained by low labor costs.

<p>Stoler stressed that the United States is not seeking a global minimum wage or protectionism.  Rather, he said, when the U.S. talks about core labor standards, it is referring to fundamental human rights in the workplace: freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining, the prohibition on forced labor, the prohibition of exploitative child labor and the prohibition on discrimination.

<p>"The issue will not go away, and refusal to recognize it could, over time, truncate and distort the ability of the WTO to accomplish its mission," Stoler said.

<p>The following is the text of Stoler's statement as delivered:

<p>(begin text)

<p>Ambassador Barshefsky asked me to convey her regrets that she cannot be here this morning because she was forced to stay in Tokyo for negotiations yesterday.  Regrettably, her plane landed just a few hours ago but she asked me to assure you that she is fighting your fight.  Ambassador Barshefsky asked me to thank Mr. Jordan (the Secretary General ICFTU) for inviting her to be here today.  We share an important objective here.  And that is to help the WTO and all those interested in more and freer trade understand the importance of the intrinsic relationship between trade and the issue of improving labor standards internationally.

<p>We are making some progress.  In the next few days we will work with our trading partners to achieve an outcome that reflects the importance of this issue.  What's at stake?  Ultimately, the confidence of the very constituencies who must come to support trade agreements and market-opening initiatives.  What we are looking for here is a basic expression of values and a commitment to address the common concerns of workers around the world, whether they make computers or cars, work in mines, serve meals, clean buildings or load ships.

<p>We have no illusion that our efforts to achieve recognition of the importance of labor standards and trade will come easily.  There is resistance within the WTO.  Regrettably, there are a number of nations that are unwilling to provide a rightful role for the WTO on this issue.

<p>A few months ago Ambassador Barshefsky enlisted John Sweeney, the newly elected leader of the AFL-CIO, to work with her and use every forum to outline the importance of this effort.  With his efforts and others, there is a broader understanding about the importance of core labor standards but we have more work to do.

<p>It is worth making the distinction of what we re not talking about:  We are not talking about seeking a global minimum wage.  We are not talking about protectionism.  We all recognize that global trade is a necessary catalyst to improve wages and working conditions, and enhance wealth.

<p>When we talk about core labor standards, what we are talking about are fundamental human rights in the workplace:
-- Freedom of association,
-- The right to collective bargaining,
-- The prohibition on forced labor,
-- The prohibition of exploitative child labor, and
-- The prohibition on discrimination.

<p>What we are seeking is not revolutionary, but a simple recognition in the WTO of the responsibilities all WTO member nations have committed to in the International Labor Organization and other fora.  Why isn't that enough?  Because only trade bureaucrats can make a distinction between trade liberalization and the concerns of people in the workplace.  I know because I've been trying to explain this now practically every day since April.  The WTO has a responsibility to work with other international institutions, principally the ILO, to improve the lives of workers.

<p>Ambassador Barshefsky has been very clear.  Our trading partners must recognize these concerns because they are not going to go away.  We cannot hide from our basic moral responsibility here.

<p>The Problem

<p>What we are talking about in acknowledging our responsibilities to address core labor rights is not a hypothetical political battle.  This is a very real and immediate concern as studies by the OECD and ILO have concluded.

<p>In the last 20 years, by many indices, we are actually losing ground in this effort.  The ILO study indicates, for example, that 250 million children are working in developing countries.  Some 120 million are working full-time.  Most are in agriculture or domestic service, but many are working in deplorable manufacturing conditions with severe consequences.

<p>In some countries, death rates caused by exposure to poison chemicals and compounds among children actually exceeds death rates from childhood illnesses.

<p>Problems in labor standards do not simply fall upon children.  We know through our investigations that worker rights in Asian countries and in our own hemisphere are not what they should be.  I do want to assure you however that the Clinton administration through our GSP program has contributed to progress on working conditions in a number of countries.

<p>To be sure our work is just beginning.  The United States cannot do this job alone which is precisely why we brought this issue to the WTO.  The ILO has established a working party on the social dimensions of the liberalization of international trade.  The formal involvement of the WTO would add significantly to the commitment of the ILO.

<p>What the reports and our own experience tell us are as follows:

<p>First, observance and protection of core labor rights will enhance economic development around the world, and that is an objective in which all of us have an interest.

<p>Second, trade liberalization and effective implementation of core labor standards are mutually enforcing.

<p>The American Experience

<p>At the risk of sounding a bit chauvinistic, let me outline why I feel so strongly about this issue.  Increased trade is good for America.  We have only in the past year seen the first substantial wage and standard of living gains after two decades of relative stagnation.

<p>Trade is a big part of that equation.  In just the past five years, trade has moved from 25 percent to more than 30 percent of our GDP.  Jobs related to trade pay 15 percent more than jobs in the rest of the economy.  We now have 11 million jobs dependent upon trade.

<p>Yet Americans do not believe that they are seeing economic benefits from trade.  They support more exports, but do not believe that trade agreements -- which are necessary to open markets for exports -- are good for them.

<p>This disconnect is not just an American phenomenon.  It is a global problem.  If we cannot mobilize support for more global trade, at risk is the ability to increase trade further, and at some point, the globalization that trade bureaucrats take for granted will become threatened.  Here again the WTO could be part of the solution.

<p>Toward a Solution

<p>Labor conditions are determined by both political and economic factors.  Just as global market-opening initiatives should be multilateral in nature, so should initiatives to improve labor conditions.

<p>We believe it is in the long-term interests of the WTO to acknowledge the relationship between trade and labor conditions, much as it has begun a dialogue to explore the relationship between trade and the environment.  This initiative will be good for the global trading system, it will be good for workers.  Let me quote the director of the ILO in saying, what we are seeking is "to bring back into focus the objectives of fundamental labor standards and social progress... we should reject a single-minded insistence on trade sanctions or an inflexible resistance to any link between labor standards and trade."

<p>What we are really looking for here is common ground.  This issue will not go away, and refusal to recognize it could, over time, truncate and distort the ability of the WTO to accomplish its own mission.

<p>Conferences such as this one the ICFTU has organized are immensely helpful to these efforts.  Be assured, we will continue to work with you to advance concerns about worker rights in the context of global trade at the WTO and wherever we might more this issue forward.

<p>Speaking for Ambassador Barshefsky, I very much appreciate the contributions you are making here.  Thank you.

<b>INTERNATIONAL LABOR AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
<br>(Byliner: AFL-CIO chief on worker rights, trade link)</b>
<br>By John J. Sweeney
<br>President of the AFL-CIO

<p>(The AFL-CIO is the largest labor federation in the United States.)

<p>For the past 20 years or more, most working Americans have seen their living standards decline or stagnate.  This has happened for a host of reasons.  But, because these 20 years have been the time when America plunged into the new global economy, there is a growing backlash against international trade and investment and against all our nation's political and economic involvements in the world.

<p>Unless we offer working Americans hope and help -- with policies that lift living standards here at home and a serious commitment to labor standards throughout the world -- there will be consequences that none of us will welcome.  That is why I hope you will heed my words.  It will be far better for us to address these concerns now than to address their consequences later.

<p>We are at a time of change for business, labor, government, and the entire American community.

<p>American labor understands that it must change.  We can no longer concentrate on the narrowest definition of the short-term interests of our existing members.  We must devote out energies to a larger vision of the long-term interests of all working Americans -- union and non-union.  That is how we intend to grow -- by fighting for the future of working Americans.

<p>We understand that the world and the workplace have changed, and so must we.  Before they grow old, today's Americans can expect to work at several jobs and perhaps for several companies and even in several industries.  Working Americans will need to learn new skills, to work with new technologies, and to seek new markets for their goods and services.  And the role of our labor movement is not to reminisce about the old economy but to represent working Americans in the new economy.

<p>That is why American labor will no longer take the position that quality, productivity, and profits are not our business.  They are our business.  They are our jobs.  And indeed they are our very livelihoods.  We intend to give voice to working people's yearnings to make better products and provide better services.  We see it as our responsibility to increase productivity and help American business compete in the world economy and create new wealth for their shareholders and their employees.  And we will fight more aggressively than ever for an America where working people can share in the gains of a growing economy.

<p>Just as American labor is recognizing new realities and assuming new responsibilities, so must American business.

<p>In 1989, a corporate chief executive officer, Gilbert Williamson of NCR, said:

<p>"I was asked the other day about United States competitiveness, and I replied that I don't think about it at all.  We ... think of ourselves as a globally competitive company that happens to be headquartered in the United States."

<p>I believe that we all can be better citizens of the world by being better citizens of our own country.

<p>That is why, before I talk about international trade and investment, I want to talk about the condition of working Americans.

<p>America makes the most progress -- in our endeavors at home and abroad -- when we prosper together.  But, during the past two decades, Americans have not prospered together.  Yes, the stock market has reached record heights.  Yes, corporate profits increased by 205 percent between 1980 and 1995.  And, yes, executive salaries have soared by almost 500 percent.

<p>These milestones were set, in no small measure, because working Americans rose to the challenge of global competition.  They increased productivity by 24 percent.  They restored our industrial leadership in market after market, and they pioneered new technologies not even dreamed of in 1970.  But they have not shared in the wealth they have produced, for family incomes have declined by almost 15 percent, and, even after two years of growth, have not even climbed back to 1989 levels.

<p>I do not begrudge companies' good fortune.  But I am concerned that so many working Americans have not shared in it.  That is why -- in every speech I give and in a book I recently wrote -- I make this simple point:  America needs a raise.

<p>That is the context in which I want to make two important points about international trade and investment:

<p>First:  Discussions and decisions about international trade and investment must consider the condition of working people, here in the United States and throughout the world.

<p>Second:  Unless we address the pain, the anxiety, and the basic needs of working people, there will be a backlash against international trade and investment.  And that backlash will generate protectionism, isolationism, and destructive discord, here in the United States and throughout the world.

<p>I often remind people that trade is not an end in itself.  Its purpose is to promote the well being of ordinary people -- producers and consumers, buyers and sellers, here and abroad.

<p>Unfortunately, public discussion of trade is too often characterized as a debate between backward "protectionists" on one side and enlightened "free traders" on the other.

<p>The leaders of the backlash that we should strive to avoid -- people like Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot -- are perfect foils for those who would avoid serious discussion about the problems working Americans face in the global economy.

<p>Let me be clear:  Working people don't want to build an economic wall around America.  We do want to build a framework of rules that are fair to American workers, American companies, and American consumers.

<p>We do want to lower the barriers to the export of American products and services.  A growing number of our jobs and paychecks depend on American exports.

<p>And by no means are we opposed to any and all trade agreements.  But we do want agreements that reflect American interests and American values.

<p>Most importantly, trade agreements must reflect and promote the fundamental human dignity of working men and women, wherever they may live and labor.

<p>We want corporations, governments, and trade agreements to show the same concern for people as for property.  At their best moments, administrations of both parties, from William McKinley and Woodrow Wilson to Ronald Reagan and George Bush, have accepted this idea.  And I applaud the Clinton administration for calling for an examination of worker rights by the World Trade Organization.

<p>Despite this history, there are those who still say that workers' rights and labor standards have no place in trade negotiations.  They are wrong.

<p>But many of those same leaders insist that intellectual property and capital investment must be protected by new rules.  We must not and cannot have it both ways.

<p>I believe we must defend Michael Jackson's right to enjoy royalties for his songs and Bill Gates' right to enjoy royalties on his software.  But we must also defend the rights of the women and men who manufacture Michael Jackson's compact disks and Bill Gates' computer disks to enjoy simple human dignity for their labor.

<p>There are those who say that most economies on earth cannot afford this.  I suggest that we look at this issue more closely and more carefully.

<p>I have used two different phrases, "workers' rights" and "labor standards."  That is because they refer to two different, if closely related, concepts.

<p>By workers' rights, I mean fundamental human rights that every woman and man should enjoy:  the right to free speech, the right to freedom of association, and the right to organize and bargain collectively.

<p>These rights do not depend on a nation's level of economic development.  There is no nation on earth so poor in material things that it cannot afford free speech and freedom of association for its citizens.

<p>But labor standards do depend upon how developed and how wealthy a nation is.  While there is no country too poor to afford freedom of association, there are economies that cannot afford, as our economy can, a minimum wage of five dollars and 15 cents an hour.

<p>It should be our policy to push for workers' rights, as we push for human rights of all kinds throughout the world.  And we should promote policies that, in a reasonable and workable way, have the effect of harmonizing labor standards upward and not downward.

<p>That is how we can begin to make sure that the global economy will lift up working people throughout the world, rather than drive them down.  That is how we can begin to make sure that U.S. companies will have dedicated employees and loyal consumers, here in this country and in every country where they do business.  And that is how we can begin to make sure that there will not be a protectionist, nativist, know-nothing backlash that will produce social conflict at home and trade wars everywhere.

<p>You don't have to take my word for it.  Listen to some of the wisest students of international affairs.  The Council on Foreign Relations is convening a study group -- in which the AFL-CIO will participate -- on the issue of "global trade and wages."  They understand that, as long as living standards for working Americans decline, so will public support for international trade.

<p>And, in an insightful article in a recent issue of Foreign Affairs, Ethan Kapstein, who is director of studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote:

<p>"The global economy is leaving millions of disaffected workers in its train ....  The failure of today's advanced global capitalism to keep spreading the wealth poses a challenge not just to policymakers ....  If the post-World War II social contract with workers -- of full employment and comprehensive social welfare -- is to be broken, political support for the burgeoning global economy could easily collapse."

<p>American business doesn't want that to happen.  Neither does American labor.  That is why I issue four challenges to the entire business community.  These aren't easy.  But they are the right thing -- and the smart thing -- for all of us to do:

<p>My first challenge recognizes business support not only for the ILO but for fundamental American values.

<p>I ask U.S. businesses to join with the government of the United States and with the American labor movement to support a fundamental principle on which all Americans should agree.

<p>I am speaking of ILO Convention 111.  It calls upon each country to accept the principle that there must be no discrimination in employment by race, color, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction, or social origin.

<p>It is a principle that our country honors in our own laws.  It is a fundamental value which we all hold dear in our own hearts.

<p>I ask the American business community to support submitting Convention 111 to the U.S. Senate without further delay.  If technical problems remain, they can and should be resolved easily and quickly.  There must be no more doubt or delay about where our nation stands on the issues addressed by Convention 111.

<p>My second challenge is for the U.S. business community to support the United States government in its efforts to have the World Trade Organization adopt an examination of the linkage between trade and internationally recognized human rights.

<p>I ask the entire business community to support our government on this issue.

<p>Who can deny that it is important to consider the impact of international trade on the liberties and livelihoods of working people?  Who can disagree that it would be beneficial for representatives of countries throughout the world to address this issue?  It is always a good thing for people to meet and reason together.

<p>And here is my third challenge:  Perhaps business and labor can find some issues on which we can agree to set a standard for the rights of working people throughout the global economy.

<p>An area on which we should agree is child labor.  Throughout the world, an estimated 200 million children are at work -- and too many of them work under conditions that should move us to shame, to anger, and to action.

<p>Let me be clear:  I'm not talking about young people who work after school.  And I'm not talking about young people who work alongside their parents, on farms, or in stores, or family businesses.  I am talking about children working in the fields and factories, in the mines and mills -- sometimes even in bondage or in brothels.

<p>Under the leadership of President Clinton and Labor Secretary Reich, the U.S. government is taking action against sweatshops and child labor in our own country.  Our government is pressing for action in international arenas, such as the ILO Ministerial Conference, which I attended in June.  And our government is beginning to hold U.S. companies accountable for the actions of their contractors at home and abroad.

<p>I ask American business to support and join in these efforts.  If we can agree on nothing else, can we agree that children belong in schools, not sweatshops?

<p>Fourth and finally, I ask the business community to join with us in ensuring that, as trade increases, so do the fortunes of working people everywhere.

<p>If we cannot meet this challenge, the gains of recent years and the promise of the new century will be swept away by an angry backlash.

<p>I ask the business community to join with us to create the conditions that will allow working Americans to face the future with confidence and see the new global economy as an opportunity, not a threat.  If we succeed, we will fulfill our responsibilities at this urgent moment of history.  And I say:  We dare not fail.

<b>TEXT:  DEPUTY USTR LANG 10/7 PRESS STATEMENT IN BANGKOK<br>
(Open telecom markets depend on Asian WTO members)</b>

<p>Bangkok -- The World Trade Organization (WTO) telecommunications services negotiations cannot succeed without market-opening commitments from the high-growth countries of Asia, according to Jeffrey Lang, deputy U.S. Trade Representative.

<p>In an October 7 statement in Bangkok, Lang pointed out that WTO members from Eastern Europe and Latin America have already offered to provide market access across all basic telecommunications service sectors without significant limits on foreign investment.  He added that 31 countries have adopted "a common set of enforceable regulatory commitments that will be crucial to assure real market access."

<p>"We are looking for offers from the powerful economies of Southeast Asia that build on the progress each country has made to date in opening telecom services markets," he said.

<p>In addition to the telecommunications services talks, the United States would like to see discussion of labor standards, transparency in government procurement, and an Information Technology Agreement (ITA) at the December 9-13 WTO Singapore Ministerial Conference, Lang said.

<p>According to Lang, the ITA would reduce tariffs to zero by the year 2000 for semiconductors computers, telecommunications equipment and other components of the Global Information Infrastructure.

<p>Following is the official text of Lang's statement, as prepared for delivery:

<p>OCTOBER 7, 1996

<p>PRESS STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR JEFFREY M.  LANG

<p>DEPUTY UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE

<p>BANGKOK, THAILAND

<p>I have just completed a visit to four ASEAN countries -- Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand -- to brief Ministers and my colleagues in trade, telecom and foreign ministries on the results of the latest meeting of the Quadrilateral Trade Ministers, which took place in Seattle on September 26 to 28.  The Quad is composed of the trade ministers of the United States, the European Union, Japan and Canada.  My ASEAN colleagues and I discussed the details of several initiatives that are crucial to the success of the Singapore Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization.  The Singapore Ministerial will take place on December 9 to 13.

<p>Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Bob Cassidy will travel to the Philippines in a few days on a similar mission.

<p>At Seattle, the Quad ministers broke two "log-jams" among the industrialized countries.

<p>-- First, Acting United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, Sir Leon Brittan of the European Union, and MITI Minister Tsukahara of Japan agreed on terms whereby the European Union will join in multilateral negotiations at the WTO to commit to zero tariffs for semiconductors and other information technology products.  This is the proposed Information Technology Agreement, which would reduce tariffs to zero, by the year 2000, not only for semiconductors, but also for computers, telecom equipment and other components of the Global Information Infrastructure.  In return for the E.U.'s commitment to negotiate an ITA, the Semiconductor Council meeting scheduled for January will be postponed until March.

<p>-- Second, Ambassador Barshefsky and Sir Leon announced their intention to respond positively, in advance of the Singapore Ministerial, to each other's requests for improvement of their respective offers in WTO negotiations on basic telecommunications services.  These negotiations have a deadline of February 15, 1997.  Japan and Canada also confirmed in Seattle their intentions to review their telecom services offers and to make their best efforts to improve those offers before the Singapore Ministerial.  The Quad partners agreed to take these market-opening steps in telecom goods and services on a MFN, or Most Favored Nation basis, conditional on successful multilateral talks among all the members of the WTO.

<p>The focus of the global trade community therefore shifts next to Asia, the fastest-growing region in the world, and a region where the importance of expanding and improving telecommunications infrastructure is widely recognized.  Our chances for successful multilateral agreements to open global markets for telecom goods and services will depend, to a great extent, on how the WTO members of Asia will approach these issues as we prepare for the Singapore Ministerial.

<p>I had detailed discussions today with senior officials of the Commerce Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry of Transport and Communications.  We discussed our mutual objectives for the Singapore Ministerial, including

<p>-- the Information Technology Agreement;

<p>-- the WTO telecom services talks;

<p>-- transparency in government procurement; and,

<p>-- providing an opportunity for a discussion of labor standards at the WTO.

<p>We also discussed a variety of other issues, including intellectual property, insurance and the APEC meetings scheduled for next month in Manila.

<p>Let me review the main points.

<p>First, on government procurement, the United States is proposing negotiations on an interim agreement among all WTO members that would provide for greater transparency.  In many countries, the largest purchaser is the government.  Transparency in procurement is a first step to opening this huge market.

<p>Second, on labor standards, the Quad proposals are modest, but necessary.  The WTO increasingly is seen as a forum for resolution of industry's economic interests, but in isolation from the interests of ordinary working people.  The United States is suggesting that the members agree to discuss labor standards at the WTO, without preconditions as to further steps beyond a discussion.  We aim for a discussion that would not prejudice to the primary role of the International Labor Organization in the field of labor standards, and that would explicitly bar issues of wage rates and any pretexts for protectionism.

<p>Third, I have found receptivity in this part of the world to the proposed Information Technology Agreement, because most countries in the region are exporters of these products, as is the United States.  But the ITA opportunity has to be grasped quickly, or it could be lost.  Experts from ASEAN and other countries have been invited to a meeting in Geneva on Friday, October 10, to begin what we hope will be a speedy process to agree on the crucial details of product coverage and tariff phase-out.  The Quad countries explicitly left the door open to contributions from other countries on these details.

<p>Finally, the WTO telecom services negotiations cannot succeed without market-opening commitments from the high-growth countries of Asia.  The telecom services offers made so far by WTO members in Eastern Europe and Latin America are superior to the offers that have been made by WTO members in Asia.  Those other offers -- for example, by Argentina, Hungary, Brazil, and others in those regions -- provide market access across all basic telecom services sectors at an early date, without significant limits on foreign investment.  Moreover, thirty-one countries have adopted a common set of enforceable regulatory commitments that will be crucial to assure real market access.

<p>We are looking for offers from the powerful economies of Southeast Asia that build on the progress each country has made to date in opening telecom services markets.

<b>TEXT:  USDA'S ROMINGER ADDRESSES WTO ON AGRICULTURAL TRADE<br>
(Calls for eliminating "unjustified" barriers)</b><br>

<p>Singapore -- A U.S. agriculture official has urged members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to push for reforms that will further liberalize agricultural trade, including elimination of "unjustified" sanitary and phytosanitary barriers.

<p>"We are finding that the current system does not adequately address a number of issues of critical importance to our agricultural community," Richard Rominger, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), said December 11.

<p>He also called for the elimination of agricultural export subsidies, reforms in the administration of tariff-rate quotas, and improved regulation of state trading enterprises.

<p>Rominger was speaking to trade ministers gathered in Singapore for their first formal meeting since the creation of the WTO.

<p>"In Marrakesh we all made a historic commitment to bring agriculture under the aegis of the WTO," he said.  "But we agreed then that it was a historic first step.  We need to keep going."

<p>Following is the text of Rominger's statement as prepared for delivery:

<p>(begin text)

<p>Mr. Chairman, as the WTO moves beyond this ministerial toward a new century and further trade liberalization, agriculture needs to remain a top priority.  For most countries around the world, agriculture is the most important sector of trade.  It's essential that -- as the World Trade Organization matures -- we continue to make steady progress in freer and fairer agricultural trade.

<p>In Marrakesh we all made a historic commitment to bring agriculture under the aegis of the WTO.  Through the implementation of the Uruguay Round we are bringing freer trade to agriculture.  But we agreed then that it was a historic first step.  We need to keep going.

<p>One look at economic growth, trade growth, and the development growth of the past few years -- not to mention the long line of nations who want to join the WTO -- and it is clear that trade liberalization is the path toward a more peaceful, prosperous future.

<p>The overriding success of the WTO and the Uruguay Round supports what history has always shown:  Protectionism and isolationism are never the right answers.  We are a community of nations that can only achieve our full potential together.

<p>The United States shares the WTO's assessment that -- overall -- our nations have done a good job of keeping the Uruguay Round agricultural commitments and are proceeding in good faith.  But our work is far from complete and is not perfect.

<p>When we created the WTO in Marrakesh, we understood that building a strong, shared marketplace -- that spurs growth in output, jobs and exports -- would require each of us to make some sacrifices.  So we sought a balance of concessions where success hinges on every nation doing its part.  We created a framework of rules by which progress and commitment by members can be measured.

<p>The United States has been actively engaged over the past two years in the activities of the Committees on Agriculture, and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, the Working Party on State Trading Enterprises, and the Decision on Least-Developed and Net Food-Importing Developing Countries.  We are pleased with the progress that has been made in these fora, and we look forward to continued progress leading to further reform of agriculture in 1999.  In this regard, we look forward to the process of analysis and information exchange which will enable the Committee on Agriculture to further pursue in 1997 and thereafter all relevant provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture.

<p>Most countries have proceeded in conformity with the rules and spirit of our Agreement on Agriculture.  Some have not.  Some have failed to establish tariff-rate quotas... some have allowed tariff-rate quotas to go unfilled due to restrictive import policies... some have violated export subsidy commitments, and some have maintained unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary measures.  All these countries have sacrificed principle for political expedience.

<p>As WTO members continue to implement the Uruguay Round, we must not forget that beyond establishing rules and shaping a freer marketplace, we are also setting precedent.  How we honor our commitments will determine the relevance of this organization in shaping the future of agricultural trade.

<p>Having implemented and monitored the Uruguay Round commitments to date, all WTO member countries know that additional reform is necessary.  The system we established in Marrakesh is young, and we are learning, through the ongoing work of the Committee on Agriculture as well as other bodies, to identify where we have done well and where we need further work.  We are finding that the current system does not adequately address a number of issues of critical importance to our agricultural community.  For example, reforms are essential in the administration of tariff-rate quotas and in the elimination of unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary barriers.  This is becoming clear as we study notifications and encounter implementation irregularities.  In addition, much work is needed in disciplining the activities of state trading enterprises and eliminating export subsidies.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the United States remains engaged, and committed -- both in bilateral negotiations and through the WTO -- to challenging trade-distorting activities in whatever form they arise.  It is in our best interest.  It's also in the best interest of this organization and the member countries.  The WTO is the multilateral forum for developing binding trade agreements and is only as strong as the actions of the countries that comprise it.  Thank you.

<b>TRANSCRIPT: HILLS ON WTO MINISTERIAL IN SINGAPORE
<br>(Former USTR predicts ITA negotiations will succeed)</b><br>

<p>Washington -- Carla Hills, who was U.S. trade representative in the Bush administration, predicts that trade ministers meeting in Singapore in days ahead will approve some sort of information technology agreement, a top U.S. objective.

<p>Hills made the prediction December 6 at the National Press Club in remarks setting the background for the World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial-level meeting in Singapore December 9-13.

<p>She also expects the ministers at Singapore to approve some weak statement on the controversial issue of labor standards.  She predicted negotiators will conclude in early 1997 an agreement on basic telecommunications services, an agreement that has so far proved elusive.  And she suggested that a few European and Asian countries would likely block preparatory work on WTO agricultural negotiations that are scheduled to start in 1999.

<p>Following is a transcript of Hills' remarks:

<p>(begin transcript)

<p>HILLS:  I've been asked to talk about and give you a framework for the World Trade Organization's meeting in Singapore.  As Peter Hickman said, it's going to be a crowded affair.  Over 160 nations will be represented there: 127 members of the World Trade Organization, or the WTO, plus 34 observer nations.  In addition, there will be some 49 observer international organizations, including 14 international organizations from the IMF to the World Bank, various regional development banks, and the United Nations and its various agencies.  So it's not a small meeting.

<p>I think with this audience, you know what the WTO is: basically, an extension of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is nearing its 50th anniversary.  Under the GATT, the trading nations of the world slashed their tariffs from an average of 40 percent down to below 5 percent today.  And that has caused world trade to mushroom, and with it, it has raised standards of living for people all around the world and has created economic opportunity.

<p>In the early '80s, led by the United States, the GATT members decided that the GATT needed to be modernized and strengthened, as it only covered goods and there were rapidly growing sectors, such as services and agriculture, high technology, which needed the protection of intellectual property, and investment, where there were no internationally agreed norms.

<p>And so we started the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks in 1986, and that resulted in 1994 in dozens of new agreements containing thousands of tariff cuts and new obligations covering services, intellectual property right protections, protections for investment, and that was fine.  A number of legal texts were signed by over 100 nations.  And one of the agreements created the World Trade Organization as a successor of the GATT, but kept the GATT to cover trade and goods.  And the question before you is, at two years what has the WTO clearly accomplished?

<p>Well, two years is probably too short a period to have a conclusive evaluation of the accomplishments of the WTO, particularly as many of its commitments are ongoing and are being phased in.  Still, let me give you a half a dozen examples of where I think the WTO has made substantial improvement over its predecessor organization.

<p>First, it has far broader coverage.  Its 29 legal texts cover things like services.  That was important to the United States, as we're the largest provider of services worldwide, selling some $200 billion per year in services.  The World Trade Organization for the first time has agreed to cut agricultural subsidies and to convert quantitative barriers to tariffs and then proceed to cut them.  And the WTO members for the first time agreed to rules to protect patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets.  And it agreed to strengthen the GATT trading rules by requiring the WTO members to sign all of the legal texts.  No picking and choosing as was done under the GATT.  And so if you signed one, you signed all.  And that is a rule that has applied save for one area, namely procurement.  And when the agreement is finally implemented, the old area of goods will have further benefit because the tariff in the area of goods has been cut by an additional 45 -- probably about an additional third.  And in 45 percent of the area of industrial goods they have eliminated tariffs altogether, including important sectors like pharmaceuticals, paper, and furniture, all important areas to the United States.

<p>Dispute settlement under the WTO mechanism is much clearer and much faster, and I think is generally recognized as an area of extraordinary success.  As of early November worldwide there had been 62 consultations over trade differences.

<p>The United States has been a plaintiff in 21 and a respondent in nine.  We've won or settled four.  There are 16 pending.  We've lost two cases, and I think those who studied them thought that they were legitimate outcomes.  And we have had some settlements outside the system as a result of the filing.  So that this is a success story, I think, for reducing trade friction.

<p>And finally, the WTO, unlike the GATT, creates a permanent institutional structure so that a trade minister could bring to the over 100 trading nations a new idea for an international norm and without having to start a whole massive round of trade talks.  That is the door through which the newer issues have come -- labor, environment and competition policy.  And they will continue to come.  And the fact that they're contentious at the outset and the secretary- general is having difficulty getting a consensus is not surprising.  After all, the United States wanted to start the Uruguay Round in 1982, and it wasn't till 1986 that it was launched.  So it takes a while to develop a consensus.

<p>Now, what will the ministers discuss at Singapore?  Well, I think the focus will be on implementation of these various WTO commitments, including the unfinished business that was left over from the Uruguay Round and the so-called built-in agenda where the WTO members agreed to negotiate in the future in a number of areas.  And here let me mention a few.

<p>Basic telecommunications.  This negotiation covers a $500 billion global market.  They're scheduled to conclude in February of '97.  The original deadline of April of 1996 was extended because only 11 nations were willing to match the U.S. offer.  Latin America and Eastern Europe would have agreed to our offer, but they wanted somewhere between one and five years.  There were no comparable offers from the Asia nations.  And the current reports are the negotiations are going very well.  Were I a betting person, I would think that you would reach in early '97 a resolution.

<p>Secondly, financial services: Negotiations are expected to resume in financial services next year.  Negotiations reached an interim agreement that was signed in August and -- May -- the interim agreement went into force in August of this year.  And it is subject to review and withdrawal at the end of next year.  The United States complained that the agreement failed to lock in rights that currently exist in many of the developing countries, particularly the right to maintain majority ownership of financial institutions.  Companies that had bought 80 percent of a company were told that under the accord, the host government could have reduced that percentage down to below 50 percent, and so, in effect, it would be a closure of the market.  I think that there will be an enormous effort this year to persuade particularly the nations in Latin America and Asia to make better offers for the financial services sector.

<p>In maritime services, the United States walked away from the negotiations this past June.  Only 36 nations made commitments, and they did agree to suspend negotiations until the year 2000.

<p>On services generally, there will be a round of services negotiation covering all sorts of services, to begin in the year 2000, in hopes that nations will put on the table services beyond tourism, information, health, which are already covered.

<p>And agriculture, always a contentious area:  Another round is scheduled, under the terms of the agreement, to begin in 1999.  The OECD estimates that farm subsidies and supports still cost the consumer about $350 billion a year.  The United States and the 14 members of the Cairns group, which includes the seven ASEAN nations and several Latin American nations, and Australia, want work to start in anticipation of the negotiations in 1999.  They'd like that work to begin in 1997.  Korea, Japan, and the European Union resist.  So if I were a betting person I would say there'd be very little likelihood that much work is going to be done before the deadline of 1999.

<p>The major addition to this built-in agenda and the unfinished agenda has already been mentioned, and that's the information technology agreement.  This is a high priority for the United States.  We are seeking staged reductions in tariffs, hopefully down to zero, on a variety of items -- computers, LAN equipment, supercomputers, semiconductors -- by the year 2000.  The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum endorsed the concept.  Certain of the APEC nations felt that the coverage was not in line with what they had hoped, and some had some difficulty with the timetable.  But I think that there will be a discussion of this, a hearty discussion of this at Singapore, and I would expect that they would be able to reach some agreement.

<p>Then accession has already been mentioned.  You know, another one of the big successes of the WTO is the desire of so many of these nations that have transitory economies that have come from statism into a market concept want to get into the WTO.  And there are currently 34 applications pending for admission, including applications from China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and Russia.  And each one of these applications presents challenging issues.

<p>Then finally the ministers are going to have to deal with the so-called newer issues, which are contentious.  And let me mention three or four in a descending level of contention.

<p>First, labor standards.  The secretary general, Renato Ruggiero, had proposed in his draft declaration that he would mention labor standards.  The ASEAN nations, Brazil and Egypt strongly oppose.  The United States says it's not going to sign this declaration unless there is some mention to core labor standards.  And sources say that the European Union, Japan and Australia are willing to have a mention but -- and are not insisting on any particular wording.  So the question is, will there be a mention.  And I would suspect that they could resolve that with some mention.  The draft language already is just very, very gentle.  It talks in terms of the International Labor Organization having primary jurisdiction in this area and more should be done.

<p>Secondly is investments.  Good progress is being made in the OECD on a multilateral agreement on investment.  Secretary General Ruggiero has proposed that the WTO also take up work on investment.  The U.S.  would like the OECD to conclude its work before the WTO does anything in depth, and you've got a split among the developing nations.  Some developing nations don't want the WTO to touch the subject, investment.  They would like unilaterally to make the rules for their own dealings with foreign investors.  Others would like to have some discussion in the WTO, fearing that if the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, which is the rich man's club, comes to a resolution on an investment agreement and without their input, that it may not serve their interests.  So you've got a dichotomy there in the developing world, some preferring that the WTO step up to it and have an investment arrangement, others not wanting any organization to have an investment agreement that would deal with their interests.

<p>The environment was thought to be a contentious issue and has turned out not to be so contentious.  The declaration will mention the report of the Committee on Trade and the Environment, and probably the ministers will ask the WTO to continue its work.  Basically, the committee's report, which was filed in early November, calls for cooperation between the WTO and institutions that enforce multilateral environmental agreements.  The report sidestepped the most controversial area, such as the use of trade sanctions to enforce environmental norms.  The report suggests that disputes among the parties to a multilateral environmental accord be handled under that accord although the parties would retain their WTO rights, which raises the question of what happens when there's an inconsistency.  And language was dropped which would have called upon the WTO members to ensure that the trade measures enacted in any multilateral environmental accord be consistent with the WTO.

<b>TEXT: USTR POSITION PAPER ON THE BANANA ISSUE
<br>(Urges equitable handling of U.S., Latin American banana exports)</b><br>

<p>
WASHINGTON -- The following is the text of a U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) position paper on the question of the international banana trade:

<p>
Office of the United States Trade Representative

<p>The Banana Issue

<p>There are many misconceptions about U.S. policy, about what this case is about and about what a WTO case means.  To briefly summarize this very complex issue: The United States, Mexico, Ecuador, Honduras and Guatemala are engaged in a WTO dispute settlement to try to end the trade-distorting method the EU uses to discriminate against U.S. and Latin American distribution companies and banana exports from Latin American countries.  Chiquita, Dole Foods and Delmonte support an end to the EU banana regime.

<p>-- The United States has major interests in the Caribbean, as well as in Latin America.  We and the Caribbean share important goals: security, orderly movement of people and control of migration, protection of the environment, the expansion of trade and investment and improved living standards.  These interests are best served by long-term and broad-based economic growth and political stability in the Caribbean.

<p>-- USG goals with respect to EC banana regulations are to: promote economic growth in the region, remove illegal discrimination, keep international commitments, reform the existing banana regime, and encourage continued diversification of Caribbean economies.

<p>-- The EU regime has deprived Latin American countries of market share and export growth in the EU and has taken business away from U.S. and Latin American banana marketing firms.

<p>-- The WTO banana case will not require the EU to end all types of trade preferences or financial assistance to the Caribbean and is not a threat to Caribbean banana production.

<p>-- A reformed EU banana regime could maintain tariff preferences for Caribbean producers, encourage diversification and help these producers become competitive without imposing gratuitous discrimination against non-European marketing firms.

<p>-- Before the new EU regulations went into effect in 1993, only three EU member states -- France, the U.K. and Spain -- sharply limited the supply of Latin American bananas; now the entire 15 countries of the EU do.

<p>-- A WTO panel that found the EU's banana regulations to be inconsistent with WTO agreements would not require the EU to end all assistance for the Caribbean, but would call upon the EU to bring its banana regulations into conformity with agreed rules of international trade.

<p>-- The five countries that brought the WTO action have expressed their commitment to a healthy Caribbean banana presence in the EU.  There are ways to accomplish this objective without impeding the exports and distribution services of other Western Hemisphere producers and marketing companies.

<p>-- The United States is ready to work with the EU to help the Caribbean producers in a way that does not hurt U.S. companies and Latin American producers.  There are better ways to accomplish this objective than the EU's regulations, as our alternatives paper points out.

<p>
Banana Alternatives Summary

<p>-- We believe that it is in the best interest of the Caribbean, Latin America, the United States and the international trading system for the EU to pursue WTO-consistent policies that focus on the needs and capabilities of banana-producing countries.

<p>-- Given the ability of most African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries to compete, EU assistance should be focused on those countries that need it.  The Caribbean nations of the Windward Islands (St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, Grenada, and St. Lucia) are not near being competitive, in part because of their special circumstances and in part because EU regulations have stifled incentives to become competitive.

<p>-- EU regulations have also been a disincentive to diversification.  It is likely that the preference system itself has discouraged investment in alternative crops.

<p>-- While Windward Island producers must continue to work toward dramatically improving efficiency and quality of production, the EU banana regulation must be reformed to help to prepare the Windward producers for competitiveness when the current Lome banana protocol expires.

<p>-- The U.S. respects the EU commitment undertaken in its Lome agreements to promote development of ACP countries through access to its market.  We do not object to a continuation of tariff preferences for the Windward Islands and other ACP banana producers.

<p>-- However, we do object to EU banana regulations that are inconsistent with the agreed rules of international trade and are not consistent with the terms of the WTO waiver for the banana tariff preferences.

<p>-- There are many WTO-consistent paths to reach the objective of economic growth for Windward Island banana producers through WTO-consistent tariff preferences, technical assistance or financial aid.  Other ways:

<p>-- Develop human resources in the Windward Islands through education.

<p>-- Explore alternatives such as information technologies.

<p>-- Finance pilot projects and starter-plots for alternative crops.

<p>-- Provide a WTO-consistent income support subsidy.

<p>-- Introduce a buy-out scheme calculated to encourage inefficient producers to look for alternatives.

<p>-- The EU collects $300 million annually in tariff revenue from Latin American bananas.  The EU could consider expanding its diversification program and use some of the banana tariff proceeds to finance such programs.

<p>-- It is important to begin work now on implementing such measures and reforming the current regime to benefit all affected countries in the region.  The United States stands ready, as it always has, to work with the EU, the Caribbean, and Latin America in developing a WTO-consistent approach toward this end.

<p>Washington -- Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said October 1 that Germany has agreed to take steps to ensure open competition in its heavy electric equipment market.

<p>The USTR said, "We have long sought changes to the German remedies system and assurances that U.S. firms will receive equitable treatment in the German heavy electrical equipment procurement market."

<p>The announcement came at the end of a 90-day consultation period following official citation of Germany under Title VII of the U.S. Trade Act for discriminating in its heavy electrical sector.  Since then, the Commission of the European Communities has been consulting with the United States on behalf of Germany regarding this issue.

<p>Following is the text of a news release issued October 1 by the Office of the USTR:

<p>(Begin text)

<p>Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky announced today that Germany has agreed to take steps that will effectively ensure open competition in the German heavy electric equipment market.  In announcing this agreement, Barshefsky welcomed the German Cabinet's decision to reform the public procurement remedies system.

<p>"We have long sought changes to the German remedies system and assurances that U.S. firms will receive equitable treatment in the German heavy electrical equipment procurement market," said Barshefsky.  "The German Cabinet's recent decision to implement much-needed reforms is an important step toward achieving that goal.  However, I am not terminating the Title VII action today, because legislation to enact the reforms must still be drafted and passed by parliament."

<p>Barshefsky determined to further delay imposition of sanctions and set a number of milestones for reviewing her decision.  "We will closely follow the legislative process in Germany.  We will impose sanctions if we are not satisfied with the details of the legislative reform package, there are unreasonable delays in the submission or passage of such legislation, or U.S. firms experience difficulties with future procurements while legislation is pending," Barshefsky said.

<p>Today's announcement came at the end of a 90-day consultation period after Barshefsky formally identified Germany under Title VII for discrimination in the heavy electrical sector.  Since the conclusion of the 1993 U.S.-European Union Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Government Procurement, U.S. firms experienced irregularities in the procurement process of two German procurements of steam turbines, each worth several hundred million dollars.  Moreover, in each case, there proved to be no effective remedies available in Germany to challenge these procedures, despite such obligations in the 1993 MOU.  Since January 1, 1996, Germany has been obligated to provide an effective remedy system under the WTO (World Trade Organization) Government Procurement Agreement (GPA).

<p>The United States and the Commission of the European Communities, on behalf of Germany, have conducted a series of consultations regarding German practices since Germany's identification under Title VII.  Barshefsky has agreed to meet with German Economic State Secretary Lorenz Schomerus on Thursday.  "I expect that Dr. Schomerus will be able to advise me of a consultative process we can undertake while the legislation is pending so as to ensure that it addresses our concerns and that U.S. bidders are protected," said Barshefsky.

<p>The German Government also agreed to outreach, monitoring and consultation measures in the heavy electrical equipment procurement sector to ensure that procurements are carried out in accordance with Germany's international obligations.  Barshefsky indicated that she expects that draft legislation would be available this fall and that it would be introduced by the end of the year.  "We expect passage of this legislation within one year," said Barshefsky.  "The U.S. Government will closely monitor these developments."

<b>BYLINER:  MULTILATERALISM AND REGIONALISM IN TRADE
<br>(Regional, multilateral accords need to converge)</b><br>
By Renato Ruggiero<br>
Director-General of the World Trade Organization

<p>(The following article is from the November 1996 issue of Economic Perspectives, a USIA Electronic Journal.  Persons who intend to redistribute this article should give credit to Economic Perspectives as the source.)

<p>An important basis of the multilateral trading system as represented by the World Trade Organization (WTO) is nondiscrimination in the trade conducted among WTO members; this is embodied in WTO's most-favored-nation (MFN) principle.  Preferential treatment granted in the context of regional agreements, however, is one -- and the most important -- exception to the MFN principle.  This exception, included in Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) -- the predecessor of the WTO -- was drafted in the late 1940s on the assumption that regional trade liberalization constituted an advanced implementation of tariff reductions on an MFN basis.

<p>While the proliferation of regional trade agreements has raised concerns about the implications for the multilateral trading system, the shared assessment of the great majority of the international trade community has been that these two systems have not been contradictory.  However, the relationship between regionalism and a multilateral system based on the MFN principle is nonetheless a complex one, and it is becoming more complex as the number and the scope of regional initiatives increase.  Ensuring that regionalism and multilateralism grow together -- and not apart -- is perhaps the most urgent issue facing trade policy-makers today.  Four possible elements could provide a response to that question.

<p>The Role of the CRTA

<p>First is improving the institutional capacity of the WTO to deal with regional trade agreements.  The increasing number of regional agreements, together with the relationship between regionalism and multilateralism and the impressive workload of the WTO on regional agreements, led the Council of the WTO to agree, on February 6, 1996, on the establishment of the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA).  While this may seem to be a procedural reply to an issue of substance, both the far-reaching terms of reference of, and the work already conducted in, the CRTA tend to demonstrate that WTO members are in a position to discuss the substance of the relationship between regionalism and multilateralism.

<p>The terms of reference of the CRTA include, inter alia, the examination of regional trade agreements in light of WTO rules, the development of procedures to facilitate and improve the examination process, and, as a new task to members, the consideration of the systemic implications of regional trade agreements and initiatives for the multilateral trading system and the relationship between them.

<p>From May to September 1996, the CRTA held four meetings that addressed all of the items of its term of reference.  By the end of 1996, the committee will have taken up 21 agreements due for examination (out of a total of 32 regional agreements due for examination by WTO members) -- including the North American Free Trade Agreement, the enlargement of the European Community to include Austria, Finland, and Sweden, and the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) Agreement.  Progress has also been achieved on the facilitation and improvement of the examination process.

<p>It is worth noting that the improvements being considered are mainly of a procedural nature.  However, the committee's mandate to consider the systemic implications of regional trade agreements and initiatives for the multilateral trading system and the relationship between them provides members with an opportunity to address some issues of substance with respect to regionalism and multilateralism.

<p>Debate under this item, which is not intended to have a legal character, aims at allowing WTO members to identify both the systemic implications and the relationship between the parallel moves toward regionalism and multilateralism.  This analysis could help members in defining elements that would ensure that regionalism complements -- and does not compete with -- multilateralism.  The committee is currently conducting a horizontal analysis of some of the elements found in regional agreements and initiatives that are relevant to the WTO -- technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary regulations, and rules of origin, among others -- thus giving members a broader picture of what is happening in practice.

<p>Timing and Politics

<p>A second response to the need for ensuring that regionalism and multilateralism grow together relates to ensuring that multilateral liberalization initiatives proceed almost in tandem with regional ones.  What countries are willing to do regionally they must then be willing to do multilaterally, so as to keep this parallelism between regional and multilateral commitments.  In practice, this means pressing on vigorously with the WTO's built-in agenda and even accelerating it as much as possible; it also means keeping the WTO at the forefront of the new trade agenda.

<p>A third response would involve enhancing the political dimension of the WTO.  Member countries of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meet annually at the head-of-government level and more frequently at the ministerial level.  The same is true for other regional groups.  On the other hand, WTO ministers are thus far scheduled to meet only every two years.  Yet the multilateral system is becoming more and more a political issue.  This is happening because its evolution increasingly concerns national regulatory policies rather than cross-border obstacles, which means that the challenges to the system increasingly are as much political as technical.  Logic suggests that the active involvement of political leaders should become as regular a feature of the WTO as it is of many regional groupings.

<p>Open regionalism

<p>Finally, some of the newer regional groupings (such as APEC and MERCOSUR) contain a commitment that is very important for the future of the multilateral system:  This is "open regionalism."  As for the meaning of open regionalism, two basic alternatives can be identified.

<p>-- The first would ensure that any preferential area, while being an exception to the basic principle of the WTO -- the MFN clause -- will be legally compatible with the WTO rules.  While the possibility of making such an exception was conceived by the drafters of the GATT, the proliferation of regional groupings may result in the exception becoming the rule, thus risking a complete change in the nature of the system.

<p>-- The second interpretation of open regionalism foresees the gradual elimination of barriers to trade within a regional grouping being implemented at more or less the same rate and on the same timetable as the lowering of barriers towards nonmembers.  This would mean that regional liberalization would be generally consistent not only with the rules of the WTO but also -- and this is very important -- with the MFN principle.

<p>The choice between these alternatives is a critical one; they point to very different outcomes.  In the first case, we would arrive at a division of the trading world into two or three intercontinental preferential areas, each with its own rules and with free trade inside the area, but with external barriers still existing among the blocs.  The second alternative, on the other hand, points toward the gradual convergence on the basis of shared rules and principles of all the major regional groups.  In this case, at the end we would have one global free market with rules and disciplines internationally agreed and applied to all, with the capacity to invoke the respect of the rights and obligations to which all had freely subscribed.

<TITLE>Summit of The Americas</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>

Summmit of the Americas <a href="plan.htm"> Plan of Action</a>(continued)<P>
<P>
<h4>III.  ERADICATING POVERTY AND DISCRIMINATION IN OUR HEMISPHERE</h4><P>
<P>
Large segments of society in our Hemisphere, particularly women,
minorities, the disabled, indigenous groups, refugees and
displaced persons, have not been equipped to participate fully in
economic life.  Nearly one-half of the Hemisphere's population
still lives in poverty.  Expanded participation of the poor in
the region's economies, access to productive resources,
appropriate support for social safety nets and increased human
capital investments are important mechanisms to help eradicate
poverty.  In pursuit of these objectives, we reaffirm our support
for the strategies contained within the "Commitment on a
Partnership for Development and Struggle to Overcome Extreme
Poverty" adopted by the OAS General Assembly.<P>
<P>
The World Summit for Social Development to be held in Copenhagen
in March 1995, as well as the United Nations World Conference on
Women in Beijing in September 1995, will provide unique
opportunities to define strategies to promote social integration,
productive employment and the eradication of poverty.<P>
<P>
<B>16. Universal Access to Education</B><P>
<P>
Universal literacy and access to education at all levels, without
distinction by race, national origin or gender, are an
indispensable basis for sustainable social and cultural
development, economic growth and democratic stability.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Guarantee universal access to quality primary education, working
with public and private sectors and non-governmental actors, and
with the support of multinational institutions.  In particular,
governments will seek to attain by the year 2010 a primary
completion rate of 100 per cent and a secondary enrollment rate
of at least 75 per cent, and to prepare programs to eradicate
illiteracy, prevent truancy and improve human resources
training.<P>
<P>
Promote, with the support of international financial institutions
and the private sector, worker professional training as well as
adult education, incorporating efforts to make such education
more relevant to the needs of the market and employers.<P>
<P>
Improve human resources training, and technical, professional and
teacher training, which are vital for the enhancement of quality
and equity of education within the Hemisphere.<P>
<P>
Increase access to and strengthen the quality of higher education
and promote cooperation among such institutions in producing the
scientific and technological knowledge that is necessary for
sustainable development.<P>
<p>
Support strategies to overcome nutritional deficiencies of
primary school children in order to enhance their learning
ability.<P>
<P>
Support decentralization including assurance of adequate
financing and broad participation by parents, educators,
community leaders and government officials in education decision-
making.<P>
<P>
Review existing regional and hemispheric training programs and
make them more responsive to current needs.<P>
<P>
Create a hemispheric partnership, working through existing
organizations, to provide a consultative forum for governments,
non-governmental actors, the business community, donors, and
international organizations to reform educational policies and
focus resources more efficiently.<P>
<P>
Urge the March 1995 World Summit for Social Development and the
September 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women to address the
issue of universal access to education.<P>
<P>
<B>17. Equitable Access to Basic Health Services</B><P>
<P>
Despite impressive gains in the Hemisphere, limitations on health
services access and quality have resulted in persistently high
child and maternal mortality, particularly among the rural poor
and indigenous groups.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Endorse the maternal and child health objectives of the 1990
World Summit for Children, the 1994 Nari&ntilde;o Accord and the
1994 International Conference on Population and Development, and
reaffirm their commitment to reduce child mortality by one-third
and maternal mortality by one-half from 1990 levels by the year
2000.<P>
<P>
Endorse a basic package of clinical, preventive and public health
services consistent with World Health Organization, Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO) and World Bank recommendations and
with the Program of Action agreed to at the 1994 International
Conference on Population and Development.  The package will
address child, maternal and reproductive health interventions,
including prenatal, delivery and postnatal care, family planning
information and services, and HIV/AIDS prevention, as well as
immunizations and programs combating the other major causes of
infant mortality.  The plans and programs will be developed
according to a mechanism to be decided upon by each country.<P>
<P>
Develop or update country action plans or programs for reforms to
achieve child, maternal and reproductive health goals and ensure
universal, non-discriminatory access to basic services, including
health education and preventive health care programs.  The plans
 and programs will be developed according to a mechanism to be
decided upon by each country.  Reforms would encompass essential
community-based services for the poor, the disabled, and
indigenous groups; stronger public health infrastructure;
alternative means of financing, managing and providing services;
quality assurance; and greater use of non-governmental actors and
organizations.<P>
<P>
Strengthen the existing Inter-American Network on Health
Economics and Financing, which serves as an international forum
for sharing technical expertise, information and experience, to
focus on health reform efforts.  The network gathers government
officials, representatives of the private sector, non-
governmental institutions and actors, donors and scholars for
policy discussions, analysis, training and other activities to
advance reform; strengthens national capabilities in this
critical area; and fosters Hemisphere-wide cooperation.<P>
<P>
Convene a special meeting of hemispheric governments with
interested donors and international technical agencies to be
hosted by the IDB, the World Bank and PAHO to establish the
framework for health reform mechanisms, to define PAHO's role in
monitoring the regional implementation of country plans and
programs, and to plan strengthening of the network, including the
cosponsors' contributions to it.<P>
<P>
Take the opportunity of the annual PAHO Directing Council Meeting
of Western Hemisphere Ministers of Health, with participation of
the IDB and donors, to develop a program to combat endemic and
communicable diseases as well as a program to prevent the spread
of HIV/AIDS, and to identify sources of funding. <P>
<P>
Urge the March 1995 World Summit for Social Development and the
September 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women to address the
issue of access to health services.<P>
<P>
<B>18.  Strengthening the Role of Women in Society</B><P>
<P>
The strengthening of the role of women in society is of
fundamental importance not only for their own complete
fulfillment within a framework of equality and fairness, but to
achieve true sustainable development.  It is essential to
strengthen policies and programs that improve and broaden the
participation of women in all spheres of political, social, and
economic life and that improve their access to the basic
resources needed for the full exercise of their fundamental
rights.  Attending to the needs of women means, to a great
extent, contributing to the reduction of poverty and social
inequalities.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Recognize and give full respect for all rights of women as an
essential condition for their development as individuals and for
 the creation of a more just, united and peaceful society.  For
that purpose, policies to ensure that women enjoy full legal and
civil rights protection will be promoted.<P>
<P>
Include a gender focus in development planning and cooperation
projects and promote the fulfillment of women's potential,
enhancing their productivity through education, training, skill
development and employment.<P>
<P>
Promote the participation of women in the decision-making process
in all spheres of political, social and economic life.<P>
<P>
Undertake appropriate measures to address and reduce violence
against women.<P>
<P>
Adopt appropriate measures to improve women's ability to earn
income beyond traditional occupations, achieve economic self-
reliance, and ensure women's equal access to the labor market at
all employment levels, the social security systems, the credit
system, and the acquisition of goods and land.<P>
<P>
Cooperate fully with the recently-appointed Special Rapporteur on
Violence Against Women, its Causes and Consequences, of the
United Nations Commission on Human Rights.<P>
<P>
Support and actively work to secure the success of the United
Nations World Conference on Women that will take place in Beijing
in September 1995.<P>
<P>
Encourage, as appropriate, ratification and compliance with the
International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of
Discrimination Against Women and the Inter-American Convention on
the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against
Women. <P>
<P>
Further strengthen the Inter-American Commission on Women.<P>
<P>
Call upon regional and international financial and technical
organizations to intensify their programs in favor of women.
Encourage the adoption of follow-up procedures on the national
and international measures included in this Plan of Action.<P>
<P>
<B>19. Encouraging Microenterprises and Small Businesses</B><P>
<P>
Microenterprises and small businesses account for a large
percentage of the employment of the poor, particularly women, and
contribute a considerable percentage of the gross domestic
product of our countries.  Strengthened support for
microenterprises and small businesses is a key component of
sustainable and equitable development.<P>
<P>
Governments will:<P>
<P>
Further pursue or initiate programs of deregulation and
 administrative simplification.
<P>
Increase efforts to enable enterprises to obtain information on
appropriate technologies (especially those that are
environmentally sound), markets, processes, raw materials and
management systems that will permit them to be more competitive
in the global economy.<P>
<P>
Develop programs of financial deregulation to reduce costs in
credit transactions and strengthen the institutional capacity of
the financial sector servicing microenterprises and small
businesses, and encourage the active participation by
multilateral and bilateral agencies, development banks,
commercial banks and other intermediary credit organizations,
consistent with strict performance standards.<P>
<P>
Strengthen the institutions and programs that supply services and
facilitate access to training and technical assistance to make
possible this sector's participation in the global economy
through export of its products and services.<P>
<P>
Encourage cooperation among businesses in this sector to enable
them to benefit from the advantages of economies of scale without
losing their distinctive characteristics.<P>
<P>
Promote the strengthening of relations among the public, private
and mixed (public/private) institutions that support the
microenterprise and small business sector through programs of
information, training, technical assistance, financing and
association-building, enabling this sector to thrive over the
long term.<P>
<P>
Recommend to the multilateral development organizations,
especially the World Bank and the IDB, the establishment or
fortification of funds and other mechanisms to support
microenterprises and small businesses.<P>
<P>
<B>20. White Helmets -- Emergency and Development Corps</B><P>
<P>
The "White Helmets Initiative" is based on the conviction that a
concerted international effort of developing and developed
countries can facilitate the eradication of poverty and
strengthen the humanitarian rapid response capability of the
international community to emergency humanitarian, social and
developmental needs.<P>
<P>
The countries of the Americas could pioneer this initiative
through the creation of national corps of volunteers that could
respond to calls from other countries in the region.  These
national corps could eventually be put at the disposal of the
United Nations.<P>
<P>
Governments will on a voluntary basis:<P>
<p>
Establish, organize and finance a corps of volunteers to work at
the national level and, at the same time, be at the disposal of
other countries of the Hemisphere and, eventually, the United
Nations system, on a stand-by basis, for prevention, relief,
rehabilitation, technical, social and development cooperation,
with the aim to reduce the effects of natural disasters, social
and developmental needs and emergencies.<P>
<P>
Through the creation of a national corps of volunteers, be
responsible for the following:<P>
<P>
-- Selection and training of its national volunteer corps;<P>
<P>
-- Financing of its national corps of volunteers, encouraging the
involvement of the private sector;<P>
<P>
-- Preparedness to send specialized volunteers, on short notice
and at the request of the United Nations, to cope with situations
generated by or to prevent the effects of natural disasters and
humanitarian emergencies.<P>
<P>
Contribute to the formation of this corps and invite private
enterprises, foundations and regional financial institutions to
do so.<P>
<P>
Contribute to the development of an international roster of
volunteers to be maintained in a master plan in the United
Nations to be drawn upon to complement the activities of existing
UN mechanisms.  The IDB, OAS, and PAHO should be invited to
participate and assist in developing this corps.<P>

<i><b><font size=12>T</font></b></i>
he earliest Americans did not speak of "human rights." But they
did speak of freedom and liberties, and they valued them highly.
As British subjects, they were well familiar with the steady
evolution of British political and constitutional rights.
<p>
Many of the first colonists came to the New World seeking the
religious freedom denied them in 17th-century Europe.
Massachusetts was founded by Puritans, Pennsylvania by Quakers,
Maryland by Catholics. French Calvinists -- Huguenots --
attempted an early colony in the Middle South, and later settled
in important numbers in several colonies farther north. These
highly religious groups may not have accepted each other from the
beginning; in fact, some of them imposed their will on religious
minorities by establishing state religions in colonial America.
But over time, the exigencies of colonial life fostered a sense
of religious tolerance among them, and, in most cases, freedom of
worship was incorporated into colonial law and custom.
<p>
In addition to bringing their religious faith to the New World,
American colonists brought a passion for self-government. Even
before they landed on the coast of Massachusetts in 1620,
America's early settlers, the Puritans, drew up the "Mayflower
Compact," agreeing to abide by "just and equal laws" framed by
leaders of their own choosing. Massachusetts was not a perfect
democracy, but as more and more settlers filled the coastal towns
and peopled the interior of the northeastern United States -- the
area commonly known as New England -- the tendency was toward
inclusion. By the 18th century, the democratic nature of the New
England town meeting, at which inhabitants of a town come
together as its legislative authority, was firmly established. 
Among America's founding fathers who emerged from this background
were John and Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman,
James Otis, Alexander Hamilton, and many others.
<p>
In Virginia, the largest of the southern colonies and one with a
much different social structure from New England, there was also
a long tradition of participation in local government. From this
heritage came George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, George Mason,
James Madison, and other of America's founders.
<p>
Thus, when the time came for the American colonists to dissolve
the political bonds that connected them to Britain, they looked
to an already well-established body of law and custom that
recognized freedom of speech, of religious worship, and of
assembly, as well as the right to petition, to a jury trial, and
to have a say in governing their own affairs. In fact, it was the
curtailment of these liberties that sparked America's revolution
to gain independence from Britain.
<p>
<i><b><font size=10>T</font>he Principles of Freedom</i></b>
<br>
<a name="declare">Although the first battles of the American
Revolution occurred in
1775, the <a href="declare.htm">Declaration of Independence</a>
by the American colonies in
1776 formally announced the revolution. Its principal author was
Thomas Jefferson, who later became the third president of the
United States.
<p>
With the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson created a
succinct yet eloquent affirmation of human rights and natural
law. In the Declaration's second paragraph, Jefferson wrote: "We
hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable [inalienable] Rights, that among these are Life,
Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these
Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just
powers from the consent of the governed...."
<p>
As Abraham Lincoln, who led the United States during its fiercest
battle over human rights -- the Civil War -- said of the
Declaration more than a half-century later, its signers "meant
simply to declare the right so that enforcement of it might
follow as fast as circumstances might permit. They meant to set
up a standard maxim for free society, which would be familiar to
all and revered by all; constantly looked to, constantly labored
for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly
approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its
influence and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all
people of all colors everywhere."

<p>
Although the Declaration of Independence did not provoke the
American Revolution, it did clarify the rationale for the battle,
which continued, with assistance from the French, until the
British surrendered. On September 3, 1783, American and British
representatives signed articles of peace -- the Treaty of Paris -
- in which Britain acknowledged the independence, freedom, and
sovereignty of the 13 former American colonies, soon to be
states.
<p>
For the first years of independence, the American states remained
largely independent of each other, united only by loose-fitting
Articles of Confederation that served as the basic law of the new
nation. The articles were seen more as a treaty between equal
states joining together for military security and economic
advantage than a formal constitution governing the country. This
was a deliberate choice by many who feared central government and
believed that individual liberties would more likely be protected
at the state than at the national level.
<p>
The success of the revolution gave Americans the opportunity to
give legal form to their ideals as expressed in the Declaration
of Independence and to remedy some of the grievances through
state constitutions. As early as May of 1776, Congress had passed
a resolution advising the colonies to form new governments "such
as shall best conduce to the happiness and safety of their
constituents." Within a year after the Declaration of
Independence, all but three states had drawn up constitutions.
<p>
The first objective of the framers of the state constitutions was
to secure those inalienable rights whose violation had caused the
former colonies to repudiate their connection with Britain. Thus,
each began with a declaration or bill of rights. Virginia's
constitution, which served as a model for the others, included a
declaration of such principles as popular sovereignty, rotation
in office, and freedom of elections, as well as an enumeration of
fundamental liberties -- moderate bail and humane punishment,
speedy trial by jury, freedom of the press and of conscience, and
the right of the majority to reform or alter the government.
<p>
Other states enlarged the list of liberties. But the state
constitutions also had some glaring limitations. The colonies
south of Pennsylvania excluded their slave populations from their
inalienable rights as human beings. Women had no political
rights. No state went so far as to permit universal male
suffrage, and even in those states that permitted all taxpayers
to vote, office-holders were required to own a certain amount of
property.
<p>
<i><b><font size=12>T</font>
he U.S. Constitution</b></i>
<p>
It was not until 1787 that representatives from the states met in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to begin drawing up the U.S.
Constitution. What they crafted was a document of compromise and
representative democracy, one that has adapted well to changing
circumstances for over 200 years. As its framers stated in the
preamble to this basic law of the United States, the document was
written "in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish
Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common
defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of
Liberty to ourselves and our posterity...."
<p>
There were many who opposed the new Constitution, though. Their
consent to the document came only with the promise that a series
of amendments guaranteeing the civil liberties that were part of
most state constitutions would soon accompany it.
<p>
<a name="bill">To this end, in 1791, 10 amendments -- known
collectively as the
<a href="bill.htm">Bill of Rights</a> -- were added to the
Constitution. These
amendments specifically guarantee freedom of religion, speech,
and the press. They proclaim the right of the people to peaceable
assembly; to petition the government for redress of grievances;
to bear arms; to secure their persons, houses, papers, and
effects against unreasonable search and seizure; to due process
of law; and to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury.
<p>
Since the adoption of the Bill of Rights, only 17 additional
amendments have been made part of the Constitution. A number of
these amendments revised the federal government's structure and
operation, but many followed the precedent established by the
Bill of Rights and expanded individual rights and freedoms.
<p>
But while the United States began with a well-established body of
rights and liberties, it would take almost two centuries before
those rights and liberties could be said to include all
Americans.
<p>
One step toward greater inclusion was to expand the franchise
beyond the narrow precepts of the times, which held that only
white male property owners could vote or hold public office. By
the early 19th century, virtually all the states had eliminated
property qualifications as a condition for voting or holding
office, and the aristocratic elite that had governed the country
had been largely pushed aside for the new American, the self-made
man. As the French author Alexis de Tocqueville noted in his
introduction to <I>Democracy in America</I> in the mid-1800s,
"The more
I advanced in the study of American society, the more I perceived
that this equality of condition is the fundamental fact from
which all others seem to be derived."
<p>
The spread of suffrage led to a new concept of education, for
statesmen everywhere perceived the threat to universal suffrage
from an untutored, illiterate electorate. These men were
supported by organized labor, whose leaders demanded free,
tax-supported schools open to all children; gradually, states
enacted legislation to provide for such instruction. But while
the public school system became common throughout the northern
part of the country, in other parts the battle for public
education continued for years.
<p>
The American quest for rights and opportunities also saw the
beginning of the labor organization. In 1835, labor forces in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, succeeded in reducing the former
"dark-to-dark" workday to a 10-hour day. Other reforms of the
times addressed the problems of prisons and care for the insane.
Efforts were made to turn prisons, which stressed punishment,
into penitentiaries where the guilty would undergo
rehabilitation, and to establish state hospitals for the care of
the insane, who previously had been confined to wretched
almshouses and prisons.
<p>
<i><b><font size=12>A</font>
 House Divided</b></i>
<br>
Despite the spread of democracy, the practice of slavery mocked
the concept that liberty and the pursuit of happiness were the
rights of all Americans. The battle to contain and ultimately
defeat slavery took three-quarters of a century. It was Thomas
Jefferson, a slaveholder himself, who struck the first blow. His
Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which was adopted under the Articles
of Confederation, prohibited slavery in the more northern U.S.
territories.
<p>
The international slave trade was abolished in 1808, and many
thought that this would bring an end to slavery in America, too.
But the expectation proved false, for during the next generation
the southern United States united solidly behind the institution
of slavery as the boom of such labor-intensive southern
industries as cotton, tobacco, and sugar cane made slavery
immensely profitable. Thus, the leaders of the South clung firmly
to slavery and countered every move of the growing and
increasingly vocal abolitionist movement.

<p>
Slavery was inherently a system of brutality and coercion in
which beatings and the breakups of families through the sale of
individual slaves were commonplace. However, the most trenchant
criticism of slavery for many was its fundamental violation of
every human being's right to be free.
<p>
With the election of Abraham Lincoln as the country's president
in 1860, the situation began to change. "A house divided against
itself cannot stand," Lincoln had said in an 1858 Senate campaign
speech. "I believe this government cannot endure permanently half
slave and half free." Lincoln was sworn in as president on March
4, 1861. And on April 12 of that year, southerners opened fire on
federal troops stationed at Fort Sumter in the Charleston, South
Carolina, harbor, beginning the U.S. Civil War. The battle --
pitting the slave-owners of the South, who sought independence
from the United States, against those living in the North -- cost
half a million American lives before it ended in 1865.
<p>
Lincoln declared the end of slavery on January 1, 1863, with the
Emancipation Proclamation, which proclaimed as "forever free" all
slaves living in the areas that were in rebellion. Slavery was
formally abolished in December 1865 by the Thirteenth Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution, which states that "neither slavery nor
involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof
the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the
United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction." 
<p>
Within a few months of the end of the war, Congress began to work
out a plan for the reconstruction of the South, which had been
devastated by the battle. By mid-1866, Congress had passed a
civil rights bill and set up a Freedman's Bureau -- both designed
to prevent discrimination against blacks by southern
legislatures. Congress also passed the Fourteenth Amendment to
the Constitution, which states that "all persons born or
naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the States
wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,
liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
This repudiated an earlier ruling -- known as the Dred Scott
decision, for the black slave who was the claimant -- which had
denied slaves the right of citizenship.
<p>
All southern legislatures with one exception refused to ratify
the amendment. It was only after ratification was made a
condition of southern states' escaping a permanent military
government established in the South by the Congress that the
amendment was ratified in 1868.
<p>
In 1870, yet another amendment was added to the Constitution,
this one maintaining that race was not to be a bar to voting
rights. The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified on March 30 of that
year, states that "the right of citizens of the United States to
vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by
any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of
servitude."
<p>
In spite of laws passed and efforts made to resolve the problems
of the South, Reconstruction was in many ways a period of
regression. Southern state legislatures passed "black codes"
aimed at reimposing bondage on the freedmen. The codes differed
from state to state, but some provisions were common. Blacks were
required to enter into annual labor contracts, with penalties
imposed in case of violation; dependent children were subject to
compulsory apprenticeship and corporal punishment by masters; and
vagrants could be sold into private service if they could not pay
severe fines. The last quarter of the 19th century also saw a
profusion of "Jim Crow" laws in southern states that segregated
public schools, forbade or limited black access to public
facilities such as parks, restaurants, and hotels, and denied
most blacks the right to vote by imposing poll taxes and
arbitrary literacy tests.
<p>
In effect, slaves had been granted their freedom, but not
equality. Their economic needs were not fully addressed by the
North. While the Freedmen's Bureau attempted to protect slaves
from violence, it could not provide them with political and
economic opportunity. Blacks depended on northern whites -- some
of them racists -- to protect them from the Ku Klux Klan, an
organization of white men that threatened blacks and prevented
them from exercising their rights. Without economic resources,
many southern blacks were forced to work as tenant farmers on
land owned by their former masters, in a cycle of poverty.
<p>
The failure of the Reconstruction period meant that the struggle
of African-Americans for freedom and equality was deferred until
the 20th century, when it would become a national, not a
southern, issue.
<p>
<i><b><font size=12>T</font>
he Battle for Women's Suffrage</b></i>
<br>
One of the most powerful voices for freedom in the 19th century
was Frederick Douglass. Born a southern slave in
1817, he had escaped to the North and later found the means to
buy his freedom as a guarantee against being returned
to the South as a piece of property.
<p>
Although slaves were forbidden to learn how to read by the laws
of the time, once freed, Douglass discovered that he had a gift
for writing and for speaking before audiences. He founded a
newspaper called North Star to campaign against slavery, he wrote
scores of magazine and newspaper articles, and he became a
spokesperson for the Anti-Slavery Society in Massachusetts.
Douglass also helped form the Underground Railroad, a network of
secret routes in which both blacks and whites helped runaway
slaves make their way north to freedom.  
<p>
Douglass was a leading voice for freedom not only for
black Americans. He fought for human rights for all people,
including voting rights for women. If less 
bloody than the war against slavery, the battle for women's
suffrage, which began in the 19th century and continued into the
early part of the next, nevertheless necessitated a long and
arduous fight against narrow-mindedness, tradition, prejudice,
and exclusion.
<p>
During the 1830s and 1840s, women had been playing important
roles in various American reform movements, such as temperance
(prohibition of alcohol), abolition (slavery), and educational
reform. And while the work they did was significant, women found
they could not take leadership roles nor could they lobby
strongly for their positions. They were expected to be part of
the background. For some, the situation became intolerable.
<p>
The first important "women's meeting" was held in 1848 at the
Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls, New York. Not surprisingly, its
chief sponsors were linked to the abolitionist movement.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott had attended an
anti-slavery meeting in London and had been excluded because they
were women. Their anger at this treatment led directly to the
Seneca Falls meeting, where 240 people, 40 of them men, came
together to draft a "women's bill of rights" modeled after the
Declaration of Independence. Although the bill included a
provision calling for the right of women to vote, most of the
delegates were reluctant to pass such a measure, and it was only
after Frederick Douglass spoke to the assembly that it was
adopted.
<p>
From this moment on, gaining the franchise would be the rallying
cry at every women's rights convention. Gradually, women were
allowed to speak in public, and individual states adopted laws
enabling women to own property in their own names, to keep their
earnings, and to retain custody of their children in cases of
divorce.
<p>
In 1869, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony established
the National Woman Suffrage Association and began an all-out
campaign for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to give women
the right to vote. The two would form a 50-year alliance,
becoming the most outspoken advocates of the women's movement
across the United States.
<p>
That same year, the western U.S. state of Wyoming became the
first state to grant women the right to vote within its borders.
But it was not until 1920 that the Nineteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, granting the right to vote to every adult woman in
the country, was passed.
<p>
<i><b><font size=12>T</font>
he New Deal</b></i>
<br>
Yet another struggle involved the worker. The life of the
19th-century American worker was far from easy. Even in good
times, wages were low, hours long, and working conditions
hazardous. Before 1874, when Massachusetts passed the nation's
first legislation limiting the number of hours women and child
factory workers could perform to 10 a day, virtually no labor
legislation existed in the country. Indeed, it was not until the
1930s that the federal government became actively involved.
<p>
In 1932, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected to the presidency
of the United States. With that election, the concept of rights
expanded to include economic and social rights. Roosevelt's
program of direct federal relief and economic security, known as
the New Deal, won the support of the overwhelming majority of
Americans, then suffering through the devastating Great
Depression of the 1930s.
<p>
In 1935, the U.S. Congress passed the Social Security Act. Social
Security created a system of insurance for the aged, the
unemployed, and the disabled based on employer and employee
contributions. The program was funded in large part by taxes on
the earnings of current workers. Although its origins were
modest, Social Security today is one of the largest domestic
programs administered by the U.S. government, guaranteeing to
millions of Americans a modicum of financial protection.
<p>
During the same year, workers gained the right to organize and
bargain collectively. And in 1938, a minimum wage and a maximum
work week were established.

<a name="fourfree">Although Roosevelt saw himself
very much in
the tradition of
Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln in terms of his concern for
political rights, he was, by necessity, preoccupied with the
problems of poverty and basic economic needs. The outbreak of war
in Europe in 1939 forced Roosevelt to turn from the country's
pressing domestic problems and begin considering the kind of
world that might emerge from the devastation of so many millions.
In January of 1941, in what came to be known as the 
<a href="fourfree.htm">"Four
Freedoms"</a> address, Roosevelt called on all governments to
guarantee their citizens freedom from want and fear, as well as
freedom of speech and worship.
<p>
In August 1941, Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston
Churchill agreed on the Atlantic Charter, which proclaimed a
broad vision of a new postwar world order based on democracy,
freedom, disarmament, and international cooperation. In January
1942, two dozen nations fighting Japan and Nazi Germany adopted
the charter's basic principles. Roosevelt's term "the United
Nations" was used for the first time in this document.
<p>
In December 1941, the Japanese attacked the U.S. naval base at
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The viciousness of the attack and fear of
Asian espionage led the U.S. government to inter
Japanese-Americans without due process of law. In February 1942,
nearly 120,000 Japanese-Americans residing in California were
removed from their homes and placed behind barbed wire in 10
temporary camps, later to be moved to "relocation centers"
outside isolated southwestern towns. More than 60 percent of
these Japanese-Americans were American born and were U.S.
citizens. No evidence of espionage ever surfaced. In fact,
Japanese-Americans from Hawaii and the continental United States
fought with distinction on the Italian front, while others served
as interpreters and translators in the Pacific. Although the
exclusion of the Japanese from the U.S. West Coast was upheld in
1944 by the U.S. Supreme Court in Korematsu v. U.S., in 1983, the
U.S. government acknowledged the injustice of its actions with
payments to those Japanese-Americans of that era who were still
living.
<p>
Throughout World War II, Roosevelt remained intensely interested
in the peace to follow and in establishing effective
international institutions to promote the fundamental human
rights of all mankind, not just Americans. As political
philosopher Isaiah Berlin said, Roosevelt's vision of
international responsibility made him a hero "to the indigent and
oppressed far beyond the confines of the English-speaking world."
<p>
Roosevelt's belief that a better world lay ahead after the war
never dimmed. "The great fact to remember is that the trend of
civilization is forever upward," he noted in his January 1945
inaugural address -- his fourth and his last. At the time he died
later in 1945, the United Nations and the international financial
institutions he had done so much to create were well on their way
to becoming enduring institutions. In contrast to the years
following World War I, when the United States rejected membership
in the League of Nations and adopted a policy of isolationism,
its participation in the 1945 San Francisco conference to erect
the framework of the United Nations signaled to the world that
the United States intended to play a key role in international
affairs.

the United States helped begin the process of extending the full
benefits of freedom to African-Americans. Despite the Bill of
Rights, amendments to the U.S. Constitution granting full
citizenship rights, and numerous presidential executive orders,
African-Americans continued to suffer from widespread, blatant,
and often legal discrimination.
<p>
African-Americans became increasingly restive in the postwar
years. During the war they had challenged discrimination in the
military services and in the work force, and they had made
limited gains. Millions of blacks had left southern farms for
northern cities, where they hoped to find better jobs. They
found, instead, crowded conditions in urban slums. Now, black
servicemen returned home, intent on rejecting second-class
citizenship, as other blacks began to argue that the time was
ripe for racial equality.
<p>
Blacks in the South then enjoyed few, if any, civil and political
rights. More than one million black soldiers had fought in World
War II, but those who came from the South could not vote. Blacks
who tried to register to vote faced the likelihood of beatings,
loss of jobs, loss of credit, or eviction from their land.
Lynchings still occurred, and Jim Crow laws enforced segregation
of the races in street cars, trains, hotels, restaurants,
hospitals, recreational facilities, and employment.
<p>
President Harry Truman, a Democrat, supported the campaign for
civil rights, and he responded by sending a 10-point civil rights
program to the Congress. When southern Democrats, angry about a
strong civil rights stance, left the Democratic party in 1948,
Truman issued an executive order barring discrimination in
federal employment, ordered equal treatment in the armed forces,
and appointed a committee to work toward an end to military
segregation.
<p>
Blacks also began to take matters into their own hands. In the
years after slavery ended, blacks had formed scores of
nongovernmental organizations to organize and lobby for the
rights that other Americans took for granted. The most
influential of these was the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which had been founded in
1909 and included the participation of many non-blacks who
believed in equal justice.
<p>
In the decade following World War II, attorney Thurgood Marshall,
then the NAACP's chief legal counsel and later to become the
first black to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, traveled
throughout the country, laying the legal foundations for an
assault on racial segregation. His efforts culminated in a U.S.
Supreme Court decision in 1954 -- Brown v. Board of Education --
outlawing the segregation of black and white students in public
schools. A year later, the Supreme Court demanded that local
school boards move with "all deliberate speed" to implement the
decision.
<p>
Despite the Supreme Court's ruling, black Americans were
impatient at the slow rate of progress toward full integration.
On December 1, 1955, a seemingly insignificant event took place
in Montgomery, Alabama -- then still a southern stronghold of
segregation -- that ignited the modern Civil Rights Movement. An
African-American woman named Rosa Parks refused to give up her
seat on a Montgomery city bus to a white man, as was then
required by Alabama law. She was arrested.
<p>
Her act of defiance might have gone unnoticed had it not been for
Martin Luther King, Jr., a young Baptist minister.  King led a
382-day boycott of the city's public transportation system that
forced the city to integrate it.
<p>
In 1960, black college students sat down at a segregated lunch
counter in North Carolina and refused to leave. Their sit-in
captured media attention and led to similar demonstrations
throughout the South. The next year, civil rights workers
organized "freedom rides" in which blacks and whites boarded
buses heading south toward segregated terminals.
<p>
Martin Luther King, Jr., continued to be part of these
activities. A life-long advocate of nonviolence, King, with other
ministers, founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
which was dedicated to the nonviolent struggle against racism and
discrimination. But in his quest for racial justice, he joined
forces with many other organizations to, as he put it, "make
America what it ought to be."
<p>
There were many important milestones in the Civil Rights
Movement. One of the most memorable took place on an August day
in 1963, when over 200,000 Americans, black and white, assembled
at the memorial to Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C. Scores of
speakers addressed the crowd, but the day belonged to King, who
set aside his prepared text and spoke from his heart. "I have a
dream," he said. "It is a dream deeply rooted in the American
dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and
live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to
be self-evident; that all men are created equal.' "  
<p>
King was to see the U.S. Congress in 1964 pass the Civil Rights
Act, which outlawed discrimination in all public accommodation,
and in 1965 the Voting Rights Act, which authorized the federal
government to appoint examiners to register voters where local
officials made black registration impossible. The year after
passage, 400,000 blacks registered in the Deep South. King was
killed by an assassin's bullet in April 1968, while on a visit to
the city of Memphis, Tennessee, to champion the rights of
sanitation workers there, most of whom were black and poor.
<p>
King's primary objective was equality for African-Americans, but
he realized that racism is not just an American problem but a
global one. "Among the moral imperatives of our time," he said,
"we are challenged to work all over the world with unshakable
determination to wipe out the last vestiges of racism. It is no
mere American phenomenon. Its vicious grasp knows no geographical
boundaries."
<p>
<i><b><font size=12>D</font>
iscontent and Change</b></i>
<br>
During the debate on the 1964 Civil Rights bill, some legislators
had hoped to defeat the measure by proposing an amendment to
outlaw discrimination on the basis of gender as well as race.
First the amendment, then the bill itself, passed, giving women
the legal tool to secure their rights.  
<p>
Women themselves took measures to improve their lot. In 1966, 28
professional women established the National Organization for
Women (NOW) "to take action to bring American women into full
participation in the mainstream of American society now." Four
years later, membership had reached 15,000. NOW and similar
organizations helped make women increasingly aware of their
limited opportunities and strengthened their resolve to increase
them.
<p>
Organized activity on behalf of women's rights reached its peak
in the early 1970s. In 1972, Congress passed the Equal Rights
Amendment to the Constitution, which declared: "Equality of
rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the
United States or by any State on account of sex." Over the next
several years, 35 of the necessary 38 states ratified the
amendment, but this was not enough for passage, and the amendment
died in 1982 as the women's movement stagnated. Although the
effort to protect women from gender discrimination continues
today, the gains made by women during the 1970s and in the years
following firmly established their place in all aspects of
American life.
<p>
In post-World War II America, Spanish-speaking groups faced
discrimination as well. Coming from Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico,
and Central America, they were often unskilled and unable to
speak English. Some worked as farm laborers and, at times, were
cruelly exploited while harvesting crops; others gravitated to
the cities where, like earlier immigrant groups, they encountered
difficulties in their quest for a better life.
<p>
The National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which secured many
gains for U.S. workers, had excluded agricultural workers from
its guarantee of the right of labor to organize and bargain
collectively. But the example of black activism had taught
Hispanics the importance of pressure politics in a pluralistic
society. Cesar Chavez, founder of the overwhelmingly Hispanic
United Farm Workers, called for a nationwide consumer boycott of
selected agricultural products that laid the foundation for
representation to secure higher wages and improved working
conditions for migrants. Also during this time, Hispanics became
politically active, further increasing their assimilation into
American society.
<p>
One final group that worked to claim their rights in the wake of
the Civil Rights Movement were Native Americans. In the 1950s,
the federal government had undertaken a program of moving Native
Americans off reservations and into cities, where they might
become part of "mainstream America." Not only did they face the
loss of land; many of the uprooted Indians often had difficulties
adjusting to urban life.
<p>
In the 1960s and 1970s, Native Americans became aggressive in
pressing for their rights. A new generation of leaders went to
court to protect what was left of tribal lands or to recover that
which had been taken, often illegally, in previous times. In
state after state, they challenged treaty violations and, in
1967, won the first of many victories guaranteeing long-abused
land and water rights. The American Indian Movement, founded in
1968, helped channel government funds to Indian-controlled
organizations and assisted neglected Indians in the cities.
<p>
Indian activism brought results. Other Americans became more
aware of Native American needs, and officials in all branches of
government had to respond to pressure for equal treatment that
was long overdue.
<p>
<i><b><font size=12>T</font>
he Cold War and Beyond</b></i>
<br>
From its beginning, the Cold War put limits on those who hoped to
make human rights America's top international priority. Locked in
competition with the Soviet Union, the United States chose to
accept responsibility for countering Communist moves in Eastern
and Central Europe and elsewhere.
<p>
The most dramatic defense of Western freedom took place in
Berlin, when Soviet occupation forces closed off the city, still
struggling to recover from wartime devastation, in June 1948. 
U.S. and Allied forces flew 277,000 missions, keeping the city
alive until the Soviets lifted the embargo some 10 months later.
<p>
With the arrival of dtente, an era of lowered U.S.-Soviet
tensions began. A high point of the era was the Helsinki Accords.
Signed in 1975, they set the stage for the struggle for freedom
and human rights that would culminate in the fall of the Berlin
Wall 14 years later.
<p>
In November 1976, Jimmy Carter was elected president of the
United States. Carter took office two months later with a strong
commitment to human rights. In 1977, a human rights bureau was
created within the U.S. Department of State. Its first human
rights reports were issued that year. Since then, reports have
been produced every year; they now cover every country,
including, for the first time in 1995, the United States itself.
<p>
To some, Carter's belief in the universality of human rights was
too idealistic. Nonetheless, despite ideological differences, the
succeeding U.S. presidential administrations have made human
rights a fundamental tenet of national policy.

<i><b><font size=5>W</font></b>hen in the course of human Events,
it becomes necessary
for
one
People to dissolve the political bands which have connected them
with another, and to assume among the Powers of the earth, the
separate and equal station to which the laws of Nature and of
Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of
mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel
them to the separation.
<P>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable [inalienable] Rights, that among these are Life,
Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these
Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just
powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any Form
of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right
of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new
Government, laying its foundation on such principles and
organizing its Powers in such form, as to them shall seem most
likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed,
will dictate that Governments long established should not be
changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all
experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer,
while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by
abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a
long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the
same Object evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute
Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such
Government, and to provide new guards for their future security.
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such
is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former
Systems of Government....
<P>We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of
America, in General Congress, assembled, appealing to the Supreme
Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in
the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies,
solemnly publish and declare, that these United Colonies are, and
of Right ought to be Free and Independent States.... And for the
support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the
protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other
our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.</i>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>...<b><font size=5>T</font></b>here is nothing
mysterious about the foundations of a
healthy
and strong democracy. The basic things expected by our people
of their political and economic systems are simple. They are:
<ul>
<li>Equality of opportunity for youth and for
others.<br>
Jobs for those who can work.
<li>Security for those who need it.
<li>The ending of special privilege for the few.
<li>The preservation of civil liberties for all.
<li>The enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider
and
constantly rising standard of living.
</ul>
<P>These are the simple and basic things that must never be lost
sight of in the turmoil and unbelievable complexity of our
modern world. The inner and abiding strength of our
economic and political systems is dependent upon the degree to
which they fulfill these expectations....
<P>In the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look
forward
to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.
The first is freedom of speech and expression -- everywhere
in the world.
<P>The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his
own
way -- everywhere in the world.
<P>The third is freedom from want -- which, translated into world
terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every
nation a healthy peacetime life for its
inhabitants everywhere in the world.
<P>The fourth is freedom from fear -- which translated into world
terms means a worldwide reduction of armaments to such a point
and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a
position to commit an act of physical aggression against any   
neighbor -- anywhere in the world.
<P>That is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite
basis
for a kind of world attainable in our own time and
generation. That kind of world is the very antithesis of
the so-called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to
create with the crash of a bomb.
<P>To that new order we oppose the greater conception -- the
moral
order. A good society is able to face schemes of world domination
and foreign revolutions alike without fear.
<P>Since the beginning of our American history we have been
engaged
in change -- in a     perpetual peaceful revolution -- a
revolution which goes on steadily, quietly adjusting itself to
changing conditions -- without the concentration camp or the
quicklime in the ditch. The world order which we seek is the
cooperation of free countries, working together in a friendly,
civilized society.

<P>
Political power in Iraq is concentrated in a repressive one-party
apparatus dominated by Saddam Hussein.  The provisional
Constitution of 1968 stipulates that the Arab Ba'ath Socialist
Party (ABSP) governs Iraq through the Revolutionary Command
Council (RCC), which exercises both executive and legislative
authority.  President Saddam Hussein, who is also Prime Minister,
Chairman of the RCC, and Secretary General of the Regional
Command of the ABSP, wields decisive power.  Saddam Hussein and
his colleagues continue to point to an October 1995,
nondemocratic "referendum" on his presidency in which he received
99.96 per cent of the vote as legitimating the regime.  However,
his "referendum" included neither secret ballots nor opposing
candidates, and many credible reports indicated that voters
feared possible reprisal for a negative vote.  The judiciary is
not independent and is subject to presidential interference.
<P>
Ethnically and linguistically, the Iraqi population includes
Arabs, Kurds, Turkomen, Yazidis, and Armenians.  Historically,
the religious mix is likewise varied:  Shi'a and Sunni Muslims
(both Arab and Kurdish), Christians (including Chaldeans and
Assyrians), and Jews (most of whom have emigrated).  Ethnic
divisions have resulted in civil uprisings in recent years,
especially in the north and the south.  The Government has
reacted against those who revolt with extreme repression.
<P>
The Government's security apparatus includes militias attached to
the President, the Ba'ath Party, and the Interior Ministry.  They
play a central role in maintaining the environment of
intimidation and fear on which government power rests.  Security
forces have committed widespread, serious, and systematic human
rights abuses.
<P>
The Government controls most of the economy, which is largely
based on oil production, and owns all major industries.  Damaged
by the Gulf War and subjected to United Nations sanctions as a
result of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the economy continues
to deteriorate.  The sanctions ban all exports and allows imports
only of food, medicine, and materials and supplies for essential
civilian needs.  The Government's failure to comply with U.N.    

Security Council resolutions has led to repeated extensions of
the sanctions.  In May, after a year of obstruction and delay,
the Government reached agreement with the U.N. on a plan to
implement U.N. Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 986, which
would allow a controlled sale of Iraqi oil to purchase food and
other humanitarian goods to improve the deteriorating situation
of the Iraqi people.  Throughout the rest of 1996, however, the
Government continued to engage in delaying tactics and other
actions which the U.N. and other observers cited as delaying
implementation.  The Government's actions threatened the
resolution's intended controls on oil sales and the conditions
required to ensure fair and equitable distribution of relief.  In
mid-December, the U.N. announced that conditions were finally in
place to allow implementation to begin, although it appeared
likely that relief would not be delivered until early 1997.
<P>
The Government's abysmal record on human rights worsened in 
1996.  Human rights abuses remain extremely difficult to document
because of the Government's efforts to conceal the facts,
including its refusal to permit visits by human rights monitors
or other observers and its continued restrictions designed to
prevent dissent.  Nevertheless, the Government's renewal of
repression and threats in northern Iraq following its military
attack on the city of Irbil on August 31 make it clear that
serious human rights violations increased.
<P>
Summary executions of perceived political opponents reportedly
increased, as did reports of disappearances.  Both types of
repression were particularly clear in the north during and after
the August 31 attack on Irbil.  Tens of thousands of political
killings and disappearances remain unresolved from previous
years. As socioeconomic conditions deteriorated, the regime
punished persons accused of economic crimes, military desertion,
and a variety of other charges with torture and cruel and inhuman
penalties, including the extensive use of amputation.  Prison
conditions are poor. The authorities routinely use arbitrary
arrest and detention.  The judiciary is not independent; the
President can override any court decision.  The Government
continues to deny citizens the right to due process and privacy. 
Max van der Stoel, the Special Rapporteur for Iraq appointed by
the U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), confirmed again that
freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and association do not
exist, except in some parts of the northern areas, beyond control
of the Government.  The Government severely limits freedom of
religion and movement, discriminates against women, children,
religious minorities, and ethnic groups.  It also restricts
worker rights.
<P>
Citizens do not have the right to change their government.  The
October "referendum" on Saddam's presidency was not free.  It was
dismissed by most international observers.  As in years past, the
Government forcibly transferred hundreds of government workers
from one job to another, purportedly to prevent the development
of potential opposition in any government institutions.  After
failed coup attempts and repressed protests between May and July,
the Government arrested, removed from their jobs, or otherwise
punished numerous citizens for their alleged association with
these incidents.  The fate of many such persons remains unknown. 
After Saddam's daughters and his sons-in-law, Hussein Kamel and
Saddam Kamel al-Majid, defected to Jordan in August 1995, the
Government reportedly arrested scores of midlevel military and
civilian officials for their association with the defectors. 
Evidence has emerged that the Government was behind the deaths of
Saddam's sons-in-law, who returned to Iraq in February from
Jordan after they received promises of amnesty.  Shortly after
entering Iraq, the two were separated from their families and
were killed, allegedly in a gunfight with relatives.  Other
members of the al-Majid clan were also arrested or disappeared.
<P>
Iraqi military operations continued to target Shi'a Arabs living
in the southern marshes.  In central and southern Iraq, the
regime continued to divert humanitarian supplies to its security
forces, the military, and other supporters.  For most of the
year, the Government maintained an internal embargo against
Iraq's northern governorates, blocking the shipment of food,
medicine, and other goods from government-controlled territory to
the Kurdish-controlled areas.  The Government announced the
lifting of the internal embargo on September 12, but anecdotal
and other reports indicate that the regime still exercises tight
control over the flow of goods and services into and out of
northern areas.
<P>
The Government persisted in its flagrant interference with the
international community's provision of humanitarian assistance,
in contravention of the conditions of UNSC Resolution 688.  It
harassed and intimidated relief workers as well as U.N. security
personnel throughout the country.  The Government renewed a
threat to arrest or kill relief workers, whether foreign or
Iraqi, simply for association with a foreign relief organization.

The Government initially objected to the distribution monitors
required by the terms of Resolution 986, and it remains to be
seen whether the Government will allow those monitors to carry
out their work. 
<P>
In northern Iraq, fighting continued between the two main Iraqi
Kurd groups, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), in which both fighters and
civilians were killed.  KDP cooperation with the Government in
the August 31 attack and PUK cooperation with Iran in August
increased instability and, according to Iraqi and Iranian
opposition reports, the ability of both governments to act
against political opponents in the area.  A cease-fire
established on October 23 ended fighting for the rest of the
year, albeit with a few sporadic clashes.  At the end of the
year, both groups were considering a mutual release of detainees
as one of several confidence-building measures to strengthen the
cease-fire and improve prospects for political reconciliation
between the two groups.  Terrorist actions in northern Iraq and
Turkey by the Turkish terrorist organization, the Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK), also resulted in the death of both fighters
and civilians.  Both Iraqi Kurdish groups and the PKK reportedly
committed serious abuses, including killings, torture, arbitrary
arrest and detention.

<B>Section 1   Respect for the Integrity of the Person,</B>
<P>Including Freedom from:  
<P>
<b>a.   Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing</b>
<P>
The regime has a long record of executing perceived opponents. 
The U.N. Special Rapporteur, the international media, and other
groups all reported an increased number of summary executions in
1996.  In his November report to the U.N. Human Rights
Commission, the Special Rapporteur stated that "the country is
run through extrajudicial measures."  In an April 10 report,
Amnesty International noted that various decrees expanding the
use of the death penalty in 1994 and 1995 have not been
sufficiently clarified to ensure fair and just applicability, a
problem compounded by the lack of an independent judiciary.
<P>
As in previous years, there were numerous credible reports that
the regime executed persons allegedly involved in plotting
against President Hussein, including high-ranking civilian,
military, and tribal leaders, as well as members of his family
and clan.  The regime periodically eliminates large numbers of
detainees; in May, according to unconfirmed reports, the regime
executed as many as 100 detainees.  In June some 400 officers of
various ranks were executed, including some senior Republican
Guard officers.  Allegedly these executions were ordered directly
by Saddam Hussein and supervised by his eldest son, Uday.  Also
in June, Uday reportedly ordered the killing of a former aide,
Muhammad Al-Rawi, for trading stocks on the Baghdad stock market.
<P>
Hussein Kamel and Saddam Kamel, Saddam Hussein's sons-in-law,
were executed by the Government in February, according to
numerous credible sources, when they returned from Jordan after
defecting in August 1995.  Although the Government announced
amnesties for both men, they and over 40 relatives, including
women and children, were killed in what the official Iraqi press
described as the spontaneous administration of tribal justice. 
The Special Rapporteur noted in his November report that "the
killings occurred without any legal process and with total
impunity."  He also cited continued reports of the frequent use
of the death penalty for such offenses as "insulting" the
President or the Ba'ath Party, and the pervasive fear of death
for any act or expression of dissent.
<P>
Government forces reportedly executed more Shi'a inhabitants of
the southern marshes in 1996, but there remains no independent
means to verify these reports (see Section 1.g.).
<P>
Indications persist that the Government has offered "bounties" to
anyone who kills United Nations or other international relief
workers in northern Iraq.  A September 12 amnesty announcement
specifically excluded anyone accused of espionage, a charge the
Government has repeatedly made against foreign relief
organizations working in northern Iraq.
<P>
As in previous years, the regime continued to deny totally the
widespread killings of Kurds in northern Iraq during the "Anfal"
Campaign of 1988 (see Sections 1.b. and 1.g.).  The Special
Rapporteur and Human Rights Watch have concluded that the
Government's policies against the Kurds raise issues of crimes
against humanity and violations of the 1948 Genocide Convention.
<P>
The most obvious extrajudicial killings occurred during and after
the Iraqi army attacked northern Iraq in late August and early
September.  Numerous credible reports, including but not limited
to eyewitness accounts collected by opposition organizations,
confirm that 96 Iraqi army officers and soldiers who had
previously deserted the army and fled to the north were captured
in the town of Qushtapa, 22 kilometers south of Irbil, on August
31.  Local residents were reportedly taken to the town center and
forced to watch while soldiers executed these prisoners.  As
noted by the Special Rapporteur and media reports, a KDP
spokesman acknowledged on September 11 that the Government was
responsible for these executions.  Numerous other individual
executions and extrajudicial killings were reported over the next
few months. For example, on October 16 the body of an Iraqi
dissident, architectural engineer Qutaiba Ghazi Al-Samarra'i, was
discovered in Dohuk.  According to opposition reports,
Al-Samarra'i was an opponent of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship and
was eventually sought out and killed by government intelligence
units .
<P>
There was no further information on the death of the prominent
Shi'a oppositionist Taki Al-Khoei who, along with three others,
was killed in 1994 in a suspicious automobile crash in southern
Iraq.  Strong circumstantial evidence points to the Government's
involvement.
<P>
During the year, political killings and terrorist actions
occurred in northern Iraq.  Intra-Kurdish fighting from August
through October between the PUK and the KDP resulted in the
deaths of several fighters and civilians, and both groups
complained of forced expulsions of one another's supporters from
territory controlled by the other party.  At the end of the year,
both groups were working to confirm the whereabouts of one
another's detainees and missing supporters and to end forced
expulsion and other abuses as part of confidence-building
measures to strengthen the October 23 cease-fire.  Throughout
1996, elements of the PKK, a Turkish Kurd terrorist group,
remained active in northern Iraq and reportedly killed local
residents in an effort to control a territorial base.  The PKK
sometimes attacked civilians, foreign relief workers, and
journalists.
<P>
<B>b.   Disappearance</B>  
<P>
The Special Rapporteur stated in November that he continues to
receive reports on widespread disappearances.  The Government
continued to ignore the more than 15,000 cases conveyed to it in
1994 and 1995 by the U.N. Working Group on Enforcement on
Involuntary Disappearances, as well as other requests from the
Governments of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on the whereabouts of
those missing from the 1990-91 occupation of Kuwait. 
<P>
The United Nations has documented over 16,000 cases of persons
who have disappeared  According to the Special Rapporteur, most
of these cases occurred during the Anfal campaign.  He estimates
that the total number of Kurds who disappeared during Anfal could
reach the tens of thousands.  HRW estimates the total at between
70,000 and 150,000, and Amnesty International (AI) at more than
100,000.
<P>
Disappearances in northern Iraq increased in 1996 as Iraqi and
Iranian intelligence units grew more active.  On September 11, a
KDP spokesman confirmed various reports that Iraqi intelligence
units arrested numerous individuals, including members of the
oppositionist Iraqi National Congress (INC) and Turkomen and
Islamist groups.  According to the Special Rapporteur, the fate
of these individuals remains unknown.  Unconfirmed reports blamed
Iran for the disappearances of several Iranian opposition figures
who resided in the north.
<P>
The Special Rapporteur and several human rights groups continued
to request that the Government provide information about the
arrest in 1991 of the late Grand Ayatollah Abdul Qasim Al-Khoei
and 108 of his associates.  The Ayatollah died while under house
arrest in Al-Najaf.  Others arrested with him have not been
accounted for, and the regime refuses to respond to queries
regarding their status.
<P>
The Government failed to return or account for a large number of
Kuwaiti citizens and other foreign nationals detained during the
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.  Regime officials, including military
leaders known to have been among the last to see the persons who
disappeared during the occupation, have refused to respond to the
hundreds of outstanding inquiries about the missing.  The regime
denies having any knowledge of them and claims that relevant
records were lost in the aftermath of the Gulf War.
<P>
In addition to the tens of thousands of reported disappearances,
human rights groups report that the Government continues to hold
thousands of other Iraqis in incommunicado detention.
<P>
<b>c.   Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
or Punishment</b>
<P>
The security services routinely torture detainees, even though
the Constitution prohibits the practice.  The Special Rapporteur
and AI provided new, detailed accounts of the Government's
systemic use of physical and psychological torture in recent
years.  They noted that government decrees and announcements that
might reduce the use of torture had not been confirmed by
demonstrable evidence.  For example, the Special Rapporteur noted
that an August 5 RCC decree suspending the use of amputation
against army deserters did not apply to those convicted of
various other crimes.  The execution of 96 deserters in northern
Iraq on August 31 (see Section 1.a) calls into question whether
the Government intended any lesser punishments for army
deserters.
<P>
According to former detainees, torture techniques include
brandings, electric shocks administered to the genitals and other
areas, beatings, burnings with hot irons, suspension from ceiling
fans, dripping acid on the skin, rape, breaking of limbs, denial
of food and water, and threats to rape or otherwise harm
relatives.  Tormentors kill many torture victims and mutilate
their bodies before returning them to the victims' families.
<P>
Eyewitnesses reported that the Government carried out second
amputations and brandings on repeat offenders and on those who
sought corrective surgery for earlier disfigurements.  In some of
these cases, the regime executed the offenders as well as the
doctors who either performed corrective surgery or refused to
carry out amputations.  The Special Rapporteur also reported the
execution of a number of doctors who refused to tattoo army
deserters on their foreheads as required by government decree. 
In his November report, the Special Rapporteur reconfirmed his
previous analysis, that the amputations and brandings constituted
"gross violations of human rights."
<P>
Several government officials cited Islamic law (Shari'a) as a
rationale for amputating the right hands of convicted thieves,
but none commented on the punishments imposed on repeat offenders
or the Government's disregard for rights protected under Islamic
law.  One senior official claimed that brandings were instituted
in order to avoid confusing criminals with war veterans who had
lost limbs in battle.
<P>
The Special Rapporteur, human rights organizations, and
opposition groups continue to receive numerous reports of women
still suffering severe psychological trauma after they were raped
while in custody.  The security forces allegedly raped women
captured during the Anfal Campaign and during the occupation of
Kuwait.  The Government has never acknowledged these reports of
rape or conducted any investigation.  Although the regime made a
variety of pronouncements against rape and other violent crimes
during the year, it took no action against regime activists who
committed these abuses.
<P>
Prison conditions are poor.  Certain prisons are notorious for
routine mistreatment of prisoners.  Al-Rashidiya Prison, on the
Tigris River north of Taji, reportedly has torture chambers.  The
Al-Shamma'iya Prison, located in east Baghdad, holds the mentally
ill and is reportedly the site of both torture and
disappearances.
<P>
The Al-Radwaniyah Prison is a former prisoner-of-war facility
near Baghdad and reportedly the site of torture as well as mass
executions.  This prison was the principal detention center for
persons arrested following the civil uprisings of 1991.  HRW and
others have estimated that the Al-Radwaniyah Prison holds more
than 5,000 detainees.
<P>
There were continued reports that Iraqi Kurdish groups tortured
captured criminal suspects and political opponents.  A wide
variety of observers documented KDP abuses against the al-Sourchi
tribe and others for alleged cooperation with the PUK and others.
Some observers charged that the KDP was reportedly responsible
for the death of a respected leader of the tribe, Hussein
al-Sourchi, as well as for detaining tens of suspected KDP
opponents and for property damage.  The KDP claimed that Hussein
al-Sourci's death was an accidental result of a preemptive strike
against KDP opponents, and the KDP denied what it termed
exaggerated reports of damage and of detainees.  Numerous other
reports of KDP and PUK abuses against perceived opponents also
circulated during the year, especially in the aftermath of
Iranian support for PUK military moves in August and of Saddam
Hussein's August 31 attack on Irbil (see Section 1.g.).  The PKK
also reportedly tortured civilians captured in northern Iraq in
the latter half of the year.  The UNHCR and other observers noted
that PKK influence at the Atrush refugee camp had grown to such a
point that at year's end the UNHCR decided to close the camp,
with its inhabitants offered the options of voluntary
repatriation to Turkey or relocation elsewhere in northern Iraq.
<P>
<b>d.   Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile  </b>
<P>
Although the Constitution and Legal Code explicitly prohibit
arbitrary arrest and detention, the authorities routinely engage
in these practices.  In his November report, the Special
Rapporteur stated that arbitrary arrests are still common
throughout the country and often lead to detention for long
periods of time without access to a lawyer or being charged.  The
military and security services, rather than the ordinary police,
carry out most cases of arbitrary arrest and detention. 
Government officials have linked ending these practices to the
lifting of the international embargo.  They maintain that the
arrests are a temporary preventive measure and do not constitute
human rights violations.
<P>
It has also been reported that there is a widespread practice of
holding family members and close associates responsible for the
alleged actions of others.  In the aftermath of several security
incidents, security forces reportedly arrested hundreds of
persons perceived as security threats, mainly on the basis of an
individual's personal association or family connection with
opponents of the regime.  Many of those arrested were reportedly
killed while in custody (see Section 1.a.).  The Special
Rapporteur also notes that  "guilt by association" is facilitated
by administrative requirements on relatives of deserters or other
perceived opponents of the regime.  Relatives who do not report
deserters, for example, could lose their ration cards for
purchasing government-controlled food supplies or be evicted from
their residences. 
<P>
According to international human rights groups, numerous
foreigners arrested arbitrarily in previous years remain in
detention.
<P>
According to the Special Rapporteur's report, Iraqi military and
security authorities arbitrarily arrested hundreds of people
during and after the Government's military operations against the
northern city of Irbil in late August and early September.  Among
those arrested were several prominent local politicians,
intellectuals, lawyers, journalists, and university lecturers. 
Reportedly 1,500 persons were arrested in Irbil alone, including
women and children.  In addition, 150 members of an opposition
group and persons suspected of involvement with opposition groups
were reportedly detained by government security personnel.  Their
fate remains unknown.
<P>
Opposition groups provide many detailed but unconfirmed reports
of arbitrary arrest in other areas of the country.  In April, for
example, the regime reportedly launched a random arrest campaign
in the Al-Basrah governorate.  Troops reportedly raided a number
of homes in the Al-Zubayr district and arrested about 30 citizens
under the pretext that the detained persons had connections with
Kuwaiti citizens who own farms near the Iraqi border.  In the Abu
Al-Khasib district, six citizens reportedly were arrested on the
same charge.
<P>
The Government reportedly continued to target Shi'a Muslim clergy
and their supporters for arbitrary arrest and other abuses.  The
Government also reportedly continued to forcibly move various
Shi'a populations from the south to the north and other minority
groups such as Assyrians and Turkomen from the north to
government-controlled territory. 
<P>
There was no substantive evidence that the Government was
implementing two "amnesty" decrees issued in 1995.  AI stated on
April 10 that it "remains concerned that Iraqi authorities may be
attempting to bring deserters and government opponents out of
hiding in order to penalize them."  The Special Rapporteur
reported in November that his similar analysis in 1995 remained
accurate.
<P>
Although the figure is unknown, there are possibly thousands of
political detainees.
<P>
The Government apparently does not practice forced exile.
<P>
<b>e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial</b>
<P>
The judiciary is not independent, and there is no check on the
President's power to override any court decision.  The Special
Rapporteur and international human rights groups all observed
during the year that the repressive nature of the political and
legal systems precludes any concept of rule of law.
<P>
There are two parallel judicial systems:  the regular courts,
which try common criminal offenses; and special security courts,
which generally try national security cases, but may also try
criminal cases.  There is a Court of Appeal.  The Court of
Cassation is the highest court.
<P>
Procedures in the regular courts theoretically provide for many
protections.  However, the regime often assigns to the security
courts cases which, on their merits, would appear to fall under
the jurisdiction of the regular courts.  Trials in the regular
courts are public, and defendants are entitled to counsel, at
government expense in the case of indigents.  Defense lawyers
have the right to review the charges and evidence brought against
their clients.  There is no jury system; panels of three judges
try cases.  Defendants have the right to appeal to the Court of
Appeal and then to the Court of Cassation. 
The Special Rapporteur noted in his November report that numerous
laws lend themselves to continued oppression.  He reported in
detail on extrajudicial methods used by the Government in
previous years to extract confessions or coerce cooperation with
repressive actions by the Government's security forces. 
<P>
The Government shields certain groups from prosecution for
alleged crimes.  A 1992 decree grants immunity from prosecution
to members of the Ba'ath Party and the security forces who kill
anyone while in pursuit of army deserters.  Unconfirmed but
widespread reports indicate that this decree was applied in 1996
to prevent trials or punishment of such government officials as
Uday Saddam Hussein, the President's son.  A 1990 decree grants
immunity to men who kill their mothers, daughters, and other
female family members who have committed "immoral deeds," e.g.,
adultery, fornication, etc.
<P>
Special security courts have jurisdiction in all cases involving
espionage and treason, peaceful political dissent, smuggling,
currency exchange violations, and drug trafficking.  According to
the Special Rapporteur and other sources, military officers or
civil servants with no legal training head these tribunals, which
hear cases in secret.  Authorities often hold defendants
incommunicado and do not permit contact with lawyers.  The courts
admit confessions extracted by torture, which often serve as the
basis for conviction.
<P>
Many cases appear to end in summary execution, although
defendants may appeal to the President for clemency.   Saddam
Hussein may grant clemency in any case that apparently suits his
political goals.
<P>
There are no Shari'a, or Islamic law, courts as such.  Regular
courts are empowered to administer Islamic law in cases involving
personal status, such as divorce and inheritance.
<P>
Because the Government rarely acknowledges arrests or
imprisonments, it is difficult to estimate the number of
political prisoners.  Many of the tens of thousands of persons
who have disappeared or been killed in recent years were
originally held as political prisoners.
<P>
<b>f.   Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or 
Correspondence</b>  
<P>
The Government frequently disregards the constitutional right to
privacy, particularly in cases allegedly involving national
security.  The law defines security offenses so broadly that
authorities are virtually exempt from the legal requirement to
obtain search warrants.  In 1996 the authorities subjected
citizens of various ethnic groups and tribal affiliations to
searches without warrants (see Section 1.g.).  The regime
routinely ignores the constitutional provisions safeguarding the
confidentiality of mail, telegraphic correspondence, and
telephone conversations.  The Government periodically jams news
broadcasts, including those of opposition groups, from outside
Iraq.
<P>
The security services and the Ba'ath Party maintain pervasive
networks of informers to deter dissident activity and instill
fear in the public.  For example, the Special Rapporteur reported
in November that an operator was arrested and executed in 1993
for having warned a person not to use a bugged telephone line. 
The authorities also hold family members and close associates
responsible for the alleged actions of others (see Section 1.d.).
<P>
<B>g.  Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian    
Law in Internal Conflicts</B>
<P>
As in previous years, the armed forces conducted deliberate
artillery attacks against Shi'a civilians in the southern marshes
and against minority groups in northern Iraq.  In 1992 the Gulf
War allies imposed "no-fly zones" over both northern and southern
Iraq.  The no-fly zones continue to deter aerial attacks on the
marsh dwellers in southern Iraq and residents of northern Iraq,
but they do not prevent artillery attacks in either area, nor the
military's large-scale burning operations in the south.
<P>
Credible reports confirm the ongoing destruction of the marshes. 
The army continued to construct canals, causeways, and earthen
berms to divert water from the wetlands.  Hundreds of square
kilometers have been burned in military operations.  Moreover,
the regime's diversion of supplies in the south limited the
population's access to food, medicine, drinking water, and
transportation.
<P>
During 1996 the Government regularly reported on several
water-diversion and other projects in the south, which continued
the process of large-scale environmental destruction.  The
Government claims the drainage is part of a land reclamation plan
to increase the acreage of arable land, spur agricultural
production, and reduce salt pollution in the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers.  However, the evidence of large-scale human and
ecological destruction appears to belie this claim.
<P>
The Government maintained an internal embargo against the three
governorates in northern Iraq for most of the year.  These
governorates are populated primarily by Kurds, Assyrians,
Turkoman, and other ethnic minorities.  The embargo prevented the
entry of food, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies to that
area.  Beginning in 1993, the embargo also included electrical
power cut-offs in specific areas, causing the disruption of water
and sanitation systems and interfering with the delivery of food
and fuel.  The United Nations and donor governments installed
temporary generators to alleviate the crisis.  The Government
announced that the embargo was lifted in mid-September, but
anecdotal and other reports indicate that some areas are still
subject to more restrictive movements of goods and people than
other parts of the country.  The entire northern area remains
subject to the threat of future cut-offs.
<P>
Operation Provide Comfort--a multinational coalition made up of
the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Turkey--continued
enforcement of a "no-fly zone" to inhibit government aerial
activity to repress citizens in northern Iraq.  However,
government military forces continued intermittent, sometimes
heavy shelling of northern villages by long-range artillery
throughout the year, especially of areas controlled by the PUK. 
Iranian forces reportedly shelled military positions and civilian
sites within KDP-controlled areas in August.  The Government also
continued to "Arabize" certain areas, such as the urban centers
of Kirkuk and Mosul, through the forced movement of local
residents from their homes and villages and their replacement by
Arabs from outside the area (see Section 1.d.).
<P>
On August 31, government troops, tanks, artillery, and
helicopters first shelled and then captured the city of Irbil in
northern Iraq.  Several other cities and villages in northern
Iraq were shelled by artillery and then were entered by
government troops.  The Special Rapporteur stated in November
that indiscriminate shelling by Iraqi forces of civilian
settlements had been a recurrent practice well before these most
recent clashes.  He and numerous other observers confirmed that
the Government's use of military forces against civilian targets
is a clear violation of Security Council Resolution 688, which
demands that the Government cease oppression of its civilian
population.
<P>
According to the Special Rapporteur, there were at least 100
casualties following the drive by troops into Irbil, as well as
many other casualties of a simultaneous push by the KDP.  In
addition, security forces reportedly executed several members of
the INC, PUK, and other opposition groups in the streets
following house-to-house searches.
<P>
It has also been reported that the troops that entered the
villages upon the first attacks burned and destroyed houses after
having looted valuable property.  Major buildings, including
hospitals, as well as water and sanitation systems, were
reportedly looted, damaged, and in some cases destroyed.  The
armed conflict in Irbil also resulted in the cutting of
electricity and water supplies by both Kurdish groups, which were
restored fully a few weeks after a cease-fire was put in place on
October 23.
<P>
The KDP was accused of several extrajudicial killings and
indiscriminate attacks in September, including a confirmed attack
on September 10 on a camp near the Iranian border that held
refugees from PUK-controlled areas.  The KDP also detained PUK
members and perceived supporters throughout this peroid,
including PUK politburo member Fuad Massoum and 11 other PUK
supporters who were released on September 25.  The PUK was
accused of similar indiscriminate attacks and detainees in August
and October, which the KDP said were supported by Iranian forces.

The vast majority of these reports could not be confirmed due to
the absence of impartial observers and the general lack of
security, but individual cases that were confirmed indicate that
the abuses likely took place on both sides while fighting
continued.
<P>
During this period, the KDP and PUK took steps to protect foreign
workers engaged in humanitarian relief work.  However, there were
several reports that Kurdish relief workers were abused during
the second half of the year.
<P>
The PKK committed numerous abuses against civilians in northern
Iraq throughout the year.  It also stepped up violence against
UNHCR officials working in the Atrush refugee camp late in the
year.
<P>
On several occasions in 1996, Turkish armed forces entered
northern Iraq in pursuit of PKK terrorists and bases.  Human
rights organizations and political organizations charged that
these operations resulted in some civilian deaths and destruction
of residences.  Turkish government authorities stressed that the
operation sought to avoid civilian casualties. 
<P>
Land mines in northern Iraq, mostly planted by the Government
before 1991, continue to kill and maim civilians.  Many of the
mines were laid during the Iran-Iraq War, but the army failed to
clear them before it abandoned the area.  The mines appear to
have been haphazardly planted in civilian areas.  The Special
Rapporteur has repeatedly reminded the Government of its
obligations under the Land Mines Protocol to protect civilians
from the effects of mines.  Various nongovernmental organizations
continue efforts to remove mines from the area and increase mine
awareness among local residents.
<P>
Reports from victims and eyewitnesses show that the Iraqi regime
engaged in war crimes--willful killing, torture, rape, pillage,
hostage-taking, and associated acts--directly related to the Gulf
War.  Many governments continue to urge the U.N. Security Council
to establish an international commission to study evidence of a
broader range of war crimes, as well as crimes against humanity
and possible genocide.  HRW continues to work with various
governments to bring a genocide case at the International Court
of Justice against the Government for its conduct of the Anfal
campaign against the Kurds in 1988.  U.S. Government policy is to
support these efforts to hold Saddam Hussein's regime accountable
for its war crimes and crimes against humanity.

<P>
<B>Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties,</B> 
<P>
Including:  
<P>
<B>a.   Freedom of Speech and Press</B>  
<P>
Freedom of speech and of the press do not exist, and political
dissent is not tolerated in areas under the Government's control.

The Special Rapporteur reports that "the possibility for citizens
to freely express their opinions is seriously undermined if not
totally meaningless."
<P>
The Government and the Ba'ath Party own all print and broadcast
media and operate them as propaganda outlets.  They generally do
not report opposing points of view that are expressed either
domestically or abroad.  According to the Special Rapporteur,
journalists are under regular pressure to join the Ba'ath party. 
The Special Rapporteur and other observers have described how
journalists are under instruction to mention Saddam Hussein
positively in any article, regardless of the subject.  The same
sources have detailed how journalists may fall under suspicion
for not writing about Saddam Hussein every few months.  Negative
articles can carry extreme consequences:  one journalist was
reportedly executed extrajudicially for criticizing an article
written by Saddam Hussein under a pseudonym, while another was
sentenced to life imprisonment for telling a joke about the
President.
<P>
The Special Rapporteur also reported that the Ministry of Culture
and Information periodically holds meetings at which orientation
and general guidelines for the press are provided.  Furthermore,
books can be published only with the authorization of the
Ministry of Culture and Information.  The President's son, Uday
Hussein, also reportedly exercises control over journalists.  He
sometimes uses a newspaper under his personal control, Babel, to
threaten members of a particular tribe or clan believed to be
insufficiently supportive of the regime.  In a more direct
example of control, the Special Rapporteur reported that Uday
Hussein and his cohorts pelted two elderly, well-respected
journalists with tomatoes at a conference as punishment for not
being sufficiently supportive of the regime.  The Government also
jams foreign news broadcasts (see Section 1.f.).
<P>
Several statutes and decrees suppress freedom of speech and the
press.  These include a 1986 decree stipulating the death penalty
for anyone insulting the President or other high government
officials; Section 214 of the Penal Code, which prohibits singing
a song likely to cause civil strife; and the Press Act of 1968,
which prohibits the writing of articles on 12 specific subjects,
including those detrimental to the President.
<P>
Foreigners are also subject to restrictions on freedom of the
press.  The Government refused to admit a returning Danish member
of the U.N. Guard Contingent in Iraq, which protects
international humanitarian workers throughout the country, for
carrying a foreign newspaper with unfavorable coverage of Saddam
Hussein.
<P>
In northern Iraq, several newspapers have appeared over the past
5 years, as have opposition radio and television broadcasts.  The
absence of central authority permits some freedom of expression,
although most journalists are influenced or controlled by various
political organizations.
<P>
The Government has no respect for academic freedom, exercising
strict control over academic publications.  University staff is
hired or fired depending on their support for the Government.
<P>
<B>b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association</B>  
<P>
Citizens may not peacefully assemble or organize for any
political purpose other than to express support for the regime. 
The Government regularly orchestrates crowds to demonstrate
support for the regime and its policies through financial
incentives for those who participate and threats of violence
against those who do not.
<P>
Unconfirmed reports continued to circulate of small
demonstrations and even confrontations between farm workers and
the security forces.  The Special Rapporteur and other observers
expressed doubts that the Government would allow such reports to
be confirmed by monitors, whose mandate under Resolution 986
could cover such activities insofar as they are related to the
distribution of relief. 
<P>
The Government controls the establishment of political parties,
regulates their internal affairs, and monitors their activities. 
Several parties are specifically outlawed, and membership in them
is a capital offense.  A 1974 law prescribes the death penalty
for anyone "infiltrating" the Ba'ath Party.
<P>
<B>c.   Freedom of Religion</B>
<P>
The Government severely limits freedom of religion.  The
Provisional Constitution of 1968 states that "Islam is the
religion of the State."  The Ministry of Endowments and Religious
Affairs monitors places of worship, appoints the clergy, and
approves the publication of religious literature.
<P>
Although Shi'a Muslim Arabs, who compose between 60 and 65
percent of the population, are the largest religious group, Sunni
Arabs (composing only about 12 to 15 percent of the population)
have traditionally dominated economic and political life. 
Despite legal guarantees of sectarian equality, the regime has in
recent years repressed the Shi'a clergy and followers of the
Shi'a faith.  Security forces have desecrated Shi'a mosques and
holy sites, particularly in the aftermath of the 1991 civil
uprisings.
<P>
The security forces reportedly were still encamped in the shrine
to Imam Ali at Al-Najaf, one of Shi'a Islam's holiest sites,
using it as an interrogation center.  The former Shi'a
theological school in Al-Najaf, which the Government closed
following the 1991 uprising, continues to be used as a public
market.  Security forces continued to expel foreign Muslim
clerics from Al-Najaf, under the pretext that the clerics' visas
had expired.
<P>
The following government restrictions on religious rights
remained in effect throughout 1996:  a ban on the Muslim call to
prayer in certain cities; a ban on the broadcast of Shi'a
programs on government radio or television; a ban on the
publication of Shi'a books, including prayer books; a ban on
funeral processions; and the prohibition of certain processions
and public meetings commemorating Shi'a holy days.  Moreover, the
Government also continued to insist that its own appointee
replace the late Grand Ayatollah Abul Qasim Al-Khoei, formerly
the highest ranking Iraqi Shi'a clergyman, who died in government
custody in 1992 (see Section 1.b.).  The Shi'a religious
establishment refuses to accept the Government's choice.  The
Government also continued to harass and threaten members of the
late Ayatollah Al-Khoei's family (see Section 1.a. and 1.b.).
<P>
The Special Rapporteur and others report that the Government has
engaged in various abuses against the country's 350,000 Assyrian
Christians.  Most Assyrians traditionally live in the northern
governorates, and the Government often has suspected them of
"collaborating" with Kurds.  Military forces destroyed numerous
Assyrian churches during the Anfal Campaign and reportedly
tortured and executed many Assyrians (see Section 4).  According
to HRW and Assyrian sources, the Government continues to harass
and kill Assyrians throughout the country by forced relocations,
terror, and artillery shelling.
<P>
<B>d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, 
Emigration, and Repatriation</B>  
<P>
The Government controls the movement within the country of
citizens and foreigners.  Persons who enter sensitive border
areas and numerous designated security zones are subject to
arrest (see Section 1.d.).  Police checkpoints are common on
major roads and highways.  High-ranking officials and other key
supporters of the regime were exempt from these restrictions, but
some reports indicate that the Government removed most of these
exceptions and tightened internal and border travel controls at
times of relative instability, such as reported internal
disturbances in May and July.
<P>
The Government requires citizens to obtain expensive exit visas
for foreign travel.  Citizens may not make more than two trips
abroad annually.  Exit from the country requires possession of
specific government authorization, and the Government reportedly
prohibits some citizens from all international travel.  Before
traveling abroad, citizens are required to post collateral with
the Government which is refundable only upon their return.  There
are restrictions on the amount of currency that may be taken out
of the country.  Women are not permitted to travel outside Iraq
alone; male relatives must escort them.
<P>
The Government prohibits the granting of approval for foreign
travel to journalists, authors, and all the employees of the
Information Ministry.  Security authorities interrogate all media
employees, journalists, and writers who have traveled outside
Iraq about the reasons for their travel and who they met during
their trips.  
<P>
Some citizens without personal documents have turned themselves
over to Jordanian border posts to avoid paying the departure tax
levied on citizens who wish to travel abroad.  Most citizens are
unable to pay this tax.  In addition, the Jordanian Government
has asked the Iraqi regime to prevent Iraqi border guards from
shooting at Iraqi soldiers who try to flee to Jordan.  Iraqi
border guards fire at fleeing soldiers even after they cross into
Jordanian territory.
<P>
Students abroad who refuse to return to Iraq are required to
reimburse any of their expenses that were paid by the Government.

Each student wishing to travel abroad must provide a guarantor. 
The guarantor and the student's parents may be liable if the
student fails to return.
<P>
Foreign spouses of citizens who have resided in Iraq for 5 years
are required to apply for nationality.  The requirement is 1 year
of residence for the spouses of citizens employed in government
offices.  Many foreigners thus have been obliged to accept
citizenship and are subject to official travel restrictions.  The
penalties for noncompliance include, but are not limited to, loss
of the spouse's job, a substantial financial penalty, and
repayment for any governmental educational expenses.
<P>
The Government prevents many citizens who also hold citizenship
in another country--especially the children of Iraqi fathers and
foreign-born mothers--from visiting the country of their other
nationality.
<P>
The Government does not provide first asylum or respect the
rights of refugees.  In northern Iraq, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) worked with the KDP and the PUK
on the return of Iraqis who fled into Iran during the September
clashes, and along with the Government of Turkey, on the
disposition of the Atrush camp.
<P>
The Government continued to pursue its discriminatory
resettlement policies, including demolition of villages and
forced relocation of Kurds, Turkomen, Assyrians, and other
minorities.  Human rights monitors reported that the Government
continues to force Kurdish and Turkomen residents of Mosul and
Kirkuk to move to other areas in the north or the south.
<P>
Tens of thousands of refugees fled to Iran from northern Iraq
after the Iraqi attack on Irbil and other attacks in early
September.  Hundreds of thousands of others temporarily fled
their residences in these areas, although they did not leave Iraq
itself.  By December, most of these refugees and displaced
persons had returned to their residences.
<P>
According to the Special Rapporteur, security forces continue to
relocate Shi'a inhabitants of the southern marshes to major
southern cities.  Many have been transferred to detention centers
and prisons in central Iraq, primarily in Baghdad, or even to
northern cities like Kirkuk, as part of the Government's attempt
to "Arabize" traditionally non-Arab areas.
<P>
According to the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR),
hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees remain abroad--mainly in
Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria, Turkey, Pakistan, and Jordan. 
Apart from those suspected of sympathizing with Iran, most fled
after the Government's suppression of the civil uprising of 1991;
others are Kurds who fled the Anfal Campaign of 1988.
<P>
Of the 1.5 million refugees who fled following the 1991
uprisings, the great majority, particularly Kurds, have
repatriated themselves to northern Iraq, in areas where the
allied coalition has prohibited overflights by Iraqi aircraft. 
Several hundred thousand Kurds remain unsettled in northern Iraq
because political circumstances do not permit them to return to
their former homes in government-controlled territory.
<P>
Both the KDP and the PUK fulfilled security guarantees and
provided assistance in evacuating more than 6,000 relief workers
and Iraqi oppositionists perceived to be affiliated with the
United States.
<P>
Approximately 14,000 Turkish Kurds remain in the north who have
fled civil strife in southeastern Turkey.  The UNHCR is treating
these displaced persons as refugees until it reaches an official
determination on their status.  In late 1996, the UNHCR and the
Government of Turkey began implementing a plan to close the
Atrush refugee camp and conduct voluntary repatriation of the
refugees to Turkey.

<A HREF="#index">Return to Index</A></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Section 3 Respect for Political Rights:</B> <P>
<B>The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government</B>
<P>
Citizens do not have the right to change their government. 
Although the Government has taken steps to provide an increased
appearance of democracy, the political process is still
controlled by the State.  There are strict qualifications for
candidates; candidates to the National Assembly, by law, must be
over 25 years old and "believe in God, the principles of the July
17-30 revolution, and Socialism."  In the 250-seat National
Assembly 160 deputies reportedly belong to the Ba'ath Party and
60 are independent, Saddam Hussein appointed 30 deputies to
represent the northern governorates.  According to the Special
Rapporteur, the Ba'ath Party allegedly instructed a number of its
members to run as nominally "independent" candidates.
<P>
Full political participation at the national level is confined to
members of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, estimated at about 8
percent of the population.  The political system is dominated by
the Party, which governs through the Revolutionary Command
Council, headed by President Saddam Hussein.  However, the RCC
exercises both executive and legislative authority.  It
overshadows the National Assembly, which is completely
subordinate to it and the executive branch.
<P>
The President wields decisive power over all instruments of
government.  Almost all powerful officials are either members of
his family or are family allies from his hometown of Tikrit.
<P>
Opposition political organizations are illegal and severely
suppressed.  Membership in certain political parties is
punishable by death (see Section 2.b.).  In 1991 the RCC adopted
a law that theoretically authorized the creation of political
parties other than the Ba'ath; in practice the law is used to
prohibit parties that do not support Saddam Hussein and the
current Government.  New parties must be based in Baghdad and are
prohibited from having any ethnic or religious character.
<P>
The Government does not recognize the various political groupings
and parties that have been formed by Shi'a Muslims, as well as
Kurdish, Assyrian, Turkomen, and other Iraqi communities.  These
political groups continued to attract support notwithstanding
their illegal status.
<P>
Women and minorities are underrepresented in government and
politics.  The law provides for the election of women and
minorities to the National Assembly, but they have only token
representation. 
<P>
In northern Iraq, all central government functions have been
performed by local administrators, mainly Kurds, since the
Government withdrew its military forces and civilian
administrative personnel from the area after the 1991 uprising. 
A regional parliament and local government administrators were
elected in 1992.  These were the only free and open elections
held in Iraq in recent decades, and those only for local
officials and institutions.  This parliament last met in May
1995.  Discussions among Kurdish and other northern Iraqi
political groups continue on the reconvening of parliament, but
the tensions and maneuverings by both the PUK and KDP continue to
prevent parliamentary activity.
<P>
<HR>
<CENTER><B><A NAME="4">HUMAN RIGHTS INVESTIGATION</A></B><BR>
<A HREF="#index">Return to Index</A></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human
Rights</B>
<P>
The Government does not permit the establishment of independent
human rights organizations.  It operates an official human rights
group that routinely denies allegations of abuses.  Citizens have
established several human rights groups abroad and in northern
areas not under government control.
<P>
As in 1995, the Government did not allow the U.N. Special
Rapporteur to visit Iraq, nor did it respond to his requests for
information on several cases.  The Government continued to defy
various calls from U.N. bodies to allow the Special Rapporteur to
visit the southern marshes and other regions.
<P>
In 1996 the U.N. Human Rights Committee and the U.N.
Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
Minorities adopted resolutions condemning the Government's human
rights violations.  For the fourth consecutive year, the UNHRC
passed a resolution calling on the U.N. Secretary General to send
human rights monitors to "help in the independent verification of
reports on the human rights situation in Iraq."  The U.N.
Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
Minorities adopted a resolution reiterating the UNHRC request for
the deployment of monitors.  The Government has continued to defy
these calls for the entry of monitors.
<P>
The Special Rapporteur nonetheless was able to gather more
evidence, in part due to interviews with current and past
government officials who shed new light on the systemic nature of
human rights violations.  The Special Rapporteur dispatched
members of his staff to Jordan and other locations to interview
victims of Iraqi human rights abuses.  The Special Rapporteur
repeatedly has asserted the need for further resources to carry
out his mandate, while recalling that appropriate action on major
issues like the Anfal Campaign are beyond the scope of his
potential resources (see Section 1.g.).
<P>
The Government continues to fail to accept U.N. Security Council
Resolution 688, which insists that the Government afford
immediate, unrestricted access by humanitarian workers to all
those in need of assistance in all parts of Iraq.  Throughout
1995 the Government threatened, harassed, and assaulted employees
of the U.N. and nongovernmental organizations working in Iraq
(see Sections 1.g. and 2.a.).
<P>
<HR>
<CENTER><B><A NAME="5">DISCRIMINATION</A></B><BR><A
HREF="#index">Return to Index</A></CENTER>
<p>
<B>Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
Disability, Language, or Social Status</B>
<P>
The Constitution and legal system provide for some rights for
women, chldren, and minorities.  However, in practice, the
Government systematically abuses these rights.
<P>
<B>Women</B>
<P>
Domestic violence against women occurs, but little is known about
its extent.  Such abuse is customarily addressed within the
tightly knit family structure.  There is no public discussion of
the subject, and the Government issues no statistics.  Spousal
violence constitutes grounds for divorce and criminal charges,
but suits brought on these charges are believed to be rare.  Men
who kill female family members for "immoral deeds" may receive
immunity from prosecution under a 1990 law (see Section 1.c.).
<P>
The Special Rapporteur has noted that there is an unusually high
percentage of women in the Kurdish areas, purportedly caused by
the disappearances of tens of thousands of Kurdish men during the
Anfal Campaign.  The Special Rapporteur has reported that the
widows, daughters, and mothers of the Anfal Campaign victims are
economically dependent on their relatives or villages because
they may not inherit the property or assets of their missing
family members.  Other reports suggest that economic destitution
has forced many women into prostitution.
<P>
Evidence concerning the Anfal Campaign indicates that the
Government killed many women and children, including infants, by
firing squads and in chemical attacks.  Government forces also
raped many women during the Anfal campaign as well as during the
occupation of Kuwait.  Reports indicate that women are raped in
custody, but the Government takes no action against the abusers
(see Section 1.c.).
<P>
The Government claims that it is committed to equality for women,
who make up about 20 percent of the work force.  It has enacted
laws to protect women from exploitation in the workplace and from
sexual harassment; to permit women to join the regular army,
Popular Army, and police forces; to require education for girls;
and to equalize women's rights in divorce, land ownership,
taxation, suffrage, and election to the National Assembly.  It is
difficult to determine to what extent these protections are
afforded in practice.  Reports indicate, however, that the
application of these laws has declined as Iraq's political and
economic crisis persists.  Women are not allowed to travel
outside Iraq alone (see Section 2.d.).
<P>
<B>Children</B>
<P>
No information is available on whether the Government has enacted
specific legislation to promote the welfare of children. 
However, the Special Rapporteur and several human rights groups
have collected a substantial body of evidence pointing to the
Government's continuing disregard for the rights and welfare of
children.
<P>
The Government's failure to comply with relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions has led to a continuation of economic
sanctions.  As a result, general economic and health conditions
have deteriorated dramatically.  Children have been particularly
susceptible to the decline in the standard of living.  Increases
in child mortality and disease rates have been reported.
<P>
There were continued accounts of aggressive government action
against youths.  In February security forces launched an arrest
campaign against youths who frequented the Al-Tali'ah Youth
Center in Baghdad, after the discovery of leaflets denouncing the
ruling regime.  In another report, three Jordanian youths, who
were on their way to Baghdad aboard a truck laden with sugar,
were killed by a gang led by an army midlevel officer.  The gang
reportedly killed the young men, hacked their bodies into pieces,
and scattered them in the desert.
<P>
In late July, opposition sources reported that more than 300
children had died while undergoing compulsory training in
Fedayeen camps.  The Fedayeen system was widely reported by
opposition and other sources as another systematic regime effort
to extend and solidify its control through forced indoctrination
of Iraqi youth.
<P>
<B>People with Disabilities</B>
<P>
No information is available on the Government's policy towards
people with disabilities.
<P>
<B>National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities</B>
<P>
Kurds, who make up approximately 20 percent of the population,
historically have suffered political and economic discrimination,
despite the token presence of a small number of Kurds in the
national Government (see Sections 1.a., 1.b., and 1.g.).
<P>
Assyrians and Chaldeans are ethnic groups as well as separate 
Christian communities (see Section 2.c.).  Assyrians speak a
distinct language--Syriac.  Public instruction in Syriac, which
was to have been allowed under a 1972 decree, has never been
implemented.  Numerous reports indicated continued systematic
discrimination against Assyrians throughout 1996, especially in
terms of forced movements from northern areas and repression of
political rights there.
<P>
Citizens considered to be of Iranian origin must carry special
identification and are often precluded from desirable employment.

Over the years, the Government has deported hundreds of thousands
of citizens of Iranian origin (see Section 2.d.).
<P>
<B>Religious Minorities</B>
<P>
Iraq's cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity are not
reflected in the country's political and economic structure. 
Various segments of the Sunni Arab community, which itself
constitutes a small minority of the population, have effectively
controlled the Government since independence in 1932.  Shi'a
Arabs, the overwhelming majority of the population, have long
been economically, politically, and socially disadvantaged.  Like
the Sunni Kurds and other ethnic and religious groups in the
north, the Shi'a Arabs of the south have been targeted for
particular discrimination and abuse, ostensibly because of their
opposition to the Government.

<P>
<B>Section 6 Worker Rights</B>
<P>
<B>a. The Right of Association</B>
<P>
Although Iraq is a party to the 1919 Constitution of the
International Labor Organization (ILO), which provides for the
freedom of association, trade unions independent of government
control do not exist.  The Trade Union Organization Law of 1987
established the Iraqi General Federation of Trade Unions, a
government-dominated trade union structure, as the sole legal
trade federation.  The General Federation is linked to the Ba'ath
Party, which uses it to promote party principles and policies
among union members.
<P>
Workers in private and mixed enterprises--but not public
employees or workers in state enterprises--have the right to join
local union committees.  The committees are affiliated with
individual trade unions, which in turn belong to the General
Federation.
<P>
The Labor Law of 1987 restricts the right to strike.  No strike
has been reported over the past two decades.  According to the
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the severe
restrictions on the right to strike include penal sanctions.
<P>
The General Federation is also affiliated with the International
Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the formerly
Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
<P>
<b>b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively</b>
<P>The right to bargain collectively is not recognized.  Salaries
for public sector workers (the majority of the employed) are set
by the Government.  Wages in the much smaller private sector are
set by employers or negotiated individually with workers.
<P>
The Labor Code does not protect workers from antiunion
discrimination, a failure that has been criticized repeatedly by
the ILO's Committee of Experts.
<P>
There are no export processing zones.
<P>
<B>c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</B> 
<P>
Compulsory labor is theoretically prohibited by law.  However,
the Penal Code mandates prison sentences, including compulsory
labor, for civil servants and employees of state enterprises
accused of breaches of labor "discipline," including resigning
from a job.  According to the ILO, foreign workers in Iraq have
been prevented from terminating their employment to return to
their native countries because of government-imposed penal
sanctions on persons who do so.
<P>
<B>d.   Minimum Age for Employment of Children  </B>
<P>
The employment of children under the age of 14 is prohibited
except in small-scale family enterprises.  Children reportedly
are increasingly encouraged to work in order to support their
families, given the country's harsh economic conditions.  The law
stipulates that employees between the ages of 14 and 18 work
fewer hours per week than adults.
<P>
<B>e.   Acceptable Conditions of Work</B>
<P>
Theoretically, most workers in urban areas work a 6-day, 48-hour
workweek.  Hours for government employees are set by the head of
each ministry.  In practice, the rate of absenteeism has likely
increased with the deterioration of socioeconomic conditions. 
There is contradictory information on whether laws and
regulations mandate a minimum wage, but the Government makes no
effort to protect this or other worker entitlements.
<P>
Working hours for agricultural workers vary according to
individual employer-employee agreements.
<P>
Occupational safety programs are in effect in state-run
enterprises.  Inspectors theoretically inspect private
establishments, but enforcement varies widely.

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch is one of the many
nongovernmental organizations -- both in the United States and
around the world -- that have been integral to the protection of
human rights. Human Rights Watch began in 1978 with the founding
of Helsinki Watch, which monitored compliance of European member
states, the United States, and Canada with the human rights
principles agreed to in the Helsinki Accords.
<p>
Today, Human Rights Watch includes five divisions 
covering Africa, the Americas, Asia, and the Middle East, as well
as the signatories to the Helsinki Accords. It also includes five
thematic projects covering arms transfers, children's rights,
free expression, prison conditions, and women's rights. It
maintains offices in New York City, Washington, D.C., Los
Angeles, London, Brussels, Moscow, Dushanbe, Hong Kong, and Rio
de Janeiro.
<p>
The organization issues a Human Rights Watch World Report each
January, presenting a detailed analysis of human rights
developments in more than 70 countries. This report is
supplemented by the Human Rights Watch Update, a quarterly
bulletin that highlights breaking developments since the
publication of the annual report. In addition, Human Rights Watch
puts out some 100 reports every year about specific human rights
issues.
<p>
Human Rights Watch collects the information for these and other
publications through fact-finding missions, meetings with
government officials, and collaborative efforts with other
nongovernmental human rights organizations.
<p>
Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, notes
that the focus of human rights reporting has shifted in the past
decade from the plight of political 
prisoners to the victims of communal violence. To combat these
new abuses, Roth says, the human rights movement must "begin
supplementing its traditional international exposure of violator
governments with stronger calls for economic sanctions."
<p>
Says Roth:  "Much of the communal violence we see today is
attributable not to age-old animosities, as 
common wisdom has it, but to governments that have found it
politically convenient to whip up nationalist 
fervor to firm up their political base." But he makes it clear
that it is not just governments that are the 
violators. Many nongovernmental, organized groups with the power
to enforce their will are violators as well.
<p>
Roth stresses the importance of recruiting the business community
-- "one of the largest untapped tools" -- in 
support of human rights. The human rights community must do more,
he believes, to convince business that regimes that outlaw
repression and engender respect for human rights are good for
business.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>WHAT ARE HUMAN RIGHTS?</H3>
<P>
<I>By Jack Donnelly</I>

<br>
<blockquote>
<i><b><font size=12>H</font size=12></b></i>uman rights are,
literally,
the
rights
that one has simply
because one is human.  This deceptively simple idea has profound
social and political consequences.
<P>
Human rights, because they rest on nothing more than being
human,
are universal, equal, and inalienable.  They are held by all
human
beings, universally.  One either is or is not human and thus has
or does not have human rights, equally.  And one can no more lose
these rights than one can stop being a human being -- no matter
how inhuman the treatment one may suffer.  One is entitled to
human rights and is empowered by them.
<P>
Human rights, being held by every person against the state and
society, provide a framework for political organization and a
standard of political legitimacy.  In a context in which they are
systematically denied, claims of human rights may be positively
revolutionary.  Even in societies where human rights are
generally
well respected, they provide constant pressure on governments to
meet their standards.
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
<b><hr>
<P>
<i>The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior
power
on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority
of man, but to have only the law of nature for his rule. The
liberty of man in society is to be under no other legislative
power but that established by consent in the commonwealth....</I>
<P>
<center>John Locke, British philosopher (1632-1704), from
<i>Concerning
Civil Government</i>, 1690</center>
<hr></b>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></b>
<i><b><font size=10>T</font>he Origins of Human Rights</i></b>
<br>
All societies possess notions of justice, fairness, dignity,
and
respect.  Human rights, however, are but one path to implement a
particular conception of social justice.  In fact, the idea of
human rights -- the notion that all human beings, simply because
they are human, have certain inalienable rights that they may
exercise against society and their rulers -- was foreign to all
major pre-modern Western and non-Western societies.
<p>
Nearly all pre-modern societies saw rulers as obliged to
govern
wisely and for the common good.  This mandate, however, arose
from
divine commandment, natural law, tradition, or contingent
political arrangements.  It did not rest on the rights
(entitlement) of all human beings to be ruled justly.  In a
well-ordered society, the people were to benefit from the
political obligations of rulers.  But the people had no natural
or
human rights that could be exercised against unjust rulers.   
<p>
Human rights entered the mainstream of political theory and
practice in 17th-century Europe.  John Locke's <i>Second Treatise
of
Government</i>, published in 1688 in the wake of Britain's
Glorious
Revolution, which overthrew King James II, presented the first
fully developed theory of natural rights.
<P>
Locke's theory begins with a pre-social state of nature in
which
equal individuals have natural rights to life, liberty, and
estates.  In the absence of government, however, these rights are
of little value.  They are almost impossible to protect by
individual action, and disputes over rights are themselves a
powerful cause of conflict.  Therefore, people form societies,
and
societies establish governments, to enable themselves to enjoy
their natural rights.
<p>
Government, according to Locke, is based on a social contract
between rulers and ruled.  Citizens are obliged to obey only if
the government protects their human rights, which are morally
prior to and above the claims and interests of the government.
Government is legitimate to the extent that it systematically
protects and furthers the enjoyment of the human rights of its
citizens.
<p>
The idea of human rights initially was associated with the
middle
classes.  Against the claims of high birth and traditional
privilege, the rising bourgeoisie of early modern Europe advanced
political claims based on natural human equality and inalienable
natural rights.  This bourgeois political revolution, however,
had
severe limits.  For example, Locke, despite the apparent
universalism of the language of natural rights, actually
developed a theory for the protection of the rights of propertied
European males.  Women, along with "savages," servants, and wage
laborers of either sex, were not recognized as rights-holders.
<p>
But once the notion of equal and inalienable rights held by
all
was advanced, the burden of proof shifted to those who would deny
such rights to others.  Claims of privilege could be rationalized
by, for example, arguments of racial superiority or assertions of
superior acquired virtue.  Privilege could be, and regularly was,
protected through force.  But having accepted the idea of human
rights, dominant elites found it increasingly difficult to escape
the logic of human rights.
<p>
Many of the great political struggles of the past two
centuries
have revolved around expanding the recognized subjects of human
rights.  Efforts to extend the right to vote beyond a small,
propertied elite provoked intense controversy in most European
countries in the 19th century.  The claims of working men for
fair
wages, for the right to organize themselves, and for safe and
humane working conditions led to often violent political conflict
until World War I in most of Europe, and much longer than that in
the United States.  Ending the systematic denial of human rights
inherent in colonialism was a major global political issue during
the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.  And struggles to eliminate
discrimination based on race and gender have been prominent in
many countries over the past 30 years.
<p>
In all of these situations, dispossessed groups used the
rights
they did enjoy to press for legal recognition of the rights being
denied them.  For example, workers used their votes, along with
what freedom of the press and freedom of association were allowed
them, to press for eliminating legal discrimination based on
wealth or property.  They also demanded new rights that would
bring true liberty, equality, and security to working men (and
later women).  Racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, women,
and peoples suffering under colonial rule have likewise used what
rights were allowed them to press for full recognition and
participation as equal members of society.
<p>
In each case, the essence of their argument was that we, no
less
than you, are human beings.  As such, we are entitled to the same
basic rights as you and to equal concern and respect from the
state.  And in each case, acceptance of such arguments has led to
radical social and political changes.
<p>
In the past decade, the revolutionary force of the demand for
human rights has become unusually clear.  Across the globe,
regimes that had cynically manipulated the language of human
rights have been sent packing by a citizenry that insisted on
taking human rights seriously.  A significant cause of the
collapse of the Soviet empire was the growing unwillingness of
Communist-bloc citizens to accept the systematic denial of
internationally recognized human rights.  In South and Central
America, repressive military governments fell throughout the
1980s.  In Asia and Africa, liberalization and democratization
have been more irregular but nevertheless real, and in some
countries (South Korea and South Africa, for example) quite
striking.
<p>
The spread of human rights is neither natural nor inevitable.
Regression is possible, even likely in some cases.  The world's
remaining repressive dictatorships may prove quite long-lived.
But the lesson of the past decade would seem to be that wherever
people are given the chance to choose, they choose
internationally recognized human rights.  And whatever the
shortcomings of current practice, we live in a world in which
fewer governments than ever before seem able to deny their people
that choice.
<p>
<i><b><font size=10>H</font>uman Rights As An International
Issue</b></i>
<br>
In the post-Cold War world, nearly all states, in all regions
of
the world, at all levels of development, proclaim their
commitment to human rights.  And with the continuing spread of
political liberalization and democratization, an ever-growing
number of governments are being pressured at home and from abroad
to live up to these commitments.  In today's world, a consistent
pattern of gross human rights violations is widely perceived to
undermine a regime's national and international legitimacy.
<P>
This situation, however, is historically unprecedented.  Human
rights has been an established subject of international relations
for only about half a century.  Prior to World War II, even
genocidal massacres such as Russian pogroms against the Jews and
the Turkish slaughter of Armenians were met with little more than
polite statements of disapproval.  Less egregious violations
typically were not even considered a fit subject for diplomatic
conversation.
<p>
How a government treated its own citizens in its own territory
was considered a matter of sovereign domestic jurisdiction.  In
fact, individual states and the international community were
considered to be under an international legal obligation not to
intervene in such matters.  Even the notoriously "idealist"
covenant of the League of Nations fails to mention human rights
as a subject of legitimate international concern.
<p>
<i><b>From the Holocaust to the Cold War:</i></b>  The Holocaust,
in
which
German Nazis systematically attempted to eliminate European
Jewry, brought human rights into the mainstream of international
relations.  Shocking as Nazi atrocities were, the international
community lacked the legal and political language to condemn
them.  Massacring one's own citizens simply was not an
established
international legal offense.  The German government may have been
liable under the laws of war for its treatment of citizens in
occupied territories, but in killing German nationals it was
merely exercising its sovereign rights.  And traditional
"realist"
diplomacy, which defined the national interest in terms of state
power, could find no material interest that was threatened by the
barbarous treatment of foreign civilians.
<a name="crimes"><p>
The <a href="crimes.htm">Nuremberg War Crimes Trials
(1945-1946)</a> introduced the
novel
charge of crimes against humanity.  For the first time, officials
were held legally accountable to the international community for
offenses against individual citizens, not states, and individuals
who in many cases were nationals, not foreigners.  It was in the
United Nations, however, that human rights really emerged as a
subject of international relations.
<p>
Human rights have a prominent place in the UN Charter adopted
in
1945.  And the new organization moved rapidly to elaborate
authoritative international human rights norms.  On December 10,
1948, the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights.  This comprehensive list of rights codified the
emerging view that the way in which states treat their own
citizens is not only a legitimate international concern but
subject to international standards.
<p>
With the rise of the Cold War, however, human rights
increasingly
became just another weapon of ideological struggle.  Just as the
United States was willing to accept the most vicious human rights
practices in "friendly" anti-Communist regimes, the Soviet Union
was ready to use force when necessary to assure "friendly"
totalitarian regimes in its sphere of influence.
<p>
Furthermore, few states desired more than the strong statement
of
norms provided by the Universal Declaration.  Although no longer
willing to leave human rights entirely beyond international
purview, they refused to allow even multilateral monitoring of
national human rights practices, let alone international
implementation or enforcement.  The UN Commission on Human
Rights,
for example, was not even permitted to read the thousands of
complaints received by the United Nations alleging human rights
violations.
<p>
The United Nations is not a world government standing above
states, but an intergovernmental organization.  It can do nothing
that its members -- sovereign states -- do not authorize.  And
during the first two decades of the Cold War, neither bloc was
willing to allow the UN to do much at all in the field of human
rights.
<p>
By the mid-1960s, though, the Afro-Asian bloc had become the
largest group in the United Nations.  These countries, which had
suffered under colonial rule, had a special interest in human
rights.  They found a sympathetic hearing from the Soviet bloc
and
some countries in Europe and the Americas.  The United Nations
thus once again began to attend to human rights.
<p>
Most significant, the International Human Rights Covenants
were completed in December 1966.  Along with the Universal
Declaration they represented -- and still provide -- an
authoritative statement of internationally recognized human
rights.
<p>
The very comprehensiveness of the Covenants, however, demanded
that the United Nations shift its human rights work from
standard-setting to implementing these standards.  This was an
area where the organization had made virtually no headway in its
first two decades.
<p>
In the absence of an international legislative body,
international law is in large measure contractual.  Most
international legal obligations today arise from treaties, which
are, in effect, solemn contracts between states.  Because states
are free to enter into treaties or not, as they see fit, the
obligations of international law are for the most part
voluntarily incurred.  States are thus free to, among other
things, establish international obligations that cannot be
internationally enforced -- which is precisely what they did in
the case of human rights.
<p>
Consider the "implementation" machinery of the Covenants.
Parties
must submit periodic reports on compliance.  The supervisory
committees may question state representatives about the reports
and draw attention to apparent shortcomings.  But they are not
authorized to find violations of the treaty, demand changes in
state practice, or seek remedy for victims.
<p>
Although human rights norms were fully internationalized by
the
mid-1960s, implementation of those norms remained almost entirely
national.  The emerging global human rights regime thus
reflected,
and even today continues to reflect, the strong persistence of a
sovereignty-respecting logic.
<p>
<i><b>The Carter Revival:</i></b>  Small inroads began to be made
in the
late
1960s and 1970s.  The UN Commission on Human Rights received
authority to discuss human rights violations in particular
countries.  Special procedures addressed human rights violations
in Israeli-occupied territories, South Africa, and Chile.  But
the
point of takeoff for human rights as an international issue came
in 1977, when Jimmy Carter took the office of president of the
United States.
<p>
In embracing human rights as a priority for American foreign
policy, Carter at least partly disentangled international human
rights from the East-West politics of the Cold War and the
North-South struggles over a new international economic order.
This gave new momentum and increased legitimacy to human rights
advocates throughout the world.
<p>
Within the United Nations, a revitalized Commission on Human
Rights, led by Canada, the Netherlands, and others, formulated
major treaties on women's rights (1979), on torture (1984), and
on the rights of the child (1989).  Rapporteurs were appointed to
study human rights violations in a growing number of increasingly
diverse countries.  The commission also developed innovative new
mechanisms to deal with particular kinds of violations, most
notably disappearances.
<p>
<a name="helsinki">The mid-1970s also saw the introduction of
human rights into
the
mainstream of bilateral foreign policy.  For example, the United
States and the Nordic countries began to consider the human
rights practices of recipient countries in their aid policies.
And the <a href="helsinki.htm">Helsinki Final Act of 1975</a>
explicitly introduced human
rights into the mainstream of U.S.-Soviet relations.
<p>
The emerging trend represented by such initiatives received a
major boost from Carter's prominent public human rights
diplomacy.  By the mid-1980s, debate in most Western countries
focused less on whether human rights should be an active concern
of foreign policy -- still a matter of considerable controversy
in the late 1970s and early 1980s -- than on which rights should
be pursued and where.
<p>
The 1970s was also the decade in which nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) concerned with human rights emerged as a
notable international political force, as symbolized by the award
of the Nobel Peace Prize to Amnesty International in 1977 for its
assistance to political prisoners.  By 1980, there were some 200
NGOs in the United States that dealt with human rights in some
way, and about the same number in Britain.  These groups, in
addition to their advocacy for victims of human rights abuses,
have been important actors in changing bilateral and multilateral
international human rights policies.  International campaigns
against torture by Amnesty International in the 1970s and 1980s
played an important role in the drafting of the UN's 1984
Convention Against Torture.  At the national level, the Dutch
section of Amnesty was involved in drafting its government's 1979
White Paper on human rights and development.  And anti-apartheid
activists in the United States and several European countries had
a major impact on foreign policy toward South Africa in the
1980s.
<p>
<i><b>The Post-Cold War Environment:</b></i>  Post-Cold War
developments
have
further strengthened multilateral, bilateral, and transnational
human rights actors and procedures.  Existing multilateral
mechanisms are being used more vigorously and with greater
impartiality, and new initiatives, such as the creation of a UN
High Commissioner for Human Rights, promise intensified
international monitoring.  In most countries, human rights have
become a more deeply entrenched and less controversial issue on
foreign policy agendas, and nongovernmental human rights
organizations and advocates have become an increasingly
significant part of the political landscape.
<p>
International human rights issues still provoke political
controversy.  At the World Conference on Human Rights held in
Vienna in 1993, for example, a small group of countries argued,
ultimately unsuccessfully, against efforts of the international
community to press states to comply with the standards laid out
in the Universal Declaration and the Covenants.  In bilateral
relations, raising human rights issues still is resented by many
states, as the strained relations between China and its major
trading partners in the years following the 1989 Tiananmen
massacre of Chinese citizens clearly illustrate.  And most states
still refuse to press international human rights concerns
strongly enough to satisfy many human rights NGOs.
<p>
<a name="watch">The record of national practice, although greatly
improved in
many countries over the past decade, also leaves much to be
desired.  There are still regimes in power -- in Cuba, Iraq,
Zaire, North Korea, and other countries -- that rest on
systematic violations of internationally recognized human rights.
And as is documented in the reports of groups as diverse as the
NGO <a href="watch.htm">Human Rights Watch</a> and the U.S.
Department of State, most
countries of the world still have significant human rights
problems.
<p>
Nonetheless, there is a new willingness within the
international
community to act forcefully in at least some cases of systematic
human rights violations.  During the Cold War, genocide in
Cambodia was met with pained expressions of regret, but little
more.  In Rwanda in 1994, by contrast, the international
community
responded to genocide with military intervention.  In El
Salvador,
UN human rights monitors played an important role in reaching a
political settlement and demilitarizing the country after a
decade-long civil war.  In Somalia, when the country descended
into warlord politics, multilateral military forces intervened to
save literally hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians from
starvation.  And in Cambodia, a massive United Nations operation
helped to remove occupying Vietnamese forces and install a freely
elected government.
<p>
To take just one more example, consider Bosnia.  After three
and
a
half years of refusing to bow to force and the politics of ethnic
cleansing, the international community, led by the United States,
was able to broker a settlement of a bloody civil war that killed
close to a quarter million people and made refugees of some two
million others.  Whether the peace will hold is unclear.  But the
willingness of the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and several non-NATO countries in Central and
Eastern Europe to provide 50,000 troops to implement the Dayton
Peace Accords dramatically reflects the rise in importance of
human rights and humanitarian politics on national and
international agendas in the 1990s and beyond.
<p>
<b><i><font size=10>T</font>he United States and Human
Rights</i></b>
<br>
The United States has played a special role in the political
development and spread of human rights ideas and practices.  The
Declaration of Independence, by which the American colonies
severed their allegiance to the British Crown in 1776, proclaims
the self-evident truth that all men are created equal and endowed
with inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness.  No less important, it asserts the right of a people
to dissolve political bonds that have come to be oppressive.  And
in the political system established under the U.S. Constitution
and its Bill of Rights, the world witnessed the first practical
experiment in a government committed to being judged by the
extent to which it respected and protected the rights of its
citizens.  Rights, thus, are often seen by Americans as a
defining
feature of their national heritage.
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
<b>
<hr>
<i>Natural rights are those which appertain to man in right
of
his
existence. Of this kind are all the intellectual rights, or
rights of the mind, and also all those rights of acting as an
individual for his own comfort and happiness, which are not
injurious to the natural rights of others....</i>
<P><center>    Thomas Paine, American political theorist and
writer
(1737-1809), from <I>Rights of Man,</I> 1792</b></center>
<hr>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
There are, of course, darker sides to that heritage.  Slavery
was
officially accepted for the better part of the first century of
the new republic -- the U.S. Constitution actually protected the
slave trade for some 50 years -- and legalized racial
discrimination was the norm for much of the second century.
Indigenous populations were forced to surrender their homes and
their lands, without recompense, as America expanded westward.
<p>
There was a similar ambivalence in American international
human
rights policies and practices.  For example, Central America and
the Caribbean were viewed as "our backyard," in which American
troops were sent to overthrow governments the United States
judged unacceptable.  And during the Cold War, brutal military
dictatorships were called free and democratic, and were given
American financial and military support, so long as they
supported U.S. economic and geopolitical interests.
<p>
But the United States also has a long record of positive
international action on behalf of human rights, as, for example,
during the French Revolution and when the countries of Central
and South America threw off Spanish colonial rule in the 19th
century.  Furthermore, throughout the 20th century, the United
States has acted internationally to strengthen this reputation.
After World War I, American President Woodrow Wilson championed
national self-determination and protection of minorities by the
international community.  After World War II, the United States
devoted considerable effort and money to sustaining and
rebuilding democracy in Europe and to establishing it in Japan.
The United States was a leader in decolonization, granting
independence to the Philippines in 1946.  Even during the Cold
War, when the United States supported repressive dictatorships in
the name of anti-communism, there was a core of truth to the
American claim to be the one superpower committed to the
realization of human rights.  And with the end of the Cold War,
the United States has emerged as a leader in multilateral human
rights and humanitarian initiatives in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia,
and other countries.
<p>
This leadership role has its problematic elements.
Traditionally,
the United States has been reticent to open itself to the sort of
human rights scrutiny it applies to others.  It was only in 1992
that the United States ratified the United Nations' International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, more than 25 years after
the measure received General Assembly approval.  In addition,
across the
mainstream of the American political spectrum, there has been an
unusual reluctance to accept the equal status of civil and
political and economic, social, and cultural rights, a central
normative principle of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and the Covenants.  The United States is not a party to
the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,
and Americans do not regard social problems involving education,
health care, and employment as human rights issues.
<p>
American leadership has also been challenged.  At home, the
isolationist tradition is deeply rooted.  Today, many Americans
are reluctant to spend money or risk American lives to support
human rights abroad.  Abroad, American self-righteousness and a
preference for unilateral action have often provoked resentment
even among those who have shared the values underlying American
policies.
<p>
Nonetheless, the United States today, as two centuries ago, is
a
world leader in the ongoing struggle for human rights.  And the
struggle continues, globally, to realize the revolutionary idea
that all people, simply because they are human, are entitled to
the basic protections, goods, services, and opportunities of
internationally recognized human rights.
<p>
<i><b><font size=10>I</font>nternational Monitoring and
Implementation
Mechanisms</i></b>
<br>
The transformation of the international relations of human
rights
has been particularly striking at the normative level.  For
example, the International Human Rights Covenants have been
ratified by more than three-fourths of the countries of the
world.  Although international bodies still play a secondary role
in implementing these norms, states are increasingly accountable
to the international community for their human rights practices.
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
<b><hr>
<p>
<i>...there are occasional crimes committed on so vast a
scale
and
of such peculiar horror as to make us doubt whether it is not our
manifest duty to endeavor at least to show our disapproval of the
deed and our sympathy with those who have suffered by it. The
cases must be extreme in which such a course is justifiable.</i>

established a supervisory committee of independent experts -- the
Human Rights Committee -- the principal function of which is to
review the periodic reports submitted by states.  Similar
committees have been created by international human rights
treaties on racial discrimination, women's rights, torture, and
the rights of the child.
<p>
Although questions from the committee during review of the
reports are often well informed and probing, the representative
of the reporting state need not answer any question, let alone
provide a satisfactory answer.  Many reports contain little more
than extracts from laws and the constitution, or obviously
evasive claims of compliance.  And whatever the quality of the
report, once it has been reviewed, the monitoring process
typically ends until the next report is due.
<p>
Reporting schemes obviously cannot force recalcitrant states
to
alter their practices.  They can, however, provide additional
incentives for states seeking to improve or safeguard their human
rights record.  Preparing a report requires a national review of
law and practice, which may uncover areas where improvement may
be needed or possible.  It also provides a concrete periodic
reminder to officials of their international legal obligations.
<p>
Human rights reports, because they originate from the
reporting
government, may provide the least adversarial of all
international monitoring mechanisms.  Reporting systems also have
the virtue of allowing human rights issues to be addressed before
problems become severe.  But government control of the mechanism
makes this type of monitoring most subject to evasion and abuse.
<p>
The Human Rights Committee may also consider "communications"
(complaints) from individuals in the states party to the (First)
Optional Protocol to the Covenant.  Although the findings of the
Human Rights Committee are not enforceable, several states have
acted on them.  For example, Canada revised legislation
concerning
the rights of Indians living off their tribal lands, Mauritius
altered legislation concerning women's rights, and the
Netherlands changed discriminatory social security legislation.
The expert committees on racial discrimination and torture have
similar powers.
<p>
An even stronger individual complaint mechanism exists within
the
Council of Europe.  The decisions of the European Commission on
Human Rights, although not technically binding, are usually
accepted by states.  And the European Court of Human Rights has
made legally binding decisions in over 150 cases dealing with a
variety of issues, including such sensitive questions as public
emergencies.  This is the one instance, globally, where there has
been a significant transfer of authority for implementing human
rights from states to a supranational political community.
Unfortunately, regional schemes in the Americas and Africa have
had less success working with individual communications, and Asia
and the Arab world do not have regional human rights commissions.
<p>
The attraction of individual cases is that their concreteness
and
specificity make it hard for states to evade responsibility.  In
order to avoid embarrassing publicity, a state may release
political prisoners or may compensate individual victims --
although the three global treaty-based petition systems have
handled well under 1,000 cases combined.  Procedures focused on
individual victims, however, fail to address broader patterns and
deeper structural forces.
<p>
Therefore, it is of special interest that the Committee
Against
Torture is also authorized to investigate
communications concerning situations where torture is
systematically practiced.  But precisely because such procedures
allow more systematic challenges to governments, they are not
widely implemented.  No other independent committee of experts
has
this authority, and the comparable "1503 procedure" in the UN
Commission on Human Rights dealt with less than half a dozen
cases during its first two decades of operation.
<p>
Here as elsewhere, one can see an inverse relationship between
the strength and scope of international monitoring procedures and
the willingness of states to use and participate in them.  And
because sovereign states have the right to choose not to
participate in most international human rights implementation
systems, the tradeoff between strength and coverage is a serious
and persistent problem.
<p>
Another set of multilateral human rights monitoring mechanisms
focuses on investigative reporting and advocacy.  The pioneer in
this area was the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.  Its
reports on Chile in the 1970s and 1980s were an important element
in the international campaign against the Pinochet government,
and its 1978 report on Nicaragua appears to have contributed
significantly to the demise of the Somoza government.
<p>
Over the last 15 years, the UN Commission on Human Rights has
devoted considerable and growing effort to country studies,
including such politically prominent countries as Guatemala,
Iran, and Burma.  Typically, the commission works through a
special rapporteur -- a semi-independent expert and investigator.
The special rapporteur, in addition to reporting formally to the
commission, typically attempts to maintain a continuing dialogue
with the government in question in order to establish a sustained
presence and channel for influence.
<p>
The UN Commission on Human Rights has also developed an
innovative series of "thematic" efforts to consider particular
types of human rights violations, beginning with the Working
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances established in
1980.  In its first decade, this working group handled over
19,000
cases.  In 1985, Peter Kooijmans, the outgoing chair of the
commission, was appointed special rapporteur on torture.
Kooijmans held this position until 1993, when he became Foreign
Minister of the Netherlands -- a sign of the dramatic rise in the
priority of human rights in the foreign policy of at least some
states.  Additional rapporteurs or working groups have been
created to deal with summary or arbitrary executions, arbitrary
detentions, religious intolerance, human rights violations by
mercenaries, and racism.
<p>
The newest international human rights monitor is the
semi-independent UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,
established in 1994.  It is still too early to assess the impact
of this initiative.
<p>
<i><b><font size=10>N</font>ongovernmental Organizations and
States: Their Contrasting
Roles</i></b>
<br>
As noted earlier, the transnational activities of human rights
nongovernmental organizations outside their own countries and the
bilateral policies of states are often at least as important to
the international politics of human rights as the activities of
formal multilateral institutions discussed above.  In addition to
the international campaigns waged by Amnesty International, such
U.S. NGOs as Americas Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union,
and several other organizations were important players in the
struggles over Central American policy in the 1980s.  And in both
North America and Europe, NGOs played a major role in national
debates over sanctions against South Africa during the 1980s.
<p>
Because of their private status, NGOs can operate free of the
political control of states.  And because they do not have
broader
foreign policy concerns that may conflict with their human rights
objectives, they often are better able to press human rights
concerns.
<p>
Human rights NGOs may also have a special advantage as
national
advocates of improved human rights practices.  Because they are
narrowly focused and generally nonpartisan, they sometimes can
raise human rights issues within a country that no other actor
can.  Particularly where independent political activity is
repressed and civil society is weak, as in the Soviet bloc or the
Southern Cone of South America during the late 1970s and early
1980s, human rights NGOs may be the only national voice not
completely silenced.  Likewise today, in countries where
democratization and political liberalization remain incomplete,
partisan political activity often is far more dangerous than less
directly partisan human rights activity.  And both national and
international human rights NGOs have a special role when
political space begins to open, or threatens to close back down,
because they act with a single-minded focus on human rights.
<p>
However, NGOs must rely on the power of publicity and
persuasion.
They lack the resources of even weak states.  States remain free
to be unpersuaded.  And many states have used their powers of
coercion against the members of human rights NGOs, turning them
into new victims.
<p>
Sovereign states have almost the opposite strengths and
weaknesses of NGOs.  States in their foreign policies must
accommodate a wide range of interests.  Foreign policy can never
be reduced to or identical to human rights policy.  Furthermore,
foreign policy is by its nature directed toward the realization
of the national interest, which rarely places human rights above
material and political interests.  But when states do choose to
pursue human rights objectives, they typically possess resources,
channels of influence, and even publicity capabilities that are
unavailable to NGOs.
<p>
The national role of states also needs to be emphasized.
States,
in addition to being the principal violators of human rights, are
the principal mechanism for their protection and implementation
in the contemporary world.  The ultimate goal of human rights
advocacy is to alter national law and practice.  The contribution
of international actors is therefore almost always secondary to
the national political struggles by which citizens force their
own government to respect their rights.  International action can
help to quicken the pace, provide support for national human
rights advocates, and add further incentives for regimes to
respect the rights of their citizens.  It is at the level of the
nation-state, however, that human rights must ultimately be
vindicated.
<p>
Finally, in thinking about international human rights
pressures
on states, the role of actors who are only episodically involved,
or may not even have an explicit human rights mandate, should not
be overlooked.  For example, the 1993 Vienna World Conference on
Human Rights, a one-time, ad hoc gathering, helped refocus
international attention on human rights in the post-Cold War
world.  The war crimes tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and
Rwanda are ad hoc bodies that may help to shape the direction of
international human rights activities.  The 1995 United Nations
Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing attempted to
introduce women's issues more explicitly into the mainstream of
international human rights discussions.  The World Bank, in its
recent emphasis on "good governance," has begun to touch on
important human rights issues.  And both the Council of Europe
and
the European Union have stressed the importance of
rights-protective policies to inclusion in "Europe." 
<p>
<i><b><font size=10>A</font> System of International
Accountability</b></i>
<br>
Although sovereign states retain a primary responsibility for
implementing internationally recognized human rights in their
territories, they no longer enjoy the protections of discrete
diplomatic silence.  Quite the contrary, persistent human rights
violators increasingly must act in the light of embarrassing
international publicity mobilized by public and private groups.
Global, regional, national, and transnational actors have created
a web of pressures that make it almost impossible today for
states to avoid a public accounting of their human rights
practices.
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
<b><hr>
<i>The authority of government...is still an impure one: to
be
strictly just, it must have the sanction and consent of the
governed. It can have no pure right over my person and property
but what I concede to it. The progress from an absolute to a
limited monarchy, from a limited monarchy to a democracy, is
progress toward a true respect for the individual.</i>
<P>
<center>Henry David Thoreau, American essayist (1817-1862),
from <i>Civil Disobedience,</I> 1846</center>
<hr>
</b>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
Admittedly, most of the current mechanisms of accountability
rely
principally on the power of public exposure and scrutiny.  But
the
value of publicizing violations and trying to shame states into
better compliance should not be underestimated.  Even vicious
governments may care about their international reputation.  For
example, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, no less vile a
government than the Argentine military regime devoted
considerable diplomatic effort to thwart the investigations of
the UN Commission on Human Rights.  Furthermore, publicity often
helps at least a few of the more prominent victims of repression.
<p>
The most important impact of all this -- largely verbal --
international human rights activity, however, probably lies less
in its immediate achievements on behalf of victims than in the
fact that national and international norms and expectations are
being altered.  The idea of human rights has a moral force and
mobilizing power in the contemporary world that seems hard to
resist.  And as more and more citizens throughout the world come
to think of themselves as endowed with inalienable rights against
their government, the demand for human rights continues to cause
dictators to flee and their governments to crumble.
<p>
The sword often proves mightier than the word, at least in the
short run.  But the task of human rights advocates, wherever they
may be, is the ancient and noble one of speaking the truth of
justice to power.  And one of the most heartening lessons of the
past decade is that, far more often than so-called realists would
ever allow, that truth can triumph.

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
The idea that human rights violations committed by those waging
aggressive wars should be prosecuted -- including the planning of
atrocities by high government officials -- was firmly
established more than 50 years ago at Nuremberg, Germany, where
high-level Nazis were tried.
<P>
The principle was first officially annunciated in the Moscow
Declaration of 1943, which was signed by U.S. President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston
Churchill, and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. As a result of the
declaration, the Allies set up a War Crimes Commission that met
in London throughout 1944, preparing lists of war criminals and
debating ways of dealing with them.
<P>
There was much disagreement among members of the commission and
within the allied governments about the fate of the Nazi human
rights violators. Some favored summary execution for the
worst offenders, others a quick trial and execution. But it was
ultimately agreed that the Nazi leaders should be tried according
to accepted principles of law so that a precedent would be firmly
established.
<P>
At a conference in London, a plan for the trial system was
adopted. This became the London Charter, the basic document of
the International Military Tribunal and of the entire Nuremberg
trial procedure.
<P>
In the most important of the cases heard at Nuremberg, the
indictment named 22 Nazi leaders and charged them with
conspiracy against peace, crimes against peace, and violations of
the laws of war. Perhaps even more important, they
were found guilty of crimes against humanity for the human rights
violations perpetrated against their own nationals and
subjects. The prosecutors cited such international agreements as
The Hague Convention of 1907 and the Geneva Convention of 1929 to
support the indictment. Of the 22 defendants, 19 were found
guilty; three were acquitted of the charges.
<P>
Commenting on the meaning of Nuremberg to future generations,
Edward R. Murrow, a radio reporter whose wartime broadcasts
from Europe informed millions of Americans, said: "It is
now established that planning, preparing, and initiating
aggressive war constitutes an international crime. And it
is also established that atrocities -- crimes against humanity --
are not merely the responsibility of those who commit them, but
also the responsibility of the highest government officials."
<P>
With the creation of the International Criminal Tribunal for
Yugoslavia in 1993 and that for Rwanda in 1994, many believe this
long-unused instrument for punishing wartime human 
rights offenders can become a potent weapon for deterring future
violations.</BLOCKQUOTE></I>

<H3>THE HELSINKI PROCESS</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
One of the most prominent of the regional human rights
organizations is the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), which was formed in 1975 as a result of the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and whose
mission is stated in the final act of that conference, the
Helsinki Accords.
<P>
Many experts credit the Helsinki process with helping to bring
about the fall of autocratic communism in the former Soviet Union
and in Eastern Europe. Certainly, the commitment of the states of
Europe, the United States, and Canada to a list of 10 specific
principles helped frame a climate in which the champions of human
rights could make their case:  
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Respect for sovereignty;
<LI> Refraining from the use of force or threat of force;
<LI> The inviolability of borders;
<LI> The territorial integrity of states;
<LI> Peaceful settlement of disputes;
<LI> Noninterference in internal affairs;
<LI> Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including
freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and conviction;
<LI> The equality of peoples and the right to 
self-determination;
<LI> Cooperation among states;
<LI> The fulfillment of international legal commitments in good
faith.
</UL>
<P>
Western governments, the international media, and human rights
organizations such as Helsinki Watch and Charter 77 applied
constant pressure to the Soviet-bloc nations to free their
dissidents, permit more freedom, and open their countries to
international human rights standards.
<P>
In the years since the Cold War ended, OSCE has begun work on
building a new European security architecture intended to prevent
new dividing lines from forming on the continent. In this
respect, the major arms reductions specified in the CFE
(Conventional Armed Forces in Europe) Treaty, which was
negotiated under OSCE auspices and signed in 1990, provides 
an important precedent.
<P>
There are now Helsinki Committees in more than 30 states --
including Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Macedonia, and
Canada -- and an international Helsinki foundation located in
Vienna. Many people believe that the OSCE could be a prototype
for other regional efforts and a way of forging greater respect
for human rights in other parts of the world as well as in
Europe.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission was announced during President Mandela's October 1994 visit to Washington.  The Commission was created to oversee, coordinate, and promote the development of relations between the United States and South Africa.  Vice President Gore and Executive Deputy President Mbeki launched the U.S.-S.A. Binational Commission at its inaugural meeting on March 1, 1995.  The Commission is co-chaired by the Vice President of the United States and the Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa.  The Commission was originally comprised of five committees for the purpose of facilitating bilateral cooperation in key issues of mutual concern: 1) Trade and Investment (formerly called business development); 2) Environment.  Conservation and Sustainable Development; 3) Sustainable Energy Development; 4) Human Resource Development and Education; and 5) science and Technology.  Each Committee is chaired at the Ministerial/Secretarial level.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Commission is scheduled to meet approximately every six months with the venue alternating between the two countries.  During the meetings, the Commission will review activities of the six committees, resolve any outstanding difficulties and establish an agenda for future undertakings of the Commission.  The committee co-chairpersons are responsible for their committees' completing assigned tasks prior to the next Commission meeting.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The first full meeting of the BNC with its initial five committees occurred in Pretoria in December 1995.  A sixth committee on Agriculture was added to the BNC following that session.  The BNC met with all six committees in July 1996 in Washington.</P>

<P>The third full meeting of the U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission (BNC) is scheduled to take place in Cape Town, South Africa on February 14 - 17, 1997.</P>

<P DIR="LTR">The BNC has become the capstone of the Clinton Administration's efforts to reestablish and elevate to a priority position the U.S. relationship with the new South Afiica.</P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B DIR="LTR">Trade and Investment Committee</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Secretary of Commerce co-chairs the BNC's Trade and Investinent Committee (TIC) with his counterpart, South Afiica's Minister of Trade and Industry Alec Erwin.  Ruth Harkin, President of OPIC, is the Vice Chair on the U.S. side.  There is no South African Vice Chair.  The February meeting will be the second BNC/TIC session for Minister Erwin.  He assumed his position as Minister of the Department of Trade and Industry on April 3, 1996.  He had formerly served as the Deputy Minister of Finance.
The TIC has played a key role as the United States and South Africa seek to reestablish the many facets of their commercial relationship which had been cut off during the apartheid/sanctions era.  USDOC/ITA's Office of Africa is the TIC point of contact for the Department.  Commerce coordinates the TIC interagency working group representing 13 USG agencies in the trade and investment area to identify issues to be addressed and delivarables to be announced at the TIC meetings.  The following agencies make up the TIC: Commerce, State, USTR, Treasury, OPIC, AID, Energy, TDA, Labor, EXIM Bank, USIA, the NSC and the White House.  This group has been meeting periodically since the fall of 1993, as the USDOC Interagency Task Force on South Africa, and has been largely responsible for crafting the commercial component of the USG's relationship with the new South Africa.</P>

<BR>

<A HREF="#index">Return to Index</A></Center>

<P>

The Islamic Republic of Iran was established in 1979 after a

populist revolution toppled the monarchy.  The Government is

dominated by Shi'a Muslim clergy.  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is the

Leader of the Islamic Revolution and functions as the Chief of

State.  He is also the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. 

President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, first elected in a

popular vote in 1989 and reelected in 1993, is constitutionally

barred from a third term.  The Constitution provides for a

270-seat unicameral Islamic Consultative Assembly, or Majles. 

The Government seeks to ensure that public policy is consistent

with its view of political and socio-religious values, but some

serious differences exist within the leadership.  The

authoritarian government maintains its power through widespread

repression and intimidation.  The judiciary is subject to

government and religious influence.

<P>

Several agencies share responsibility for internal security,

including the Ministry of Intelligence and Security, the Ministry

of Interior, and the Revolutionary Guards, a military force

established after the revolution and coequal with the regular

military.  Paramilitary volunteer forces known as Hezbollahis or

Basijis conduct vigilante actions.  Both regular and paramilitary

security forces commit numerous and serious human rights abuses.

<P>

Iran has a mixed economy.  The Government owns the petroleum and

utilities industries and the banks.  Oil exports are the primary

source of foreign exchange.  The economy has not yet recovered

from the disruptions of the 1979 revolution and the destruction

from the Iran-Iraq war.  Iran's isolation from international

financial markets has decreased slightly, but remains a problem. 

Economic performance is adversely affected by corruption and

government mismanagement.  Unemployment in 1996 was estimated at

30 percent, and inflation was about  50 percent.

<P>

The Government's human rights record remains poor; there was no

evidence of significant human rights improvement during the year.

Systematic abuses include extrajudicial killings and summary

executions; disappearances; widespread use of torture and other

degrading treatment; harsh prison conditions; arbitrary arrest

and detention; lack of fair trials; infringement on citizens'

privacy rights; and restriction of the freedoms of speech, press,

assembly, association, religion, and movement.  The Government

represses political dissidents and the ruling clerics effectively

control the electoral process, thereby denying citizens the right

to change their government.  Women face legal and social

discrimination, and the Government discriminates against 

minorities and restricts important worker rights.  Although a

lively debate on political, economic, and social issues occurred

during the parliamentary election campaign this year, freedom of

expression remained firmly under government control and became

more severely restricted in the wake of the parliamentary

elections.  The Government closed several newspapers,

disqualified candidates, barred speakers, and intimidated

opposition gatherings by encouraging Hezbollahi attacks.

<P>

However, the Government did allow the first visit in 5 years of

the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) Special

Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran.  Canadian Maurice Copithorne,

the newly appointed Special Rapporteur, visited Iran from

February 10 to 16.  The Special Rapporteur heard credible reports

of abuses including:  Inhuman or degrading treatment and

punishment; arbitrary arrests, imprisonments, and executions;

unfair judicial practices; and disregard for freedom of

expression and religion.  Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the UNHRC

Special Rapporteur reported that the Government was generally

cooperative during their visits,  However, the Government

continues to deny the universality of human rights and attempts

to discredit critics.  For example, in one Iranian press report,

the chief of Evin prison described human rights inspectors as

"sick" people who filed misleading and untruthful reports.  The

U.N. Special Rapporteur for Religious Freedom and the U.N.

Special Rapporteur for the Freedom of Expression also traveled to

Iran in 1996.  In November the UNHRC continued the mandate of its

Special Rapporteur.

<P>

<B>Section 1   Respect for the Integrity of the Person,</B>

<P>Including Freedom from:  

<P>

<b>a.   Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing</b>

<P>

Most executions in political trials amount to summary executions

because basic procedural safeguards are lacking.  In his 1995

report, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or

Arbitrary Executions noted "the persistent allegations of

violations of the right to life in the Islamic Republic of Iran."



Although the domestic press stopped reporting most executions as

of 1992, executions appear to continue in substantial numbers. 

Amnesty International (AI) reported that at least 110 persons

were executed in 1996, a substantial increase over the previous

year's total of 50 executions.  Inhuman punishments are used in

some cases, including two cases of stoning (see Section 1.c.). 

Those executed included Mehrdad Kalany, who was executed on June

22 on charges that included "meeting and talking" with Reynaldo

Galindo Pohl, the former U.N. Special Representative,  and the

delegation that accompanied him.  Also on June 22, Ahmed

Bakhtiari, a member of the Iranian People's Fedaian Organization

(Minority), was executed on charges of participation in a

terrorist group and terrorist operations, as well as other

criminal charges.  Rahman Radjabi Hamvand, a member of the

Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran, was executed on July 28.  The

charges against him stemmed from a complaint by a private

individual that was later withdrawn.  AI reported that

Hedayatollah Zendehdel and Abolghasem Majd-Abkahi were believed

to have been hanged at the end of the year, after 7 years'

detention without trial and conviction on mainly political

charges.

<P>

Exiles and human rights monitors report that many of those

executed for alleged criminal offenses, primarily narcotics

charges, were actually political dissidents.  In addition a

November 1995 law criminalized dissent and applied the death

penalty to offenses such as "attempts against the security of the

State, outrage against high-ranking Iranian officials, and

insults against the memory of Imam Khomeini, and against the

Leader of the Islamic Republic."

<P>

The Government continued its repression of the Sunni minority,

both inside and outside Iran.  On January 28, a 50-year-old Sunni

cleric, Molawi Ahamed Sayyad, imprisoned by the Government from

1990-95, disappeared at Bandar Abbas airport.  His body was found

in a suburb of the city on February 2.  Allegedly, six members of

the Revolutionary Guards arrested him at the airport; he is

believed to have died in their custody.  In early March,

46-year-old Molavi Abdul Malek, a Sunni cleric and Iranian

Balouch leader, was reportedly killed by Iranian intelligence

operatives in Karachi.  Also reported killed in a related

incident were Iranian Sunni Molavi Abdulmalek, the son of a

prominent Iranian Sunni cleric, and Jamshid Zahi, another Iranian

Sunni leader.  

<P>

In December clashes erupted in Bakhtaran at a funeral after

mourners accused the Government of killing Mohammad Rabil, a

Sunni prayer leader.  Officials said that Rabil died of a heart

attack.  It is unclear whether any persons were killed in the

rioting.

<P>

The Government also continued to kill political opponents abroad.

Opposition leaders Zahrah Rajabi and Abdul Ali Moradi were killed

in Istanbul by agents of the Government on February 20.  In Iraq

eight members of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran were killed

by elements of the Revolutionary Guards.  The victims were: 

Ghafour Mehdizadeh; Ali Amini; and Saddig Abdulahi, who were

killed on December 27, 1995 in Koya; Usman Ruyan and Abubaker

Rahimi, who were killed on December 30, 1995 in Arbil; Rahman

Schabannajad and Ali Abdulah, who were killed on January 2 in

Suleimanya; and Cheder Mahmudi, who was killed in November 1995

in Suleimanya.  In May a former official from the Shah's regime,

Reza Masluman, was killed in Paris.  The murder is believed to

have been ordered by the Government.

<P>

Investigations of state-sponsored terrorism abroad continued in

1996.  For example the trial of Kazem Darabi, an Iranian charged

with murdering four Iranian Kurdish dissidents in Berlin in 1992

allegedly under instructions from the Iranian Government,

continued in Germany.  In November the German prosecutor stated

that Iranian Head of State Ayatollah Khameini and President

Rafsanjani were responsible for the murders.  Iran responded by

threatening the German embassy in Tehran, the German judiciary,

and political and economic ties with Germany.  In France a French

prosecutor accused Iranian chief of intelligence Ali Fallahian of

ordering a killing, and in Germany a warrant was issued for

Fallahian's arrest.

<P>

The Government took no action to repudiate the religious ruling

(fatwa), or its related bounty, calling for the death of Salman

Rushdie and anyone associated with publishing his book, "The

Satanic Verses" (see Section 2.a.).

<P>

<B>b.   Disappearance</B>  

<P>

No reliable information is available on the number of

disappearances.  In the period immediately following arrest, many

detainees are held incommunicado.

<P>

In early November, Faraj Sarkuhi, a magazine editor who had been

critical of the Government, disappeared while traveling to

Germany where his wife and children reside.  His wife accused the

Government of abducting him in Tehran.  Sarkuhi reappeared in

late December and held a press conference at the Tehran airport

where he said that he had been in Germany but had not contacted

his wife, with whom he was having problems.  The German

Government stated that he had not entered Germany, and the press

speculated that the Government had forced Sarkuhi to give a false

account of his whereabouts.

<P>

<b>c.   Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment

or Punishment</b>

<P>

Credible reports indicate that security forces continue to

torture detainees and prisoners.  Common methods include

suspension for long periods in contorted positions, burning with

cigarettes, and, most frequently, severe and repeated beatings

with cables or other instruments on the back and on the soles of

the feet.  A new law entered into force on July 10 that

reinforces Islamic punishments such as flogging, stoning,

amputations, and public executions.  Two persons were stoned to

death, while two others were executed after receiving lashes.

<P>

Prison conditions are harsh.  Some prisoners are held in solitary

confinement or denied adequate rations or medical care in order

to force confessions.  Female prisoners have reportedly been

raped or otherwise tortured while in detention.  In the past,

prison guards have intimidated the family members of detainees

and have sometimes tortured detainees in their presence.  The

UNHRC Special Rapporteur met privately with detainee Abbas Amir

Entezam, a former deputy minister in the government of Prime

Minister Mehdi Bazargan.  Amir Entezam reported that the

conditions in Evin prison improved after 1989, but that political

prisoners were still housed with violent criminals and denied

regular family visits.  Some prisoners, who met with former U.N.

Special Representative Galindo Pohl during his last visit in

1991, complained of reprisals.  Amir Entezam claimed that he was

beaten so extensively that he lost the hearing in his left ear.

<P>

The Government does not permit unrestricted to imprisoned

dissidents by human rights monitors.  The U.N. Special Rapporteur

was not able to see all the dissidents he asked to see.

<P>

In September 1994, the International Committee of the Red Cross

(ICRC) issued a report on "unresolved humanitarian issues" from

the Iran-Iraq war.  The ICRC noted that the Government failed to

identify combatants killed in action and failed to exchange

information on those killed or missing.  The report criticized

the Government for obstructing ICRC efforts to register and

repatriate prisoners of war.  Throughout 1996 the Governments of

Iran and Iraq made little progress in resolving the issue of

those missing in action.

<P>

<b>d.   Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile  </b>

<P>

Although the Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and

detention, there is reportedly no legal time limit on

incommunicado detention, nor any judicial means to determine the

legality of detention.  Suspects may be held for questioning in

jails or in local Revolutionary Guard offices.

<P>

The security forces often do not inform family members of a

prisoner's welfare and location.  Even if these circumstances are

known, the prisoner still may be denied visits by family and

legal counsel.  In addition, families of executed prisoners do

not always receive notification of the prisoner's death.  Those

that do receive such information may be forced to pay the

Government to retrieve the body of their relative.

<P>

Although the Government claimed to have released Abbas Amir

Entezam early in 1996, he is still detained.  Initially arrested

in 1979 on charges of espionage and condemned to life in prison,

he is now held in a "security house."  

<P>

Adherents of the Baha'i faith continue to face arbitrary arrest

and detention.  The Government appears to adhere to a practice of

detaining a small number of Baha'is at any time.

<P>

The Government does not use forced exile, but many dissidents

leave Iran because they feel threatened.

<P>

<b>e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial</b>

<P>

The traditional court system is not independent and is subject to

government and religious influence.

<P>

Iran has two court systems:  The traditional courts,  which

adjudicate civil and criminal offenses; and the Islamic

Revolutionary Courts, established in 1979 to try political

offenses, narcotics crimes, and "crimes against God."

<P>

Many aspects of the prerevolution judicial system survive in the

civil and criminal courts.  For example defendants have the right

to a public trial, may choose their own lawyer, and have the

right of appeal.  Trials are adjudicated by panels of judges. 

There is no jury system.  In the absence of postrevolution laws,

the Government advises judges to base their decisions on Islamic

law.  These courts are not independent.  The Revolutionary Courts

may consider cases normally in the jurisdiction of the civil and

criminal courts, and also may overturn their decisions. 

Assignment of cases to either system of courts appears haphazard.



The Supreme Court has limited authority to review cases.

<P>

Trials in the Revolutionary Courts are not fair.  Often, pretrial

detention is prolonged and defendants lack access to attorneys. 

When legal help is available, attorneys are rarely given time to

prepare an effective defense.  Indictments are often for vague

offenses such as "antirevolutionary behavior," "moral

corruption," and "siding with global arrogance."  Defendants do

not have the right to confront their accusers or to appeal. 

Secret or summary trials of 5 minutes are common.  Others are

show trials intended to highlight a coerced public confession.

<P>

The Government often charges members of religious minorities with

crimes rather than apostasy.  Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the head

of the judiciary, stated in May that Baha'ism was an espionage

organization rather than a religion.  On February 18, the Iranian

court confirmed death sentences for two Baha'is, Kayvan

Khalajabadi and Bihnam Mithaqi.  When they were sentenced in

1993, an Iranian member of the U.N. Human Rights Commission

stated that they were sentenced to death not because they were

Baha'is, but because they were spies (see Sections 2.c. and 5). 

In July a Muslim convert to Christianity was arrested on charges

of espionage (see Section 2.c.).

<P>

In 1995 the Government began implementing a law authorizing

judges to act as prosecutor and judge in the same case.  The

rights of defendants are further eroded by the fact that many

judges retired after the revolution, and others were disbarred

for ideological reasons.  The Government has replaced them with

judges who are regarded as politically acceptable to the regime. 

The law's effect was clear to the U.N. Special Rapporteur when he

viewed a 45-minute session of a trial.  He wrote in his report: 

"The judge was clearly not a neutral third party between the

prosecution and the defense."

<P>

In June the Government requested technical assistance in training

judges and administering prisons from the UNHCR, and from the

U.N. Crime Prevention and Justice Branch.

<P>

No estimates are available on the number of political prisoners. 

However, the Government often arrests persons on questionable

criminal charges, usually drug trafficking or espionage, when

their actual "offenses" are political.  In October 1994, the U.N.

Special Rapporteur issued a report that noted that he had

requested the Government to provide information on 78 reported

political prisoners.

<P>

<b>f.   Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or 

Correspondence</b>  

<P>

The Constitution states that "reputation, life, property, (and)

dwelling(s)" are protected from trespass except as "provided by

law."  However, security forces enter homes and offices, monitor

telephone conversations, and open mail without court

authorization.

<P>

Paramilitary volunteer forces, including the basijis and

hizbollahis, and other security forces monitor the social

activities of citizens.  Such organizations may harass or arrest

women whose clothing does not cover the hair and all of the body

except the hands and face, or those who wear makeup.  Enforcement

varies with the political climate and the jurisdiction.

<P>

There were increasing reports of hizbollahi violence.  Incidents

included attacks on young people believed to be too foreign in

their dress or activities.  Reports indicate that the hizbollahi

more frequently invaded private homes and intervened on the

streets.  They also disrupted memorial services for prominent

literary figures.  There are reports of several deaths resulting

from these incidents.  There have been other reports that

hizbollahi or basiji question and abuse unmarried couples.  

Women have also been beaten if caught without proper clothing in

public or in private houses when men are present.

<P>

In the past, prison guards have intimidated family members of

detainees (see Section 1.c.).  Iranian opposition figures living

abroad have reported harassment of their relatives in Iran.

<P>

<B>Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties,</B> 

<P>

Including:  

<P>

<B>a.   Freedom of Speech and Press</B>  

<P>

The Constitution provides for the freedom of the press, except

when published ideas are "contrary to Islamic principles, or are

detrimental to public rights."  In practice the Government

restricts freedom of speech and the press.  The Government exerts

strong control over most media, particularly publications.  Some

newspapers are associated with factions in the Government.  They

reflect different views and criticize the Government, but are

prohibited from criticizing the concept of Islamic government or

promoting the rights of ethnic minorities.

<P>

The U.N. Special Representative for Freedom of Opinion and

Expression, Abid Hussain, visited Iran from January 6 to 10.  He

reported significant problems:  The strong connection between

adherence to the Government's version of Islam and the right to

freedom of opinion and expression.  He noted that the vagueness

of criteria determining what forms of expression are allowable

under Islamic law hampers free expression and also reported

limits on women's right to free expression.  He pointed out that

the Government "generally fails to condemn strongly and

unequivocally" both threats and the use of violence "by irregular

groups of private persons against professionals in the field of

information."  He expressed concern that prominent members of the

Government defend and encourage the hizbollahi in these attacks,

and that no court cases have been brought against the hizbollahi.

<P>

The Government continued its heavy-handed censorship of the

press.  Iranian publisher and writer Abdolkarim Soroush again

left Iran after continuing harassment by the Government and

hizbollahi.  In May a band of hizbollahi prevented Soroush from

speaking at Amir Kabir University in Tehran.

<P>

Another influential writer, Abbas Maroufi, publisher of the now

defunct magazine, Gardoun, was sentenced to 35 lashes and 6

months in prison for "publishing lies" after printing a survey

stating that many Iranians are psychologically depressed.  He was

also convicted of "insulting the Leader of the Islamic Republic"

for publishing an article comparing the Shah and Ayatollah

Khamenei.

<P>

In January publisher Abolghassem Golbaf of the monthly magazine,

Gouzarish, was sentenced to 3 months in prison for publishing a

negative story on a state-owned fertilizer company.  Under the

press law, only the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance may

bring cases against a publisher or writer; however, the case

against Golbaf was brought by the Minister of Agriculture.

<P>

The U.N. Special Rapporteur reported that several newspapers were

closed by the authorities, and that the editor of Kinyan, a

publication critical of government policies, was charged with

publishing false information and "weakening the foundation of the

Islamic Republic."

<P>

The Special Rapporteur also reported that the authorities broke

up an informal gathering of writers protesting the intolerant

atmosphere, threatening that if such meetings were held again,

those involved would be detained.

<P>

The Government owns all broadcasting facilities, and their

programming reflects its political and socio-religious ideology. 

In the fall, a new television program "Hovigat" (Identity) was

launched.  The program's apparent aim is to categorize targeted

intellectuals as social misfits or foreign spies.

<P>

Government censorship extends to the film industry.  Any cinema

showing films not considered acceptable is vulnerable to

hizbollahi attacks.  In early June, a group of hizbollahi

attacked the audience and employees of the Qods cinema because it

played a movie in which a man appeared in women's clothing. 

Several persons were reported injured, including a pregnant

woman.

<P>

The Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance is also charged with

ensuring that books do not contain offensive material prior to

publication.  The Ministry inspects foreign printed materials

prior to their release on the market.  However, some books and

pamphlets critical of the Government are published without

reprisal.

<P>

The Government made no effort to repudiate the 1989 religious

decree condemning to death British author Salman Rushdie for his

book, "The Satanic Verses," which the Government considers

blasphemous.  Nor did the Government move to repudiate its

promise of a cash award to any person who kills Rushdie or anyone

associated with publishing his book.  According to press reports,

senior government officials declared that the Government would

not take steps to enforce the decree.  However, Ayatollah Yazdi,

head of the Iranian judiciary, stated that the decree "applies to

all Muslims and would eventually be carried out one day."

<P>

In the fall the authorities began rigorously enforcing the ban on

satellite dishes.  Many were seized and others were removed and

hidden by their owners.  The press speculated that the crackdown

was related to the debut of a television program featuring

popular Iranian performers that was broadcast by the Voice of

America.

<P>

Academic censorship persists.  In his interim report the UNHRC

Special Representative noted the existence of a campaign to bring

about the "Islamization of the universities," which seemed to be

a movement to purge persons "who fight against the sanctities of

the Islamic system."  The deputy Dean of the law school at the

University of Tehran, Dr. Javad Tabatabai, was dismissed after

criticizing a 1994 law reorganizing the country's court system.

<P>

Government informers are said to be common on university campuses

and monitor classroom material.  Admission to universities is

politicized; all applicants must pass "character tests" in which

officials screen out applicants critical of the Government's

ideology.  To achieve tenure, professors must cooperate with

government authorities over a period of years.

<P>

<B>b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association</B>  

<P>

The Constitution permits assemblies and marches "provided they do

not violate the principles of Islam."  In practice, the

Government restricts freedom of assembly.  Oppositionists tried

to hold press conferences about the election on January 2 and

again on January 31.  The police broke up both meetings, first

claiming they could not guarantee security for the event and then

stating that the conference was sponsored by an illegal

organization.  The UNHCR Special Rapporteur also noted the

tendency of government police and military forces not to

intervene when unofficial groups attempted to break up opposition

or cultural gatherings.  The press reported significant

antigovernment unrest in the western city of Kermanshah following

the death of a Kurdish Sunni Muslim cleric in early December. 

Protests over the next week were violently suppressed by security

forces, resulting in several deaths, many persons injured, and

perhaps hundreds arrested.

<P>

The Constitution provides for the establishment of political

parties, professional associations, and religious groups provided

that they do not violate the principles of "freedom, sovereignty,

and national unity," or question Islam or the Islamic Republic. 

In practice, most independent organizations are banned, co-opted

by the Government, or moribund.

<P>

In 1995 the Ministry of Interior refused to grant a license to

the Freedom Movement, a political group founded in 1961 and

declared illegal in 1991.  The Ministry decision effectively

precluded the party from participating in the March Majles

elections.  No major opposition faction was represented in the

elections.  In the northwestern city of Bonab, demonstrations

against the Government's handling of the elections were forcibly

broken up, resulting in the deaths of a number of persons.

<P>

<B>c.   Freedom of Religion</B>

<P>

The Constitution declares that the "official religion of Iran is

Islam and the sect followed is Ja'fari Shi'ism."  It also states

that "other Islamic denominations shall enjoy complete respect." 

However, the Government restricts freedom of religion.  The

Government is profoundly influenced by Shi'a Islam.  The

President and many top officials, including the Speaker of the

Parliament and many parliamentary deputies, are Shi'a clergymen.

<P>

Approximately 90 percent of the population are Shi'a Muslims. 

Aside from slightly over 1 percent who are not Muslims, the rest

of the population are Sunni Muslims, drawn largely from Kurdish,

Arab, Turkoman, Baluchi, and other ethnic minorities.

<P>

The Constitution also recognizes Christianity, Judaism, and

Zoroastrianism.  Members of these religions elect representatives

to reserved Parliamentary seats.  They are free to practice their

religion and instruct their children, but the Government

interferes with the administration of their schools. Harassment

by government officials is common (see Section 5).

<P>

Non-Muslims may not proselytize Muslims.  Oppression of

evangelical Christians increased in 1996.  In early July, a

Muslim convert, Shahram Sepehri-Fard, was arrested on charges of

having "sensitive information."  He has been denied visitors

since shortly after his arrest, and his condition is unknown. In

late September, another Muslim convert to evangelical

Christianity, Pastor Mohammed Yussefi (also known as Ravanbaksh),

was reportedly murdered by authorities.  Yussefi had been

imprisoned by the Government on several occasions prior to his

death.  Three members of the opposition movement

Mojahadin-e-Khaleq (MEK), Farohnaz Anami, Betoul Vaferi Kalateh,

and Maryam Shahbazpoor, are currently in prison for the 1994

murder of Reverend Tatavous Michaelian, an evangelical Protestant

pastor.  The three women claim that two other Christian pastors

murdered in 1994, Reverend Mehdi Dibaj and Reverend Haik

Hovsepian Mehr, were also killed by the MEK.

<P>

The Government regards the Baha'i community, the largest

non-Muslim minority with 300,000 to 350,000 members, as a

"misguided sect."  It prohibits Baha'is from teaching and

practicing their faith or maintaining links with coreligionists

abroad.  Recently, Baha'i youth have been denied admittance to

the fourth year of high school.  Universities continue to deny

admittance to Baha'i students.  In addition, Baha'i are regularly

denied compensation for injury or criminal victimization. 

Government authorities claim that only Muslim plaintiffs are

eligible for compensation.

<P>

In October 1993, the Majles approved legislation that prohibits

government workers from membership in groups that deny the 

"divine religions."  The Government uses such terminology to

describe members of the Baha'i faith.  The law also stipulates

penalties for government workers who do not observe "Islamic

principles and rules."

<P>

<B>d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, 

Emigration, and Repatriation</B>  

<P>

Citizens may travel to any part of Iran, although there have been

restrictions on travel to Kurdish areas during times of heavy

fighting.  People may change their place of residence without

obtaining official permission.  The Government requires exit

permits for draft-age males and citizens who are politically

suspect.  Some Iranians, particularly those whose skills are in

short supply and who were educated at government expense, must

post bonds to obtain exit permits.

<P>

The Government permits Iranian Jews to travel abroad, but often

denies them the multiple-exit permits normally issued to other

citizens.  The Government does not normally permit all members of

a Jewish family to travel abroad at the same time.

<P>

The Government and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees

(UNHCR) estimate that there are approximately 1.3 million Afghan

refugees in Iran.  Of this total, only about 21,800 are

accommodated in refugee camps administered by the Government. 

The rest live seminomadic lives or reside in settlements.  In

1996 about 10,000 refugees repatriated to Afghanistan.  This was

far fewer than the UNHCR had predicted would return and resulted

from continued instability in Taliban-controlled areas of

Afghanistan.

<P>

The UNHCR estimates that there are about 580,000 Iraqi Kurdish

and Shi'a Muslim refugees in Iran who were displaced by the Gulf

War.  In September an additional 65,000 Iraqi Kurdish refugees

fled to Iran following the eruption of fighting between two

Kurdish factions in northern Iraq.  Since the cessation of

fighting in October, the majority of this most recent wave of

refugees has returned to Iraq.

<P>

The Government generally cooperates with the UNHCR and other

humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.  Iran is a

signatory to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of

Refugees and its 1967 U.N. Protocol.  Although the Government

generally provides first asylum (as demonstrated by the large

number of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Iran), there have been

instances where pressure was applied to force refugees to return

to their home countries.  In late 1996, the Government hastened

the return of many recently arrived Iraqi Kurdish refugees by

depriving them of adequate food and other relief.  The UNHCR

protested this policy of forced repatriation to the Government.

<A HREF="#index">Return to Index</A></CENTER>

<P>

<B>Section 3 Respect for Political Rights:</B> <P>

<B>The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government</B>

<P>

The right of citizens to change their government is severely

compromised by the leadership of the Government, which

effectively manipulates the electoral system to its advantage. 

Iran is ruled by a group of religious leaders and their lay

associates who share a belief in the legitimacy of a theocratic

state based on Ayatollah Khomeini's interpretation of Shi'a

Islam.  There is no separation of state and religion.  The

clerics dominate all branches of government.  The Government

represses any movement seeking to separate state and religion, or

to alter the State's existing theocratic foundation.  The

selection of candidates for elections is effectively controlled

by the ruling clerics.

<P>

The Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians composed of

six Islamic clergymen and six lay members who review all laws for

consistency with Islamic law and the Constitution.  The Council

also screens political candidates for ideological and religious

suitability.  It accepts only candidates who support a theocratic

state, but clerics who disagree with government policies have

also been disqualified.

<P>

Regularly scheduled elections are held for the President, members

of Parliament (the Majles), and members of the Assembly of

Experts, a body responsible for selecting the successor to the

Leader of the Revolution.  The Majles exercises a considerable

amount of independence from the executive branch, but its

decisions are reviewed by the Council of Guardians.  Vigorous

parliamentary debates take place on various issues, and in some

cases the Majles has respected laws proposed by the executive

branch.  Most deputies are associated with powerful political and

religious officials, but often vote independently and shift from

one faction to another.

<P>

Majles elections in the spring were marred by government control

and violence.  Preelection debate was vigorous, but the Council

of Guardians succeeded in controlling the elections by

selectively approving candidates.  Human Rights Watch (HRW) 

estimated that the Government disqualified about 44 percent of

the 5,121 prospective candidates, including 32 sitting members of

the Majles.  The criteria for vetting candidates was vague; the

Council did not have to give a reason for rejection; and there

was no right of appeal.  The U.N. Special Rapporteur noted a

number of irregularities in the elections, in particular the

nullification of election results in eight jurisdictions

apparently on ideological grounds.  Most of the candidates

disqualified were pragmatists rather than conservative

candidates.

<P>

Human Rights Watch received reports indicating that riot police

opened fire on demonstrators protesting government interference

in the northwestern city of Bonab during voting on March 8.  On

April 6, the Government annulled election results in Isfahan,

Malayer, Najafabad, Naeen, Miandoab, Meimeh, Borkhar, and

Khomeini Shahre.  New elections for these constituencies were to

be held after 5 months but they did not materialize.  On April

19, runoff elections took place for 125 seats.

<P>

Women are underrepresented in government.  They hold only 9 of

270 Majles seats, and there are no female cabinet members.

<HR>

<CENTER><B><A NAME="4">HUMAN RIGHTS INVESTIGATION</A></B><BR>

<A HREF="#index">Return to Index</A></CENTER>

<P>

<B>Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and

Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human

Rights</B>

<P>

In 1996 the Government continued to repress local human rights

groups, but it was more cooperative with foreign groups.  The

U.N. Special Representatives on Human Rights in Iran, Freedom of

Expression, and Religious Freedom visited Iran.  In addition

Human Rights Watch sent a representative.  All reported

reasonably good cooperation from the Government, but all found

continuing serious abuses of human rights.  The ICRC and the

UNHCR both operate in Iran.

<P>

The Government established a human rights committee in the Majles

and a human rights commission in the judiciary, but observers

believe that they lack independence.  Government officials

regularly assert that Iran should be judged by Islamic, rather

than Western, human rights principles, and reject the

universality of human rights.

<P>

<HR>

<CENTER><B><A NAME="5">DISCRIMINATION</A></B><BR><A

HREF="#index">Return to Index</A></CENTER>

<p>

<B>Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,

Disability, Language, or Social Status</B>

<P>

In general the Government does not discriminate on the basis of

race, disability, language, or social status.  The Government

does discriminate on the basis of religion and sex.<P>

<B>Women</B>

<P>

Although domestic violence is known to occur, little is known

about its extent.  Abuse in the family is considered a private

matter and seldom discussed publicly.  There are no official

statistics on the subject.

<P>

Discrimination against women has increased since the revolution. 

In general women suffer discrimination in the legal code,

particularly in family and property matters.  It is difficult for

many women, particularly those residing outside large cities, to

obtain any legal redress.  Under the legal system, a woman's

testimony as a witness is worth only half that of a man's, making

it difficult for a woman to prove a case against a male

defendant.  In addition the families of female victims of violent

crime often have to pay the assailant's court costs to bring him

to trial.  Although women may be educated and employed in the

professions, social constraints tend to inhibit their educational

and economic opportunities.  Illiteracy and the lack of

university degrees also affect their standing.  The enforcement

of conservative Islamic dress codes has varied considerably since

the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989.  Nonetheless, such dress

codes persist and are enforced arbitrarily.

<P>

Under legislation passed in 1983, women have the right to

divorce, and regulations promulgated in 1984 substantially

broadened the grounds on which a woman may seek a divorce. 

However, a husband is not required to cite a reason for divorcing

his wife.  In 1986 the Majles passed a 12-article law on marriage

and divorce that limited the privileges accorded to men by custom

and traditional interpretations of Islamic law.  The 1986 law

also recognized divorced women's rights to a share of the

property that couples acquire during their marriage and increased

alimony rights.

<P>

In June the Government requested the U.N. High Commissioner for

Human Rights to "render advisory services to the nongovernmental

organization (NGO) network on women existing in the country,"

according to the U.N. Special Representative.

<P>

In 1995 the Government permitted women to attain the rank of

judges.  But the Government does not permit female judges to

preside over legal hearings, so the practical effect of the

change in the law remains unclear.  Women's activities can be

severely restricted by the hizbollahi as well.

<P>

<B>Children</B>

<P>

Most children have access to education through the 12th grade,

and to some form of health care.  There is no known pattern of

child abuse.

<P>

<B>People with Disabilities</B>

<P>

There is no available information regarding whether the

Government has legislated or otherwise mandated accessibility for

the disabled.  The Cable News Network (CNN) reported, however, in

late October on the harsh conditions in an institution for

retarded children who had been abandoned by their parents.  The

film showed children tied or chained to their beds, in filthy

conditions, without appropriate care.  It is not known to what

extent this represents the typical treatment of the disabled

Iran.

<P>

<B>National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities</B>

<P>

The Kurds seek greater autonomy and continue to suffer from

government discrimination.<P>

<B>Religious Minorities</B>  

<P>

The Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Baha'i minorities suffer

varying degrees of officially sanctioned discrimination,

particularly in the areas of employment, education, and public

accommodations (see Section 2.d.).  Muslims who convert to

Christianity also suffer discrimination.

<P>

University applicants are required to pass an examination in

Islamic theology.  Although public-school students receive

instruction in Islam, this requirement limits the access of most

religious minorities to higher education.  Applicants for

public-sector employment are similarly screened for their

adherence to Islam.

<P>

Religious minorities suffer discrimination in the legal system,

receiving lower awards in injury and death lawsuits, and

incurring heavier punishments than Muslims.  Sunni Muslims

encounter religious discrimination at the local level.

<P>

In 1993 the U.N. Special Representative reported the existence of

a government policy directive on the Baha'is.  According to the

directive, the Supreme Revolutionary Council reportedly

instructed government agencies to block the progress and

development of the Baha'i community; expel Baha'i students from

universities; cut the Baha'is' links with groups outside Iran;

restrict the employment of Baha'is; and deny Baha'is "positions

of influence," including those in education.  The Government

claims that the directive is a forgery.  However, it appears to

be an accurate reflection of current government practice.

<P>

The persecution of Baha'is persisted in 1996.  The Government

continued to return some property previously confiscated from

individual Baha'is, although the amount returned is a fraction of

the total seized.  Property belonging to the Baha'i community as

a whole, however, such as places of worship, remains 

confiscated.  Other government restrictions have been eased, so

that Baha'is may currently obtain food ration booklets and send

their children to public schools.  However, the prohibition

against the admission of Baha'is to universities appears to be

enforced.  Thousands of Baha'is dismissed from government jobs in

the early 1980's receive no unemployment benefits and have been

required to repay the Government for salaries or pensions

received from the first day of employment.  Those unable to do so

face prison sentences (see Sections 1.d. and 5).

<CENTER><B><A NAME="6">WORKER RIGHTS</A></B><BR>

<A HREF="#index">Return to Index</A></CENTER>

<P>

<B>Section 6 Worker Rights</B>

<P>

<B>a. The Right of Association</B>

<P>

Although the Labor Code grants workers the right to establish

unions, there are no independent unions.  A national organization

known as the Worker's House, founded in 1982, is the sole

authorized national labor organization.  It serves primarily as a

conduit for government control.  The leadership of the Worker's

House coordinates activities with Islamic labor councils, which

are organized in many enterprises.  These councils also function

as instruments of government control, although they have

frequently been able to block layoffs and dismissals.  Moreover,

a network of government-backed guilds issues vocational licenses,

funds financial cooperatives, and helps workers find jobs.

<P>

The Government does not tolerate any strike deemed to be at odds

with its economic and labor policies.  In 1993 the Parliament

passed a law that prohibits strikes by government workers.  It

also prohibits government workers from having contacts with

foreigners and stipulates penalties for failure to observe

Islamic dress codes and principles at work.

<P>

There are no known affiliations with international labor

organizations.

<P>

<b>b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively</b>

<P>

Workers do not have the right to organize independently and

negotiate collective bargaining agreements.  No information is

available on mechanisms used to set wages.

<P>

It is not known whether labor legislation and practice in the

export processing zones differ from the law and practice in the

rest of the country.

<P>

<B>c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor</B> 

<P>

The Penal Code provides that the Government may require any

person who does not have work to take suitable employment.  This

provision has been criticized frequently by the International

Labor Organization (ILO) as contravening ILO Convention 29 on

forced labor.

<P>

<B>d.   Minimum Age for Employment of Children  </B>

<P>

The labor law prohibits employment of minors under 15 years of

age and places special restrictions on the employment of minors

under age 18.  Education is compulsory until age 11.  The law

permits children to work in agriculture, domestic service, and

some small businesses.  By law women and minors may not be

employed in hard labor or, in general, in night work. 

Information on the extent to which these regulations are enforced

is not available.

<P>

<B>e.   Acceptable Conditions of Work</B>

<P>

The Labor Code empowers the Supreme Labor Council to establish

annual minimum wage levels for each industrial sector and region.



It is not known if the minimum wages are adjusted annually or

enforced.  The Labor Code stipulates that the minimum wage should

be sufficient to meet the living expenses of a family and should

take inflation into account.  Many middle-class citizens must

work two or even three jobs to support their families.  It is

unlikely that minimum wage laws alone can ensure a decent

standard of living for a worker and family, given current

economic conditions in Iran

<P>

Information on the share of the working population covered by

minimum wage legislation is not available.

<P>

According to press reports, the Ministry of Labor in early

December announced that employers had 1 month in which to fire

foreign workers and replace them with Iranians.  It is believed

that approximately 1 million foreign workers, mostly Afghan

refugees, would be affected.  The Government apparently hoped to

alleviate high unemployment by pressuring foreigners to leave.

<P>

The Labor Code establishes a 6-day workweek of 48 hours maximum,

with 1 weekly rest day, normally Fridays, and at least 12 days of

paid annual leave and several paid public holidays.

<P>

According to the Labor Code, a Supreme Safety Council, chaired by

the Labor Minister or his representative, is responsible for

promoting workplace safety and health.  The Council has

reportedly issued 28 safety directives, and oversees the

activities of 3,000 safety committees established in enterprises

employing more than 10 persons.  It is not known how well the

Ministry's inspectors enforce regulations.  It is not known

whether workers can remove themselves from hazardous situations

without risking the loss of employment.

<p>
A White House Fact Sheet says the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of
1996 imposes new sanctions on foreign companies that engage in
specified economic transactions with Iran or Libya.
<P>
The bill sanctions foreign companies that provide new investments
over $40 million for the development of petroleum resources in
Iran or Libya.
<P>
The bill also sanctions foreign companies that violate existing
U.N. prohibitions against trade with Libya in certain goods and
services such as arms, certain oil equipment, and civil aviation
services.
<P>
Following is official text of Fact Sheet from the White House:
<P>
(begin text)
<P>
FACT SHEET:  THE IRAN AND LIBYA SANCTIONS ACT OF 1996
<P>
President Clinton has led the fight against terrorism and will
continue to take measures to further pressure and punish states
that support it.
<P>
Purpose: The Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 imposes new
sanctions on foreign companies that engage in specified economic
transactions with Iran or Libya. It is intended to:
<ul>
<li>Help deny Iran and Libya revenues that could be used to
finance international terrorism;

<li>Limit the flow of resources necessary to obtain weapons of
mass destruction; and,

<li>Put pressure on Libya to comply with U.N. resolutions that,
among other things, call for Libya to extradite for trial the
accused perpetrators of the Pan Am 103 bombing.

The Sanctions: The bill sanctions foreign companies that provide
new investments over $40 million for the development of petroleum
resources in Iran or Libya. The bill also sanctions foreign
companies that violate existing U.N. prohibitions against trade
with Libya in certain goods and services such as arms, certain
oil equipment, and civil aviation services. If a violation
occurs, President Clinton is to impose two out of seven possible
sanctions against the violating company. These sanctions include:

<li>denial of Export-Import Bank assistance;

<li>denial of export licenses for exports to the violating
company;

<li>prohibition on loans or credits from U.S. financial
institutions of over $10 million in any 12-month period;

<li>prohibition on designation as a primary dealer for U.S.
government debt instruments;

<li>prohibition on serving as an agent of the United States or as
a repository for U.S. government funds;

<li>denial of U.S. government procurement opportunities
(consistent with WTO obligations); and

<li>a ban on all or some imports of the violating company.
</UL><P>

This Bill is Another Step in U.S. Efforts to Enforce Compliance:
<UL>
<li>prohibition on serving as an agent of the United States or as
a repository for U.S. government funds;

<li>denial of U.S. government procurement opportunities
(consistent with WTO obligations); and

<li>a ban on all or some imports of the violating company.
</UL><P>
This Bill is Another Step in U.S. Efforts to Enforce Compliance
from Iran and Libya:
<UL>
<li>In 1984, Iran was placed on the list of states that support
international terrorism, triggering statutory sanctions that
prohibit weapons sales, oppose all loans to Iran from
international financial institutions, and prohibit all assistance
to Iran.

<li>In 1987, the U.S. further prohibited the importation of any
goods or services from Iran and U.S. naval and air forces struck
Iranian naval units on several occasions in response to Iranian
efforts to disrupt the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf with
naval mines and missile attacks.

<li>In 1995, President Clinton imposed comprehensive sanctions on
Iran, prohibiting all commercial and financial transactions with
Iran.

<li>In January 1986, the United States imposed comprehensive
sanctions against Libya that froze Libyan assets, and banned all
trade and financial dealings with Libya. Two months later, U.S.
Air Force and Navy jets bombed Libyan targets in retaliation for
Libyan terrorist attacks on Americans in Europe.

<li>In March 1992, the U.S. supported the imposition of sanction
against Libya which prohibited the export of petroleum, military
or aviation equipment to Libya; prohibited commercial flights to
or from Libya; limited Libyan diplomatic representation abroad;
and restricted Libyan financial activities.

<li>In addition, the United States has worked with our allies to
further isolate Libya both internationally and within the Middle
East and to develop new methods to pressure Qadhafi to comply
with the U.N. Security Council Resolutions directed at Libya.

<CENTER><B><H2>Ambassador David C. Litt's statement<br>
before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations<br>
at his nomination hearing for Ambassador<br>
to the United Arab Emirates<br>
June 20, 1995</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am honored to appear
before you today to discuss my nomination to become the U.S.
Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates.  I wish to express my
deepest appreciation to President Clinton and Secretary
Christopher
for their confidence in my abilities to represent the United
States
in the UAE.
<P>
Mr. Chairman, for decades the Persian Gulf has occupied a
strategic
place in United States foreign policy.  The Gulf has all too
often
been a flashpoint threatening vital U.S. interests, but it also
has
been a source of opportunities for American commerce.  In both
cases, effective diplomacy is the front line weapon of choice in
defending U.S. interests. have had the privilege throughout much
of
my career to be part of our diplomatic team that has focussed on
that region.
<P>
It is a further privilege to be nominated to serve in a country
that offers promise to be of substantial support for America's
policies in the Middle East.  If confirmed, it is my intention to
promote to the fullest extent of my abilities our key interests:
building and maintaining an effective security relationship with
the UAE government, maintaining open access for American
corporations to the business opportunities that are blossoming in
the UAE as well as promoting American products over those of our
competitors, and seeking effective support from the UAE
government
for our policies in the Gulf region and toward the Middle East
peace process.
<P>
With these ambitions in mind, I am ready to meet the challenge
that
lies ahead.  I do not accept this commitment lightly, nor do I
undervalue the difficulties that may arise.  The threats to peace
and stability are many, and I have been actively involved in
combatting some of them from Washington.  With your support I
look
forward to contributing to our joint efforts to strengthen
American
policy in the Gulf region.

<PRE>                             THE WHITE HOUSE
                      OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT
                    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE            

CONTACT: 202-456-7036
Wednesday, March 1, 1995


     Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and I have just signed a Statement of Intent to form
the U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission.  By doing so, we launch a new era in
partnership between our two democracies.  This Commission will facilitate cooperation so we
can move together in important areas of cooperation: business development, conservation and
environment, energy development, human resources development and education,  science and
technology.  The agreement calls for semi-annual Commission meetings to ensure bilateral
efforts in these key areas moving ahead expeditiously throughout the year.  The next
Commission meeting will be held in South Africa to assess progress made over the next six
months and to set the agenda for future undertakings of the Commission.  Some of the
initiatives include:

     -    Business Development Committee, co-chaired by Commerce Secretary Ron
          Brown, held its inaugural meeting last September.  The Committee reviewed
          plans for its next full meeting in May in Cape Town, South Africa.

     -    Secretary Brown also announced plans for a commercial law seminar scheduled
          also scheduled for May in South Africa.

     -    Conservation and Environment Committee, co-chaired by Interior Secretary
          Babbitt, will support South Africa's successful wildlife management as a model
          of sustainable development of wildlife resources for the rest of Africa.  South
          Africa will also be brought into the GLOBE initiative.

     -    Energy Development Committee, co-chaired by Energy Secretary Hazel
          O'Leary, will be looking at some initiative already under discussion with the
          South African Government, such as a Renewable Energy Rural Electrification
          Pilot Program, construction of a U.S. photovoltaic cell manufacturing plant in
          South Africa, and a program of scientific and technical exchange between U.S.
          and South African universities.

     -    Human Resources Development and Education Committee, co-chaired by U.S.
          Agency for International Development Administrator Brian Atwood is looking
          forward to discussing a number of initiatives with his South African
          counterpart, including: a Youth Employment Skills Program, the Mantelet
          Scholars Program for post-graduate economic studies, a Fulbright Program, and
          a Labor-Management Relations Program.

     -    The Science and Technology Committee, co-chaired by the President's Advisor
          for Science and Technology Policy John Gibbons and Dr. Ngubane, who is
          here today with Deputy President Mbeki will focus on completing negotiations
          for the Framework Agreement on Environment, Science and Technology
          Cooperation, cooperative programs in fields where South Africa has conducted
          world-class scientific research, and the creation of mentoring program using
          U.S. scientist and engineers.

     All the U.S. co-chairs are anxious to get to work with their South African counterparts
and they will be making plans for their committees to meet between now and the next full
Commission meeting in the fall.

     The importance of PVO's and the private sector can not be over emphasized and the
Commissions is a good vehicle to bring together the efforts of public, private sector and NGO
organizations.

Thank you all for coming.

<B><H2>IRAN AND LIBYA SANCTIONS ACT OF
1996<P><IMG SRC="footer.gif"><br>
PL 104-073</H2></CENTER>
<P>
An Act</B><br> 
To impose sanctions on persons making certain investments
directly and significantly contributing  to the enhancement of
the ability of Iran or Libya to develop its petroleum resources,
and on persons exporting certain items that enhance Libya's
weapons or aviation capabilities or enhance Libya's ability to
develop its petroleum resources, and for other purposes.
<br>
<i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of America in Congress
assembled,</i> 
<P>
<center><B>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</B></CENTER>
<p>
This Act may be cited as the `Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of
1996'.
<p>
<center><B>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</B></center>
<p>
The Congress makes the following findings:
<ol>
<li>The efforts of the Government of Iran to acquire weapons
of mass destruction and the means to deliver them and its
support of acts of international terrorism endanger the 
national security and foreign policy interests of the United
States and those countries with which the United States shares
common strategic and foreign policy objectives.
<li>The objective of preventing the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction and acts of international terrorism through
existing multilateral and bilateral initiatives requires
additional efforts to deny Iran the financial means to sustain
its nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile weapons programs.
<li>The Government of Iran uses its diplomatic facilities and
quasi-governmental institutions outside of Iran to promote acts
of international terrorism and assist its nuclear, chemical,
biological, and missile weapons programs.
<li>The failure of the Government of Libya to comply with
Resolutions 731, 748, and 883 of the Security Council of the
United Nations, its support of international terrorism, and its
efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction constitute a
threat to international peace and security that endangers the
national security and foreign policy interests of the United
States and those countries with which it shares common 
strategic and foreign policy objectives.
</ol>
<P>
<center><b> SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.</center></b>
<P>
(a) POLICY WITH RESPECT TO IRAN- The Congress declares that it is
the policy of the United States to deny Iran the ability to
support acts of international terrorism and to fund the

the means to deliver them by limiting the development of Iran's
ability to explore for, extract, refine, or transport by pipeline
petroleum resources of Iran.
<P>
(b) POLICY WITH RESPECT TO LIBYA- The Congress further declares
that it is the policy of the United States to seek full
compliance by Libya with its obligations under Resolutions 731,
748, and 883 of the Security Council of the United Nations,
including ending all support for acts of international terrorism
and efforts to develop or acquire weapons of mass destruction.

For Immediate Release	July 23, 1996 
</P>
<P>
United States-South Africa Binational Commission 
</P>
<P>
THE U.S. OVERSEAS PRIVATE INVESTMENT CORPORATION BACKS NEW FUND
TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore today announced that the federal Overseas
Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) is backing a new, $120
million fund that will make equity investments in South Africa
and other nations in the continent_s southern region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vice President made the announcement at a press conference
following the second full session of the United States-South
Africa Binational Commission that he co-chairs with South African
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.  
</P>
<P>
 	</P>
<P>
&quot;This OPIC-backed fund is a critical vehicle that will help
move needed investment capital into South Africa and other
southern African nations,&quot; said Ruth R. Harkin, President of
OPIC. &quot;Through agencies like OPIC, this Administration is
creating public-private partnerships that promote economic
development and opportunities around the world.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
	OPIC is an independent agency of the U.S. government that sells
financial services to American companies making long-term
investments in South Africa and other developing nations.
</P>
<P>
 	The $120 million fund, called the New Africa Opportunity Fund,
L.P., is backed with an OPIC investment guaranty and is being
privately managed by New Africa Advisors (NAA), a subsidiary of
the Durham, North Carolina-based Sloan Financial Group.  With
managed assets of more than $3.5 billion, Sloan is the largest
African-American owned investment firm in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The management team of NAA includes experienced investment
professionals located in Johannesburg, South Africa supported by
the Sloan organization in North Carolina.  NAA was the first U.S.
investment firm to locate an office in Johannesburg in 1992,
providing American investors access to African securities
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fund, one of 23 OPIC-backed investment funds, will focus on
the development of businesses which are owned by the region_s
majority population.  It is expected to increase the level of
U.S. goods and services flowing to southern Africa and to
generate significant regional economic development.  In addition,
the Fund will support the return to South Africa those American
companies that left during the boycott period.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to South Africa, the Fund will pursue investments in
ten other southern African countries including: Angola; Botswana;
Lesotho; Malawi; Mauritius; Mozambique; Namibia; Swaziland;
Zambia; and Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
	All investments made by OPIC-backed funds are reviewed to ensure
a positive impact on the U.S. economy and that the projects take
steps to protect the host country_s environment and respect
worker rights.  Supporting American business for 25 years, OPIC
is a self-sustaining federal agency that encourages private, U.S.
investment in some 140 developing nations worldwide. Since 1971,
OPIC has supported $84 billion worth of investments that will
generate $43 billion in U.S. exports and help to create and
support 200,000 jobs.

<p>
<br>
<b>Oscar Arias S&aacute;nchez</b> 
<p>
Oscar Arias S&aacute;nchez (1941-    ) wrote the first draft of
a plan
to bring peace and stability to strife-torn Central America in
September 1985, five months before his election as Costa Rica's
youngest president. The Arias plan set a date for cease-fires
between government and rebel forces, ensured amnesty for
political prisoners, and scheduled free and democratic elections
in Central American countries. In August 1987, at a summit of the
five Central American presidents held in Guatemala, Arias
persuaded the other four leaders to give peace a chance. His
efforts earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987. Arias now heads
the Arias Foundation for Peace and Humanity.
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>...Peace is not a matter of prizes or trophies. It
is not the
product of a victory or command. It has no finishing line, no
final deadline, no fixed definition of achievement.
<p>
Peace is a never-ending process, the work of many decisions by
many people in many countries. It is an attitude, a way of life,
a way of solving problems and resolving conflicts. It cannot be
forced on the smallest nation or enforced by the largest. It
cannot ignore our differences or overlook our common interests.
It requires us to work and live together.
<p>
Peace is not only a matter of noble words and Nobel lectures. We
have ample words, glorious words, inscribed in the charters of
the United Nations, the World Court, the Organization of American
States, and a network of international treaties and laws. We need
deeds that will respect those words, honor those commitments,
abide by those laws. We need to strengthen our institutions of
peace like the United Nations, making certain they are fully used
by the weak as well as the strong.
<p>
I pay no attention to those doubters and detractors unwilling to
believe that a lasting peace can be genuinely embraced by those
who march under a different ideological banner or those who are
more accustomed to cannons of war than to councils of peace.
<p>
We seek in Central America not peace alone, not peace to be
followed some day by political progress, but peace and democracy,
together, indivisible, an end to the shedding of human blood,
which is inseparable from an end to the suppression of human
rights.
<p>
We do not judge, much less condemn, any other nation's political
or ideological systems, freely chosen and never exported. We
cannot require sovereign states to conform to patterns of
government not of their own choosing. But we can and do insist
that every government respect those universal rights of man that
have meaning beyond national boundaries and ideological labels.
We believe that justice and peace can only thrive together, never
apart. A nation that mistreats its own citizens is more likely to
mistreat its neighbors....</I>

<b>Aung San Suu Kyi</b>
<p>
Aung San Suu Kyi (1945-    ), daughter of the late leader of the
Burmese nationalist movement, has gained prominence in her own
right as the leader of the pro-democracy movement in her home
country. The co-founder of Burma's National League for Democracy,
which has worked hard for civilian government in the country,
Aung San Suu Kyi has electrified Burma with her passionate
speeches for democracy and human rights. She was placed under
house arrest by her country's military rulers in July 1989, in
part to sideline her in advance of national elections. Aung San
Suu Kyi remained under house arrest for six years, during which
time her writings earned her an international reputation as a
staunch advocate of democracy as well as several awards, among
them, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
<p><blockquote><i>
...Among the basic freedoms to which men aspire that their lives
might be full and uncramped, freedom from fear stands out as both
a means and an end. A people who would build a nation in which
strong, democratic institutions are firmly established must first
learn to liberate their own minds from apathy and fear....
<p>
Fearlessness may be a gift, but perhaps more precious is the
courage acquired through endeavour, courage that comes from
cultivating the habit of refusing to let fear dictate one's
actions, courage that could be described as "grace under
pressure" -- grace which is renewed repeatedly in the face of
harsh, unremitting pressure.
<p>
Within a system which denies the existence of basic human rights,
fear tends to be the order of the day. Fear of imprisonment, fear
of torture, fear of death, fear of losing friends, family,
property, or means of livelihood, fear of poverty, fear of
isolation, fear of failure. A most insidious form of fear is that
which masquerades as common sense or even wisdom, condemning as
foolish, reckless, insignificant, or futile the small, daily acts
of courage which help to preserve man's self-respect and inherent
human dignity.
<p>
It is not easy for a people conditioned by fear, under the iron
rule of the principle that might is right, to free themselves
from the enervating miasma of fear. Yet even under the most
crushing state machinery, courage rises up again and again, for
fear is not the natural state of civilised man.
<p>
The wellspring of courage and endurance in the face of unbridled
power is generally a firm belief in the sanctity of ethical
principles combined with a historical sense that despite all
setbacks the condition of man is set on an ultimate course for
both spiritual and material advancement.
<p>
It is man's vision of a world fit for rational, civilised
humanity that leads him to dare and to suffer to build societies
free from want and fear. Concepts such as truth, justice, and
compassion cannot be dismissed as trite when these are often the
only bulwarks which stand against ruthless power.</i>

<b>Ralph Bunche</b>
<p>
Ralph Bunche (1904-1971) was an American diplomat and key member
of the United Nations for more than two decades. He was active in
preliminary planning for the United Nations and, in 1947, joined
the UN Secretariat as head of its Trusteeship Division. Later, as
UN Under-Secretary for Special Political Affairs, Bunche
negotiated a 1949 armistice agreement between warring Palestinian
Arabs and Jews. For his skill and perseverance in this effort, he
was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950. Bunche was also long
active in the struggle for civil rights and racial equality in
the United States. He was co-founder of the National Negro
Congress and a member of the board of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People for 22 years.
<p><blockquote><i>
...There may never be perfection in the relations among people or
in the operation of the mechanisms of democracy. But in democracy
the gap between ideal and practice must be constantly narrowed.
For democracy, to prosper, or even to live, must ever be dynamic.
It must move forward toward the goals of greater freedom, better
life, fuller dignity for the people it serves. Any backward step,
any encroachment upon the rights of democracy's citizens, any
violation of the dignity of the individual, any retreat in the
well-being of the people strikes at the virility of the ideal and
retards the course of human progress.
<p>
We in America not only have democracy, but we have built it on
unique foundations -- a union of peoples more diversified in
origin than any other society has ever known....
<p>
In the course of our great experiment, we have learned that it is
not necessary to eradicate differences, to achieve a single human
pattern, in order to enjoy democracy or to attain national unity.
Rather, we have found that it is only necessary for people to
change their attitudes and superstitions about differences, and
that this can be done and is being done. Indeed, we know that
differences of race, religion, and culture actually enrich the
society.
<p>
There is nothing, surely, in the entire realm of human activity
so inspired or inspiring as free men of all races and religions
bound together by the stimulus of common interests, objectives,
and ideals.
<p>
The vision of a world in which all peoples will live together in
peace and brotherhood may be far from realization, but it remains
the noblest ideal of human existence....</i>

<b>Mahatma Gandhi</b>

Mohandas Karamchand (Mahatma) Gandhi (1869-1948), a native of

Africa working for the removal of government measures that he saw
as unfair to the country's Indian population.

He returned to India in 1915 and, within five years, became head
of the Indian
national movement, leading a successful campaign of nonviolent
resistance to British rule and gaining independence and economic
self-reliance for Indians. In 1948, just a year after realizing
his goal of a self-governing India, Gandhi was assassinated by a
Hindu who opposed Gandhi's program of peace and tolerance for all

which mere promotion of disaffection is a crime. I have studied
some of the cases tried under it, and I know that some of the
most loved of India's patriots have been convicted under it. I
consider it a privilege, therefore, to be charged under that
section. I have endeavored to give in their briefest outline the
reasons for my disaffection. I have no personal ill-will against
any single administrator, much less can I have any disaffection
toward the King's person. But I hold it to be a virtue to be
disaffected towards a government which in its totality has done
more harm to India than any previous system. India is less manly
under the British rule than she ever was before. Holding such a
belief, I consider it to be a sin to have affection for the
system. And it has been a precious privilege for me to be able to
write what I have in the various articles tendered in evidence
against me.
<p>
In fact, I believe that I have rendered a service to India and
England by showing in non-cooperation the way out of the
unnatural state in which both are living. In my humble opinion,
non-cooperation with evil is as much a duty as is cooperation
with good. But in the past, non-cooperation has been deliberately
expressed in violence to the evil doer. I am endeavoring to show
to my countrymen that violent non-cooperation only multiplies
evil, and that as evil can only be sustained by violence,
withdrawal of support of evil requires complete abstention from
violence. Nonviolence implies voluntary submission to the penalty
for non-cooperation with evil. I am here, therefore, to invite
and submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be
inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what
appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen....</i>

<b>Vaclav Havel</b>
<p>
Vaclav Havel (1936-    ), a native of Prague and a playwright by
profession, in 1977 helped found Charter 77, a human rights
organization in Czechoslovakia. For this he was the subject of
police harassment and spent nearly four years in jail, from 1979
to 1983. When massive anti-government demonstrations erupted in
Prague in November 1989, Havel became a leading figure in the
Civic Forum, a new coalition of non-Communist opposition groups
pressing for democratic reforms. A month later, with the ouster
of the Communist regime, Havel was elected the country's interim
president; he was re-elected to the presidency in July 1990. As
president, Havel has worked to increase basic freedom in the
Czech Republic and introduce an economic system based on free
enterprise.
<p><blockquote><i>
...We have fallen morally ill because we became used to saying
one thing and thinking another. We have learned not to believe in
anything, to ignore each other, to care only about ourselves.
Notions such as love, friendship, compassion, humility, or
forgiveness have lost their depth and dimensions....The previous
regime, armed with its arrogant and intolerant ideology, reduced
man to a means of production and nature to a tool of
production....
<p>
In the effort to rectify matters of common concern we have
something to build on. The recent past -- and in particular, the
last six weeks of our peaceful revolution -- has shown the
enormous human, moral, and spiritual potential: the civic culture
that has slumbered in our society beneath the mask of apathy.
Whenever someone categorically claimed that we were this or that,
I always objected that society is a very mysterious creature and
that it is not wise to trust the face it chooses to show you. I
am happy I was not mistaken. People all around the world wondered
how those meek, humiliated, cynical citizens of Czechoslovakia,
who seemed to believe in nothing, found the strength to cast off
the totalitarian system in several weeks, and do it in a decent
and peaceful manner. And let us ask: Where did young people who
never knew another system get their longing for truth, their love
of free thought, their political imagination, their civic
courage, and their civic prudence? How did their parents--
precisely the generation thought to be lost--join them? How is it
possible that so many people immediately grasped what had to be
done, without needing anyone else's advice or instructions?
<p>
I think there are two main reasons: First of all, people are
never merely a product of the external world--they are always
able to respond to something superior, however systematically the
external world tries to snuff out that ability. Second,
humanistic and democratic traditions...did after all slumber in
the subconscious of our nations and national minorities. These
traditions were inconspicuously passed from one generation to
another, so that each of us could discover them at the right time
and transform them into deeds....</i>

<b>Nelson Mandela</b>

Nwlaon Eoliklalla Mandela (1918-    ) was elected president of
South Africa on May 9, 1994, an event that capped a life-long
struggle to achieve a multiracial democracy in his country. 
Mandela had begun his political career some 50 years earlier, as
an organizer for the African National Congress (ANC), a group
opposed to whie minority rule in South Africa. Beginning in 1952.
as tje AMC's deputy president, Mandela traveled throughout the
country organizing reistance to discriminatroy legislation based
on racial classifications.  In 1964, he was sentenced to life
imprisonment for sabotage and treason; he spent 27 years in jail.
When he was released in February 1990, he immediately embarked on
a course of dialogue and negotiation that brought democracy and
equality to South Africa.  In 1993, Mandela -- along with then-
South African President F.W. de Klerk -- was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize.
<p><blockquote><i>
...We speak here of the challenge of the dichotomies of war and
peace, violence and nonviolence, racism and human dignity,
oppression and repression and liberty and human rights, poverty
and reedom from want.
<p>
We stand here today as nothing more than a representative of the
millions of our people who dared to rise up against a social
system whose very essence is war, violence, racism, oppression,
repression, and the impoverishment of an entire people.
<p>
The value of our shared reward will and must be measured by the
joyful peace which will triumph, because the common humanity that
bonds both black and white into one human race will have said to
each one of us that we shall all live like the children of
paradise.
<p>
Thus shall we live, because we will have created a soiety which
recognizes that all people are born equal with each entitled in
equal measure to life, liberty, prosperity, human rights, and
good governance.
<p>
Such a society should never allow again that there should be
prisoners of conscience nor that any person's human rights should
be violated.
<p>
Neither should it ever happen that once more the avenues to
peaceful change are blocked by usurpers who seek to take power
away from the people, in pursuit of their own, ignoble
purposes....

cynicism, or selfishness made us fail to live up to the ideals of
humanism which the Nobel Peace Prize encapsulates.  Let the
striving of us all prove Martin Luther King, Jr., to have been
correct when he said that humanity can no longer be tragically
bound to the starless midnight of racism and war.

<b>Eleanor Roosevelt</b>
<p>
Anna Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962), an American humanitarian and
the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was an outspoken
defender of labor and the poor and a champion of education,
health, and other issues affecting children. During World War II,
she traveled extensively on behalf of her husband and an idea to
which he was dedicated: the creation of an effective
international organization to prevent future wars. Following his
death in 1945, Eleanor Roosevelt was appointed to the U.S.
delegation to the new United Nations and, in early 1946, was
elected the first chairman of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
In that position, she played a pre-eminent role in forging the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. She continued to serve the
United Nations until 1952.
<p>
<blockquote><i>...As I look back at the work thus far of our
Human Rights
Commission I realize that its importance is twofold.
<p>
In the first place, we have put into words some inherent rights.
Beyond that, we have found that the conditions of our
contemporary world require the enumeration of certain protections
which the individual must have if he is to acquire a sense of
security and dignity in his own person. The effect of this is
frankly educational. Indeed, I like to think that the Declaration
will help forward very largely the education of the peoples of
the world.
<p>
It seems to me most important that the Declaration be accepted by
all member nations, not because they will immediately live up to
all of its provisions, but because they ought to support the
standards toward which the nations must henceforward aim. Since
the objectives have been clearly stated, men of good will
everywhere will strive to attain them with more energy and, I
trust, with better hope of success.
<p>
As the Convention is adhered to by one country after another, it
will actually bring into being rights which are tangible and can
be invoked before the law of the ratifying countries. Everywhere
many people will feel more secure. And as the Great Powers tie
themselves down by their ratifications, the smaller nations which
fear that the great may abuse their strength will acquire a sense
of greater assurance.
<p>
The work of the Commission has been of outstanding value in
setting before men's eyes the ideals which they must strive to
reach. Men cannot live by bread alone.</i>

<b>Andrei Sakharov</b>
<p>
Andrei Dmitriyevich Sakharov (1921-1989), a successful Soviet
nuclear physicist, became recognized as a champion for democracy
and human rights in 1968 with the publication in the West of his
underground manifesto "Progress, Coexistence, and Intellectual
Freedom." In 1970, he helped found the Committee for Human Rights
in the Soviet Union. His efforts were recognized with the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1975. Following criticism of the government at the
end of 1979, Sakharov was exiled to the closed city of Gorky. He
was released in 1986 and saw many of the causes for which he had
fought become official government policy.  In 1989, he was
elected to the Soviet Union's newly formed legislature, the
Congress of People's Deputies. He died later that year.
<p><blockquote><i>
...In struggling to protect human rights we must, I am convinced,
first and foremost act as protectors of the innocent victims of
regimes installed in various countries, without demanding the
destruction or total condemnation of these regimes. We need
reform, not revolution. We need a pliant, pluralist, tolerant
community, which selectively and tentatively can bring about a
free, undogmatic use of the experiences of all social systems.
What is dtente? What is rapprochement? We are concerned not with
words, but with a willingness to create a better and more
friendly society, a better world order.
<p>
Thousands of years ago tribes of human beings suffered great
privations in the struggle to survive. In this struggle, it was
important not only to be able to handle a club, but also to
possess the ability to think reasonably, to take care of the
knowledge and experience garnered by the tribe, and to develop
the links that would provide cooperation with other tribes. Today
the entire human race is faced with a similar test. In infinite
space many civilizations are bound to exist, among them
civilizations that are also wiser and more "successful" than
ours. I support the cosmological hypothesis which states that the
development of the universe is repeated in its basic features an
infinite number of times. In accordance with this, other
civilizations, including more "successful" ones, should exist an
infinite number of times on the "preceding" and the "following"
pages of the Book of the Universe. Yet this should not minimize
our sacred endeavors in this world of ours, where, like faint
glimmers of light in the dark, we have emerged for a moment from
the nothingness of dark unconsciousness into material existence.
We must make good the demands of reason and create a life worthy
of ourselves and of the goals we only dimly perceive.</i>

<b>Raoul Wallenberg</b>
<p>
Raoul Wallenberg (1912-1945?) was a diplomat from a neutral
country, Sweden, who came to the aid of Europe's Jews during
World War II.

 The foreign representative of a central European
trading company, Wallenberg in 1944 persuaded the Swedish foreign
ministry to send him to Budapest on a diplomatic passport. There
he sheltered thousands of Jews in "protected houses" flying the
flags of Sweden and other neutral countries. He rescued people
from deportation trains and death marches; to many of those whom
he could not save he gave food and clothing. Wallenberg
disappeared on January 17, 1945. On September 22, 1981, the U.S.
Congress granted Raoul Wallenberg honorary American citizenship
-- only the second individual to be given this distinction.
<p>
<blockquote><i>The need for ration cards, baptismal certificates,
identity
papers; the requirement to wear the Star of David; the curfew for
Jews during most of the day; the strict control of the streets at
night; the lack of cash among Jews; the lukewarm sympathy of the
Christian population; and the open and easily surveyable
topography of the countryside all combine to make it difficult
for the Jews to elude their fate by escaping.
<p>
Somewhere in the vicinity of 20,000 to 50,000 Jews are thought to
have been hidden in Budapest by Christian friends. Of those who
remain in the Jewish houses, it is likely that most are children,
women, and old people. The men have been conscripted for work.
During the week ending July 7, a large number of baptisms were
performed by Catholic priests. Greater restrictiveness now
prevails, however, and three months' instruction is now required
for baptism. Many priests have been arrested. By being baptized,
Jews hope to take advantage of the rumored new regulations
exempting those baptized from having to wear the Star of David.
The number of baptized Jews in Hungary is reported not to exceed
70,000.
<p>
Some slight possibility exists of acquiring Aryan papers
belonging to people who have either been bombed out or killed.
These command a very high price. I do not know of any cases of
false identity papers, however, and the printing establishments
are under such strict control that it is, at this point,
virtually impossible to escape by this method....
<p>
... Relief activity has been initiated on a very limited scale.
Money has been requested -- but not obtained -- from a religious
organization that has been very active in aiding the Jews, as
well as from the newly formed Jewish Council for Christian Jews.
It would obviously be desirable to pursue this avenue further,
whether in the form of support of a camp through the Red Cross,
or in the form of support to individuals, or organizations and
individuals who have proved useful. I can only regret that those
who were most eager to send me here have not seemed to understand
that funds are essential. There is endless suffering to ease in
this place.</i>

<b>Wei Jingsheng</b>
<p>
Wei Jingsheng (1950-    ), an electrician, was raised in Beijing,
the child of two Communist party members. Wei first came to
prominence through articles critical of his government's
modernization program in the late 1970s for focusing on economic
reforms to the exclusion of democratic reforms. A week after
posting his last article on Beijing's Democracy Wall in March
1979, Wei was arrested and sentenced to 15 years in prison. When
he was freed unexpectedly in September 1993, he immediately took
up his old work. In early 1994, Wei was again detained, and, on
December 13, 1995, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison for, as
government charges stated, seeking "to develop a plan of action
that included establishing an organization to raise funds to
support democratic movement activities."
<p><blockquote><i>
...What is true democracy? It means the right of the people to
choose their own representatives to work according to their will
and in their interest. Only this can be called democracy.
Furthermore, the people must also have the power to replace their
representatives any time so that these representatives cannot go
on deceiving others in the name of the people....
<p>
Will there be great disorder across the land and defiance of laws
human and divine once people enjoy democracy? Do not recent
periodicals show that just because of the absence of democracy,
dictators, big and small, were defying laws human and divine? How
to maintain democratic order is the domestic problem requiring
solution by the people themselves, and there is no need for the
privileged overlords to worry about it. Therefore, judging from
past history, a democratic social system is the major premise or
the prerequisite for all developments -- or modernizations.
Without this major premise or prerequisite, it would be
impossible not only to continue further development but also to
preserve the fruits of the present state of development. The
experiences of our great motherland over the past 30 years have
provided the best evidence.
<p>
Why must human history take the road toward prosperity or
modernization? The reason is that human beings need a prosperous
society to produce realistic fruits and to provide them with
maximum opportunity to pursue their first goal of happiness,
namely freedom. Democracy means the maximum attainable freedom
so
far known by human beings. It is quite obvious that democracy has
become the goal in contemporary human struggles....</i>

<b>Elie Wiesel</b>
<p>
Eliezer (Elie) Wiesel (1928-   ), an American author, was born
and spent his early life in a small, Hasidic community in Sighet,
Romania. In 1944, during World War II, Wiesel was sent with his
family and the town's other Jews to the Auschwitz and then
Buchenwald concentration camps. He was a survivor. Following the
end of the war, Wiesel worked in France as a journalist with
French and Israeli newspapers. In 1956, he moved to the United
States, where he has dedicated his life to writing and speaking
on the horrors he witnessed during the Holocaust and to helping
victims of oppression and racism everywhere. In recognition of
his efforts to expose violence and hatred, Wiesel was awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1986.
<p><blockquote><i>
...As you walk through the [U.S. Memorial] Holocaust Museum, as
you look into the eyes of the killers and their victims, ask
yourselves: How could the murderers do what they did and go on
living? Why was Berlin encouraged in its belief that it could
decree with impunity the humiliation, persecution, extermination
of an entire people? Why weren't the railways leading to Birkenau
bombed by Allied planes? Why was there no outcry, no public
indignation?
<p>
Another question: Where did the poorly armed fighters in the
ghettos and the forests find the courage to take on the mightiest
legions in Europe?
<p>
And the most awesome question of all: Why was man's silence
matched by God's?
<p>
The questions, in fact, are endless and will forever remain
unanswered. Indeed, if there is an answer to the Holocaust, it
must -- by definition -- be the wrong answer. Nor is the Museum
an answer; it is but a question mark.
<p>
Every event connected with that period defies human
understanding. It is not because I cannot explain that you will
not understand; it is because you will not understand that I
cannot explain.
<p>
The essence of this tragedy is that it can never be fully
communicated....
<p>
And yet, we are duty-bound to try. Not to do so would mean to
forget. To forget would mean to kill the victims a second time.
We could not prevent their first death; we must not allow them to
vanish again. Memory is not only a victory over time, it is also
a triumph over injustice.
<p>
That is one of the lessons we have learned. There are others. We
have learned that though the Holocaust was principally a Jewish
tragedy, its implications are universal. Though not all victims
were Jewish, all Jews were victims. We have learned that whatever
happens to one community ultimately affects every community....We
have learned that although every human being has the right to be
different, none has the right to be indifferent to
suffering....</i>

Washington -- Turkey announced December 25 that it will extend

the State Department said December 25.
<P>
In a written statement, the State Department said that coalition
aircraft have been flying these operations since 1991 under
"Operation Provide Comfort," but the designation "Provide
Comfort" is being dropped because of changes in its mission due
to the closing of the Military Command Center in Zakho and the
shift of humanitarian assistance in the north under United
Nations Security Council Resolution 986 to international
organizations.

EXTENSION OF COALITION AIR OPERATIONS OVER NORTHERN IRAQ</center>
<P>
The United States welcomes Turkey's December 25 announcement that
it will extend Coalition Air Operations over northern Iraq
beginning January 1. Coalition aircraft will continue to fly
these operations as they have since 1991 in the framework of
Operation Provide Comfort. Because of changes in its mission as a
result of the closing last fall of the Military Command Center in
Zakho and the shift of humanitarian assistance in the north under
UNSCR 986 to international organizations, the designation
"Provide Comfort" will no longer will be used.
<P>
Operation Provide Comfort has made an important contribution to
the well being of the people of northern Iraq and to the peace
and stability of the region. The ongoing air operation
underscores the firm commitment of coalition partners to bringing
about Iraq's full compliance with all its UN obligations.

<P>
(Begin text)
<P>
The memorandum of understanding signed May 20, 1996, between the
U.N. and Iraq is an important step in implementing Resolution 986
by providing for the procurement and distribution of humanitarian
supplies in Iraq.  It ensures that Saddam Hussein will neither
control nor have access to proceeds from the sale of the oil, and
that only the people of Iraq will benefit from the oil-for-food
resolution.  Other steps will need to be taken before Resolution
986 is fully implemented, including acceptance by the Secretary
General of an Iraqi food distribution plan and creation of
guidelines for that plan by the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
<P>
The details of Resolution 986 include:
<P><ul>
<li>The Iraqis will be allowed to sell 2 billion dollars worth of
oil over the next 180 days.
<P>
<li>600 million dollars of that amount will be transferred to the
U.N. Compensation Fund to compensate individual and other claims
arising from Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait.
<P>
<li>Between 260 and 300 million dollars will be set aside during
this 180-day period for the humanitarian program in the three
northern governates.
<P>
<li>Money will also be deducted to cover the costs of the
independent inspection agents to be provided by the U.N., the

<CENTER><B><H2>Statement of the Department of State<br>
On U.S. Participation in UNSCR 986</H2>
<br>by Spokeman Nicholas Burns, June 5, 1996</B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<p>
Washington -- The U.S. administration has decided to permit
American companies to participate in transactions under the
United Nations Security Council Iraq "oil-for-food" arrangement,
UNSC Resolution 986.
<P>
Following is the official text of a June 5 statement by State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns:
<P>
(Begin official text)
<P>
The Administration has decided to allow American companies to
participate in transactions involving Iraq under UN Security
Council Resolution 986. Our decision permits U.S. companies to
buy or sell goods or services, including oil and humanitarian
supplies, to the extent permitted by the UN Resolution and the
extent permitted by the UN Sanctions
Committee.
<P>
Resolution 986 is the so-called "oil for food" arrangement that
Iraq recently agreed to implement under strict UN supervision. It
is a humanitarian exception to the UN economic embargo against
Iraq and does not represent a lifting of the sanctions. The
proceeds from oil sales are to compensate the victims of Iraqi
aggression and to purchase humanitarian supplies.
<P>
Oil revenues will be tightly controlled to insure they benefit
the Iraqi population and to prevent abuse. All aspects of 986
will require case-by-case approval and will be strictly monitored
by the United Nations. All oil revenue will be deposited in an
escrow account established by and under the control of the UN.
The Administration has decided that it is appropriate to allow
U.S. commercial participation in 986 transactions in these
circumstances. Any U.S. firm that wishes to participate in such
transactions with Iraq under 986 must be licensed by the U.S.
treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

Bank Announces Deal With Qatar</TITLE></HEAD>

<CENTER><B><H2>Export Import Bank Announces Deal With
Qatar</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
Washington -- The following news release from the Export Import
Bank of the United States was released January 17 to announce the
"Middle East Deal of the Year," a half-billion dollar export to
Qatar that will also benefit Virginia, Texas, Pennsylvania, and
Oklahoma firms.
<P>
(Begin text)
<P>
The Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank) has
approved its first project financings in Qatar -- $526 million to
support U.S. exports for two gas field development projects. The
sale of U.S. equipment and services for the Ras Laffan and
Qatargas projects, sponsored by subsidiaries of Mobil Corp.,
Fairfax, VA, will sustain thousands of high-quality American
jobs.
<P>
The projects will tap the largest gas field in the world, the
North Field located offshore Qatar, and use exports from U.S.
companies around the country including primary contractors M.W.
Kellogg and McDermott Engineering both of Houston, TX.
<P>
The Ras Laffan project financing was named "Middle East Deal of
the Year" by Project Finance International Magazine, and the
Qatargas project financing was selected to be one of the
magazine's top five Middle East deals for 1996.
<P>
"The Ras Laffan project expects to purchase in excess of $500
million of goods and services from suppliers in the United
States, which would not have been possible without Ex-Im Bank's
participation," said Dale Stein, Director, Project Finance,
Mobil. "Ex-Im Bank played a leadership role in the financing
which was critical to its success."
<P>
Dianne Rudo, Vice President of Ex-Im Bank's project Finance
Division, said: "With the approval of these cases in the first
quarter of fiscal 1997, our division's business so far this year
equals 80 percent of all the financing we did in fiscal 1996.
These transactions are the first of what we hope will be many
large project financing commitments in the Middle East by Ex-Im
Bank."
<P>
Ex-Im Bank's Board of Directors approved $464 million in
financing supporting U.S. exports to Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural
Gas Co. Ltd. to build, own and operate offshore and onshore
facilities at the North Field. Ras Laffan will extract gas and
process it to form liquefied natural gas (LNG).
<P>
Project sponsors and owners of Ras Laffan are the Qatar General
Petroleum Corp. (QGPC), owned by the government of Qatar, and
Mobil QM Gas Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Mobil Corp. M.W.
Kellogg is a primary contractor for the onshore portion of the
project, and McDermott International for the offshore platform.
Subcontractors on the project include companies based in
Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and Texas. Firms based in Florida, Nevada,
California and Massachusetts are under consideration as potential
subcontractors.
<P>
Ex-Im Bank also approved up to $62 million in financing in
support of the sale of U.S. equipment and services for the
upstream part of the Qatargas Liquefied Natural Gas Project.
Qatargas will develop a gas and condensate concession in the
North Field, build a pipeline to transport the wet gas, extract
and sell condensates, and deliver the resulting feedstock gas to
an LNG plant. The Qatargas upstream project is a joint venture
owned by subsidiaries of Mobil, U.S.A.; QGPC, Qatar; Total,
France; and Marubeni and Mitsui, Japan.
<P>
The financers of the two projects will be repaid from project
revenues, rather than relying on a guarantee of the debt by the
host country government. "Financing on a limited recourse basis
is relatively new for major international projects," Mobil's
Stein said. "Ex-Im Bank's Project Finance Division used its
expertise in the area to the benefit of the Ras Laffan and
Qatargas financing and ultimately to the benefit of U.S.
business."
<P>
Ex-Im Bank is an independent government agency that creates and
sustains good high-wage jobs for American workers by financing
U.S. export sales into key emerging markets where private sources
of credit are still developing.

<H2>Explanation of the U.S. Operations of the Committee</H2>
<PRE> 
This Committee uses five Working Groups, based on U.S. and S.A. environmental agency
responsibilities, to organize its activities.  The Department of the Interior (DOI) staff sought
to involve as many Federal environmental agencies as possible in the work of the Committee.

Since DOI agencies, EPA and NOAA, all intend to develop strong professional relationships
with their counterparts in South Africa, it was decided each agency should have as much
autonomy to develop its activities and contacts as possible.  Each agency is providing its own
funding for its activities and operates under its own legal authorities. [Each Working Group
coordinates with other agencies, for example USFWS includes Smithsonian and Bureau of
Land Management in its Working Group.]

A.  U.S. Participants in the Working Groups: 

Nature Conservation and Ecotourism  
U.S. Co-Chair: Marshall Jones, Assistant Director, Fish and Wildlife Service
Staff: David Ferguson, International Program Officer, Fish and Wildlife Service

Environmental Management
U.S. Co-Chair: William Nitze, Assistant Administrator, International Activities, EPA
Staff: Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, Program Officer, International Activities, EPA

Water Conservation
U.S. Co-Chair: Eluid Martinez, Commissioner, Bureau of Reclamation
Staff: Richard Ives, Acting Chief, International Activities, Bureau of Reclamation

Oceans and Atmosphere
U.S. Co-Chair: Elbert Friday, Director, National Weather Service, National Oce- anic and
Atmospheric Administration
Staff: Martin Yerg, Chief, International Activities Office, NWS/NOAA

Fisheries 
U.S. Co-Chair: Will Martin, Deputy Assistant Secretary, International Affairs, NOAA
Staff: Jacqueline Rousseau, Program Officer, International Affairs, NOAA
     Brad Brown, NOAA, Director of Southeast Fisheries Science Center
                                                                           
B.  Functions of Each Working Group:

Nature Conservation and Ecotourism
This Working Group supports efforts to maintain South Africa's wildlife and parks
management as a model for sustainable development of wildlife resources and protection of
biodiversity for the rest of Africa.  It facilitates exchange of information and skills between
South Africa and the United States and between South Africa and other African countries. 
The members discuss policies related to international environmental conventions such as
CITES, World Heritage, Ramsar, and the Biodiversity Convention.  The group develops
techniques to bring to public attention the economic importance of sustainable development,
national parks and wildlife tourism.

Environmental Management and Pollution Prevention
This Working Group focuses on major environmental issues of both countries.  It explores
avenues to support environmental management capacity building, including environmental
laws, policies and practices that encourage sound environmental management and sustainable
development with special attention to promoting pollution prevention.  The working group
establishes a mechanism for systematic exchange of information between and among
counterpart government agencies, such as through INFOTERRA.  Members seek to promote
increased interaction between environmental organizations, academic and research institutions
and private environmental technology and services companies.

Water Conservation
This Working Group shares common problems and lessons in dealing with the lack of water
in certain parts of the country, a problem faced by both nations.  The focus is on capacity
building, water conservation, and water utility exchanges.  Project activities strive to provide
equitable allocation and efficient use of water.  The U.S. has been impressed with the
innovative ideas and breadth of the Working Group s activities to address difficult water
allocation problems.

Oceans and Atmosphere
This Working Group focuses on applied research and operations in the field of meteorology,
climatology, hydrology and oceanography with an emphasis on short-term and long-term
rainfall forecasting and cloud seeding.  The Working Group will cooperate in the areas of
education and training, exchange of experts and information, joint scientific studies, and
upgrading of equipment and observations.

Fisheries
This Working Group shares expertise in a number of fisheries-related areas including the
following: a) the role of marine reserves in conservation and sustainable development; b)
stock assessment methodologies; and c) cooperation in areas of joint research interests,
particularly dealing with comparative ecosystems research on highly-migratory fish species
and pelagic and groundfish resources.  Comparisons of ecosystems might focus on the
Agulhas Current and the Gulf Stream and the Benguela and California Currents.  In addition,
the working group is exploring the possibility of cooperative educational and research efforts
between traditionally black colleges in both the United States and South Africa.

<H2>GLICKMAN CITES SUCCESSES OF FIRST U.S.-SOUTH AFRICA
BINATIONAL COMMISSION's AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE MEETING</H2>
<P> WASHINGTON, April 1, 1996--Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman today said that the first bilateral meeting of the U.S.-
South Africa Binational Commission's Agriculture Committee
achieved many of its goals.</P>
<P>&quot;It was a pleasure to meet with South African
Agriculture Minister Andre van Niekerk, Ambassador Franklin Sonn,
and members of the South African delegation,&quot; said Glickman.
 &quot;This first business meeting served to get the Agriculture
Committee up and running.  We addressed and clarified many
organizational issues that will now enable us to work more
closely and cooperatively together on mutually beneficial
initiatives.  Both Agriculture Minister van Niekerk and I were
pleased with the progress made and will report our
accomplishments to the chairpersons of the Binational Commission
-- Vice President Albert Gore, Jr., and South African Executive
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki -- at the next commission meeting,
proposed for July 9,&quot; he said.</P>
<P> Glickman said the committee's accomplishments included
agreement to sign a Terms of Reference (TOR) by the next
commission meeting.  The TOR describes the functions and
organizational structure of the committee.  Also agreed to was
the formation of four working groups to address agricultural
issues related to market access, institutional development,
technology to create wealth, and sustainable development. 
Discussions are already underway to develop initiatives by each
working group.  Proposed initiatives include exchanging and
sharing information with counterparts in both countries through
joint seminars, forums, and projects.  The private sectors of
both countries will be included, where appropriate, so that trade
and investment opportunities between the United States and South
Africa can be expanded.</P>
<P>  Along these lines, a U.S.-South Africa agribusiness forum
was held on March 27, attracting 72 U.S. and South African
agribusiness representatives.  The forum -- the first activity of
the Agriculture Committee -- gave participants the opportunity to
exchange ideas and information with one another and with speakers
from the private and public sectors about doing business in South
Africa.  Topics discussed included public and private financing,
food safety requirements for export and import, transportation of
food products, and opportunities for U.S. high-value,
intermediate, and bulk products.</P>
<P>  &quot;A driving force behind the Agriculture Committee's
decision to hold this forum was the need to respond to the
enormous amount of inquiries from U.S. agribusinesses interested
in doing business in South Africa,&quot; said Glickman.  &quot;Since
the birth of South Africa's democratic, non-apartheid government
in mid-1994, these inquiries have escalated.  This forum helped
answer many of the questions U.S. agribusiness had about trade
with South Africa and opened doors for future collaboration.&quot;</P>
<P>The Agriculture Committee was established in December, 1995
under the auspices of the U.S.-South Africa Binational
Commission, headed by U.S. vice President Albert Gore, Jr., and
south Africa's Executive Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.  Secretary
Glickman and South African Minister van Niekerk co-chair the
committee.
</P>
<P>The committee provides a framework for facilitating
discussion, cooperation, and initiatives in the areas of
agricultural trade, investment and development; rural economic
and community development; marketing, regulation, and safety of
food products; food and nutrition; natural resources; and
agricultural economics, extension, and research.</P>
<P>In addition to agriculture, the other committees of the
Binational Commission cover trade and investment, human resources
development and education, sustainable minerals and energy,
science and technology, and conservation and the environment.</P></BODY></HTML>

<CENTER><B><H2>Prepared Remarks on U.S. Middle East Policy<br>
By Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau<br>
before the House International Relations Committee</H2><br>
September 25, 1996</B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
The United States seeks "a unified <A HREF="#iraq">Iraq</A> at
peace
with its neighbors and its own people," Assistant Secretary of
State Robert Pelletreau said in his prepared remarks before the
House International Relations Committee September 25, 1996.
<P>
"We want economic growth and normal international commerce --
including oil," Pelletreau continued.  "However, Saddam Hussein's
Iraq uses force against its neighbors and its people; it
represents a threat to the wider Middle East; and it is pursuing
weapons of mass destruction."  For that reason the U.S. policy
with respect to Iraq is focused on deterring "the threat the
Iraqi regime poses to the peace and security of a region of vital
national interest to the United States."
<P>
"The containment of the Iraqi regime is not a struggle only
between the U.S. and Iraq," Pelletreau's statement read.  "There
is broad and enduring support within the international community
for containing Saddam."
<P>
Turning to <A HREF="#iran">Iran,</A> Pelletreau said: "As long as
Iran pursues
aggressive external policies, we will continue seeking to deprive
it of external financial support and to develop international
economic pressure to change its threatening behavior."
<P>
The Iran and Libya Sanctions Act "has not been popular
legislation among most of our friends and allies," Pelletreau
conceded.  However, the sanctions do serve to underscore "the
gravity with which we regard Iran's several threats: support of
terrorism, including support for groups that use violence to
oppose the Middle East peace process; pursuit of weapons of mass
destruction and the means to deliver them beyond Iran's borders;
and meddling in the affairs of neighbors."
<P>
On Egypt, Pelletreau cited the country's economic progress and
said the United States looks forward to November's economic
summit in Cairo "to add to the momentum of Egypt's growth and
reform."  With respect to Egypt's relations with Israel, he said
that the dialogue between the two countries "needs to be
strengthened."
<P>
As for Algeria, he said that "the United States supports the
government's efforts to foster national reconciliation based on
political pluralism and democratic institutions, but our
continued support is conditioned on real progress.  Continued
crackdowns on newspapers and limitations on the functioning of
political parties will call into question the seriousness of the
government's intentions."
<P>
Following is the official text of Pelletreau's prepared remarks:
<P>
(Begin text)
<P>
Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the Committee, I am
pleased to appear before you to review recent developments in the
Middle East and North Africa.  I would like to focus my remarks
on the central elements of U.S. policy in the region: the Middle
East peace process, our response to  <A HREF="#iraq">Iraq's
aggression</A> and international terrorism, and our cooperation
with our allies in the <A HREF="#gcc">Persian Gulf</A>.
<P>
An extraordinarily wide range of U.S. national interests converge
in the Middle East.  Among these crucial national interests are:
<P><UL>
<LI>Achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace between
Israel and its neighbors;
<P>
<LI>Maintaining our long-standing commitment to Israel's security
and well-being;
<P>
<LI>Combating terrorism and countering the spread of weapons of
mass destruction;
<P>
<LI>Nurturing close relations with our Gulf allies and ensuring
the United States' access to the area's vital petroleum reserves;
<P>
<LI>Promoting democracy and respect for human rights and for the
rule of law; and
<P>
<LI>Enhancing business opportunities for American companies.
<P></UL>
Promoting these interests requires that we continue our active
political engagement in the region and back it with American
military power -- with the support and cooperation of our allies
whenever possible.  We are putting special energy into containing
the disruption from rogue regimes in Iraq, Iran and Libya, and
into denying the benefits of membership in the community of
nations to extremists who foment conflict.
<P>
<B>MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS</B>
<P>
The United States has been active in the quest for an
Arab-Israeli peace since the creation of the State of Israel in
1948.  This Administration has maintained this steadfast
involvement and commitment.  Under U.S. cosponsorship, Israel and
the Palestinians have engaged in almost continuous negotiations
since the Madrid peace conference in October 1991.  Prime
Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat shook hands on the White House
lawn three years ago this month.  Israel and the Palestinians
have signed two major agreements which are major steps along the
road to peace.  Also since that handshake, Jordan has signed a
peace treaty with Israel; the Arab League economic boycott of
Israel has virtually withered away; and Israel has exchanged
official representatives with Morocco, Tunisia, Oman, Qatar and
Mauritania.
<P>
Continued U.S. engagement has been crucial to keeping the peace
process on track despite numerous setbacks and challenges by
extremists and other opponents of peace.  After eight days of
shuttle diplomacy in April, Secretary Christopher negotiated an
understanding that created a new mechanism for calming the
situation along the Israeli-Lebanese border.  After fanatics
launched a series of terrorist attacks in Israel earlier this
year in the hopes of putting new obstacles between Israel and the
Arabs, President Clinton gathered 29 world leaders at Sharm
el-Sheikh to condemn terrorism and express their support for
Israel and the peace process.  The U.S. has kept up its level of
engagement with both Israel and the Arabs since the election of
the new government in Tel Aviv because we believe that progress
in the peace process is not only possible, but necessary.
<P>
Palestinian Track
<P>
Over the last three and a half years, Israel and the Palestinians
have been engaged in a historic process of reconciliation.  Our
support has been crucial as they have taken courageous decisions
for peace.  As a result of existing Israel-Palestinian
agreements, including the Interim Agreement signed in Washington
a year ago, Palestinians now govern themselves throughout Gaza
and most cities of the West Bank; Israeli and Palestinian
security forces cooperate to root out the terrorist
infrastructure of HAMAS and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
<P>
The U.S. has been working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu's
government and with the Palestinians to keep up the momentum of
cooperation across a broad range of issues, political and
economic.  We were pleased by the historic meeting between Prime
Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat earlier this month.
<P>
Only four days later, Prime Minister Netanyahu met with President
Clinton in Washington and firmly restated his government's
commitment to achieving peace with the Palestinians.  The Prime
Minister indicated that the Israeli government remains committed
to implementing existing agreements and to building on them
toward a comprehensive peace in the region.  The Palestinians
also remain committed to progress in this historic reconciliation
between two peoples whose conflict has unsettled the entire
region.
<P>
We continue to monitor carefully Palestinian compliance with
commitments to Israel, and we remain satisfied that they are
adhering to bilateral agreements.  On August 12, the President
once again stated his determination, pursuant to the Middle East
Peace Facilitation Act, to renew the suspension of certain
statutory restrictions on the PLO, based on the assessment in the
report to Congress of July 13.  That assessment noted that, in
the security area, the Palestinian authorities have mounted a
sustained campaign against the perpetrators of violence and
terrorism, particularly HAMAS and Islamic Jihad.
<P>
Both Israel and the United States are committed to strengthening
the economic underpinnings of peace.  We have taken a leadership
role in stimulating the international donor community to advance
economic development in the West Bank and Gaza.  Earlier this
month, at a U.S.-hosted meeting of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee
-- the principal coordination mechanism for the West Bank/Gaza
donor effort -- donors examined ways to accelerate assistance and
laid out a program for the coming months.  About $1.2 billion of
the five-year total of $2.9 billion pledged by the donors has
already been disbursed since September 1993.  About $195 million
of the United States' five-year pledge of $500 million has been
released.
<P>
Syrian Track
<P>
The United States continues to believe that only a comprehensive
peace will be a durable peace.  For this reason, we have long
encouraged and facilitated negotiations between Israel and Syria
and Israel and Lebanon.  Both the new Israeli Government and the
Government of Syria have made clear that they are committed to
achieving a peaceful settlement of their conflict through
negotiations.  Gaps exist between the two parties on a variety of
issues, including the basis on which to resume their direct
talks.  Nevertheless, both have indicated that they would like to
see negotiations resume and will work with us to that end.  We
are currently in contact with both parties and will continue to
try to develop an agreed formula for resuming their negotiations.
<P>
Lebanon Track
<P>
We are also interested in seeing the resumption of negotiations
between Israel and Lebanon and we have continued to urge both
sides to be prepared to exploit opportunities for peace.  The
Lebanese government has indicated that it looks forward to
proceeding as soon as a favorable atmosphere develops.  And
Israel, focused on security concerns along its border with
Lebanon, would also like to see negotiations resume.  We will
adopt a practical approach to the issues when the negotiations
begin again.
<P>
The Israel-Lebanon Monitoring Group called for by the April 26
understanding brokered by Secretary Christopher has held several
meetings since beginning operations in July.  The Monitoring
Group has helped ease tensions in southern Lebanon by affording
Syria, Lebanon and Israel a forum for avoiding escalation.  The
United States is also organizing a meeting of a consultative
group called the Friends of Lebanon to assist in Lebanon's
reconstruction.  We hope to convene the meeting in October.
<P>
On September 15, Lebanon completed a five-week cycle of elections
in which all 128 members of the parliament were chosen.  The
elections appear to have enjoyed a good turnout in most regions
based on historical standards.  Despite significant flaws, we
believe these elections represent a step forward for Lebanon. 
They underscore the Lebanese people's desire to put the war years
behind them and to focus on strengthening their institutions and
advancing national reconciliation.
<P>
Jordan Track
<P>
The treaty of peace signed by Jordan and Israel in October 1994
is a model for regional peace and reconciliation.  In January of
this year, the two sides signed the last of fourteen implementing
agreements called for in the treaty, covering such areas as
tourism, trade and economic cooperation, energy and
transportation.  Commercial air service between Tel Aviv and
Amman began in April.  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu visited
Jordan on August 5, and there is active and regular dialogue
between Jordanian and Israeli officials at all levels.  We are
also witnessing the beginnings of cooperative ventures in private
sector areas, such as agriculture and manufacturing -- small
steps, perhaps, but important to laying the foundation of a
lasting peace.
<P>
The commitment shown by President Clinton and the U.S. Congress
to assist Jordan has bolstered King Hussein's resolve and
highlighted the benefits of peace for the Jordanian people. 
Jordan's bold steps toward peace with Israel have been matched by
equally courageous domestic economic reforms that will lead to
economic well-being and strengthen Jordan as a bulwark for peace
and stability in the region.  These reforms have not come without
pain and disruption for the Jordanian people.  We appreciate the
Congress's generous support for Jordan's economic development and
security.
<P>
<B>Multilateral Initiatives</B>
<P>
Israel's bilateral negotiations with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and
the Palestinians are only part of the peace process.  The peace
process's multilateral track complements the four bilateral
tracks by fostering regional cooperation on issues of broad
importance such as water, the environment, economic development,
refugees and arms control and security.  This work takes place in
the Multilateral Working Groups.  We believe that the tangible
economic progress resulting from these activities will give the
people of the region a greater stake in the peace process and
strengthen the economic underpinnings of peace.
<P>
The Water Resources Working Group, chaired by the United States,
is undertaking major initiatives in the areas of water
conservation; regional water data banks; water supply and demand;
and desalination.
<P>
The Environment Working Group's activities include an oil spill
contingency project in the Gulf of Aqaba; an initiative for
combating desertification; a project on the environmental health
effects of pesticides; and a project on wastewater treatment and
reuse.
<P>
The Working Group on Regional Economic Development has created a
Regional Business Council and a Middle East-Mediterranean Travel
and Tourism Association to harness the commercial possibilities
of a region rich in entrepreneurial talent.
<P>
The Middle East-North Africa Economic Summit process, begun two
years ago in Casablanca, is one of the most important
multilateral initiatives.  Last October, more than 1,000 business
leaders, along with government representatives from 70 countries,
came together in Amman to formulate plans for regional economic
integration, private investment and regional economic
institutions.  We look to this year's economic summit in Cairo in
November to build on the foundations laid in Casablanca and
Amman.
<P>
The regional economic cooperation stimulated by the Casablanca
and Amman summits has broadened Israel's involvement in the
regional economy and helped bring Israel out of political
isolation.  The Arab League boycott is a vestige of the past, and
Israel is actively engaged in a range of economic projects with
Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians.
<P>
The Middle East Development Bank (MEDB) can play a crucial role
in supporting the economic framework necessary for a durable
peace, and we urge the Committee to support the Bank.  The Bank
is designed as an innovative financing institution, emphasizing
co-financing with the private sector and other financial
institutions.  Its mandate is to promote private sector growth
and entrepreneurship; support regional development projects,
particularly trans-border infrastructure; and enhance regional
economic policy dialogue and coordination.
<P>
<B>THE PERSIAN GULF</B>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean is not the only part of the Middle East
where the United States actively secures regional peace and
stability.  Both Iran and Iraq blatantly disregard international
norms of behavior, seek to dominate the Gulf and its
petrochemical resources, and pose a direct threat to their
neighbors.  The United States is committed to preventing either
of these rogue states from asserting hegemonic influence over the
Gulf or acquiring weapons of mass destruction.
<P>
<A NAME="iraq"><B>IRAQ</B>
<P>
Our policy objective on Iraq is constant: to deter the threat the
Iraqi regime poses to the peace and security of a region of vital
national interest to the United States.
<P>
We want to see a unified Iraq at peace with its neighbors and its
own people, and we want economic growth and normal international
commerce -- including in oil.  However, Saddam Hussein's Iraq
uses force against its neighbors and its people; it represents a
threat to the wider Middle East; and it is pursuing weapons of
mass destruction.
<P>
Our Policy and Our Actions
<P>
Our policy is to contain Iraq, employing political, economic, and
military measures.  This policy has enjoyed bipartisan support
through two administrations.  Each time Iraq has endangered the
region's security, the United States has been there to confront
it and to isolate the Iraqi threat.
<P>
The key elements of containment are:
<P><UL>
<LI>inspections and monitoring by UNSCOM to prevent Iraq's
pursuit
of weapons of mass destruction;
<P>
<LI>a strong UN sanctions regime;
<P>
<LI>no-fly zones below the 33rd parallel and above the 36th
parallel to prevent Iraq's use of air power; and
<P>
<LI>a no-drive zone pursuant to UNSCR 949, whereby Saddam is
prohibited from reinforcing his ground forces in the south.
<P></UL>
In response to Saddam's latest aggression -- his attack on Irbil
August 31 -- the U.S. expanded the southern no-fly zone.  We
launched air strikes against air defense sites in the south to
protect our aircrews enforcing the new zone.  Together with the
British, we warned Iraq not to threaten coalition aircraft
enforcing the zones and said we would do whatever is necessary to
protect our pilots.
<P>
The seizure of Irbil required a strong, immediate response. 
Failure to make Saddam pay a price would have emboldened him to
act again -- next time even more recklessly and more dangerously
for our interests.  We chose the time, manner, and place of our
response.  We imposed a strategic cost on him by expanding the
no-fly zone in the south.  We now control the skies from the
Kuwaiti border to the suburbs of Baghdad.  We have strengthened
the strategic straitjacket on the Saddam regime.
<P>
The Iraqi regime initially reacted to the expansion of the no-fly
zone by threatening coalition aircraft, but has stated since that
it is ceasing such threats.  However, we will judge Saddam by his
actions, not his words, and we will respond by the means of our
choosing.
<P>

The containment of the Iraqi regime is not a struggle only
between the U.S. and Iraq.  There is broad and enduring support
within the international community for containing Saddam.  Even
those who did not explicitly endorse our actions have no illusion
about the threat from Saddam.  The British and French patrol the
no-fly zones with us and have agreed to increase the number of
patrol flights.  Our regional friends -- including Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, and Bahrain -- welcomed the deployment of additional U.S.
aircraft and troops and have continued to provide the essential
cooperation on which our ability to contain Saddam depends.
<P>
In the north, the situation is fluid in the wake of the Aug. 31
seizure of Irbil and the subsequent KDP capture of Suleimaniya
and most of the Kurdish part of Iraq.  I met with KDP leader
Barzani in Ankara on September 18.  I left no doubt of our
government's view that reliance on Saddam Hussein's armed forces
could not ultimately serve the interest of the citizens of
northern Iraq.  Barzani said that Iraq's military intervention
was limited to Irbil.  He said the KDP was in the process of
consolidating its control over northern Iraq without Iraq's
assistance, and that his goals were to see stability
re-established through cooperation among the communities and
groups in the North, and to see international humanitarian
assistance resumed.  He hoped there would be continuing U.S.
involvement in the North.  He gave us assurances that he would do
his best to protect Americans and other foreign citizens engaged
in international assistance or monitoring and also any Kurds or
others who were associated with them.  We expect to continue
discussions with the KDP and other groups in the North and follow
developments closely.  We will also maintain contacts with the
PUK.
<P>
Because the situation is still uncertain, we have, with Turkish
cooperation, moved all those who were employed by the United
States and their families out of the North to facilities in Guam
where they are being processed for entry into the United States. 
We are working with NGOs who received U.S. assistance to compile
lists of their employees and families who might be endangered and
to move them out of Northern Iraq as well.  Mr. Barzani is
cooperating fully with these efforts.
<P>
The international framework of Security Council resolutions
remains intact.  The Security Council on September 3 unanimously
agreed to continue the sanctions.  We will work to maintain them
until the Iraqi regime complies fully with all UN resolutions,
including those dealing with weapons of mass destruction.  Saddam
must be shown that his refusal to cooperate with UN inspections
of Iraq's program for weapons of mass destruction is
unacceptable.  Finally, we will work closely with our allies to
keep up the vigilance of the international coalition that is so
vital to containing Iraqi adventurism.
<P>
Postscript: The Syrian Angle (per Chairman Gilman's letter)
<P>
In closing my remarks on Iraq, I wanted to address a specific
question from Representative Gilman regarding Syrian-Iraqi
relations.  We have heard rumors of a resumption of Syrian border
trade with Iraq.  The U.S. is opposed to actions of any state
which violate the sanctions regime against Iraq.
<P>
<A NAME="iran"><B>IRAN</B>
<P>
Since I last appeared before this Committee, Congress has passed
the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996, and President Clinton
has signed it into law.  The Department's Bureau of Economic and
Business Affairs, in consultation with my bureau and others, is
currently devising guidelines and procedures for implementing
this law.  We expect this process to be completed soon.  In the
meantime, we continue to work to deter foreign investment that
would increase Iran's revenues.  We also are gathering the
information needed to make the determinations required under the
Act.
<P>
The Act demonstrates American leadership to compel Iran to change
its rogue behavior, and this Committee deserves a good deal of
the credit.  This has not been popular legislation among most of
our friends and allies, but it underscores the gravity with which
we regard Iran's several threats: support of terrorism, including
support for groups that use violence to oppose the Middle East
peace process; pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and the
means to deliver them beyond Iran's borders; and meddling in the
affairs of neighbors.
<P>
The Sanctions Act and earlier steps by the U.S. have begun to
slow investment flows to Iran.  Last November, Iran hosted a
petroleum conference to promote a dozen projects Tehran was
opening for foreign investment.  Nearly a year later, not one of
these deals has gone through.  The U.S. has made Iran a more
risky prospect, economically and politically.  As long as Iran
pursues aggressive external policies, we will continue seeking to
deprive it of external financial support and to develop
international economic pressure to change its threatening
behavior.  The Sanctions Act helps us to do this and bolsters the
impact of the unilateral trade and investment embargo President
Clinton imposed sixteen months ago.
<P>
Securing the support of our allies is important to our overall
strategy of containing Iran.  Although the European states have
not participated in our embargo and do not support the Sanctions
Act, they have reduced their commercial ties with Iran.  The
European strategy remains one of engaging Iran in a "critical
dialogue," although the Europeans admit that such dialogue has
had little impact on Iran's behavior.  We continue to urge the EU
to add an element of economic pressure to its dialogue to
effectively challenge Iran's renegade activities.
<P>
Our allies have also agreed on the need to block Iran's efforts
to develop its conventional military capabilities and acquire
technology needed for its program to develop weapons of mass
destruction.  The Wassenaar Arrangement enshrines a commitment by
33 weapons-producing countries not to sell arms or sensitive
dual-use items to military end-users in countries of concern,
including Iran.  Russia, formerly Iran's largest arms supplier,
is a party to this commitment.  In addition, most nuclear
supplier states have agreed not to provide Iran with any form of
nuclear cooperation.  Russia and China remain important
exceptions to this international consensus.  We believe our
mutual interests are served by ending all existing nuclear
cooperation with Iran and we continue to make this case at the
highest levels in Moscow and Beijing.
<P>
<A NAME="gcc"><B>THE GCC</B>
<P>
Our Persian Gulf policy consists of two elements, of which
countering Iraqi and Iranian hegemonic aspirations is only one. 
The second is to sustain close political, economic and security
relations with the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
<P>
The U.S. works closely with the six states of the GCC to contain
the military threat from Iran and Iraq.  Working with U.S.
Central Command, we have made steady progress in improving
security cooperation with these states since Desert Storm.  Our
approach has three dimensions.  First, we help each Gulf state
strengthen its own defense forces through our defense sales and
training programs.  Second, we encourage regional defense
cooperation among the Gulf states through the GCC's collective
security arrangements.  Third, we promote bilateral U.S. security
cooperation with individual states.
<P>
In this last area, we have made dramatic strides since 1991:
increasing U.S. forward presence in the region in a careful,
non-permanent way; prepositioning equipment in Kuwait and Qatar,
and carrying out an expanded program of land, sea and air
training exercises with the GCC states.  We are also steadily
increasing our regional consultation and intelligence exchanges.
<P>
As the heinous bombing of our troops in Khobar, Saudi Arabia,
reminds us, security has many dimensions, including security from
terrorist attack.  In many parts of the Gulf, local and foreign
extremists work against U.S. interests as well those of our
friends.  As we respond to this threat, we must weigh measures to
preserve security and order against their potential to inflame
domestic extremism.  We believe that our current efforts to
increase security and economic cooperation both advance U.S.
national interests and increase stability among Gulf states.
<P>
Although internal tensions exist in many GCC countries -- notably
Bahrain -- the GCC states are politically stable overall.  All
the GCC states are able to work with internal opposition
effectively.  The rulers of the GCC states are acutely aware of
the need to address the reasons for internal dissent of a portion
of their populations.  While this internal political concern may
affect the scope of bilateral cooperation in some areas, it is
not evidence of a serious lack of internal stability.
<P>
The U.S. has considerable economic and commercial interests in
the Gulf states, and we are working hard, particularly within the
framework of the U.S.-GCC economic dialogue, to expand this
aspect of our relations.  We encourage Gulf states to privatize
and open up their economies, and to promote free trade through
easing investment restrictions and protecting intellectual
property fights.  Four of the six GCC members have joined the
World Trade Organization (WTO); applications for the other two
are under active consideration. Economically, as well as
politically, the GCC states are important partners for the United
States and linchpins of the peace process.
<P>
EGYPT
<P>
Egypt remains a key partner in the search for peace and security
because of its historical influence in the region and its close
relations with all parties.  President Mubarak has provided a
constant, constructive influence on the Israeli-Palestinian track
and has been instrumental in encouraging Syria and other Arab
states to remain engaged in the peace process.  The dialogue
between Egypt and Israel needs to be strengthened as the parties
to the negotiations grapple with both old and new issues.
<P>
The "Gore-Mubarak" Partnership -- officially known as the
"Partnership for Economic Growth and Development" between the
United States and Egypt -- operates through several high-level,
public and private sector committees to promote expanded economic
growth and job creation in Egypt and to strengthen economic and
commercial ties between our two countries.  We have discussed
with the Egyptian government, most recently during the July visit
to Washington by President Mubarak, the need for Egypt to
maintain momentum in its creation of a business environment
favorable to investment, including the implementation of policies
to spur privatization, liberalize trade, develop a unified
commercial law, create a dispute settlement process, and protect
intellectual property fights.
<P>
Economic reform efforts encouraged by the Partnership have begun
to pay off.  Since Prime Minister Ganzouri took office in
January, the Egyptian government has taken action to speed up
privatization, ease foreign investment restrictions and reduce
trade barriers.  The implementation of these reforms will help
promote economic opportunities and greater prosperity for Egypt's
62 million people.  We look to the Cairo Economic Summit to add
to the momentum of Egypt's growth and reform.
<P>
ALGERIA
<P>
The Algerian government has also made some headway in the months
since President Zeroual's election in November 1995 toward
obtaining a political consensus for a return to legislative
elections.  At a "national entente" conference held in Algiers on
September 14-15, Algerian delegates endorsed the broad principles
proposed by President Zeroual; however, several opposition
parties boycotted the conference, charging that the process is
insufficiently democratic.
<P>
The United States supports the government's efforts to foster
national reconciliation based on political pluralism and
democratic institutions, but our continued support is conditioned
on real progress.  Continued crackdowns on newspapers and
limitations on the functioning of political parties will call
into question the seriousness of the government's intentions.  We
are also concerned that the essential economic reform is
stalling.  I have held and will continue to hold consultations on
the political process -- including the need to open the process
to groups of all persuasions who reject violence, including
Islamists -- with both Algerian party leaders and government
officials.
<P>
LIBYA
<P>
Libya's renegade leadership poses a threat to the United States
and our allies through its support for terrorism and its efforts
to develop weapons of mass destruction.  Despite international
condemnation, Libya is constructing the world's largest
underground chemical weapons facility near Tarhunah, about 60
kilometers from Tripoli.  We have collaborated closely with our
allies to prevent Libya from acquiring the technology it needs to
make this nightmarish facility a reality.  No good can come from
a state sponsor of terrorism with this kind of destructive
capability.
<P>
On July 19, the UN Security Council voted for the thirteenth time
to continue its sanctions regime against Libya for another 120
days.  This vote reflects the Security Council's continuing
opinion that Libya has not yet met the requirements of Security
Council Resolution 731 concerning the bombings of Pan Am 103 and
UTA 772.  We continue to condemn strongly Libya's lack of
cooperation in helping bring these tragic episodes to an end, and
we will continue to support the international community's resolve
to see that justice is served.
<P>
Mr. Chairman, as you well know and as I stated earlier, the
President signed into law the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of
1996 on August 5.  Even as we work to establish mechanisms for
enforcing this law, we have already received many inquiries which
indicate that companies which once considered investing in Libya
are now having second thoughts.  This can be viewed as a
successful first effect of the Iran and Libya Sanctions
legislation.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
Mr. Chairman, the United States has a broad and complex set of
interests in the Middle East, and we face many daunting
challenges.  We have an equally broad, complex and ambitious
policy toward the region.  We have taken courageous steps toward
advancing peace and cooperation between the countries in the
region, assuming a role that only the United States can play. 
Sustained political engagement by the United States is crucial to
the future of the Middle East peace process and to regional
stability.
<P>
At the same time, security is the foundation of U.S. policy in
the Middle East.  This Administration has taken significant
steps, both in the United States and in the region, to combat the
threats of extremism and terrorism.  We will continue to deter
and, when necessary, respond to attacks against our allies and
against our interests.  Iran and Iraq's defiance of international
norms must not go unchallenged, and their adventurism cannot be
allowed to destabilize a region where peace has begun to take
root after so many decades of conflict.

<H2 ALIGN="center">THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT</H2>
<P>
For Immediate Release							  July 23, 1996 
</P>
<P>
U.S.- South Africa Binational Commission 
</P>
<P>
Science and Technology Committee 
</P>
<P>
	The Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Committee of the U.S.-South
Africa Binational Commission, headed by Vice President Al Gore
and South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, will help South
Africa meet the goals of its Reconstruction and Development
Program by applying science and technology to basic human needs. 
To meet this goal, the Vice President and the Deputy President
have focused the Committee's work on three objectives:  capacity
building and science education; food and environmental security;
and health care.     
</P>
<P>
	The S&amp;T Committee co-chairs, John H. Gibbons, Assistant to
the President for Science and Technology, and Ben Ngubane, South
African Minister for Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, have
made science education and capacity building a cornerstone of the
new bilateral relationship.  Specific projects aimed at math and
science education for South Africa's black majority include:
</P>
<P>
 -	Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment
(GLOBE) program, in which South Africa will join the Vice
President's initiative to give students hands-on experience in
taking environmental measurements and using computers;  -	Faculty
Enrichment Program at South African historically black colleges
and universities (HBCU's), in which the U.S. Department of Energy
and Florida A&amp;M University will train South African faculty
from the Technikon of the Northern Transvaal in science and
engineering.  The South African teachers will improve their
teaching skills and develop an advanced math and science
curriculum for schools in South Africa.  -	SUNSAT student
microsatellite program, in which NASA has agreed to launch a
South African student-built satellite in early 1997.  Younger
students will interact with the satellite through a radio
communications system.  In exchange for the launch, SUNSAT will
carry two NASA instruments that will give the satellite unique
capabilities in monitoring sea level rise, melting of polar ice
caps, and other important indicators of global change.       
</P>
<P>
Under the auspices of the S&amp;T Committee, the Department of
Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
and the South African Weather Bureau (SAWB) announced progress in
environmental monitoring and climate prediction.  
</P>
<P>
-	NOAA and SAWB have joined forces to better understand the
oceanographic phenomena known as El Nino and its effects in
southern Africa.  The project is already producing valuable data,
which can be used to predict drought, heavy rains, and warmer
temperatures.  The ability to predict drought up to one year in
advance could have a tremendous impact on agricultural
production.  Our new predictive capabilities will also help us
understand the climate conditions that are directly related to
outbreaks of vector-borne diseases like malaria. 
</P>
<P>
-	The S&amp;T Committee's Precipitation Enhancement Project is an
excellent example of the mutual benefits of this Commission.  In
the U.S., we use more water than we recover; in South Africa,
cyclical droughts have devastating results.  By taking advantage
of cloud-seeding technologies developed in South Africa and
computer models developed in the United States, we can improve
our ability to make best use of limited water resources.  	</P>
<P>
The U.S. and South Africa also agreed to join forces to combat
the threat of emerging infectious diseases.  Under the auspices
of the S&amp;T Committee, South Africa will become a regional
surveillance and response center in a global network called for
by the Clinton Administration last month.  The two sides will
also work together in the areas of telemedicine and biomedical
research, under a newly created subgroup on health. 	 	</P>
<P>
As a result of the S&amp;T Committee's meeting, the two sides
will also share information on science policy and technology
commercialization.  As a first step, the U.S. and South Africa
signed an agreement between the Department of Commerce's National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the South
African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR),
which will pave the way for cooperation in the development of new
technologies, advanced materials for building and construction.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>USIA: U.S. Policy in the Gulf -- Remarks by
Robert Pelletreau, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern
Affairs</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff><IMG SRC="usis2.jpg">
<CENTER><B><H2>Remarks by Robert Pelletreau,<br>
Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs<br>
Washington D.C., June 26, 1995
</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
Washington --  Although the United States still faces challenges
in
the Middle East, opportunities exist through the ongoing peace
process to ensure security and stability in the area, Robert H.
Pelletreau, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern
Affairs,
said in Washington June 26.
<P>
In a speech before members of the American-Bahrain Friendship
Society, Pelletreau expressed hope that with Syrian-Israel
military
talks now underway in Washington, "a real opportunity exists for
progress in these talks.  At the same time, he admitted, "we
recognize that these opportunities are not going to be simple
negotiations and that there are real gaps between the parties on
several key issues."
<P>
The Assistant Secretary also praised efforts by friendly states
in
the Gulf, particularly Bharain, and cited the "strong bonds of
cooperation and friendship between Bahrain and the United States
that "reflects the special relationship that has long existed
between our two countries."
<P>
He praised diplomatic efforts in the Gulf by Ambassador Abdul
Ghaffar, Bahrain's Ambassador to the United States and David
Ransom, President Clinton's representative in Bahrain, along with
Bahrain's Shaikh Issa, to build on the Middle East peace process.
<P>
Following is the text of Pelletreau's remarks: (Begin text) Thank
you, Mr. Ambassador.  Good evening friends, colleagues and
distinguished guests.  It is a pleasure to be with you this
evening
to pay tribute to the strong bonds of cooperation and friendship
between Bahrain and the United States.  This is a date we have
had
for some time.  I am sorry that unexpected travel forced
postponement of earlier dates for this get-together.  Let me
thank
Ambassador Abdul Ghaffar for hosting this event and recognize Tom
Bigley for his leadership of the Society and for the time, energy
and creativity he brings to your activities.
<P>
The American-Bahraini Friendship Society reflects the special
relationship that has long existed between our two countries and
peoples, a relationship founded initially on private humanitarian
contacts but which today has developed into a rich and
multifaceted
interaction involving business, academic and governmental
dimensions.  The U.S. Navy has had a particularly long and
fruitful
relationship with Bahrain.  When I first visited the Pearl of the
Gulf twenty-five years ago, I sought out U.S. naval officers for
briefings.  In preparation for my assignment as Ambassador to
Bahrain in the late 70s, I made sure to consult with Admiral
Bigley
and others at the Pentagon.  Recently at dinner with Bill and
Shirley Crowe in London, we spent much of the evening exchanging
reminiscences of our respective tours in Bahrain.
<P>
This Society's membership includes many of us who have a
professional interest in keeping relations between the U.S. and
Bahrain healthy and strong, but who also have joined to savor
fond
memories and to keep up with good friends.  We also share in
admiration and respect for His Highness, Shaikh Issa, whose
hospitality and kindness so many of us have enjoyed, and whose
wise
leadership has kept Bahrain safe and prospering in perilous
times.
<P>
The day-to-day management of our relations is in excellent hands.
Ambassador Abdul Ghaffar has played a large role in nurturing the
U.S.-Bahraini relationship since he arrived, and for that we are
grateful. His work here in Washington and at the UN has helped
extend and deepen our good relations.
<P>
President Clinton's representative in Bahrain, Ambassador David
Ransom, is likewise a distinguished diplomat who combines a rich
background of experience in the region with solid
political-military expertise.  He is joined by Rear Admiral Scott
Redd, a talented and worthy successor of several former
commanders
of the Middle East Force here tonight.
<P>
Let me say a few words about the challenges and opportunities
facing the United States today in the Middle East: opportunities
to
make further progress in the peace process; and challenges to
security and stability in the Gulf, including the pressures that
friendly states like Bahrain are facing.
<P>
Earlier this month I accompanied Secretary Christopher to the
region on a visit that helped create a new sense of optimism
among
the negotiating parties.  As you know, Syrian-Israel military
talks
begin here in Washington tomorrow.  We believe a real opportunity
exists for progress in these talks.  At the same time, we
recognize
that these are not going to be simple negotiations and that there
are real gaps between the parties on several key issues.  But
they
have narrowed their differences, and it is important that both
have
agreed to direct talks between their Chiefs of Staff.  We are
working closely with both parties to help move these negotiations
forward.
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis have also taken important steps
forward recently, and are working diligently toward a July 1
target
date for an agreement on implementing the second phase of the
Declaration of Principles.  Even if they miss this target a bit,
we
are encouraged by the prospects for continued progress on this
track.  The holding of Palestinian elections in the period ahead
would be a real breakthrough.
<P>
Jordan and Israel are following up their historic peace accord
signed last October by moving forward on joint development
projects
and cooperative undertakings in a number of spheres, as called
for
in the treaty.  Jordan is also preparing to host the Amman
Economic
and Business Summit this fall whose purpose is to engage the
private sector in new opportunities that are opening in the
region
as a result of progress in the peace process.
<P>
Additionally, the less-publicized multilateral negotiations,
which
bring together Israel, the Palestinians, and over a dozen Arab
countries as well as others, have continued to steadily expand
the
scope of their activities.  Bahrain has been among the countries
supporting these negotiations, agreeing to host the multilateral
working group on the environment last fall which produced a draft
Code of Conduct for the Environment, the first time that has been
done for the Middle East.  We believe work in the multilateral
track is of particular long-term importance to the region, in
that
such collective activities are forging mechanisms of interaction
that buttress peaceful relations.  The United States, in
encouraging the development of productive working relations
between
professionals with similar interests, the elimination of trade
and
travel barriers, reconciliation between countries of the Gulf and
Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, is not seeking to promote
domination of any nation or group of nations over others, but
rather mutual acceptance, tolerance, respect for religious and
cultural diversity, fair economic interaction and the peaceful
resolution of disputes.
<P>
Gulf Security Even as the region inclines toward peace, however,
we
cannot relax our vigilance against threats to security and
stability.  The Gulf in modern times has been inherently unstable
as Iran and Iraq have each sought hegemony.  The fall of the Shah
and the Iranian revolution were followed by eight years of
conflict
between Iran and Iraq.  It would have been preferable to see that
war conclude in mutual exhaustion, without victor or vanquished,
for when Iraq gained the upper hand, Saddam Hussein lost no time
in
seeking domination of the region and its resources.  We are still
living today with the consequences of his naked aggression
against
Kuwait.
<P>
Our policy toward Iraq remains unambiguous: we insist that it
comply fully with all relevant Security Council resolutions
passed
in response to its 1990 invasion.
<P>
Iraq still seeks to resist and evade the will of the
international
community.  Last October it once again mobilized military forces
on
Kuwait's border.  This past week UNSCOM Chairman Rolf Ekeus
reported to the Security Council that Iraq continues to withhold
information on its past biological weapons programs.  This is not
unexpected news.  It is consistent with the Baghdad regime's
failure to cooperate in accounting for Kuwaiti citizens and
others
missing in action in the 1990 conflict, its arrogant and
repressive
violation of minimal human rights standards for Iraq's citizens
in
the north, south, and even central parts of the country, and its
ludicrous claim that it is returning Kuwait military equipment
when
the junk it is turning over has clear Iranian markings and our
satellites can readily identify Kuwaiti equipment being used in
Republican Guard units.
<P>
The regime's stubborn defiance unfortunately exacerbates the
hardships faced by the Iraqi people.  In April, we and other
states
formulated a new Security Council resolution to facilitate and
simplify Iraqi oil sales to finance the purchase of food,
medicines, and other humanitarian items. Although Iraq's dictator
has rejected this gesture in a knee-jerk reaction, it remains on
the table as a way of relieving the suffering of innocent people
who are not our enemies.
<P>
Regarding Iran, U.S. policy is focused on Iran's actions; not on
the nature of its government.  We remain concerned about Iranian
support for international terrorism, its support for groups
violently opposed to the peace process, its threats toward
neighboring states and support for subversive movements, and its
pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and high-tech rearmament.
<P>
We have been working to focus additional international pressure
on
Iran to change this behavior.  On April 30, the President
announced
a ban on U.S. trade with and investment in Iran.  We invite
others
to refrain from actions that would provide benefits to Iran, such
as extending credits or investment guarantees or
opportunistically
filling in behind cancelled American contracts.  This will
further
tighten the economic constraints on the regime.  Our aim is to
convince the Iranian leadership that a change in Tehran's
policies
would be in Iran's own interest and that there are costs to not
doing so.
<P>
Iran's intentions toward shipping in the Straits of Hormuz have
also provoked concern.  Iran's military reinforcement appears
designed to enforce its territorial claims over Abu Musa and the
Tunbs islands, over which the UAE also claims sovereignty.  The
lack of Iranian response to UAE invitations over the past year to
settle this difference peacefully is unjustified.  Although there
has been some cutback in the alert-status of those Iranian
forces,
we continue to monitor them carefully in line with our concern
for
the freedom of navigation in this vital waterway.
<P>
Gulf Collective Security Our efforts to counter the threatening
potential of Iran and Iraq are complemented by bolstering the
defensive capabilities of our friends in the Gulf region.  We are
encouraging Bahrain and the other members of the GCC to continue
to
work together on collective defense and security.  We have
strengthened our own ability to act quickly in the region by
maintaining strong forces, by prepositioning equipment and
material, and by providing defense articles to friendly states.
<P>
Our goal is to complement, not replace the Gulf states'
collective
security efforts.  We do not intend to station troops permanently
anywhere in the region.  Our objective is to support our friends,
to deter threats, and to reduce the likelihood that we and our
allies would have to resort again to warfare to repel aggression.
<P>
As friends of Bahrain, we are concerned not only with external
threats to its security.  We are also troubled by the unrest that
Bahrain has recently experienced.  We recognize the government's
responsibility to guarantee public safety and security.  We also
appreciate the Government's efforts to find ways to address the
economic and political concerns that have fuelled dissatisfaction
among groups of Bahraini youth.  While the worst of this wave of
unrest seems to have passed, without posing a serious threat to
the
government or the country's stability, its underlying causes
remain
an ongoing challenge to be addressed.
<P>
As Bahrain in the past has demonstrated ingenuity and
farsightedness in developing its banking sector, its
communications
and transportation infrastructure and even its tourism industry,
and as it has invested heavily in education and health services,
its capable leaders must continue their efforts to give every
Bahraini a stake in the country's future, to provide employment
openings and social justice, and the opportunity for the
country's
youth to lead productive lives in dignity.  We are confident the
Government will meet this challenge as it has all others in the
past.  The announcement of a new cabinet June 25th is an
indication
of the Government's seriousness in bringing fresh energy and
initiative to this task.
<P>
America's ties and friendship with Bahrain reach back over many
decades and have grown with the passage of time.  We are all
proud
of Bahrain's accomplishments and have watched in admiration as
Manama has developed into a vibrant capital and international
center of economic and financial activity.  The U.S.-Bahraini
relationship has many facets: it contributes to regional peace
and
stability in an unsettled region, it generates a healthy trade
and
commercial interchange for our businesses, and it brings our
peoples closer together.  We look forward to many more decades of
close cooperation.  So let me take this opportunity to
acknowledge
these accomplishments, to express our continuing support for
Bahrain in the future, and to celebrate the special U.S.-Bahraini
friendship that has brought us together this evening.

Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1996</TITLE></HEAD>

<CENTER><B><H2>Remarks by President Clinton<BR>
At Signing of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996<BR>
August 5, 1996</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<p>
Washington -- President Clinton signed the Iran-Libya Sanctions
Act
of 1996 in the Oval Office August 5.
<P>
"We come together around a common commitment to strengthen our
fight against terrorism," Clinton said. "Terrorism has many
faces,
to be sure, but Iran and Libya are two of the most dangerous
supporters of terrorism in the world. The Iran and Libya
sanctions
bill I sign today will help to deny those countries the money
they
need to finance international terrorism.
<P>
"It will limit the flow of resources necessary to obtain weapons
of
mass destruction," the president said. "It will heighten pressure
on Libya to extradite the suspects in the bombing of Pan Am
Flight
103."
<P>
Following is the official transcript:
<P>
The Oval Office 9:42 A.M. EDT
<P>
CLINTON: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's good to be
joined
today by Senator D'Amato and Congressmen Cardin, Gejdenson,
Gilman,
King and Matsui; family members of the victims of Pan Am Flight
103; and two brave Americans who suffered the nightmare of being
taken hostage in the Middle East.
<P>
We come together around a common commitment to strengthen our
fight
against terrorism. Terrorism has many faces, to be sure, but Iran
and Libya are two of the most dangerous supporters of terrorism
in
the world. The Iran and Libya sanctions bill I sign today will
help
to deny those countries the money they need to finance
international terrorism. It will limit the flow of resources
necessary to obtain weapons of mass destruction. It will heighten
pressure on Libya to extradite the suspects in the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103.
<P>
From the skies over Lockerbie to Khobar Towers, from the World
Trade Center to Centennial Park, America has felt the pain of
terrorism abroad and at home. From the Tokyo subway to the
streets
of Tel Aviv, we know that no nation is immune. We have not yet
solved all these tragedies; we will not rest until we do so. But
one thing is clear: to succeed in this battle we need to wage it
together, as one America leading the community of civilized
nations.
<P>
Our nation is fighting terrorism on three fronts: first, abroad,
through closer cooperation with our allies; second, at home, by
giving our law enforcement officials the most powerful
counter-terrorism tools available; and, third, by improving
security in our airports and on our airplanes. Last week in
Paris,
with America's leadership, the G-7 nations and Russia agreed on a
sweeping set of measures to prevent terrorists from acting and to
catch them when they do. We have seen that when we pool our
strength we can obtain results. We will continue to press our
allies to join with us in increasing the pressure on Iran and
Libya
to stop their support of terrorists. We already have acted
ourselves, through our own sanctions, and with this legislation
we
are asking our allies to join with us more effectively.
<P>
With this legislation we strike hard where it counts, against
those
who target innocent lives and our very way of life. It shows we
are
fully prepared to act to restrict the funds to Iran and Libya
that
fuel terrorist attacks. America will not rest, and I resolve to
hunt down, prosecute, and punish terrorists and to put pressure
on
states that support them. The survivors of terrorism, the
families
of its victims who surround me and all the American people,
deserve
nothing less.

"Iran: Ban on Trade and Investment," 5/2/95</TITLE></HEAD>

<B><H2>Ban on Trade and Investment with Iran</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
<center><B>Statement by Robert H. Pelletreau<br>
Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs<BR>
before the House International Relations Committee<br>
Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade<br>
Washington, D.C. May 2, 1995</B></center>
<P>
Mr. Chairman, thank you for your welcome. I am pleased to join
you as we discuss our efforts to make the government of Iran pay
a price for its objectionable behavior. Two days ago, President
Clinton boldly projected American leadership in holding Iran
accountable
for its unacceptable policies. On Sunday, the President announced
his decision to issue an executive order banning all U.S. trade
with and investment in Iran including the purchase of Iranian
oil by American companies abroad. These new sanctions, in
conjunction
with our existing set of restrictions, will create a U.S. embargo
against Iran.<BR>

<P>
This was not an easy decision. It was the culmination of a
painstaking
review of our Iran policy. This action was chosen carefully to
advance those strategic U.S. interests challenged by Iran's
outlaw
activities. Our core concerns include: thwarting terrorism,
advancing
the ArabIsraeli peace process, fighting the spread of nuclear
weapons, and maintaining security in the Persian Gulf. By sending
a powerful political message to those who may have doubted the
importance we attach to these interests, the President's recent
decision will strengthen our hand as we again urge other nations
to adopt our approach toward Iran. His bold action underscores
America's readiness to lead by example. Only by imposing a real
and heavy price can we and other countries convince the Iranian
leadership that changing its threatening behavior is in Iran's
own interest.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Bold&nbsp;American&nbsp;Action<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
The President is expected to sign the executive order very soon.
The new ban will augment what was already the toughest set of
existing restrictions against Iran in the world. It will prohibit
trade with Iran by U.S. companies including overseas trade in
Iranian oil and U.S. investment in Iran. These new sanctions were
designed to build on our current prohibitions on imports into
the U.S. from Iran, and on exports to Iran of sensitive goods.
They will also expand the prohibition, imposed by the President
in March, on U.S. financing and management of the development
of Iran's petroleum resources.<BR>

<P>
The impact of the President's decision will be strong. Notably,
the executive order will eliminate trade in Iranian oil by U.S.
companies and their overseas branches. Last year, U.S. companies
and their affiliates purchased more than 20 percent of Iranian
crude oil exports. It will also eliminate U.S. exports to Iran;
these sales amounted to $326 million in 1994. It will ban the
reexport of certain sensitive U.S.origin goods. Finally, it will
prevent any investment in Iran by American firms and their
overseas
branches.<BR>

<P>
We know that these steps will results in some costs to U.S. firms
and workers. We will do what we can to limit the adverse impact.
We are convinced, however, that an embargo is the most effective
way our nation can achieve its goal of pressing Iran to abandon
its drive to acquire devastating weapons and its support for
terrorist
activities.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Worsening&nbsp;Behavior<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
The President's decision to impose additional sanctions is
grounded
in a policy established in the early days of his Administration.
With the President's support and under Secretary Christopher's
stewardship, this Administration has accorded a high priority
to American efforts to exert economic and political pressure on
the government of Iran so as to compel a change in its
threatening
behavior. To maximize the pressure, we have worked along a dual
track: applying unilateral restrictions and seeking multilateral
cooperation in pressuring Iran. We have had some important
successes,
but found nonetheless that Iranian behavior in areas of concern
has worsened. These disturbing trends led the Secretary to
recommend
to the President that he take new steps.<BR>

<P>
Let me outline the areas of concern. In particular, Iran's
support
of violent groups that conduct terrorist acts to undermine the
peace process has increased. In defiance of the international
community, the Iranian government maintains ties to rejectionist
groups like the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hizballah, and HAMAS
each of which has received funds, weapons, training, or
logistical
support from Iran.<BR>

<P>
The Iranian government has also intensified its efforts to
develop
weapons of mass destruction. These efforts, as well as Iran's
conventional military buildup, warranted additional review. Like
Congress, we have found reports of Russia's agreement to engage
in nuclear cooperation with Iran particularly disturbing. Given
Iran's petroleum reserves, the Tehran government's desire to
obtain
gas centrifuge equipment, as well as power reactors, from Russia
only bolsters our conviction that Iran seeks to develop its
nuclear
weapons capability. Iran has also sought to acquire light water
nuclear power reactors from China, and Beijing has announced its
intention to go through with such a sale.<BR>

<P>
Iran's persistent pattern of support for outlaw activities led
us inexorably to the following conclusion: Worsening Iranian
behavior
demands a response. Iran must pay a price for flouting the norms
of lawabiding nations.<BR>

<P>
In taking the decision to ban all U.S. trade with and investment
in Iran, President Clinton clearly signalled American
determination
to lead the effort among the international community in holding
Iran accountable for its actions. He also intended the government
of Iran to understand our seriousness of purpose. We hope our
action will cause the Iranian leadership to review its policies,
especially support for terrorism and the pursuit of weapons of
mass destruction, and to question whether they truly serve Iran's
interests.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Unmistakable&nbsp;Message<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
In making his decision, the President carefully considered the
economic costs and the national security benefits of an embargo.
He determined that if we are to succeed in getting other
countries
to make sacrifices in order to change Iran's behavior, we, too,
must be willing to sacrifice. As a world leader, the onus lies
on us to mobilize support. The President's bold step has
reinforced
our ability to secure the cooperation of all nations that share
our interest in international peace and security.<BR>

<P>
Secretary Christopher has already begun to redouble our
diplomatic
efforts with key countries to maximize multilateral support for
pressuring Iran. He is sending personal messages to our
diplomatic
partners, calling on them to review their economic ties with
Iran.
He is also asking them not to permit their firms to fill the void
left by American companies. In June, when the G7 next meet in
Halifax, the President will again urge G7 leaders to adopt our
approach. He will convey the high priority we attach to
containing
Iran, reiterate our mutual interest in changing objectionable
Iranian behavior, and stress the need for multilateral
cooperation.
The President's decision will also serve as a strong basis for
us to once again press the Russians and Chinese to forego nuclear
cooperation with Iran.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Multilateral&nbsp;Cooperation<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
U.S. policy toward Iran has long been characterized by strong
bipartisanship support. Similarly, there is general agreement
among the industrialized countries on the need to bring about
a change in Iran's unacceptable policies, although there have
been differences on the best tactics to use to reach this goal.
For example, some of the allies have argued that constructive
engagement will moderate Tehran's behavior. We disagree. We
believe
concessionary economic policies will encourage the leadership
in Tehran to think it can improve relations with the West without
changing its unacceptable policies.<BR>

<P>
In recent months, some allies have pointed to U.S. economic ties
with Iran despite the heavy unilateral limitations on this trade
as justification for maintaining and expanding their own
commercial
relationships. The President's decision will eliminate that
excuse,
and place the U.S. in the strongest position to encourage other
nations to adopt similar or parallel steps. Iran cannot stand
up to coordinated pressure from all of the industrialized
nations.
That is exactly the goal of the President's executive order: to
increase the effectiveness of our efforts to maximize pressure
on Iran.<BR>

<P>
As we seek the broadest possible multilateral support, we must
be careful not to jeopardize our own bilateral relationships with
other industrialized nations, particularly with the G7. In the
course of our review of Iran policy, we examined the issues of
extraterritoriality and a ban on financial transactions. In terms
of the extraterritorial application of U.S. law, we concluded
that the risk of alienating countries, whose cooperation we need
to maximize the effectiveness of our policy toward Iran,
outweighs
any potential benefit. Our policy would not be served by
launching
a series of drawnout legal battles with our closest friends. We
want to isolate the Iranians not become isolated ourselves. <BR>

<P>
We also determined that a prohibition on all financial
transactions
would undermine our role in international banking. Such a ban
would interfere with Iranian payments to Americans pursuant to
awards rendered by the IranU.S. Claims Tribunal in the Hague.
It could prevent us from meeting our obligations under the
Algiers
Accords (which ended the 197981 hostage crisis), and other
international
agreements. By contrast, our ban on investment will prevent
financial
transactions that could help stabilize Iran's economy without
running these risks.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Conclusion<BR>
</B></U>
<P>
Mr. Chairman, the Administration believes it is essential to
sustain
the close collaboration the executive branch has shared with
Congress
on the issue of Iran policy. We welcome opportunities, such as
today's hearing, to consult with you on this important matter.
We believe the President's decision to impose additional
sanctions
on U.S. trade and investment with Iran will dramatically
reinforce
American leadership in urging our diplomatic partners to join
us in pressuring Iran to change its objectionable behavior. We
believe our policy deserves the support of our allies, and we
hope they will respond to our lead. We hope, too, that the
President's
bold action will command the backing of Congress. <BR>

</H3></CENTER>
<P>The U.S. - S.A. Business Development Committee (BDC) was
established in 1994 as a high level means to facilitate the
reestablishment of commercial relations between the two
countries.  The Terms of Reference establishing the BDC were
signed by the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and then Minister
of Trade and Industry Trevor Manuel in Atlanta on June , 1994.
The inaugural meeting of the BDC was held in Washington, D.C. in
September, 1994.
</P>
<P>The BDC consists of 21 private sector representatives from
each country, selected by their respective governments.  The
committee has as its focus four principal areas: removing
obstacles to two-way trade and investment; improving conditions
for commercial activity in both countries; implementing
promotional programs to assist their respective business
communities enter the other's markets; and articulating
additional steps which may or ought to be taken to facilitate and
encourage the growth and development of commercial relations
between the parties.  Over the past two years, the BDC has
focused its activities in the areas of: finance and investment,
market access, technology transfer and business development.
</P>
<P>The BDC's  accomplishments over the past two years have
included: a soon to be launched Technical Assistance Center to
expand business opportunities for black South Africans, a legal
clerkship program to expand non-traditional access to the
commercial law field in South Africa, Intellectual property law
seminars in South Africa, financial services trade missions to
South Africa; and enhanced market access for S.A. products into
the United States.

Iraq/U.N.</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff><IMG SRC="usis2.jpg">
<CENTER><B><H2>Transcript: Ekeus Sees 'Overall Complacency'<br>at U.N. on
Iraq</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
Washington -- Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, Chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, complained that there is "overall complacency" within
the 15-member U.N. Security Council over Iraq's concealment of
weapons of mass destruction, particularly its effort to remove
Scud rocket motors from Iraq for technical analysis.
<P>
While he believes the "situation in Iraq is under control" now,
he told the Washington Institute for Near East Policy on January
29 that he is in the process of briefing the U.N. members in
order to get "a clear and coherent" policy in order not to allow
Iraq to misread the U.N.'s stance as expressed in the December 30
statement.
<P>
Detailing Iraq's pattern of concealing their weapons over the
years, Ambassador Ekeus said that the United States should take
the lead in this effort if it remains the view of the U.N. body
that "we should account for all these weapons" that are still
missing.
<P>
Ekeus expressed concern that there are a "significant" number of
missiles which Iraq has acquired that "we have not accounted
for," saying these "could constitute... a complete missile
operation force.  This is a very important statement, obviously,
as we once learned in the process (of ?) autumn '95 and last
year, '96, that Iraq prepared their missiles for biological and
chemical warfare."
<P>
Following is the transcript of Ekeus' remarks, provided by the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy:
<P>
(Begin transcript)
<P>
MR. EKEUS: Thank you, Bob, for this introduction.
<P>
Indeed, I had tried when I'd been here before to give a
comprehensive presentation of the work of the Special Commission.
But, as Bob pointed out, six years have gone, and it becomes too

much. I have to -- this time to pick bits and pieces and rush
maybe into the present situation. But I would like to encourage
during the discussion questions of importance which give -- can
shed light on the whole complex of issues we are to discuss
today.
<P>
But let us anyhow recall it was six years ago, fundamentally,
that the Gulf War and the -- in April '91 the Security Council
adopted this Resolution 687, which we called cease-fire
resolution. It was an interesting fact that it was a victorious
coalition that did not dictate the conditions for the cease-fire;
it was handed over to the Security -- to the United Nations and,
there, the Security Council to formulate the provisions. And this
was, I think, an interesting step in the history of the United
Nations -- to take over such responsibility. But it also puts a
lot of responsibilities on the United Nations, and we will see in
our discussions that it is not always easy to live up to these
responsibilities.
<P>
The agent, as Bob pointed out, for implementing a major portion
of the cease-fire resolution -- namely, items related to the
weapons of mass destruction -- that agent became the Special
Commission -- and to carry out that, in cooperation with the
International Atomic Energy Agency, with regard to the nuclear
component.
<P>
And the deal presented in the resolution was a very simple one.
It just said to Iraq, "Give up your weapons, and we give you your
oil." And of course, it is no small deal. We know we can now say
that if Iraq had accepted the deal from the very beginning,
outset, it would have gained more than -- up (to ?) today, in
export income, hundreds -- more than hundred -- $100 billion
worth if it would export its OPEC quota 3.3 million barrels a
day. And with today's price on oil, it is more a matter of $30
billion a year which is lost in the process.
<P>
Of course, Iraq can say, "This is not anything we lose; it is
income we don't -- can't make use of. But the oil is in the
ground and the money's in the bank." And the real loss is not,
therefore, of course, to compare with these numbers.
<P>
But anyhow, the deal -- the answer from Iraq was clear -- not in
words, but in deeds: There is no deal. This deal is no deal.
<P>
It was clear that Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq, who

decides everything, as we know, also decided to keep -- try to
keep both the weapons and achieve a relief lifting of the oil
embargo. And the way to do it was obviously to confuse the U.N.
inspectors. And I sometimes see in -- even in reputed magazines
and responsible writers stating that the U.N. inspectors have
been (sort of ?) cheated systematically and lost everything in
this process. And of course, this is something I strongly object
to. It is totally the opposite, and I will try to explain today
what is happening.
<P>
It is not in one case, I think, we really have been, in the end,
cheated. That doesn't mean -- so what I mean, who is losing here
is systematically Iraq. Iraq is losing every day that goes. In
the morning they wake up, Saddam wakes up, without right to
export his oil. Now we have this more limited scheme -- we can
discuss it later -- but fundamentally not -- he is politically
isolated. He has no possibility to develop his economy. The
infrastructure is deteriorating. And his people are suffering.
When he goes to bed, the situation is similar, only that another
day of deprivation has been added to the record. So I don't see
much of a triumph or success or strengthening in that (policy ?).
<P>
From the very beginning, from the very first days in April '91,
it was clear that Iraq -- which road Iraq decided to go. We now
can see that in the missile area, Iraq -- we talk about missiles,
ballistic missiles with a range above 150 kilometers, which is
prohibited. Shorter ranges are permitted. In that area Iraq gave
up something like 50, 49 missiles to the inspectors for
destruction, but decided to keep some 85 operational Soviet
missiles in various configurations, SCUDs, or the prolonged (sic)
version -- the various versions of al-Hussein: short al-Hussein
and long al-Hussein, and some other variations.
<P>
In the chemical area we now see that it was exactly the same
pattern. I don't know why they chose one-third, but they gave up
one-third and tried to keep two-thirds. For instance, if you take
chemical weapons, Iraq gave up something like 12,000 pieces of
chemical rockets, 122-millimeter rockets, and kept 26,000.
<P>
So -- and in the biological area, there it was a total denial:
"We have no biological capability, no biological weapons."
<P>
And in the nuclear weapons area, it was different. Iraq had no
nuclear weapons, even as, we know, they were moving very close to
one -- at least one nuclear weapon in the form of a nuclear

missile. But there we had, I would say, a gradual disclosure, a
denial of any nuclear program, weapons program, and then, in the
process, gradual, so to say, admissions.
<P>
Our approach to all these things has been to establish what we
call a material balance. That is, on the one side, account for
what has Iraq acquired through imports, through development and
through production, internal production, and on the other, of
course, what remains; that is, what maybe was used in the Gulf
War, used up in the Gulf War, what has been used up even in the
early war against Iran, when we talk about chemical weapons and
long-range missiles, and what has been accounted for in the form
of declaration and following up destruction of the weapons.
<P>
And the same goes, of course, for the production equipment. As
you know, it's not only weapons which are prohibited, but it is
production capabilities, production equipment and production
facilities have also been declared and to be destroyed.
<P>
Well, Iraq decided. We, so to say, have gradually managed to get
almost a complete picture on the one side of the balance, what
has been acquired. And that is, I think, no small feat. We have
to there depend on work with governments, and mostly, I'm sorry
to say, the Western governments were the ones providing the
technology, the machines, the machine tools and the methods and
the blueprints. Maybe others, especially, of course, Soviet Union
was a major provider of the missiles themselves, the weapons
themselves, concerning bombs, rockets in order to carry weapons
of mass destruction like biological and chemical. It was a mix of
home-produced bombs -- of home-produced delivery systems and
others bought from a number of countries which I'm too polite to
mention. (Laughter.)
<P>
So anyhow, we have -- I think it was very important, and
something which wasn't given for free. When I took up this job in
April '91, one of the first things I did was to write a letter to
practically all countries with the capability, I think some 75
governments in the world, and asked them, according to the
resolution, to come to me and tell us what they knew about what
has been provided. I would say it was a pathetic answer.
(Laughter.) Practically no one answered. And so we had to start
from I would say zero in the sense of try to -- thanks to -- our
inspection activities in Iraq gave us the leads. Then we had to
approach governments. Then we -- say, if we find the name of the
company on the machine -- because we went to that government and

asked to talk to the producer of the machine -- and, of course,
there became a lot of nervousness. "Oh, no, it was" -- you know
-- "sent through various channels. It was not sold." And then, of
course, we were not allowed to talk to the company. And
investigations took place. If it was a criminal investigation; if
it was too sensitive to give the information to us if it is a
criminal process; if it was no criminal process, they could, of
course, not give the information to us. (Laughter.) I suppose
they were innocent.
<P>
So our work had to build this sort of confidence in our ways to
approach it. And I think one of the key elements there was the
confidentiality. I think we managed to build, over the years,
trust in the methods. And the more and more I would say exotic
agencies started to deal with us after we established this
pattern of capability of handling sensitive material. And you
should know that the Special Commission in that sense is a very
-- it's a unique organization. It's probably the only one inside
the U.N. system, which is subject to systematic
counterintelligence and is systematically -- and has to work with
-- in an unfriendly environment, and -- if you recall any
peacekeeping operation -- is based upon an invitation by the host
country.
<P>
But we are imposed upon the host country. And we have, I would
say, a -- very active activities, a very active effort directed
against our work, against our personnel; classical techniques of
certain undercutting credibility or threatening, intimidating,
and so on, on (some say ?) the daily experiences for our best
people. So -- but anyhow, this confidence-building in the
international community has been a decisive factor. It's very
interesting for everyone involved, in general terms, in
non-proliferation issues, how important cooperation and
transparency is. But also how important capability to deal with
such information in a very -- in a protective and balanced way I
think are key elements for success in such a venture.
<P>
The mastermind in Iraq behind -- to carry out Saddam Hussein's
order to go for no deal was, of course, Hussein Kamel. And it was
no doubt a very interesting development when he defected in
August, '95. We saw almost -- there was a trend, I mean, almost
feeling, that Iraq was testing to give up at that stage its
concealment policy. Autumn '95 was a very interesting period for
us because a new openness was shown by the Iraqi side and we had
quite radical progress in the investigation work.

However, early '96, it appears that Iraq decided to harden its
persistence again. Obviously, somewhere there in January,
February last year, a decision was taken to stop the process of
cooperation and we ran into the usual policy of blockage.
<P>
Our response was to start a completely new campaign, in addition
to our other work. But maybe most significant was to prepare a
program for systematically focusing upon the concealment policies
of Iraq. And it was clear to us and we learned that Iraq
developed over the years methods to protect and hide a number of
weapons -- what kind of weapons, at that stage and today, we
suspect they still keep, and capabilities. Well, we think there
are small quantities left. And later on, maybe during questions,
I will describe what we have, so to say, found and destroyed, but
what remains. There is a number -- we -- we can't say that we
know there remains missiles. But we have not accounted for
missiles Iraq has acquired. And that is quite, I would say, a
significant number to the degree -- I mean, with the word
"significant" -- that it could constitute a force of missiles, a
complete missile operation force. This is a very important
statement, obviously, as Iraq, we once learned in the process (of
?) autumn '95 and last year, '96, that Iraq prepared their
missiles for biological and chemical warfare.
<P>
In the biological field, you'll recall that last year we found a
number of -- we cleared up, I think finalized the clearing up of
Iraq's production capabilities and destroyed the large production
facility al-Hakam. But that doesn't mean that Iraq is not still
concealing certain biological capabilities. Iraq has not declared
completely its biological weapons activities. On the contrary,
the so-called full final complete disclosure Iraq is supposed to
give to us is full of contradictions, misstatements,
understatements. And we again can only draw the conclusion that
there is something which is hidden behind the outrightly wrong
and misleading declarations.
<P>
In the chemical area it's the same problem. I mentioned already
the matter of chemical weapons Iraq was trying to hide. I have to
hasten to add we have identified most of these hidden elements,
and they have been destroyed by now. But still an advanced effort
after the Iran-Iraq war had been -- to say Iraq denied any
production activity after the 8th of August 1988. But through a
fantastic success by our inspectors, who penetrated some of the
remnants after the gulf war, some of the bunkers and managed this
year -- '96, I mean -- to penetrate into these bombed bunkers and

salvage the safe of the director of the (Fana ?) state
establishment, the big chemical establishment. And bringing out
that safe we found the reports on the quality controller. And
there we could see from day to day the quality of the production
of chemical agents, how much had been done and the quality after
the 8th of August '88, which Iraq had said was the cut-off date
for its production. When we confronted, I had the pleasure to
show these documents to Mr. Tariq Aziz in October. He said that
this person who was the chief of the quality control was a very
young man and very irresponsible, and probably stupid --
(laughter), and that could be the only explanation. That, of
course, hasn't satisfied us.
<P>
So indeed there are things which are concealed. And the campaign
of concealment has been focused against, first of all, the
missile hiding, but also to some degree against nuclear, chemical
and biological aspects, but the focus has been. And you probably
have seen in the media -- this is event since I was here last
time -- that we have been blocked.
<P>
Why have we been blocked? Well, when we go for concealment, we
have figured out that the responsibility for concealment are
central security organs of Iraq. It's not the army, and not
hardly even the Republican Guard, but something called the
Special Republican Guard, at least personnel and groups from that
organization is involved, and the security organs are the ones
who are responsible, protection of these items.
<P>
That means, however, that the same organs are also responsible
for the security of the leadership, and that creates, obviously,
a political situation and climate of tension and bring a very
serious element into the life of our inspectors. We have moved --
we moved in March, the first time we moved against such
institutions, locations (guarded and owned ?) by these organs.
Not surprisingly, we were blocked. We went to the Security
Council and asked for support, and after some coughing and
humming, they gave us some support in the form of statements. We
continued with -- armed with those statements and also Resolution
1060, on the Chapter 7, giving Iraq (an active ?) warning in that
respect -- continued, armed with this resolution and statements,
but we were again blocked.
<P>
We tried the diplomatic route. I, in mid- -- on the 22nd of June,
Tariq Aziz signed and I signed what we called a joint statement,
where Iraq undertook -- that was under the pressure from the

Security Council -- undertook in writing to give the commission
access to all locations it wanted or wants to investigate.
Without such a reservation on our side, we undertook to respect
legitimate -- Iraq's legitimate security concerns -- their
sovereignty, Iraq's sovereignty and legitimate security concerns.
<P>
Legitimate security concerns -- (now ?) the word "legitimate" is
obviously very important, as weapons of mass destruction are NOT
legitimate. So Iraq cannot evoke a security concern to protect
their prohibited chemical weapons or missiles.
<P>
(One could ?) -- the question with the word "sovereignty," what
kind of role it plays, as I said, there is no exceptions from the
right, but it is, in course, a decision to be taken by us when we
face such situations.
<P>
And I don't want to give an example, but I can say Iraq has a
tendency to expand, say, a presidential palace from the very
building and the grounds immediately around it into very large
areas; so-called presidential areas (will ?) cover now large part
of Iraq. (Laughter.) And we will, of course, not accept such
things under the sovereignty aspect.
<P>
We were hopeful about the -- and we also entered into the joint
program of action to -- which contained an effort to put the
political control on all activities. That is that Tariq Aziz and
myself established more or less a sort of directorate over the
operations, in the sense that we meet each second month and that
we, at these occasions, make an assessment and we sort of discuss
the future. But -- and one of the key elements in the joint
program of action is to establish what we call a material
balance, back again to that. So that means what has been acquired
should be accounted for fully. And politically, I felt this was
an important breakthrough that Iraq admit to that, and we were
quite optimistic after these statements.
<P>
However, very quickly Iraq managed to square the circle at our
next concealment inspection when we were moving again to another
place where we had good reason to believe missiles were hidden.
Instead of allow us, Iraq instead there blocked us on the road to
this, so that we never came to the facility and could invoke our
right to enter the facility. So it was a road blockage technique
established instead, and our inspectors were stopped with -- so
to say, point blank -- weapons pointed directly at them. So there
we again were blocked.


We came back to the Security Council, of course, and complained.
And you could see the sigh of, so to say, exhaustion in the faces
of these worthy personalities making up the Security Council.
"Are these guys coming complaining again?" (Laughter.)
<P>
And this is a matter which I must say it becomes more and more
difficult for us. In an effort to clarify some of the
concealment, we decided also last year to excavate missiles,
remnants of missiles, that is; destroyed missiles which were
secretly destroyed by Iraq, which we dug up in '92 and counted,
made a preliminary counting of, and then, so to say, buried them
again. We decided last year to excavate these missiles and make a
more thorough investigation by taking all missiles out of the
country and bringing them here to the United States where we had
convinced the Defense Department to give laboratory time at
Huntsville Laboratory for an investigation of these 150 -- or
remnants supposedly from 150 operational missiles; and to count
exactly how many real missiles are there and how many fake are
there to be counted as operational -- in that way, through a
simple arithmetic process, figure out how many operational
missiles have not been destroyed.
<P>
Iraq blocked us to carry out. They said we are not allowed to do
this. And we, of course, complained to the Security Council. And
they felt it was a good idea that I, anyhow, should go to Baghdad
in December. So they said let's wait and see what comes out of
that. I went to Baghdad in December and had some interesting
talks on several issues. But the matter of removal of these
missile engines was not (solidly ?) reported back to the council.
<P>
And, on the 30th of December, it issued a statement, which is
interesting. If you recall the Resolution 1060 earlier this year
-- in '96 -- it's again a rather stiff warning. They deplored
Iraq's behavior and demanded that Iraq should comply with our
demands. But now they said in this December statement -- 30
December -- that they reminded Iraq about its obligations.
(Laughter.) And it's like I have forgotten to pay my dentist's
bill. He (would probably ?) be as polite and remind me of my
outstanding bill.
<P>
And quite clearly Iraq took the message. And early January, we
met serious obstructions now on quite harmless things like
requests for documents, the removal of some chemical bombs for
investigation; declarations with regard to their Abadhil (sp) 100

program, the 100- kilometer-range missile program; and so on. And
the Iraqis say: "Well, you see, the Council is not backing you.
The Security Council is" -- so to say -- "not strong on these
issues. And we, therefore, see no reason why we should cooperate
with you," because this is the reason which may -- this is an
event, which makes us a little disturbed. I think Iraq is totally
wrong in its counting of the Security Council's position. But it
shows how important this interplay is with what is going on in
the field and the council.
<P>
So we are, of course, in the process of briefing the members,
familiarize themselves with the situation and hope that we will,
in the coming weeks and months, get together a -- clear and
coherent statements of policies, again because the leadership
must be in the hands of the United States, also to take the lead
and convince others if it is so that everyone is in agreement
that we should account for all these weapons. I can assure you
that these states in the regions are very interested and are
seriously concerned. They recognize that these capabilities,
which remain, at least have not been accounted for, constitute
powerful input on the whole stability in the region and, in the
broad perspective, also a powerful statement in relation to the
energy security of the United States and its allies and the
Western industrialized world, in general.
<P>
So these are the observations I would like to make as we start,
and I guess we will take questions from here on.
<P>
MR. SATLOFF: Thank you very much.
<P>
Given your half-a-dozen years in dealing with the Security
Council, could you offer some insight as to why the change, say,
from summer to winter in the approach of the Security Council
toward Iraqi noncompliance?
<P>
MR. EKEUS: Well, I must say that I think there is an overall
complacency in the sense that fundamentally the situation in Iraq
is under control. I totally, as I say, skipped the very important
fact that the Special Commission is not only looking for
concealment but, together with the IAEA, we have now in the
recent years established a monitoring system over the whole Iraqi
industry, its chemical activities, biological, medical, food
processing and so on, in every area where Iraq would -- should
theoretically be able to reestablish and reawaken its weapons
program. And this is a system which is based -- where we have a

center in Baghdad monitoring, where we have some 100 experts,
scientists and process specialists and supported by aerial
surveillance, communication specialists and so on.
<P>
So it's quite, I think, a good system, and they feel satisfied
that under present circumstances, Iraq will not be able
reestablish this capability without being detected. Of course,
they can throw us out, so that would be a (quick move ?). But at
least under present circumstances, I think there is the feeling
that the situation is under control and there are other
problematic areas on the global scene which one has to keep in
mind. So I think this is first of all -- I think we are victims
of our own success, to some degree.
<P>
MR. SATLOFF: I would like to turn the floor over to questions. If
I could also just inform you all we're testing a new audio system
today, so if you can't hear in the front to the back, then if you
could just, you know, put your hand to your ear and I'll be able
to tell whether or not the system is working properly.
<P>
First, Jessica Matthews (sp).
<P>
Q:  I was struck by your comment that in the fall of '95 you
started focusing systematically on policies and methods of
concealment, and I wondered whether UNSCOM's work has produced
insights and lessons that are applicable to the work of Western
intelligence agencies in other countries, whether, for example,
if you had the power to amend the NPT and the CWC and the
biological convention, that there are things that you've learned
in this exercise that could improve -- and the MTCR -- that could
improve all those efforts?
<P>
MR. EKEUS: Absolutely. I've been rather optimistic about the
possibility to have broader and more generic, if I may say so,
arms control or non-proliferation regimes. The key, I think, is
-- even for Iraq, with this relatively advanced country and focus
so much resources into the technology of the weapons, but even
there they are dependent -- Iraq is dependent upon pieces of
equipment, material to be bought. If one identifies such key
components in the production area, it is easy to mention what it
is -- which can be dual items, not prohibited, necessarily, but
dual-use items. But the -- it appears that it (crops up ?) in the
process of trade.
<P>
Iraq, for instance, has a system of some 15 companies positioned

in Jordan and they are employing some 600, 700 people. And they
are, of course, actively involved in procurement activities. But
it appears that it is not that difficult to get a hold on trade
of such items. Normally what sticks out is the size of the item.
You know, if you buy material for biological production, for
instance, and you buy a big fermenter, the question is again, why
-- you just go and look; why is this fermenter, so to say, have
that size? Or you buy growth media in an inordinate amount --
because the civilian use has its limits. And you see that type of
orders which have -- not because of the inherent -- what it is in
itself, but in its quantity, in its size you detect a lot of
things. And we feel that the export -- we have established an
export-import mechanism for Iraq which the Security Council
adopted, Resolution 1051. This mechanism started to come into --
it became operational the last autumn. That gives an obligation
to every state to report to the special commission items which
are not prohibited but which could be used to -- for production
of weapons.
<P>
One could believe that Iraq should protest very aggressively
against such a regime. This no doubt increases inside in this --
and Iraq had, of course, a balancing problem. But I think the
answer is given to me by the director of the Department of Trade
and Industry in London. He said "But if you put this regime into
place, it will be easy for us to trade with Iraq on relatively
sensitive items. Then it would be for us to trade with another
country," so to say semi- advanced country suspected for weapons
additions, prohibited weapons, biological, chemical, what it is.
<P>
Because a decision maker in London would be sure he will report
this matter will be declared and the -- it can be through an
international mechanism one can then assure oneself that this
item which is sold is not used for prohibited purposes. And
therefore you can gladly give licenses. And in that sense you can
expand trade on sensitive material.
<P>
And that's what I used to call the big trade-off. That's
transparency and trade. Through transparency, that gives security
that weapons of mass destruction are not produced and acquired.
And the transparency gives possibility to general trade to
transfer of technology, another -- (inaudible) -- so to say,
transfer of technology and transparency, because what we see now
a trend is the opposite. We have to now what -- the natural thing
we try to cut off, diminish the possibility of transfer of
technology, sensitive technology because we are afraid of the

spreading of weapons of mass destruction. And that means that we
also cut off countries from developing their economy and their
technology -- countries, maybe, who are on the starting point to
move up and become industrialized, advanced industrial countries
themselves.
<P>
We now see a cooperation -- (chuckling) -- I would say
constipated cooperation -- between technically advanced states,
members of MTCR, Australia Group, (and where we are ?), and we
try to cut off the big rest from participating in this work.
But we can break -- if we can break this whole, so to say, sad,
negative trend in the other direction and say, "Let's be open
about it; transfer (technology ?)," but that would mean the big
deal for those countries to acquire this technology. They have to
accept transparency, international inspection, openness. And you
see, that is the opposite. (As you ?) not only attack the MTCR
states, the Australia Group, I should equally (attack ?) those
other countries I know from -- I would say "bitter," but long
experience in CD, for instance, in Geneva, who say, "No, we
cannot accept transparency, and no foreign inspectors, no
openness." So this is the unhappy situation we are in today.
<P>
Q:  (Could we just ask you ?), does UNSCOM have a mandate to
report to the Security Council its conclusions about how existing
arms control regimes need to be strengthened in light of this
experience? Or is that beyond your --
<P>
MR. EKEUS: Well, of course we -- one key element to get the major
Western industrial countries to accept this arrangement was that
we protected sort of inside the international unit we established
ourselves with IAEA. We protect this or, say, if a delivery comes
from Britain to Iraq, we don't tell the Germans about the price
and the amount, or we don't tell the Japanese about that. And the
Japanese -- we have, of course, (company ?). So that is one
thing.
<P>
I (just added ?) this, but on your specific question, the council
is not interested -- you can't expect them to approach real
security issues. They're dealing with the problems of immediate
crisis. It's a crisis-management group. But preventive security
policy, I think, is far outside the reach of the council,
unfortunately.
<P>
MR. SATLOFF: Bob Friedman (sp)?
<P>

Q:  There seems to be a coincidence in dates. The Iraqis, as you
mentioned, went back to a hard line in January 1996 -- the same
time that Yevgeni Primakov became the foreign minister of Russia.
I wonder if you could share with us if, over the course of the
last year -- speaking, of course, diplomatically and off the
record -- (laughter) -- the Russians have been less helpful in
your in your efforts and both in terms of personnel under your
command and in the Security Council. Or has it continued as it
had been earlier?
<P>
MR. EKEUS:  Well -- (laughs) -- this is a very risky question to
answer, Paul, as you can imagine. It is a little confusing --
<P>
MR. SATLOFF:  It'd be a lot riskier if you were in Moscow.
(Laughter.)
<P>
MR. EKEUS:  Well, I am going to Moscow, and I have a meeting with
Mr. Primakov set on the 7th of February -- (laughter) -- so I
will probably get his reaction to my answer then. (Laughs.)
(Laughter.)
<P>
But it is clear that -- one would say, if one put oneself into
the clothes of a senior Russia official and were thinking about
this issue -- -- What is in the Russian interest? -- well, Russia
has, according to its own calculation at least, to expect
payments. Iraq owes Russia some $7 billion worth for weapons
deliveries and other delivery items. Iraq has promised that when
they get relief from the oil embargo, Russia will be up front.
They, of course, said the same to the French -- (laughs) -- and
to others. (Laughter.) But so that will be a later question; who
will be up front.
<P>
But I think the judgment -- Will there be a (lifting ?) -- how do
these countries support Iraq, to which degree are they prepared
to support Iraq's position. And that creates an enormous dilemma
for Russian diplomacy because I think the logical things -- and I
think the French have adopted that -- the logic is that put
maximum pressure on Iraq to cooperate with us and give up these
remnants of these prohibited items; simply that is, why should
one have chemical weapons in a time when we hopefully soon have a
convention? Biological weapons there is already -- (word
inaudible). So put pressure on them in order to get the situation
that the Security Council will be confronted with a decision to
lift the oil embargo. And there will be enormous pressure to lift
the embargo if the weapons issue is cleared. That is how the

resolution is drafted. I don't say that the U.S. happily will
accept this invitation. But it will be a very, very interesting
situation at that stage. So that would be logical.
<P>
But, on the other side, if Iraq today has a policy of both trying
to keep the weapons and get the embargo lifted, and you undertake
to support that policy, you are coming in a different situation.
I mean, I can imagine that you would get sweaty palms just
thinking on how to deal with such very complicated situation. And
I think what we can do -- what I will try to do is to help them
on the decision-making process next Friday. But we will see how
that works out.
<P>
MR. SATLOFF:  Tony Cordesmann (sp).
<P>
Q:  Rolf, you mentioned that there was a significant missile
capability they might retain, and that they might retain
biological weapons. I wonder if you could give us at least a
rough estimate of how many missiles they might retain and what
your concerns are with the number and types of biological weapons
they may still be concealing.
<P>
MR. EKEUS: On the missile, I don't want to give numbers. You
recall that when I was asked to, so to say, not -- to give a
presentation to Sam Nunn's committee in Senate, I said six to 16.
This was just to give a broad framework. As you know, in December
we had in the meeting between Tariq Aziz and myself in Baghdad
devoted especially to counting the missiles, and we went out, so
to say -- we went away from our normal principles. Normally we --
(inaudible word) -- from Iraq to make its presentation and we
verify the correctness; but we turned the table upside down and
said, all right, we are prepared to show why we have come to
these conclusions that there is a number of missiles, and we
would like to hear the reaction on it.
<P>
This seminar was a very -- I would say almost dramatic seminar.
There was, I would say, give and take, and it was not in a
friendly atmosphere, a very tough atmosphere, discussion. And it
ended that I came out with a feeling there are more missiles than
I suspected when I was going in.
<P>
Since then, we have had an excavation exercise, as you've
probably seen in at least the wire reports -- I don't think it's
hit the newspaper -- but in Iraq, on the initiative of Iraq,
because they learned a little of how we are counting. And we

found there remnants of four operations in missiles. But that
doesn't change in any way our continuing concern that there is --
there are missiles.
<P>
And what I have to add -- I said missile force, which is a change
of language from what I had last time. I said missiles. What I
mean with missile force is that we -- and that came out clearly
from the seminar in December, and Iraq had to admit. Iraq has an
organization to operate these missiles. They're are operating
capable. Iraq would deny that, but that's our feeling. They have
all the elements -- I mean, transporter, launchers, of course,
(filling ?), rocket fuel. They have all the necessary -- every
piece of what is necessary to constitute an operation force is
available in Iraq. So that was first of all our concern, that
they can activate that.
<P>
Of course, then on the biology field, Iraq admitted, in '95, in
autumn '95 and '96, further that they had missile warheads, and
these missile warheads to be filled with biological agent. It has
declared that 25 such warheads were filled in the moments before
the war broke out, the Gulf War. Of course, Iraq says since then
they have destroyed these, and the filling, of course, is also
destroyed. These missiles were filled with some anthrax and some
with botulinum and some with an old agent called aflatoxin, which
is not so immediate. It's a cancer agent that creates liver
cancer, but it takes some years to get that function. But the
other ones were, of course, more immediate, classical weapons.
<P>
However -- of course we are watching not only that, we are
watching, of course, bombs for biological. And Iraq admitted that
they had produced and filled a number of bombs with biological
agents before the Gulf War. However, there we are in
disagreement; we feel that they have more sophisticated bombs
than they have declared to us. And I don't want to go into more
detail what kind of sophistication because we don't want to give
Iraq all the cards.
<P>
Furthermore, there is spraying devices which we are concerned
about in the biological area, to be hooked upon some of the
airplanes they have. That means, of course, to have dried agents
preferably to liquid agent, and a dried agent is not easy to
produce. And there we are still -- it's a quarrel to which degree
they have succeeded in making the right size, the rather small
size you need for a particle size to get them functioning. So
they don't function as in agriculture, which falls down on the

ground, but it stays, so to say, in the atmosphere so you can
penetrate the lungs. There, these devices we also have not --
(inaudible). We have concerns they have -- I would say the whole
radius there has been tested and appears to be in the picture.
<P>
MR. SATLOFF: I must admit that's truly frightening.
<P>
Rocky Danziger (sp).
<P>
Q  You invited the question on the (Belarus ?)-United States, and
I am happy to oblige.
<P>
MR. EKEUS: Well, as you know, it was a matter which the Security
Council addressed already in 1991, when it adopted two
resolutions, 706 and 712, allowing Iraq to sell a limited amount
of oil. And the revenues from that should be for food and
medicine to Iraqi people. The distribution should be carried out,
according to these two resolutions, by the United Nations.
<P>
So Iraq chose to not accept them from what they call sovereignty
reasons. Obviously, it's clear that they politically didn't like
this. However, in the meantime, it played. And some other well-
meaning persons and institutions, governments, supported Iraq,
saying: "Look here. The sanctions are hitting the Iraqi people.
They are getting -- difficulty with food." I don't know starving,
but at least malnutrition -- I think it's indisputable -- and
problems with regard to medicine input.
<P>
But what we have to add that, in the meantime, Iraq has had --
used considerable resources for acquisition of weapons as late as
'95. I think I told you that Iraq imported very costly
high-quality missile-guidance systems that you remember some we
fished up in the Tigris, which were thrown there when they tried
to hide that, and others were blocked in cooperation with the
government of Jordan. So a lot of money went to other things than
to food and medicine. That's clear.
<P>
But anyhow, the Council decided, as a response I think to the
concerns by NGOs and others, to soften up the conditions of 706,
712; so with 986 want to -- fundamentally the same resolution
again, but said that Iraq shall -- should be allowed to (be)
responsible for the distribution of the goods, but there should
be a sort of observership by the United Nations. This covers
roughly one-fifth of Iraq's capability -- because now it is a
six-month arrangement only. But the council has stated that if --

they are intending to prolong this arrangement for another period
of three or even six months when we come toward the end of this.
<P>
As I say, it corresponds to something like now it's $2 billion
worth of oil per six-month period. And this amount should
one-third, roughly, go to the compensation commission which pays
out money to the victims of the Gulf War. A large number of
people there have big claims. And two-thirds will go to food and
medicine. (Audio break.)
<P>
(In progress following audio break) -- the grade of intrusiveness
of these monitoring. And now we are in the process of still
trying to interpret the memorandum of understanding. And so we
have still some problems with the full control aspect of it.
<P>
But money is starting to come in to the escrow accounts, started
specifically for this purposes. So it looks like functioning. But
-- and I think this is a wise decision, and it's a very (helpful
?) decision, and that helps the Iraqi people so they are not
deprived.
<P>
MR. SATLOFF: (Charles Krauthammer ?).
<P>
Q  (Off mike)?
<P>
MR. EKEUS: Iraq declared 50 missiles to us, which our inspectors
destroyed in summer '91. According to Iraq's present situation, a
couple of weeks after our destruction, the destruction took
place, they destroyed, in secrecy, the rest, the 85 missiles or
85 -- it depends how you count them -- let's say 80-some
missiles. And the question of course I put to Iraq now, and
everyone is now putting in his mind -- I put it to Tariq Aziz in
December -- is why seek the destruction? Why didn't you hand over
them to us if they only are to be destroyed so that we could
actually account for them? Of course they couldn't answer. (They
said ?) confusion. (Laughter.) But I said all their figures --
they did before, you wanted to manipulate these things. And that
is the big deal now. We made a preliminary counting.
<P>
And I must -- you take of course the -- (inaudible) -- part of
that, we were in a sense, they said, it was in March '92, Iraq
detected that we were very unhappy with the 50 they had given us.
It was not enough. So in March they approached me and said, Well,
it's so, we have also 85 others, and we have destroyed them, so
don't worry. And so what we did then was of course go to these

destruction sites and excavate them. And it looks very neat and
clean, because one site -- they say, Here are 21 missiles -- we
excavated, we found 21. Here is 18 -- we excavated, there were
18. And of course our inspectors were very happy and reported
this is going very fine. And so we counted these numbers.
<P>
Now of course we had also continued work. We had detected that
there was something fishy. (Laughter.) Well, we maybe should have
understood that from the beginning. But it was fishy, and it was
growing more and more clear that Iraq had manipulated these
burial places and the excavation by planting first of all
training missiles -- there is a certain low-quality training
missile which should then be counted as in operation. So if you
say the 21-site place didn't contain, when we investigated
further, 21 operational missiles destroyed, but say there were 17
operational missiles and four training missiles.
<P>
Furthermore, Iraq had the technique to account for missiles which
had been tested -- operational missiles, tested, and we had of
course counted -- (inaudible). And they took remnants of the
tested missiles and put it into the burial site, and then we
counted -- the idea was we should count that as another
operational missile. So we counted the same piece of metal
twice --
<P>
Q  (Off mike.) (Laughter.)
<P>
MR. EKEUS: So fundamentally it is that -- Iraq has admitted these
of course. And there are other manipulations with these missiles,
including that Iraq destroyed a missile by exploding it. That was
of course a mistake -- they should have melted it, because it's
more difficult to count then.
<P>
But what we detected, that was a (fuselage ?), but when we looked
closer many of these missiles were not destroyed as missiles, but
they were in pieces, and the engine was destroyed separately,
which meant that Iraq could take off turbo pumps which they
cannot produce themselves and very difficult to import with the
present MCTR arrangement. So they dismantled crucial elements
which then could be used in Iraq's own homemade engines, because
Iraq can make engines, but there are many important elements for
missiles. It's not enough with an engine. So this was also one of
the ways these secretly destroyed were manipulated.
<P>
And another way was to plant homemade engines, Iraqi-made engines

onto one of these burial sites, and where we excavate we counted
these as (operational Soviet ?). The gain, minus one. But the
fact -- but it shows (close in analysis ?) that we want to go to,
that these were Iraqi-made engines. Then we asked where is the
Soviet-made ones, the real ones, so to say.
<P>
So that is the whole scheme why we wanted to move these engines
out and make it sort of an investigation of each one of them, so
we could count how many are planted, whether they are Iraqi-made,
earlier tested or training which are planted there to give the
impression that they were operational.
<P>
MR. SATLOFF: Judith Kipper (sp)?
<P>
Q  (Off mike) -- I wanted to ask you a question that is more
political but technical. Since the -- (inaudible) -- for oil
question has been taken care of -- (inaudible) -- ? In the last
year or so there were a number of issues for oil -- there were a
lot of problems -- (inaudible) -- in the family. And I wonder if
that's reflected itself in the -- (off mike) -- what you are
describing as -- (off mike)?
<P>
MR. EKEUS: I think indeed it is not in itself alone the problem
for our -- reason for our worries. But it is linked to other
events, as you indicated, as the policy appears again to be to
keep the weapons and get the oil. These limited oil deals, in
spite of all the nervousness and concern which preceded the
acceptance of these deals, it looks like Iraq sees that one could
maybe expand on that oil deal for instance, and increase the
amount for the next period and to gradually move in the direction
of a complete lifting of an embargo, and in that sense also
undercut the (role idea ?) with embargo, which is to link it to
weapons.
<P>
So there is hope in Iraq, as I was told, that next year, that in
'96, in our meetings, next year, '97, you will see a breakdown,
if I may so -- "breakup" maybe is the right word -- of the unity
in the Security Council, and you will see a weakening of the
support for you. And that is probably the policy which is now --
one hopes that these will not be solved technically through
accounting of everything, but it be solved through political
fatigue and political attrition. So that is an element of it,
that gives some of it -- I don't say alone it is.
<P>
MR. SATLOFF: Leonard Kohl (sp).

<P>
Q  The thing that I get disturbed -- (many of us ?) -- is this
sense of openendedness about this. What more powers would you
think you would need or others would need to see an end to this
continuation of a chronic problem?
<P>
MR. EKEUS: Well, I would like to indicate that the situation
isn't good for Iraq. I indicate also that the monitoring system
in place, including the export-import mechanism, makes us
confident that we have very good hands on Iraq's capabilities.
<P>
What we need is a continuing support -- political backup so that
there is the will and stomach to keep us there, because the
situation in a sense isn't bad from our point of view. We have
the time, if we have patience. The only thing which makes me
nervous is just if there would be a deterioration of the
political situation, because Iraq is obviously searching for ways
and means to undercut us, to put doubts in the credibility of our
personnel, to get governments to sort of say -- put into doubt
our consistency and fairness. And this is an ongoing struggle. I
spend, I would say, more than 50 percent of my time on diplomacy,
on political issues and dialogue with governments, and pedagogic
exercises than on sort of running the operation. Of course that's
-- if it needs a lot of time on a daily basis, if we are
challenged every day -- this morning we had problems, yesterday
we had a problem. And we have to, you know, settle that --
blockage with flying problems here -- threats there and so on. So
it is an ongoing activity, but it is a sound one and we will
stick together I hope.
<P>
MR. SATLOFF: (Inaudible.)
<P>
Q  (Off mike)?
<P>
MR. EKEUS: Well, in the first place, the (question of material
breach ?) is considered nowadays a very important legal issue. As
you will recall, a couple of times in the operations or work the
Council declared that Iraq was in material breach. What does that
mean? It means according to the established interpretation that
if the Council finds that, that means that the provisions making
up the cease-fire have been broken, and Iraq is therefore
breaking the cease-fire, I would say, treaty which is --
(inaudible) -- the resolution, as you know, is adopted by the
Council and then accepted formally by Iraq. Because the coalition
delivered by withdrawing from Iraq and ending the war situation.

And Iraq had to deliver to say they were coming -- (inaudible) --
giving up their weapons and other things, recognizing Kuwait and
so on. So that was the problem -- the coalition's part was
already delivered, they had -- but the other deal, we had to wait
for Iraq to come. So on a couple of occasions they decided -- and
it was considered that if that means that a serious material
breach is a break of the provisions of the cease-fire, which make
it possible to bring it back to the Resolution 678, which is what
we call the War Enabling Resolution, the resolution by the
Security Council that made it possible for the military actions
directed against Iraq.
<P>
So at least the interpretation was done by some members -- the
United States and others -- that if you have material breach you
were free to take military action against Iraq under --
fundamentally under 678. The one is 678 and the other is 687.
That's the problem -- 678 is war and the other is peace, if you
want to say so. (Laughter.) And therefore this matter was raised
now when Iraq blocked our team -- especially when they blocked us
after the undertaking to give us complete access. There was not
support in the Council for that idea, so it had to be put aside.
So therefore we -- if there is a finding of material breach, it
does not mean one is obliged to take military action, but it is a
situation where there is, I would say, international (fund ?) --
there is law foundation for such action. That is, concerning 986,
then the connection is very, very complicated to see. I don't
think there was a direct link really between our work and the --
(inaudible) -- it's more the impact after it has been put in
place where we see some sort of arrogance and nonchalance from
the Iraqi side, in hopes of maddening, complicating -- you know,
confusing. And that's the thing -- because of lack of attention,
political attentions, they run (knee deep in the sand ?). So --
<P>
Q  (Off mike)?
<P>
MR. EKEUS: I understood the question from the first one --
(laughter) -- but I want to avoid to answer that, for diplomatic
reasons. (Laughter.)
<P>
MR. SATLOFF: Ken Zimmerman (sp).
<P>
Q  Well, there was a -- there have been recent reports that
Iraqis sent a high-ranking military delegation to Moscow on the
20th of December particularly for discussing a large contract
with the Russian Air Force -- (inaudible) -- large number of --

(inaudible) -- battle tanks. When you go to Moscow next week to
speak with Mr. Primakov, would this be something you would have
on the agenda? I know that conventional weapons do not
necessarily fall under the resolution, but is this something
you're concerned about? And what would be UNSCOM's role
eventually if such a deal would be concluded?
<P>
MR. EKEUS: Well, if you talk about so-called conventional
weapons, that's one thing, it's a different matter. But if you
talk about weapons, including spare parts for air, tanks, and so
on, that is specifically and separately prohibited, and this is
also separate. I would say there is a separate arms embargo in
Iraq outside the weapons of mass destruction. And I think that
will be fascinating to see the debate in the Security Council
between those who would hope to deliver weapons to Iraq and those
who do not want to go along with that -- (the day comes ?). But
first of all they have to clear the weapons -- (inaudible).
<P>
And, no, we will not -- I will not raise such issues in Moscow.
We of course look upon the -- we will emphasize the importance of
putting pressure on Iraq, and Moscow's central role is to
influence Iraq -- the weapons of mass destruction.
<P>
MR. SATLOFF: Bob Lieber (sp).
<P>
Q  I have an operational question -- (off mike) -- turning to
Iraq's military capability, Saddam remains invincible. But in the
-- (inaudible) -- Saddam were to reinvade Kuwait, to what extent
are the -- (inaudible) -- that you talked about? (Off mike.) To
what extent are -- can you keep those operational in the event a
conflict were to occur in the coming months or years?
<P>
MR. EKEUS: We -- as we indicated, we had a feeling that there are
important and essential items not accounted for. Say, in the
chemical weapons field, we don't believe that the (VX ?) agent as
such necessarily -- we don't say it's excluded -- it's stored in
Iraq. It has to be stabilized, as you know, and certain
technology to keep stabilizing an agent to not generate into
something quite innocent. But there are production capabilities
in Iraq which we fear can be activated. I've said before that I
don't think Iraq can activate such without being detected by us.
I didn't say we specifically -- we are -- I mean, we are some
middle-aged scientists, you know, we can't prevent things from
happening -- but we can observe it's happening and report that
this is happening and say that it's wrong.


But it is -- so there is -- I think Iraq could activate it,
provided we were thrown out or we were denied a presence there.
But we still have a very powerful -- I mean, we talked about
material breach just a few minutes ago. There are important
political and diplomatic talks available if the international
community would like to make use of it. So I think these
scenarios I think should be dealt with if there is attention
enough on the Iraqis.
<P>
Q  (Off mike)?
<P>
MR. EKEUS: I don't -- no, I don't think so, whether they need to
do some mobilization effort in -- concerning the weapons of mass
destruction. But, as I indicated, we are concerned with the
missiles, but the missiles should then be transferred back to the
military unit. It is not run by these (organs ?) I talked about
-- concealed by the (organs ?) -- but they must regularly be
transferred to the other -- (inaudible) -- military so they can
-- (inaudible) -- back again.
<P>
MR. SATLOFF: Paul Wolferitz (sp).
<P>
Q  I'd like to ask a question about -- (off mike). (Applause.)
That actually relates to question, because it's one of the things
that worries me and a lot of other people, which is what happens
in the longer term. It isn't just -- (off mike) -- but even more
serious -- (inaudible) -- what happens if at some point the
Iraqis really are -- (off mike) -- 687 is appropriate? (Off
mike.) Then instead of having to fear there was -- (off mike) --
all we'll have to have is one -- (off mike) -- and make sure that
they don't -- (off mike) -- they could do whatever they'd like to
do. Maybe it's an impossible question, but do you think it could
occur in a very real form -- (off mike)?
<P>
MR. EKEUS: No, that's very important, because this is a daily
question Iraq is putting to us, if we were to clear up everything
-- can you assure us that the embargos and sanctions will be
lifted? I think from the U.N. point of -- the United Nations -- I
have said I cannot see any way out from such an interpretation
with regard to the oil embargo, because the language is clear
that the weapons -- if the Security Council agrees that the issue
of weapons of mass destruction has been settled through a
monetary system in place, and no more items are concealed or
retained by Iraq which are prohibited, then the prohibition

against the import from Iraq shall no longer be in force. That is
close to a paragraph from the resolution, paragraph 22.
<P>
If the Council then decides to act according to that, which I
personally think they should do -- I can't see any way out from
that -- but I know this is contested mostly by the United States
government. But others will press this issue very, very hard, and
there may be a difficult situation. But now we talk so
theoretically.
<P>
It is quite clear that Iraq then will be in a position, if the
embargo is lifted and sanctions in general are lifted, to
challenge, by starting its weapon program, and push us aside, our
inspectors aside. And what can the Council do? There is a very
small prospect that you mentioned -- there will be a veto against
reenforcing the embargo, because of the enormous economic
interests involved in keeping the embargo off and not keep it on.
So I think those should reflect upon that, and I think
Washington, because of it is not officially prepared to think in
those terms, that it is not ready to entertain the idea. But
other allies of Washington are reflecting upon the situation.
<P>
And what you hear in the discussion is that the Council could
suspend the oil embargo, which means that -- and that suspension
will be conditioned upon regular reporting from the Special
Commission and the IAEA if its applicable -- say each second
month. We have a similar construction -- had a similar
construction with regard to sanctions on Serbia. That means that
regularly -- once, say, each second month, if the Council then is
reported that, Well, Iraq is behaving fine, there is no problem,
the suspension will stay. There is no more embargo, the embargo
is suspended. But if it is reported that it's a violation on the
way, Iraq is acquiring prohibited items, that will be enough with
one vote to block the continued suspension.
<P>
So if you understand me, is that there will be a proposal by the
president of the country -- can we continue next month, two
months, suspend the embargo? Yes, everyone is in favor -- it is
suspended. Can it continue? One vote against will veto -- can
then block this suspension and the embargo is ultimately put in
place and can be implemented by those who have the resources to
implement it. That is one, and probably one of the most probably
scenarios in the case of Iraq decides to move towards giving up
its weapons.
<P>

R. SATLOFF: I need to apologize to Phoebe and Charlie and --
(inaudible) -- and the rest that I am not able to get to today.
You can tell, Mr. Ambassador, by the number of people who have
stayed until 2:00 how intently interested everyone in Washington
is with this issue. And I can't underscore more than --
(inaudible) -- which has already said the deep respect and high
regard that we all have for your efforts. And we look forward to
having you back here in the future to give us a further progress
report on this effort. Thank you. (Applause.)

                        THE WHITE HOUSE
                  Office of the Vice President
______________________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release
July 23, 1996


         United States-South Africa Binational Commission


    REMARKS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY BY VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE
                            AT THE 
 US-SOUTH AFRICAN BINATIONAL COMMISSION JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE

     Good  afternoon.   I would like to begin by thanking all the dedicated men and women
who have worked so hard these past months to make this meeting of the U.S.-South Africa
Binational Commission a true success.  My special thanks, though, go to South Africa's Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki for the commitment and leadership he has shown throughout the BNC
process which we began here in Washington in March of 1995 and continued in Pretoria late last
year.

     Created by the clear vision and very good sense of Presidents Mandela and Clinton, our
Binational Commission exists to support one very simple, but fundamental idea that our nations
can grow stronger, wiser, more free and prosperous when our citizens join together in common
cause to confront common challenges, and to take advantage of shared opportunities.   

     We have accomplished a great deal since our last meeting.   Together, we have explored
ways to reduce pollution, conserve water, manage waste, empower and educate our young
people, protect our environment, improve agricultural practices, build free markets and free
minds, and help open the door to real economic opportunity for all our citizens.  
     
     By sharing experience and know-how, we also have been enriching both our nations. 
Since our Commission's first meeting, over 100 South African leaders have participated in
professional exchanges with their American counterparts. We also have launched the Mandela
scholars program which is providing graduate-level economics training for historically
disadvantaged South Africans.  

     These young people truly are the best hope for our future.  I would like to ask those
Mandela scholars who are here today to stand up and be recognized....  

     Each of you should know we are all very, very proud of you.

     If I may, I would like briefly to review some of the important new steps we've taken in
the past few days across the full range of our Commission's efforts, from promoting trade and
investment, to cooperation on agriculture, sustainable energy, science and technology, human
resources development and education, and our environment.    

     -- First, I am pleased to announce that earlier today, Ruth Harkin, the President of the
U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation, signed an Investment Fund Protocol to support a
120 million dollar private equity fund that will invest in businesses in South Africa owned by the
country's  majority population.  This new fund represents a major step towards spurring
investment, trade, job creation and growth in a new, robust and prosperous South Africa.  I am
proud that our Commission has played and important role in making this new fund a reality.  

    --  The civil aviation agreement we just signed also is emblematic of the many other
accomplishments of the BNC.  This agreement will restore formal aviation relations between the
U.S. and South Africa for the first time since they were broken in protest over apartheid more
than nine years ago.   The agreement is borne of mutual need and will serve our mutual self-interest.  
The flow of trade, investment and tourism between our two countries has grown
enormously in the last two years.  By recent count, one new American business per week has set
up shop in South Africa.  American tourism to South Africa has doubled in that same period. 
This new agreement will meet the existing need for more passenger and cargo flights between
our countries and provides for increasing scheduled and charter flights to meet the further growth
that is sure to come.  

     --  We also have agreed during this session to expand our cooperative efforts to combat
crime.  The U.S. will contribute substantially to South Africa's request for assistance to help
realize the full potential of its law enforcement forces. 

     Working together, sharing ideas and expertise, I know we can improve the quality of law
enforcement in both countries and can help each other ensure the safety and security our citizens
deserve.

     -- We also signed a Declaration of Intent to help bring South Africa into the growing
community of schoolchildren, teachers,  and scientists around the world that participate in a
program which we call &quot;GLOBE&quot;;  or &quot;Global Learning and Observation to Benefit the
Environment.&quot;  This is a hands-on science education program we formed at the beginning of the
Administration that links students, educators and scientist around the world through the Internet
to study our environment, and share data about our planet with scientists and each other. 
Already, some 37 nations and tens of thousands of  students participate in this important effort.  I
am glad that South Africa soon will become a GLOBE partner as well.  

     -- We also pledged today to proceed with a partnership to create a Fulbright Commission
which will improve and expand the ways in which Americans and South Africans study and
conduct research together.

     --  We are working with our partners in South Africa to build energy efficient housing,
and to promote the use of renewable and clean fuels, both by industry and in homes. 
     
     --  Our Peace Corps also will soon provide talented young Americans with the chance to
work with South Africans where they live to help improve education and foster good-will.  

     Through these, and many other initiatives of our Binational Commission,  the U.S. and
South Africa are building a matrix of mutually beneficial connections, programs, exchanges and
business ventures.  

     Some of those, like the civil aviation agreement, are bearing fruit today.  Others, like the
Mandela Scholars program and the Fulbright Commission, will pay dividends in the future.  But
these are all part of the same critical effort -- to establish a healthy give and take across all
aspects of our societies, and to nurture the possibilities of peace, justice, and prosperity for all
our citizens.  I am deeply proud of our work together.  And Mr. Deputy President, may I say that
I look forward to our next meeting in South Africa.   Thank you very much......  Mr. Deputy
President?

<P>For Immediate Release	July 23, 1996
</P>
<P> United States-South Africa Binational Commission Agriculture
Committee  	</P>
<P>Vice President Al Gore and South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki today announced the signing of the Joint Terms of
Reference that outline the functions and organizational structure
of the Agriculture Committee of the U.S.-South Africa Binational
Commission. 
</P>
<P>	&quot;Our interests lay far beyond respective trade between
our countries.  We believe work by this Committee can result in
rural development and agribusiness development for South Africa.&quot;
Vice President Gore said.  &quot;Agriculture joins five other
committees -- Human Resources and Development; Trade and
Investment; Science and Technology; Conservation, Environment and
Water; and Energy -- that provide a mechanism for high-level
discussions on mutual interests between our two countries.&quot; 
  	</P>
<P>The groundwork for the Agriculture Committee was done in
December 1995 during a visit by the Vice President to South
Africa for the second meeting of the U.S.-South Africa Binational
Commission.  The Committee, which is co-chaired by U.S.
Department of Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and Republic of
South Africa Minister of Land and Agriculture, Derek Andre
Hanekom, held its first meeting March 26, 1996.  Four working
groups were formed to address agricultural issues related to
market access, institutional development, agricultural technology
development for income generation, and sustainable agricultural
and rural development.  	</P>
<P>The Agriculture Committee also sponsored an agribusiness
forum in March that attracted more than 70 U.S. and South African
agribusiness representatives. The forum gave participants the
opportunity to exchange information on doing business in South
Africa.  	</P>
<P></P>
<P>Other major deliverables of the Agriculture Committee include
the following:  --	By the end of  FY 1996, 45 South Africans will
have completed short-term, individualized training in
agribusiness trade and investment in the United States under the
Cochran Fellowship Program;  --	 	USDA placed an agribusiness
advisor in Capetown in March 1996.   This advisor will act as a
liaison between the U.S. and South African Agribusiness
communities; 
</P>
<P>	A USDA Nutrition Advisor provided technical assistance on
policy formulation of a national school feeding program to the
South African Department of Health which began in mid-November
1995.  The Nutrition Advisor returned to the United States in
mid-February, 1996; 
</P>
<P>	 	Advanced research training fellowships will give promising
young scientists from South Africa an opportunity to obtain
advanced degrees in the United States;  	 </P>
<P>	More than 300,000 children's books and text books will be
provided to supply libraries in rural schools and communities of
South Africa;  	</P>
<P> 	USDA authorized $50 million in credit guarantees for sales
of U.S. agricultural commodities to South Africa under the
Commodity Credit Corporation's Intermediate Export Credit
Guarantee Program (GSM-103).  This is the first such program in a
Sub-Saharan African country; 
</P>

<center><b>Statement by C. David Welch, <br>
Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs.<BR>
before the House Ways and Means Committee,<br>
Subcommittee on Trade, Washington, D.C., May 22,
1996</b></center>
<P>
<U><B>Introduction</B></U>
<P>
Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Subcommittee, I would like to
thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today on the
important subject of legislation to impose sanctions against Iran
and Libya. Throughout the past nine months, the Administration
has been closely engaged in bipartisan discussions with Congress
about this bill. During these consultations, three key themes
have emerged. First, it is clear that we are all concerned about
the threat posed to U.S. interests by unacceptable Iranian
behavior.
In recent weeks, for example, we have witnessed the devastating
impact of Iran's political and material support for groups that
use violence against the Middle East peace process. Second, we
share outrage about Muammar Qadhafi's defiance of UN Security
Council resolutions, which call on Libya to turn over the
perpetrators
of the Pan Am 103 bombing and to cease all support of
international
terrorism. Third, we have agreed that we must take additional
American action to respond to these challenges by increasing the
pressure on these regimes. Amid this harmony of views, we are
now seeking the most effective way to increase the pressure on
Iran and Libya.
<P>
With your permission, my remarks today will focus on this
question
of effectiveness. What measures should we adopt to ensure that
our efforts to create economic pressure on Iran and Libya will
have an impact on Tehran and Tripoli that does not boomerang into
the United States? Our objective, as described by Secretary
Christopher,
is to maximize the pressure on Iran and Libya while minimizing
the costs to other American interests.
<P>
<U><B>A Brief Analysis of Iran and Libya</B></U><B> </B>
<P>
The unacceptable policies pursued by Iran and Libya are similar,
as has been our firm response to these threats. We object to
their
support of international terrorism and their pursuit of weapons
of mass destruction. To block Iran and Libya from obtaining the
military capabilities they seek, we have pursued a policy
designed
to thwart their attempts to acquire new equipment. For our part,
we established the strictest national export controls in the
world.
We then engaged in successful negotiations with 30 other
governments,
and obtained their agreement to prevent countries whose behavior
is of concern -- including Iran and Libya -- from acquiring arms
and sensitive dual-use goods and technologies for military
purposes.
In addition, we cooperate with other governments in an effort
to prevent either regime from acquiring items for their programs
of weapons of mass destruction. Our policies have also exploited
the financial troubles experienced by both regimes. To support
their militaries and terrorist activities, both Iran and Libya
need cash. The two countries are rich in oil and gas resources,
and consequently their economies depend heavily upon the export
sales of oil and gas. But because of government mismanagement,
including financial support for rogue programs, both Iran and
Libya are now experiencing economic troubles.
<P>
Since the Senate Banking Committee kicked off Congressional
consideration
of this bill last fall, the Administration has worked to develop
recommendations for this bill that are influenced by our
understanding
of the important differences between the two countries. Some are
obvious, like the differences in population, history, religion,
and form of government. Some are less apparent, however. One
important
example is the level of foreign involvement in the oil and gas
sector. Following the Iranian revolution in 1979, Iran refused
to permit western companies to develop its oil and gas resources.
Last year's decision to permit the French oil company, Total,
to develop an offshore field was a dramatic shift in Iranian
policy,
brought on by Iran's cash flow problems. Yet despite its desire
for foreign investment, Iran continues to put political and
economic
obstacles in the way of negotiations with foreign companies.
Libya,
on the other hand, has long welcomed foreign involvement in its
oil and gas sector, contracting over the years with some two
dozen
foreign companies for production and exploration rights. Located
just a few miles from southern Europe, Libya has worked hard to
develop close and lucrative business ties with European oil
companies.
<P>
A second crucial difference between Iran and Libya is the
approach
toward each country adopted by our allies. Following the Libyan
bombing of Pan Am 103 and of the French airline UTA, flight 772,
we worked successfully with the British and the French to
establish
global prohibitions on certain trade and transactions with Libya
at the United Nations. This international consensus about how
to respond to the Libyan threat has successfully restrained
Libya's
ability to engage in objectionable behavior. By contrast, few
other governments support the U.S. approach of economic pressure
on Iran. Despite their shared concerns about Iran's activities,
most other countries have been unwilling to take action that
would
jeopardize their trade ties with Iran. 
<P>
<U><B>The Approach of Our Allies and Trading Partners</B></U>
<P>
As you know, we engage in regular discussions about Iran and
Libya
with our G-7 partners and other nations. Together we review the
record of objectionable behavior created by Iranian and Libyan
activities. There is little disagreement about the threat such
behavior poses to our common interests. These shared concerns
have led other governments to work closely with us on export
controls
for military goods. Our cooperation on this important issue has
enabled us to constrain the military capabilities of both
countries.
Yet we want to eliminate the need for preventive measures by
convincing
Iran and Libya that it is in their interest to abandon
threatening
policies. It is here that we disagree with our allies. What is
the best way to convince Iran to change its behavior? What is
the best way to convince Libya to alter its behavior?
<P>
Our major trading partners, chiefly Canada, Europe, and Japan,
are strongly opposed to this sanctions legislation because they
consider it to be an attempt to force U.S. policy on their
citizens.
They also believe that trade-related sanctions imposed
unilaterally
by the United States will violate the principles of free trade
that we have worked hard to establish internationally. These
governments
are also reluctant to adopt measures that will mean a loss in
business for their companies. Some doubt whether economic
pressure
will succeed in altering the behavior of Iran and Libya. In
addition,
the Europeans -- especially the United Kingdom and France, who
also suffered directly from Libyan terrorism -- are strongly
opposed
to any new U.S. action against Libya that is divorced from the
existing UN consensus. They argue that other countries will have
no incentive to abide by the UN sanctions regime if the United
States acts independently.
<P>
As an alternative to economic pressure on Iran, the EU favors
a policy called &quot;critical dialogue.&quot; Japan and Canada
favor a similar approach. We do not object to the EU's policy
of dialogue with Iran, but we believe that dialogue without
pressure
is insufficient to bring about a change in Iran's policies.
Likewise,
although the EU expresses concern about Libyan behavior, European
countries have been reluctant to support our efforts to increase
UN sanctions against Libya. Until Iran and Libya are forced to
pay a cost for their actions, they will have no incentive to
change
their policies. The challenge for the United States is to
convince
other nations to join our efforts.
<P>
Like you, we have been disappointed by the lack of support from
our friends and allies for our efforts to increase the economic
pressure on Iran and Libya. We believe other governments must
assume more responsibility for the effort to contain threats
which
endanger us all. We also find it difficult to understand why
these
regimes merit financial benefits, or even &quot;business as
usual.&quot;
We would prefer to work in cooperation with our allies and major
trading partners, but we have told them we are committed to
responding
to these threats unilaterally, if necessary.
<P>
But, fundamentally, our allies and trading partners fully share
our opposition to the terrorist activities of Iran and Libya.
Like us, they do not want our common concerns to be overwhelmed
by our difference in tactics. Recently, many western governments
have begun reevaluating their policies toward the two countries,
in response to continued unacceptable activities, including
offensive
statements made by Iranian and Libyan officials after suicide
bombings in Israel. The EU, Canada, Japan, and other allies want
to see changes in Iranian and Libyan behavior, and our shared
objectives provide a strong base for continued diplomatic efforts
to gain greater cooperation for our policy of economic pressure.
<P>
<U><B>An Effective Solution</B></U>
<P>
Drawing upon these factors, including our understanding of the
policies and economies of Iran and Libya, and the concerns and
motives of our allies, the Administration has worked closely with
the House International Relations Committee, the Ways and Means
Committee, and the Banking Committee to craft the House version
of the bill.
<P>
Let me summarize the Administration's position.
<P>
(1.) We support sanctions against investment in Iran's petroleum
resources. Investment is the chokepoint of Iran's economy.
Blocking
foreign investment in Iran's oil and gas sector will have a major
impact on the country's economy by limiting its level of oil and
gas production, and thus the government's revenues. Fewer barrels
will mean fewer dollars. Moreover, we are confident that we can
succeed in this endeavor, because the mere threat of sanctions
is already keeping some foreign oil companies out of Iran. But
we believe sanctions against trade with Iran would be
ineffective,
and counterproductive. We simply will be unable to keep Iran from
acquiring those goods common to the oil and gas industry, which
are manufactured and sold by trading companies all over the
world.
And the costs -- both of trying to monitor and enforce such a
ban unilaterally, and of the retaliatory measures that other
governments
will take if we impose sanctions on their companies -- are too
high.
<P>
(2.) We support sanctions against companies that violate the UN
Security Council bans on certain trade and transactions with
Libya.
We have worked hard in the UN to build and sustain international
support for sanctions against Libya, including bans on certain
oil and gas equipment as well as prohibitions on the transfer
of military goods, aviation parts and services, and financial
services. Global restrictions are more effective than unilateral
American action. It makes sense to add to this existing UN
sanctions
regime. But we believe sanctions against investment in Libya's
oil and gas resources would be ineffective, and
counterproductive.
It is too late for us to stop foreign investment in Libya's oil
and gas sector, because some two dozen companies are already
working
there now. It is likely that the governments of these companies
would take action to protect them. Such retaliatory measures
could
have a harmful impact on U.S. companies and workers.
<P>
(3.) We support a modification that would allow us to avoid
imposing
sanctions against institutions that finance investment deals.
The administration is concerned that U.S. sanctions against
foreign
financial institutions would be costly to U.S. firms, could be
disruptive to financial markets, would reduce the attractiveness
of the United States as a financial center, and could invite
retaliation
against U.S. financial firms. We don't need to run that risk of
harming American banks and businesses. The fact of the matter
is that Iran needs more than just bank loans to develop its oil
and gas fields. Iran also needs the expertise of a foreign oil
company to pull off these multi-million dollar and multi-year
deals. A focus on blocking these companies should be sufficient.
<P>
(4.) We support modifications to the structure of the bill that
would provide the President with greater flexibility in applying
sanctions. We'd like to give the President the latitude to
respond
most effectively to each new situation. We will use the
legislation
to advance U.S. interests, but we need the flexibility to
properly
target our actions.
<P>
(5.) Finally, we support a modification to the provision that
would require the President to indiscriminately impose sanctions
against both parent companies and their subsidiaries, including
American companies, whether or not the party was involved in the
sanctionable activity. 
<P>
We believe these recommendations strike a responsible balance.
They will permit us to succeed in imposing additional economic
pressure on Iran and Libya, without causing a boomerang effect
that unnecessarily hurts other American interests. 
<P>
<U><B>Conclusion</B></U>
<P>
There can be no doubt about the commitment of the President and
Secretary Christopher to take tough action to respond to the
threat
posed by Iran and Libya. But they are also responsible for
considering
the full spectrum of American interests. We believe it is
possible
to craft a sanctions bill that maximizes the impact on Iran and
Libya while minimizing the unnecessary costs to other U.S.
interests.
We have carefully developed recommendations to do just that,
based
on our understanding of Iran and Libya and on our appreciation
of the factors that guide the approach of our trading partners
and allies. We know Congress shares our concerns about Iran and
Libya. We welcome the opportunity to continue our consultations
with the House Ways and Means Committee, the House International
Relations Committee, and the House Banking Committee. Together,
we can craft a bill that effectively increases the pressure on
Iran and Libya. <BR>

(Kuwait Assured on Sanctions Against Iraq) 
<p>
Washington -- A State Department official emphasized April 4 that
"there can be no discussions of an easing of the international
sanctions" until Iraq fulfills the obligations established by the
Security Council in the wake of the Gulf War.
<P>
John Craig, director of the Office of Arabian Peninsula Affairs
at
the State Department, gave this assurance at a seminar here
titled,
"A Partnership for Stability and Prosperity: Kuwait and the
U.S.-Kuwait Relationship."
<P>
The State Department official added that Iraq "must dismantle its
programs of weapons of mass destruction, account for the over 600
Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons and return Kuwaiti property
and put a stop to the human rights abuses of the Iraqi people." 
The seminar, sponsored by the U.S.-GCC Corporate Cooperation
Committee, is the first in a year-long series examining the
United
States' "special relationship" with the six-member countries of
the
Gulf Cooperation Council.
<P>
Other speakers at the seminar included Kuwait Deputy Chief of
Mission Abdul-al S. al-Qenaei, who has been named his country's
ambassador to India; David A. Hamod, Washington representative of
the American Business Council of the Gulf Countries, and Col.
Edward D. Bishop, director of the U.S. Central Command Liaison
Office at the Department of Defense.  Dr. John Duke Anthony,
president of the National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations,
moderated
the event.
<P>
Following is the official text of his remarks, as delivered:
(Begin
text) Mr. Ambassador, and distinguished guests, this past month
and
a half we have witnessed a series of important events that
highlight the very close friendship that characterizes U.S.
relations with Kuwait.  On February 28, His Highness Amir Jaber
al-Sabah paid an official visit to Washington, meeting with the
President and receiving calls from the Vice President and four
other Cabinet officers.  On March 13, First Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah participated
in
the Summit of the Peacemakers in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where he
carried the Kuwaiti Government's message strongly condemning
terrorism.  Just two weeks ago, former President Bush and His
Highness Crown Prince Saad presided at the official opening of
the
beautiful new U.S. Embassy building in Kuwait, a gift of the
Kuwaiti people to the American people.  As you can imagine, it
would be an understatement to say that former President Bush was
warmly welcomed in Kuwait.
<P>
I would like to describe some of the government-to-government
cooperation that is the basis of this relationship.  Starting
with
security cooperation and, foreshadowing the more detailed
presentation of Colonel Bishop, allow me to note what has been
achieved.  In September 1991 the United States and Kuwait signed
a
Defense Cooperation Agreement which has become a model for
similar
agreements that we later entered into with other Gulf states.
Under
this agreement, Kuwaiti and U.S. troops engage in one of the
heaviest combined exercise schedules in the world.  The U.S. and
Kuwaiti militaries are working closely to modernize and upgrade
the
Kuwaiti forces, to make them a powerful deterrent to threats of
aggression aimed at Kuwait.  We saw some early results of this
effort in October 1994 when Saddam once again deployed his
armored
divisions on Kuwait's border.  Kuwait's forces deployed quickly
to
the border in response and, together with a U.S. infantry
division,
thwarted Saddam's planned invasion.  We share the same view of
the
threats to the region and are working together to deter such
threats.  Our security cooperation could not be better.
<P>
We likewise are working very successfully in the diplomatic arena
to keep the sanctions on Iraq firmly in place.  In the UN and in
the capitals of Security Council members, our diplomats carry the
same message -- there can be no discussions of an easing of the
international sanctions until Iraq fulfills the obligations
established by the Security Council, that, among others, Iraq
must
dismantle its programs of weapons of mass destruction, account
for
the over 600 Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons, return
Kuwaiti
property and put a stop to the human rights abuses of the Iraqi
people.  Kuwait is a full partner in our sanctions enforcement
efforts in the Gulf, which will become even more important if
Iraq
accepts the UN Security Council Resolution 986 allowing it to
sell
oil for food and medicine under tightly monitored conditions.  We
will work closely to ensure that this humanitarian relief
provision
does not allow Iraq to evade the sanctions and its Security
Council
obligations.
<P>
The issue of Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons from the Gulf
War is intimately tied to Iraq sanctions.  The International Red
Cross maintains files on over 603 Kuwaitis and residents of
Kuwait
that the Iraqi occupation authorities took prisoner or were last
seen in Iraqi custody. These are civilians.  We in the U.S. know
the anguish caused by unaccounted for POWs and we are resolved
that
Iraq must tell the international community where these people are
and what has happened to them.  This requirement is one of the
UN's
cease-fire conditions for ending the Gulf War.  The Red
Cross-sponsored talks on this issue between Iraq and the Gulf War
Coalition allies provides the only regular face-to-face forum
where
we meet with the Iraqis.  The U.S. takes this issue very
seriously
-- we send high-level delegations to these meetings that include,
in addition to ambassadors, POW experts from the Pentagon.
<P>
U.S.-Kuwait cooperation extends to other key diplomatic
initiatives
as well. Kuwait is a strong supporter of the U.S.-led effort to
bring about peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors.  Kuwait
was the first country in the Gulf to renounce the Arab League
boycott on American firms that do business with Israel -- Kuwait
first announced this policy in June 1993 and then led the other
GCC
members to take this step in September 1994.  Kuwait has
generously
supported the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in the
West Bank and Gaza with funding for start-up costs.  This funding
came despite the fact that Kuwait does not maintain relations
with
the PLO. Rather, Kuwait felt obliged to help the Palestinian
people
on their road to autonomy and self-reliance and also to help an
important initiative of their American friends.  In addition, we
have the extremely strong condemnation by the Government of
Kuwait
of the recent bombings in Israel. Kuwaitis abhor this violence
and
are joining us in the struggle against terrorism.
<P>
This cooperation extends beyond the boundaries of the Middle East
as well. When the Amir came to Washington, he heard from the
President and others the importance we attach to securing the
fragile peace in the Balkans and specifically to helping the
Bosnians acquire the means and ability to defend themselves in
the
future.  Kuwait is already providing humanitarian relief to the
Bosnians through private organizations, but we are consulting
closely on Kuwaiti involvement in the international effort to
implement the Dayton Accords as well.
<P>
One growth area for U.S.-Kuwait relations is in the commercial
field.  Since the Gulf War, the U.S. has consistently been the
largest exporter to, and investor in, Kuwait.  In 1994, the U.S.
exported $1.18 billion worth of goods to Kuwait; in 1995, U.S.
exports to Kuwait rose more than 20 percent to $1.4 billion. 
While
our exports to Kuwait in the first years after Desert Storm were
weighted towards the military sector (Kuwait has purchased a
total
of $4.5 billion in U.S. defense goods), now military goods
represent less than one half of our export total to Kuwait.  On
the
investment side, the biggest event to date came in 1994 when
Kuwait's state petrochemical industry signed a $2 billion joint
venture with Union Carbide, which will be the largest
petrochemical
facility in the Gulf.
<P>
The future of our commercial relations, as with our traditional
government-to- government contacts, is indeed bright.  We are
working together in the security field, cooperating to maintain
sanctions on Iraq and support Middle East peace and seeking
greater
joint commercial projects.  Our embassy tells us that Kuwaitis
like
America's quality products and are growing used to American
institutions like Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Kuwaitis welcome the
American presence in Kuwait and they in turn are visiting America
in record numbers as tourists but also as students in American
high
schools, colleges and graduate schools.
<P>
I would like to close by stealing one of the favorite themes of
our
host John Duke Anthony -- that this growth in non-governmental,
people-to-people relations is crucial.  Yes, we share common
national interests in the Gulf, in the Middle East and indeed
throughout the world.  But for our two countries to reach full
understanding, our peoples must get to know each other better.  I
am happy to say that with the help of U.S.-GCC Corporate
Cooperation Committee and other groups, we are getting to know
each
other better.  This greater knowledge and understanding will help
me and my colleagues in the Government to do our jobs better.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>USIA: U.S. Policy in the Gulf-- Remarks by
USIA Director Joseph Duffey to the Bahraini American Friendship
Society</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff><IMG SRC="usis2.jpg">
<CENTER><B><H2>Remarks by USIA Director Joseph Duffey<br> 
to the Bahraini American Friendship Society<br>
November 8, 1995</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
Washington -- "Bahrain is well-suited to enter into the new
economic arena that is developing in the Middle East.  Over the
years, Bahrain has wisely invested in developing its banking
sector, and has worked hard to develop its health,
communications, and transportation infrastructure," Dr. Joseph
Duffey said November 8.
<P>
In an address before members of the Bahraini American Friendship
Society, Duffey, Director of the United States Information Agency
(USIA), praised Bahrain for "many years of wise economic
decision-making and forethought. A large number of American
companies have recognized Bahrain's positive economic climate by
locating their regional headquarters on the island," he said.
<P>
"Bahrain also deserves special recognition as a staunch supporter
of the Middle East Peace Process," Duffey said.  "The U.S. has
valued highly Bahrain's participation in the
"MDBO""MDNM"multi-lateral track of (Middle East Peace)
negotiations."
<P>
Duffey admitted that "the political climate in Washington often
forces us to think in the short term ... while overlooking those
states that have proven long-term friends."
<P>
He reminded the audience that "throughout this century, the U.S.
and Bahrain have cooperated, traded, and worked together on
political issues of major importance" and praised Bahrain as "a
vital partner in the goal of assuring a secure and stable Gulf
region."
<P>
Following is the text of Dr. Duffey's remarks, as prepared for
delivery: (Begin text) Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.  Good evening
ladies and gentlemen, friends, colleagues, and distinguished
guests.  It is an honor to be here tonight with all of you to
recognize the strong bonds of friendship between the United
States and Bahrain.  I would like to thank all of you for
attending tonight, and especially thank my friend Ambassador
Abdul Ghaffar for his energy and dedication in strengthening the
ties that exist between our two countries.  I would also like to
recognize Tom Bigley, former Commander of the Middle East Force
in Bahrain, for his active leadership of the Bahraini American
Friendship Society.
<P>
I would also like to acknowledge to all present our sincere
appreciation of His Highness Shaikh Issa and His Excellency the
Crown Prime and Prime Minister, Shaikh Hamad.  They have
demonstrated wise and courageous leadership over many years, and
shown continuing sincere friendship for the United States.
<P>
The political climate in Washington often forces us to think in
the short term and to focus on the burning issues of the day,
while overlooking those states that have proven long-term
friends.   Bahrain, an island nation with a history stretching
back thousands of years, has long been a reliable friend of the
United States, and it is heartening and proper that an
organization such as the Bahraini American Friendship Society
exists to help keep this relationship thriving.  The U.S.-Bahrain
naval relationship extends back decades, long before the Gulf War
brought it global attention, and our diplomatic and commercial
relations have grown steadily since the 1900s.  Throughout this
century, the U.S. and Bahrain have cooperated, traded, and worked
together on political issues of major importance.
<P>
U.S.-Bahraini relations today are in very capable hands.  I
already acknowledged my admiration for all of Ambassador Abdul
Ghaffar's hard work in cementing U.S.-Bahraini ties.  He is
joined in this endeavor by two excellent American officials
currently in Manama: U.S. Ambassador to Bahrain, David Ransom,
and Vice Admiral Scott Redd, Commander of USNAVCENT and the Fifth
Fleet.
<P>
The United States and Bahrain have worked closely for years in
bringing stability and peace to the Gulf region and the Middle
East.  The U.S. relies on Bahrain as a vital partner in the goal
of assuring a secure and stable Gulf region.  Bahrain has offered
more than just words of support. It has taken real action to
assist the U.S. in this important goal.  The U.S. and Bahrain
have worked hard on Gulf security for decades, and many in the
audience tonight have been important figures in building and
maintaining the Bahraini-U.S. commitment to achieving this goal.
<P>
Bahrain also deserves special recognition as a staunch supporter
of the Middle East Peace Process.  The U.S. has valued highly
Bahrain's participation in the multi-lateral track of the
negotiations, particularly Bahrain's hosting of the multilateral
working group on the environment last year.  We saw only last
month at the Amman Economic Summit more dramatic evidence of how
the Peace Process is creating a more dynamic and positive
regional and global economic reality.  Bahrain participated
actively in the Summit through its strong, high-level delegation,
once again proving Bahraini commitment to the peace process.
<P>
Bahrain is well-suited to enter into the new economic arena that
is developing in the Middle East.  Over the years, Bahrain has
wisely invested in developing its banking sector, and has worked
hard to develop its health, communications, and transportation
infrastructure.  Bahrain should feel very proud of the country's
ranking by the Heritage Foundation as third among 101 countries
in the world in terms of economic freedom.  Such a high ranking
can only have come about through many years of wise economic
decision-making and forethought.   A large number of American
companies have recognized Bahrain's positive economic climate by
locating their regional headquarters on the island.
<P>
Bahrain's past economic reforms and initiatives have rightly
earned it a high ranking from the Heritage Foundation.  These
initiatives have included the basic steps needed to institute
reforms in the field of intellectual property protection and
copyright protection.  Bahrain deserves our praise for joining
the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property
Organization.  These positive steps will be even more significant
when Bahrain joins two more important international intellectual
property agreements, the Berne Convention (covering literary
works), and the Geneva Phonograms Convention (covering audio
recordings).  Participation in all these frameworks for the
protection of intellectual property will establish a solid
foundation for the protection of copyrights in Bahrain.
Buttressing these international agreements, reformed copyright
laws and strengthened effective enforcement of those laws within
Bahrain would benefit growing Bahraini companies and encourage
even more U.S. firms to seek cooperative ventures with Bahraini
businesses.
<P>
In addressing the intellectual property rights issue, both
countries benefit from dialogue and comparison of our experiences
and successes.  This can be illustrated by the successful
resolution of a General System of Preferences problem between the
U.S. and Bahrain two years ago.  I am proud to say that USIA had
some part in this, through organizing a visit to the U.S. for a
key Bahraini official involved in labor issues.  In a one-month
trip through the U.S., both Bahraini and American interlocutors
compared their labor systems, issues, and accomplishments,
forming a dialogue that helped to resolve the problem to the
mutual satisfaction of both nations.
<P>
Dialogue is an important aspect of our relationship with Bahrain,
whether the issue focuses on security, political goals, commerce,
or culture. People-to- people activities and exchanges have
helped to cement all aspects of U.S.-Bahraini relations, and
active public diplomacy is a crucial aspect of our relations with
Bahrain.  Our U.S. Information Service in Bahrain, and the
Bahraini Embassy's constant efforts in Washington, have helped to
build personal relationships that form the foundation of our two
nations' friendship.
<P>
The United States Information Service in Bahrain works closely
with all aspects of Bahraini government and society, focusing on
ways of increasing dialogue and cooperation between our two
peoples.  In September, I spoke here in Washington at a ceremony
marking the 55th Anniversary of the International Visitor
program, a USIA program which brings citizens of foreign
countries to the U.S. for month-long visits to acquaint them with
the U.S. and its society.  At the same time, Ambassador Ransom
and our USIS post in Bahrain hosted a similar celebration in
Manama for Bahraini alumni of this program.  This event was
attended by a wide range of Bahraini citizens who had traveled to
the U.S., many for the first time, on this program.  This
distinguished group included three ministers, two former
ministers, five under secretaries, numerous academics,
journalists, and government officials.
<P>
I should also mention an exchange program of note which occurred
two years ago involving the Bahrain Center for Studies and
Research, the director of which, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad
Al-Khalifa, is a good friend of mine.  The Center, working in
conjunction with our USIS office, selected 19 student leaders
from the University of Bahrain for a USIA-organized program on
policy-making in the U.S.  This group visited several American
cities, where the students saw how the U.S. comes to consensus in
foreign and domestic policies, the role of citizen groups, the
role of the  private and public sectors in this process, and the
ongoing debates and discussions that surround public policy in
the U.S.  The students left the U.S. after two weeks with a
greater understanding of the American politics, culture, and
society.  Such programs are vital for the future of the
U.S.-Bahrain relationship, for we need continued dialogue and
understanding between the peoples of our two nations to maintain
the strength of our close ties.  I should mention that the
exchange I have just described was not only closely coordinated
by USIS and the Bahrain Center, but that the Center shared the
cost of carrying out the visit.  In times of austere budgets for
both our governments, this cost-sharing shows the value that both
governments place on our relationship.
<P>
To promote this ongoing dialogue, USIA works closely with
Bahraini educational and cultural institutions.  At Bahrain
University, we have cooperated on exchanges of faculty and
students through the Fulbright Exchange and other programs.  USIA
has been fortunate to work with professionals at the University
in the field of libraries, accreditation, and academic
development.  The high priority that Bahrain places on exchange
with the U.S. can be seen in the history of the country's
participation in the prestigious Eisenhower Fellowship program. 
Bahrain has sent more citizens per capita as  participants in
this highly competitive program than any other nation in the
world.  Finally, Bahrain has always sent excellent participants
on the Humphrey Fellowship program; one Fellow in the U.S. this
year is Bahrain's highest-ranking woman military officer,
currently studying total quality management and hospital
administration in Seattle.
<P>
As a moderate Islamic country with a long history of positive
relations with the U.S. and the West, Bahrain has an important
voice and role in the ongoing dialogue to build understanding
between the Islamic World and the West.  Bahrain has provided a
valuable forum for this dialogue.  USIS Bahrain has arranged
programs in cooperation with Manama's beautiful Bait Al-Quran
Museum, sponsoring American speakers on Arabic poetry, and the
role of Islam in the United States and the Muslim tradition in
the U.S. Such dialogue is imperative to countering the false
notion that the U.S. perceives Islam as an enemy.  Activities
such as these, and such as our gathering here tonight, are
important to strengthen and reaffirm the fact that the
U.S.-Bahraini relationship is a friendship based on mutual
respect and understanding.  By continuing to engage each other in
the fields of security and political cooperation, commerce and
trade, and culture and education, we reaffirm the respect and
understanding that is the grounding of our countries'
relationship.
<P>
Bahrain is one of our oldest and best friends in the Middle East,
a stable and important commercial partner that has made and
continues to make important contributions to Gulf security and
the Middle East peace process.  I am confident that these strong
relations will continue for many more decades, especially when
these relations are founded on the solid ties between the people
of Bahrain and the people of the United States.  I commend the
Bahraini American Friendship Society for its work in
strengthening the relationship between our two nations, and again
thank you for attending this event tonight.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>USIA: U.S. Policy in the Gulf -- Secretary of
Treasury Robert Rubin Notes Common Interests Between U.S. and
Saudi
Arabia</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff><IMG SRC="usis2.jpg">
<CENTER><B><H2>Remarks by Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin<br>
to the U.S.-Saudi Arabia Business Council<br>
October 3, 1996
</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
Washington -- The United States and Saudi Arabia have common
interests in maintaining stability and promoting a healthy global
financial system, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told the
U.S.-Saudi Arabia Business Council October 3.
<P>
"The United States and Saudi Arabia are strategic partners, both
in the Middle East and in the global economy," he said.
<P>
Rubin noted that the relations between the two countries has
become "much more complex and dynamic" as Saudi economy
diversifies, and he called on the Kingdom to "take bold steps to
create the conditions for long-term growth. ... Further
liberalization of the Saudi economy, particularly in the areas of
investment and financial services, will be a crucial step toward
a stronger Saudi economy."
<P>
Following is the official text of Rubin's remarks:
<P>
(Begin text)
<P>
I appreciate this opportunity to speak with a group that is
playing such an important role in promoting closer ties between
our two countries. Today, I would like to comment briefly on the
U.S.-Saudi economic relationship -- and the importance of working
together as we move into the future.
<P>
The United States and Saudi Arabia are strategic partners, both
in the Middle East and in the global economy. And just as we have
expanded our strategic relationship which began with the historic
meeting of Franklin Roosevelt and King Abdulaziz on the U.S.S.
Quincy in 1945, we are today expanding our economic relationship
through means such as the US-Saudi Arabian Business Council. You,
collectively, represent trade, investment, manufacturing and
finance and these are the basic sectors of both our economies.
<P>
The US-Saudi Arabia relationship is based on many interests and
goals that we share.
<P>
We both have an interest in the security of the Middle East. We
cooperate in important ways to maintain stability and encourage
peace.
<P>
And in the economic arena, we have a vital, important and growing
relationship. It, too, is based on common interests and common
goals.
<P>
We both face the issue of fiscal order. In the United States,
President Clinton has made this a high priority, with the result
that we have reduced our budget deficit by 60 percent in the last
three and a half years, after twelve years during which the
federal debt quadrupled, which has led to very favorable economic
conditions. Saudi Arabia faces a budget deficit challenge similar
to the one we faced a few years ago. I recognize how painful it
can
be to rein in spending, but I believe it is the right path over
the
long term to strong economic conditions.
<P>
As two countries where economic prosperity at home is
inextricably
linked to the strength and stability of the global economy, we
share a common interest in policies and institutions that promote
a healthy global financial system. We both prosper through active
engagement in the global economy. Saudi Arabia and the United
States have worked together closely in the IMF and in other
international financial institutions. Recently, Saudi Arabia,
with
strong U.S. support has moved to expand its multilateral ties,
for
example, by joining the Bank for International Settlements, by
contributing significantly to the expansion of the General
Agreement on Borrowing, and by taking steps toward joining the
World Trade Organization on fair and equitable terms.
<P>
As you are well aware, not so long ago, the U.S.-Saudi
relationship
was based predominantly on oil. Saudi Arabia is still the world's
largest exporter of petroleum, but now we have a much more
complex
and dynamic relationship. Saudi Arabia is our fifteenth largest
trading partner. And American businesses making everything from
nails to flat glass view Saudi Arabia both as a partner and as a
strong potential market -- as well as a gateway to the Middle
East.
Indeed, U.S. companies constitute the largest block of joint
ventures in Saudi Arabia.
<P>
This new relationship brings opportunities and challenges,
challenges which I am confident we can meet by working together.
At
the same time, each of our countries faces its own economic
policy
challenges.
<P>
For the United States, the challenge is to continue on the
President's path of promoting growth by reducing the deficit and
investing in areas critical to future productivity, such as
education and training.
<P>
For Saudi Arabia, the challenge is to take the bold steps
necessary
to create the conditions for long-term growth and to continue
playing an economic leadership role in the global economy,
particularly with regard to the Middle East. The economic
performance of Saudi Arabia, a nation dependent on exports for
prosperity, is linked to overall growth in the global economy.
Further liberalization of the Saudi economy, particularly in the
areas of investment and financial services, will be a crucial
step
towards a stronger Saudi economy. After all, Saudi Arabia
competes
for capital, as does every country, and reducing barriers to
investment will benefit Saudi Arabia in that regard.
<P>
Our framework for cooperation is already strong. The U.S.
Treasury
and the Saudi Ministry of Finance have been working together
closely to address bilateral issues. The best example is the
U.S.-Saudi Arabian Joint Economic Commission which has been
jointly
managed by the Saudi Ministry of Finance and the U.S. Treasury
since 1974. The Joint Commission is the largest that Saudi Arabia
has with any country. Over its almost 25 year history, it has
administered thirty different projects and employed several
hundred
U.S. citizens at a cost of about $1.7 billion, all of which has
been paid by the Saudi government. Most of these projects have
been
the kind where one could point to tangible results -- such as in
highway transportation, environmental protection, emergency
medicine, and hospital planning.
<P>
You are all aware of the tremendous efforts of the late Secretary
of Commerce Ron Brown to build greater business ties between our
two countries.
<P>
Our latest effort of cooperation is, of course, the U.S.-Saudi
Arabian Business Council, which has received strong encouragement
from the Department of the Treasury and the Ministry of Finance.
This organization, while only two years old, holds a great deal
of
promise and provides an important forum to discuss issues that
affect the ability of businesses to do business with each other.
In
particular, you can play a key role in encouraging small and
medium
sized businesses to be active in the trade, investment and
financial relations among our two countries.
<P>
As you are aware, this week we have had meetings of the G-7, IMF
and World Bank in Washington. While cooperation in multilateral
fora and work on the global financial system are both important,
these efforts can seem somewhat abstract to our average citizens.
They need to see concrete benefits from growing openness, trade
and
investment, and I hope that is what the Council can help
generate.
After all, when it comes to building economic cooperation,
governments can only do so much. Ultimately the measure of
success
of how well we grow and prosper together comes from how well
businesses succeed and consumers and markets prosper. Governments
can only offer an open door and create an environment for healthy
competition.
<P>
I believe if we continue to work together and cooperate on these
issues, we can promote strong economic growth and prosperity for
both our nations in the years and decades ahead. Thank you.

CEREMONY</A>

WASHINGTON -- Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Vice-President Al Gore signed an
agreement March 1, launching a &quot;new era in partnership&quot; between both the United States and
South Africa.

In a statement released by the Office of the Vice President, Gore said the commission will
facilitate business development, conservation and the environment, energy and human
resources development, education, science and technology.

Following is the text of the Gore statement:

(BEGIN TEXT)

Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and I have just signed a Statement of Intent to form the U.S. -
South Africa Binational Commission.  By doing so, we launch a new era in partnership
between our two democracies.  This Commission will facilitate cooperation so we can move
together in important areas of cooperation: business development, conservation and
environment, energy development, human resources development and education, and science
and technology.  The agreement calls for semi-annual Commission meetings to ensure
bilateral efforts in these key [sic] are moving ahead expeditiously throughout the year.  The
next Commission meeting will be held in South Africa to assess progress made over the next
six months and to set the agenda for future undertakings of the Commission.  Some of the
initiatives include:

-- Business Development Committee, co-chaired by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, held its
inaugural meeting last September.  The Committee reviewed plans for its next full meeting in
May in Cape Town, South Africa.

-- Secretary Brown also announced plans for a commercial law seminar also scheduled for
May in South Africa.

-- Conservation and Environment Committee, co-chaired by Interior Secretary Babbitt, will
support South Africa's successful wildlife management as a model of sustainable development
of wildlife resources for the rest of Africa.  South Africa will also be brought into the
GLOBE initiative.

-- Energy Development Committee, co-chaired by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, will be
looking at some initiative already under discussion with the South African Government, such
as a Renewable Energy Rural Electrification Pilot Program, construction of a U.S.
photovoltaic cell manufacturing plant in South Africa, and a program of scientific and
technical exchange between U.S. and South African universities.

-- Human Resources Development and Education Committee, co-chaired by U.S. Agency for
International Development Administrator Brian Atwood is looking forward to discussing a
number of initiatives with his South African counterpart, including: a Youth Employment
Skills Program, the Mandela Scholars Program for post-graduate economic studies, a
Fulbright Program, and a Labor-Management Relations Program.

-- The Science and Technology Committee, co-chaired by the President's Adviser for Science
and Technology Policy John Gibbons and Dr. Ngubane, who is here today with Deputy
President Mbeki will focus on completing negotiations for the Framework agreement on
Environment, Science and Technology Cooperation, cooperative programs in fields where
South Africa has conducted world-class scientific research, and the creation of a mentoring
program using U.S. scientists and engineers.

All the U.S. co-chairs are anxious to get to work with their South African counterparts and
they will be making plans for their committees to meet between now and the next full
Commission meeting in the fail.

The importance of PVO's and the private sector can not be over emphasized and the
Commission is a good vehicle to bring together the efforts of public, private sector and NGO
organizations.

Thank you all for coming.

<A NAME="story">MBEKI, GORE SIGN BUSINESS AGREEMENT AT WHITE HOUSE</A>

WASHINGTON -- Terming the United States bilateral relationship with South Africa &quot;critical
to the future of our world,&quot; Vice President Al Gore signed an agreement March 1 with
visiting South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki aimed at smoothing business relations
between their nations.

Gore said the agreement, which establishes the U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission,
&quot;will launch a new era in partnership between our two democracies.&quot;

The agreement calls for semiannual meetings of the commission to ensure that bilateral efforts
aimed at business cooperation operate smoothly.

Gore explained that the commission &quot;will facilitate cooperation so we can move [forward]
together in important areas of cooperation:  business development, conservation and
environment, energy development, human resources development and education, and science
and technology.&quot;

The vice president added, &quot;We have also agreed that this commission will reach out to
non-governmental organizations and other private sector groups and ask them to become fully
engaged&quot; with the commission's work.

[According to Commerce Department statistics, South Africa purchased $2,200 million worth
of U.S. goods in 1993, making it a larger market for America's exports than all the countries
of eastern Europe combined.]

Deputy President Mbeki noted that &quot;this is a very important day for South Africa&quot; because
the agreement moves forward &quot;relations that have existed between us and the United States
for very many years.  What it says is:  Having done the things we have done together that
gave birth to our non-racial democracy, what next do we do?

&quot;I think the next thing we are trying to do within the context of the U.S.-Africa Binational
Commission,&quot; Mbeki added, is to say:  &quot;There can be a non-racial world.  There can be a
manner of interaction such that those who have more...can share in a way that can produce a
better world for all.&quot;

Clinton Remarks, 9/4/96</TITLE></HEAD>

<CENTER><B><H2>Remarks on Iraq<BR>
By President Clinton<br></H2>
Oval Office, September 4, 1996</B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
President Clinton told reporters in the Oval Office
September 4 that according to the information he has received
from Defense Secretary Perry on damage inflicted on Iraqi
military facilities, "the missile strikes that were conducted
over the last two days had been successful."
<P>
During a photo op for reporters during his weekly luncheon with
Vice President Gore, Clinton said "the targets were either
destroyed or sufficiently damaged so that we can say that our
mission has been achieved.  That made it possible for us to
implement the expanded no-fly zone today, and I want to commend
the military once again for the exceptional job they have done in
carrying out this mission."
<P>
Following is the official transcript from the White House:
<P>
(Begin transcript)
<P>
CLINTON:  Good afternoon.  I am pleased to report that according
to the information I have received from Secretary Perry today,
the air strikes, the missile strikes that were conducted over the
last two days had been successful.  The targets were either
destroyed or sufficiently damaged so that we can say that our
mission has been achieved.  That made it possible for us to
implement the expanded no-fly zone today, and I want to commend
the military once again for the exceptional job they have done in
carrying out this mission.
<P>
Now, what has happened is that this has changed the strategic
situation, particularly in the southern part of Iraq, which
Saddam used as a staging ground for his invasion of Kuwait, and
then in 1994 for the massing of his troops near the Kuwaiti
border.  He is strategically worse off than he was before these
strikes began, and I am satisfied that this was an appropriate
measured response.
<P>
Obviously, we can't predict entirely what Saddam Hussein will do,
but now he knows that there is a price to be paid for stepping
over the line that the United Nations resolutions imposed.
<P>
The Vice President and I are about to start our weekly lunch and
we'll be discussing this further, but I did want to make this
report.  I'm very pleased by the results this morning, that we
have.
<P>
QUESTION:  Mr. President, there are reports of explosions in
Baghdad.  Are you aware of anything going on, or --
<P>
ANSWER:  I have received the reports of the explosions; I do not
know anything about them.  I can tell you that they are not the
product of any action that we have taken.
<P>
Q:  Are you disappointed, Mr. President, with the lack of public
support from the former coalition partners, and does that mean
that the coalition is dead?
<P>
A:  I don't think it's dead; I think quite to the contrary.  We
have received good support from the British.   The Prime Minister
of Canada called me last night.  The German Chancellor issued a
strong statement.  I think that our Arab partners clearly
understand what we were doing and what the risks are, and we're
still flying the no-fly zone out of bases in Saudi Arabia, so I
think things are on track and I feel good about it.  This was an
action that I thought we had to take, it was a measured, strong,
appropriate action, and I believe we did the right thing.
<P>
Q:  Mr. President, after twin missile strikes yesterday there
were two challenges today by Saddam's forces against the United
States.  Does this raise questions about whether you've really
knocked out his ability to hit American planes or Allied planes?
<P>
A:  There was a fixing on one of our planes that occurred from a
site north of the 33rd Parallel, but it does not.  We believe we
can fly this expanded no-fly zone now.  It gives us an attempt to
measure, or it gives us the capacity to measure what he's doing
all the way up to the southern suburbs of Baghdad.  So I think
we're in good shape there.
<P>
Now, we will do whatever we have to do in the future to protect
our pilots and to protect their ability to fly the no-fly zone in
safety.  We will do whatever we have to do.  But I'm satisfied
that this mission has achieved the objectives we set out for it,
and our defense advisors, from the Secretary of Defense to
General Shalikashvili, to our commander in the area, all believe
that we did what was necessary and they feel good about where we
are now.
<P>
Q:  Has the situation in northern Iraq changed, though?  That's
the key question, isn't it?
<P>
A:  No.  The key question is -- well, first of all, the situation
in northern Iraq seems to have changed.  There has been a
withdrawal of the forces, a dispersal of the forces.  But it's
too soon to say that this is permanent or that further action
will not be taken.
<P>
What we have done is to show that we are prepared to change the
strategic realities that Saddam Hussein faces if he violates the
U.N. prohibitions on either threatening his neighbors or
repressing his own people.  And I believe that we did the right
thing, I think we had the right response, and I think it will
have good results.  If it doesn't, we'll take the facts as they
come.

<CENTER><B><H2>Report to Congress by President Clinton<br>
on Iraq's Compliance With UNSC Resolutions</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
Washington -- "Iraq remains a serious threat to regional peace
and stability. I remain determined to see Iraq comply fully with
all of its obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions,"
President Clinton said in a January 7 letter to Congress on the
status of efforts to obtain Iraq's compliance with the
resolutions adopted by the UNSC.
<P>
"My Administration will continue to oppose any relaxation of
sanctions until Iraq demonstrates its peaceful intentions through
such compliance," the president said in his report, which covers
the period from November 4, 1996, to the present.
<P>
Among the violations of UNSC resolutions cited by Clinton were:
<UL>
<li>Saddam Hussein's continued efforts to try to manipulate local
rivalries in northern Iraq to his advantage;

<li>Iraq's ongoing efforts to conceal evidence of its weapons of
mass destruction (WMD) programs;

<li>Iraq continues to stall and obfuscate rather than work in
good
faith toward accounting for the hundreds of Kuwaitis and
third-country nationals who disappeared at the hands of Iraqi
authorities during the occupation. It has also failed to return
all of the stolen Kuwaiti military equipment and the priceless
Kuwaiti cultural and historical artifacts, which were looted
during the occupation;
<li>Iraq's repression of its Shi'a population continues with
policies aimed at destroying the Marsh Arabs' way of life in
Southern Iraq, as well as the ecology of the southern marshes;
<li>The human rights situation throughout Iraq remains unchanged.
Saddam Hussein shows no signs of complying with UNSCR 688, which
demands that Iraq cease the repression of its own people.
</UL>
Following is the text of the president's letter to the Speaker of
the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the
Senate:
<P>
(Begin text)
<P>
Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
<P>
Consistent with the Authorization for Use of Military Force
Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) and as part of my
effort to keep the Congress fully informed, I am reporting on the
status of efforts to obtain Iraq's compliance with the
resolutions adopted by the U.N. Security Council (UNSC). This
report covers the period from November 4 to the present.
<P>
Saddam Hussein remains a threat to his people and the region. The
United States successfully responded to the increased threat
resulting from Saddam's attack on Irbil in late August, but he
continues to try to manipulate local rivalries in northern Iraq
to his advantage. The United States and our coalition partners
continue to enforce the no-fly zone over southern Iraq.
Enforcement of the northern no-fly zone also continues
uninterrupted, despite a restructuring of operations. Because of
changes in its mission as a result of the closing last fall of
the Military Command Center (MCC) in the city of Zakho, Iraq, and
the shift of humanitarian assistance in the north under UNSCR 986
to international organizations, the designation "Provide Comfort"
will no longer be used to describe the operation. The United
Kingdom will continue to take part in this mission; however,
France has chosen not to continue to participate in this
endeavor. None of these changes affect our firm commitment to
ensuring that the northern no-fly zone is fully enforced.
<P>
Besides our air operations, we will continue to maintain a strong
U.S. presence in the region in order to deter Saddam. U.S. force
levels have returned to approximate pre-Operation Desert Strike
levels, with land and carrier based aircraft, surface warships, a
Marine amphibious task force, a Patriot missile battalion, and a
mechanized battalion task force deployed in support of USCINCCENT
Operations. As an additional deterrent against Iraqi aggression,
F-117 aircraft remain deployed to Kuwait. Since submission of my
last report, USCINCCENT has completed the initial phases of
Operation Desert Focus, with the relocation and consolidation of
all combatant forces in Saudi Arabia into more secure facilities
throughout Saudi Arabia. To enhance force protection throughout
the region, additional military security personnel have been
deployed for continuous rotation. USCINCCENT continues to closely
monitor the security situation in the region to ensure adequate
force protection is provided for all deployed forces.
<P>
United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 949, adopted
in October 1994, demands that Iraq not threaten its neighbors or
U.N. operations in Iraq and that it not redeploy or enhance its
military capacity in southern Iraq. In view of Saddam's
reinforced record of unreliability, it is prudent to retain a
significant U.S. force presence in the region in order to
maintain the capability to respond rapidly to possible Iraqi
aggression or threats against its neighbors.
<P>
In northern Iraq, we have made some limited progress in
strengthening the October 23 cease-fire and encouraging political
reconciliation between the two main Iraqi Kurd groups, the
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK). Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern
Affairs Robert Pelletreau co-chaired talks between the KDP and
the PUK in Turkey on October 30 and November 15, alongside
representatives of the Turkish and British governments. During
these talks, we obtained agreement from the two parties that the
neutral, indigenous Peace Monitoring Force (PMF) would demarcate
and observe the cease-fire line. To support the PMF, I have
directed, under the authorities of sections 552(c) and 614 of the
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, the draw-down of up
to $4 million in Department of Defense commodities and services,
and the Secretary of State has made a determination under which
we will provide up to $3 million for uniforms, tents, generators
and other nonlethal supplies. Issues related to PMF operations
are discussed regularly by a Supervisory Peace Monitoring Group
that meets in Ankara and is composed of U.S., U.K. and Turkish
representatives, as well as members of the indigenous relevant
parties. In these and other high-level meetings, this
Administration has consistently warned all concerned that
internecine warfare in the north can only work to the advantage
of Saddam Hussein and Iran, which we believe has no role to play
in the area. In this connection, we remain concerned about the
KDP's links to Baghdad and the PUK's ties to Iran.
<P>
Despite the cease-fire and other efforts, many residents of
northern Iraq continued to face threats from Baghdad due to their
association with U.S.-affiliated nongovernmental organizations,
who had undertaken relief work in northern Iraq over the past few
years. In response, this Administration, with the assistance of
Turkey, conducted a third humanitarian evacuations operation of
approximately 3,780 residents of northern Iraq whose lives were
directly threatened by the Iraqi regime. All of the evacuees are
being processed on Guam under the U.S. refugee resettlement
program, while most of the 2,700 evacuated under two previous
operations are now resettled in the United States.
<P>
The United States, working through the United Nations and
humanitarian relief organizations, continues to provide
humanitarian assistance to the people of northern Iraq. We have
contributed more than $15 million this fiscal year to programs in
the north administered by the U.N. International Children's
Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Program (WFP).
Security conditions in northern Iraq remain tenuous at best, with
Iranian and PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) activity adding to the
ever-present threat from Baghdad.
<P>
On December 9, the U.N. Secretary General submitted his formal
report to the UNSC stating that all necessary conditions for
implementation of UNSCR 986 had been met. Following this action,
the resolution went into effect 12:01 a.m. on December 10. UNSCR
986 authorizes Iraq to sell up to $2 billion of oil during an
initial 180-day period, with the possibility of UNSC renewal for
subsequent 180-day periods. Resolution 986 provides that the
proceeds of this limited oil sale, all of which must be deposited
in a U.N. escrow account, will be used to purchase food,
medicine, and other materials and supplies for essential civilian
needs for all Iraqi citizens, and to fund vital U.N. activities
regarding Iraq. Critical to the success of UNSCR 986 is Iraq's
willingness to follow through on its commitments under 986 to
allow the U.N. to monitor the distribution of food and medical
supplies to the Iraqi people.
<P>
We have already seen good evidence that the safeguards systems is
working: when Saddam Hussein pushed a button in Kirkuk on
December 10 to turn on the flow of oil before any oil contracts
had been approved by the U.N., the U.N. made him turn it off. The
oil flow began again, under proper U.N. supervision, a short time
later.
<P>
The Government of Iraq has, since my last report, continued to
flout its obligations under a number of Security Council
resolutions in other ways. Under the terms of relevant UNSC
resolutions, Iraq must grant the United Nations Special
Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) inspectors immediate, unconditional,
and unrestricted access to any location in Iraq they wish to
examine, and access to any Iraqi official whom they wish to
interview, so that UNSCOM may fully discharge its mandate. Iraq
continues, as it has for the past 5 years, to fail to live up
either to the letter or the spirit of this commitment.
<P>
In his October 11 semiannual written report to the Security
Council, UNSCOM Executive Chairman Rolf Ekeus outlined in
comprehensive detail Iraq's past and ongoing efforts to conceal
evidence of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs. In
his December 18 briefing to the Security Council, Ekeus urged it
to take action to reverse Iraq's current blocking of UNSCOM
removal of 130 SCUD motors from Iraq for analysis. As reported to
the press by Security Council President Fulci that day, Ekeus
informed the Council that he thought significant numbers of SCUD
missiles still exist in Iraq. As long as Saddam refuses to
cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors, UNSCOM will be
impeded in its efforts to fulfill its mandate to ensure that
Iraq's WMD program has been eliminated. We will continue to fully
support the mandate and the efforts of the Special Commission to
obtain Iraqi compliance with all relevant U.N.
resolutions.
<P>
The implementation of the export/import monitoring mechanism
approved by the Security Council in Resolution 1051 began on
October 1. Resolution 1051 approved a mechanism to monitor Iraq's
undertaking to reacquire proscribed weapons capabilities by
requiring that Iraq inform the U.N. in advance of any imports of
dual-use items and that countries provide timely notification of
the export to Iraq of dual-use items.
<P>
Iraq also continues to stall and obfuscate rather than work in
good faith toward accounting for the hundreds of Kuwaitis and
third-country nationals who disappeared at the hands of Iraqi
authorities during the occupation. It has also failed to return
all of the stolen Kuwaiti military equipment and the priceless
Kuwaiti cultural and historical artifacts, which were looted
during the occupation.
<P>
Iraq's repression of its Shi'a population continues with policies
aimed at destroying the Marsh Arabs' way of life in Southern
Iraq, as well `as the ecology of the southern marshes. The human
rights situation throughout Iraq remains unchanged. Saddam
Hussein shows no signs of complying with UNSCR 688, which demands
that Iraq cease the repression of its own people.
<P>
The Multinational Interception Force (MIF) remains on station in
the Arabian Gulf. Our commitment to the enforcement of the
sanctions regime is clearly demonstrated by the significant
investment we have made with our naval forces in this area. Since
my last report, 10 vessels have been intercepted and diverted for
sanctions violations. Most of the vessels diverted have been
engaged in illegal oil smuggling, but in recent weeks, we have
begun to intercept smaller boats attempting to smuggle Iraqi
dates as well. Traditionally, our naval forces encounter an
increase in date smugglers as Ramadan approaches.
<P>
We continue to note suspected smugglers using the territorial
waters of Iran to avoid interception by the MIF. Due ~to the
geography of the Gulf, it is possible to transit from Iraqi ports
to the UAE and the Indian Ocean without entering international
waters. We believe, and have confirmed in some instances, that
smugglers utilize these routes to export Iraqi petroleum products
in violation of UNSCR 661. We believe that there are elements
within the Iranian government who profit from charging
"protection fees" for the safe passage through Iranian waters. We
have presented evidence of this to the United Nations Sanctions
Committee, and I am pleased to report that the Committee has
decided to admonish Iran for failing to halt sanctions violators
in its waters.
<P>
The recent implementation of UNSCR 986 will increase the workload
of our naval forces participating in the MIF. We are prepared to
meet the increased monitoring effort in the coming months. The
surge in maritime traffic expected to occur with the
implementation of UNSCR 986 will necessitate extreme vigilance to
ensure that those who would profit from illegal trade with Iraq
are not given the opportunity to succeed.
<P>
The United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC), established
pursuant to UNSCR 687, continues to resolve claims against Iraq
arising from Iraq's unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait.
The UNCC has issued over 1 million awards worth approximately
$5.2 billion. At its most recent meeting, the UNCC Governing
Council approved an award of $610 million on the claim by the
Kuwait national oil company for the costs of extinguishing the
oil well fires ignited by Iraq at the end of the Gulf War. The
UNCC has authorized to date only limited payments for fixed
awards for serious personal injury or death because additional
funds to pay awards have been unavailable due to Iraq's refusal
to comply with all relevant sanctions. With the advent of oil
sales under UNSCR 986, however, 30 percent of the proceeds (which
is anticipated to be as much as $100 million per month) will be
allocated to the Compensation Fund. These proceeds will be use~
to make installment payments on awards already made and to
finance the operations of the UNCC.
<P>
To conclude, Iraq remains a serious threat to regional peace and
stability. I remain determined to see Iraq comply fully with all
of its obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions. My
Administration will continue to oppose any relaxation of
sanctions until Iraq demonstrates its peaceful intentions through
such compliance.
<P>
I appreciate the support of the Congress for our efforts and
shall continue to keep the Congress informed about this important
issue.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
(signed) WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Briefing on Bahrain Business Conferences</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff><IMG SRC="usis2.jpg">
<CENTER><B><H2>Jan Kalicki, Counselor of the Dept. of
Commerce<br>
Briefing on Bahrain Business Conferences<br>
February 22, 1996</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
(U.S.-GCC conferences will take place March 9-13)  
<P>
Washington -- Two back-to-back conferences aimed at forging a
"partnership" between the public and private sectors in the U.S.
and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) will take place in Bahrain on
March 9-13.
<P>
Jan H. Kalicki, counselor of the Department of Commerce,
explained
at a Foreign Press Center briefing February 22 that the United
States would like this partnership "to make our economic and
commercial ties" with the six members of the Gulf states as
"prominent" as the security and political relationship.
<P>
The first conference, opening March 9, will be a
government-to-government meeting known as the U.S.-GCC Economic
Dialogue.  This will be followed the next day by the second
U.S.-GCC Business Conference, which is expected to be attended by
more than 200 American businesses.
<P>
The two other briefers at the Foreign Presss Center were Shaun E.
Donnelly, deputy assistant secretary in charge of trade policy
and
programs at the State Department's Bureau of Economic and
Business
Affairs, and Arthur H. Hughes, deputy assistant secretary of
State
for Near Eastern Affairs.
<P>
Following is the text of the "talking points" read by Kalicki at
the briefing:
<P>
(Begin text) 
<p>
IMPORTANCE OF THE CONFERENCE -- It is a pleasure to join with my
colleagues from the Department of State -- Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Near East, Art Hughes, and Deputy Assistant
Secretary
for Economics and Business, Shaun Donnelly, to tell you about the
importance of the second U.S.-GCC Business Conference to the U.S.
government, to the U.S. business community, and to the overall
relationship between the GCC and the United States.
<P>
<ul>
<li>In that relationship, security and political ties have always
been important.  We would like to see the public sectors and the
private sectors form a partnership to make our economic and our
commercial ties an equally prominent part of our relationship.
</ul>
<P>
PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP -- To that end, for the first time, we
are holding the U.S.-GCC Business Conference in conjunction with
the government-to-government talks in the U.S.-GCC Economic
Dialogue.  We will hold the seventh meeting of the dialogue,
while
we are in Bahrain, as well as the second business conference.
<ul>
<li> The first business conference took place in 1993 in
Washington, DC.  It was highly successful, and we expect that the
second conference in Bahrain will be even more successful.  We
want
it to lead to specific deals, including joint ventures between
U.S.
companies and businesses in the GCC.

<li>In both the dialogue and the conference, we will be
discussing
ways to increase private investment in the GCC, and to strengthen
intellectual property protection, standards, technology transfer
and bilateral trade.

<li>We are addressing these issues in order to spur private
sector
development and to create a greater role for our private sectors
in
addressing the new economic challenges in the region.
</ul>
<P>
PRIVATE SECTOR ROLE -- These challenges include growing
populations
and rising expectations at a time when government resources to
address these challenges are increasingly limited.
<ul>
<li>But there is a growing private sector in the GCC and growing
interest on the part of the U.S. companies to look to the GCC as
a
place to do business.
<li>This conference comes at a time when the Middle East as a
whole
is not only open for business but actually doing more and more
business -- and when American companies are increasingly seeking
to
take advantage of the greater opportunity in the region, and
particularly in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
<li>We expect at least 200 U.S. business representatives to
attend
the conference, along with several U.S. government officials, and
we expect that there will be an equal or greater number of
business
representatives from the GCC.
<li>U.S.-GCC trade has reached around $21,000 million in recent
years, with annual U.S. exports to the region at $10,000-11,000
million and our imports $11,000-12,000 million.  We want the
trading relationship to expand, both in volume and in the
diversity
of the products traded.
<li>Health care, power generation, telecommunications,
information
systems, and consumer products are some of the areas where we
feel
U.S. companies could form profitable partnerships with their GCC
counterparts.
<li>U.S. investment in the GCC has climbed steadily to $3,800
million in 1994.  But there is potential for higher growth in
this
area as well.
<li>The conference will seek ways to make that growth happen and
to
make deals -- ways to develop stronger ties between our private
sectors in the United States and the GCC so that those ties
become
the underpinning of our overall relationship.
</ul>
<P>
REGIONAL INTEGRATION -- The conference will also reinforce the
common policy goal of greater regional integration.  GCC members
realize that in order to attract foreign investment, they must
create a market in which companies can operate easily in all Gulf
countries.  Companies see the Gulf market as a potentially very
large one once trade barriers are reduced and ultimately
eliminated
among the GCC states.
<ul>
<LI>This policy goal, in fact, is important for the entire Middle
East.  Less than seven percent of the area's total trade is
within
the region itself. We believe that the countries of the Middle
East
want to change this and become valuable trade partners with each
other, along with the rest of the world.

<li>So we look forward to the Bahrain meetings.  They will
reinforce our trade and investment ties.  They will contribute to
private sector development -- and private sector initiative in
the
region.  And they will encourage economic cooperation and
integration in the Gulf and the wider Middle East.

<CENTER><B><H2>Speech by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown<br>
to the American Business Council of Kuwait<br>
February, 8, 1995</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
Kuwait -- "The economies of all nations are more and more
dependent upon exports, upon competing in a very tough and
difficult global economic environment," U.S. Secretary of
Commerce Ronald H. Brown said on February 8.
<P>
In a speech to the American Business Council of Kuwait, Brown
said the United States desires to "reach out to our friends in
Kuwait and to help to build a strong commercial relationship to
enhance our trade and investment and economic and commercial
relationship."  He also stressed the importance of a strong and
effective public-private partnership in this commercial
enterprise.
<P>
"We hope and trust that all of you here will help us pursue those
goals, goals that will bring us closer together, goals that will
enhance our relationship, goals that will turn friendships that
were forged during times of war into friendships that will be
built upon during times of peace," Brown concluded.
<P>
Following is the text of the secretary's speech.
<P>
It is my honor and pleasure to be in Kuwait.  This is my first
visit here. It is an important visit, because once again it
demonstrates a desire of the United States to reach out to our
friends in Kuwait and to help to build a strong commercial
relationship to enhance our trade and investment and economic and
commercial relationship.  We have stood together in times of
threat of war and peril, and stood together in war and peril.  We
believe that it is time now to stand together in times of
commercial enterprise, to improve the lives of people of both of
our nations.  We think to do that there has to be a strong and
effective public private partnership.  And that's why I am so
pleased to be informed tonight that there are senior officials of
the Kuwaiti government, cabinet ministers. There are senior
officials of American companies here, there are leaders of
Kuwaiti companies and there is what I hope you believe is a
distinguished delegation from the United States, those that have
travelled with me over these last several days.  Since everyone
is standing, I can't ask them to stand and be recognized, but I
would like to ask them -- all those that are a member of our
delegation, they can just raise their hands and be recognized by
those of us who are here.  You can give them a round of applause.
<P>
The delegation is really symbolic of our world view.  We believe
that security issues are inextricably tied to economic issues,
that you can't talk about one without the other.   Nations cannot
be as secure as far as their defense and national security is
concerned unless they are economically secure.  And that is why
we have been endeavoring to build a new relationship between the
public and private sector in America, with a clear understanding
that it is the private sector that fuels the engine that pulls
the train of economic growth and job creation, but that we in
government can be stronger and more effective partners.  What I
have endeavored to do as Secretary of Commerce is to be a strong,
and hopefully effective advocate for American business and
industry around the world.  I believe that the united states is
the most productive and competitive nation on the face of this
earth.  I believe that we manufacture the highest quality
products and manufacture them at a cost competitive price. It
means that we not only want to compete effectively but we want to
win that competition around the world.  We are not afraid of
competition.  We are not afraid of open and transparent
processes, predictable processes, that anyone can look at and
feel comfortable with.  We are now endeavoring to expand those
victories to demonstrate to people around the world that we are
willing to go out and compete for business.  For many years as
you know because of the size of the United States and the
strength of our economy we often depended just on our domestic
economy.  We were frankly rather late coming to the notion that
in fact the future lies in international commerce.  That is even
more true now than ever with the globalization of the economy.  I
know many of you Americans who are here in Kuwait and have been
here many years, many of you Kuwaitis who are working for
American companies have known that for many years.   You have
been the true pioneers on whom we have relied.  We have learned
much from you and my conversations with our distinguished
Ambassador, he indicated that he is doing here what I do every
day, and that is to listen to the business community.  There is
no way that he can be an effective Ambassador or I can be an
effective Secretary of Commerce unless I am listening to the
private sector, unless I am listening and paying attention to
people who are out there every day where the rubber meets the
road so to speak, identifying the barriers and barricades and
obstacles to conduct in commerce.  We think we've made
extraordinary strides.  One of those extraordinary strides was
completion of the Uruguay Round of trades negotiations and the
resulting beginning on January 1 of the World Trade Organization.

Anything that we can do to lower tariff and non-tariff barriers
to remove obstacles to trade and commerce not only helps the
economies of our individual nations, but helps the global economy
as well.
<P>
Finally, let me say a word about what is happening in this region
and the great sense of hope and optimism that I feel that has
been reinforced by our travels this week.  Our first stop was
Cairo.  President Clinton asked me to change my itinerary to
visit first with President Mubarak to express our sincere
appreciation to President Mubarak for his personal leadership and
that of Egypt in pursuit of the peace process.  The fact is that
real change cannot come to the region until there is true and
lasting peace.  I expressed that appreciation and had a long
conversation with President Mubarak about his view of the future.

And I must say that that view is one of significant optimism.  We
left Cairo and we went on to Israel where we had the opportunity
to meet with Prime Minister Rabin, with senior officials with the
Israeli government.  And again the same sense of hope and
optimism was exhibited there, notwithstanding the recent
setbacks.  The road to peace is not going to be without
impediments.  It's not going to be without events which serve as
temporary setbacks.  But it seems to me we must be willing to
keep pursuing peace to overcome those setbacks.  We went from
there to Ramallah on the West Bank and met with Palestinian
business leaders, and leaders of PECDAR who are looking to a
future where there is economic opportunity and economic growth
and then later yesterday to Gaza, where I had the opportunity to
meet with Chairman Arafat, where he made the strongest statements
that he has yet made about terrorism and about violence and about
his desire to see it ended.  From there we went to Taba in Egypt,
where we had an historic meeting, where the trade and economics
and commerce ministers of the United States and those
representing the Palestinians of Jordan of Israel and Egypt sat
together for the first time -- a meeting that would not have been
thinkable just a year ago.  But it took place and there was real
dialogue and real interchange and a real effort to deal with
problems that exist.  From there it was on to Jordan, where we
spent part of today in Aqaba meeting with officials of the
Jordanian government.  All talked about how we could pursue the
peace process but most important, how we have to consider
economic development and economic progress in the context of
peace.  As peace comes to a region the expectations of the people
are raised considerably, and we have to determine how we can meet
those expectations.  Tension often comes from depravation and
from poverty and lack of hope from an inability to look beyond
the horizon and think that tomorrow is going to be better than
today.  Peace is pursued when people feel that they have a stake
in their future and the way that we can pursue that stake in a
positive sense is to try to secure that economic future.  We left
Aqaba and flew here to Kuwait, and we are honored to be here. 
Tomorrow morning early I'm going to have an opportunity to meet
with some of the American troops who are still here, trying to
help protect the security of Kuwait, and tonight we had a
wonderful meeting with His Highness the Crown Prince, where we
discussed a number of bilateral issues.  We also discussed the
need to continue to reach out to American companies for
expertise, for the products and goods and services that we have
to offer.  And my clear impression was that the Crown Prince was
open to that idea as have been the various ministers with whom we
have talked.  We make no secret about the purpose of our mission.
The purpose of our mission is to advocate the interests of
American business and industry.  We know that the economies of
all of our nations are more and more dependent upon exports, upon
competing in a very tough and difficult global economic
environment.  We know for example in the United States every
billion dollar increase in exports means twenty thousand new jobs
for the American people.  And that is why it is very important
for us to be successful in our pursuit of commercial
opportunities here in Kuwait.  We hope and trust that all of you
here will help us pursue those goals, goals that will bring us
closer together, goals that will enhance our relationship, goals
that will turn friendships that were forged during times of war
into friendships that will be built upon during times of peace. 
So I speak for our entire delegation and for the President of the
United States when I express my appreciation for your warmth and
for your hospitality.  We look forward to seeing you often in the
future.  Thank you very much.

"Containing Iran"</TITLE></HEAD>

<B><H2>Containing Iran</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<p>
<center><b>Statement by Peter Tarnoff<br>
Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs<br>
before the House International Relations Committee<br>
Washington, DC, November 9, 1995</b></center>
<P>
This Administration has maintained and intensified its efforts
to contain Iranian actions and policies that threaten U.S.
interests
and values. We know we share that objective with Congress. Six
months ago, President Clinton imposed an embargo against Iran.
With this strong action, he confirmed American leadership toward
Iran. The President's decision complements long-standing American
determination to counter Tehran's rogue activities. Today, as
we evaluate our policy toward Iran, let us first review some
fundamental
issues. Why is Iran's behavior important to U.S. interests? What
measures have we taken to address those concerns? Why were these
steps chosen? What effect are they having? I believe this review
will demonstrate that the Clinton Administration has devised a
responsible and realistic policy--a policy which safeguards
American
interests and deserves your support.
<P>
<B>Assessing the Iranian Threat</B>
<P>
Let me highlight some key facts about Iran that have affected
our thinking. Our strategic interest in ensuring the free flow
of oil from the Persian Gulf and in maintaining regional
stability
requires us to focus attention on Iran. When we look at Iran,
we find a country of over 60 million people that dominates the
littoral of the Persian Gulf. Iran sits adjacent to Iraq, across
from important Gulf Arab allies, and astride the gate to Central
Asia. Iran is the largest and most populous state in the Middle
East and contains 9% of the world's proven oil reserves and 15%
of the world's proven gas reserves. Iran also has claim to the
petroleum-rich Caspian Sea. Proud of its long and distinguished
history, Iran believes it should be a regional power. We also
know that Iran harbors a deep resentment about America's
relations
with the Shah. Today, Tehran fears America's military prowess
in the Gulf, and objects to our prominent regional influence.
Finally, we know that Iran has fractious relations with most of
its Arab neighbors. In particular, after enduring eight years
of war with Iraq and centuries of enmity, Iran is deeply
distrustful
of Baghdad.
<P>
Iraq is the other dominant state in the Gulf, and the interaction
between Iraq and Iran has long driven western policy. To prevent
either regime from challenging our interests in the Gulf region,
this Administration developed the strategy of dual containment.
We designed this strategy to counter, in the ways most
appropriate
for each specific threat--the set of challenges presented by
Baghdad
and the set of challenges posed by Tehran. I know the recent
story
of Iraq is familiar to you. In order to maintain our deterrence
of Iraq and to protect our Gulf allies, the United States
maintains
a significant military presence in the Persian Gulf.
<P>
Iran has presented us with a different type of challenge. Our
problems with Iran are based on our concerns about specific
Iranian
policies, which we judge to be unacceptable to law-abiding
nations.
Our goal is to convince the leadership in Tehran to abandon these
policies and to abide by international norms. We know our
objections
are familiar to you, and shared by you. Iran engages in terrorism
by assassinating its opponents. It provides material and
political
support to Palestinian rejectionists trying to undermine the
Middle
East peace process through violence. Iran also supports
opposition
groups seeking to subvert secular regimes in the Muslim world.
It is pursuing the development of weapons of mass
destruction--that
is, nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and the missile
systems to deliver them. Iran is also engaged in a conventional
military build-up that threatens regional peace and stability.
At home, Iran abuses the human rights of its citizens,
particularly
the rights of political dissidents, women, and religious
minorities.
<P>
<B>Confronting the Iranian Threat</B>
<P>
This behavior is an affront to American interests and values.
But neither the behavior nor American concern and action are new.
With the President's support and under Secretary Christopher's
leadership, this Administration has accorded a high priority to
our efforts to deny Iran the military capabilities and financial
resources it needs to successfully implement these policies. We
have acted alone when necessary and collectively when possible.
<P>
First, we concentrated on blocking the transfer to Iran of
dangerous
goods and technologies. We began with the strictest national
export
controls in the world. We have engaged in close negotiations with
other governments to obtain agreement to keep Iran from acquiring
armaments and sensitive dual-use items and technology for
military
purposes. We also have been working with other governments to
thwart Iran's efforts to acquire items useful for its programs
of weapons of mass destruction. By checking Iran's military
capabilities,
we have severely constrained Iran's ability to threaten us or
our allies with offensive action.
<P>
Second, by pressuring Iran's economy, we seek to limit the
government's
finances and thereby constrict Tehran's ability to fund rogue
activities. We launched an initiative to block Iran's access to
the international capital its economy needs. We have worked
bilaterally
and within international financial institutions to keep other
governments from providing Iran with credit. On May 6, President
Clinton issued Executive Order 12959, which imposed an embargo
against Iran. The President's decision to sever American trade
and investment with Iran signaled our commitment to exert the
maximum efforts of this country to deny Iran financial resources.
In particular, by barring American investment in Iran and
prohibiting
U.S. companies from buying Iranian oil, we have stopped the flow
of money from the United States to Iran. We are now seeking to
dissuade the international community from investing in Iran's
petroleum sector. With these efforts, we are taking advantage
of Iran's economic vulnerabilities, particularly its shortages
in hard currency. We recognize that economic pressure takes time,
but we are convinced that making Iran pay a price for its
unacceptable
activities is the best way to convince the Iranian leadership
that it is in their country's best interest to abandon these
policies.
<P>
<B>Choosing a Protective Policy</B>
<P>
The United States has a special responsibility to lead the world
in confronting states that persist in flouting international
norms.
To contain Iran, we have employed the full panoply of political
and economic measures. By imposing an embargo, we have
demonstrated
to our friends and allies that Iran's actions make it
unacceptable
to conduct &quot;business as usual.&quot; But while we continue
to pursue every option available to us to increase the cost to
Iran of its unacceptable activities, the costs we can impose by
acting alone are limited. We believe this effort to compel Iran
to change its behavior deserves multilateral support. Therefore,
through diplomatic channels, we are working aggressively to urge
other governments to join us. We seize every opportunity--in
bilateral
conversations and during multilateral consultations--to make our
point. Let me cite just a few of these activities so you can
appreciate
the range of our efforts. They include but are not limited to
the following: phone calls from the President; meetings with the
Vice President; personal letters from Secretary Christopher;
visits
to capitals by myself and Near East Assistant Secretary
Pelletreau;
consultations by other cabinet officials including Defense
Secretary
Perry, Energy Secretary O'Leary, and Commerce Secretary Brown;
and frequent exchanges between our ambassadors and heads of
state.
<P>
I can tell you, from my own experience, that these exchanges on
Iran are candid and detailed. Our persistence has paid off,
however.
When I began having these conversations about Iran almost three
years ago, my interlocutors were still skeptical about the scope
of Iranian misbehavior and resistant even to including the
subject
of Iran on our agenda. Today, because of the undeniable pattern
of evidence we have presented to them, most share our wary view
of Iran's threatening conduct. Nonetheless, our exchanges on the
issue of tactics--how best to bring about a change in this
behavior--have
intensified.
<P>
<B>Having an Impact</B>
<P>
To recap, we have reviewed why Iran's behavior is important to
us and what regional realities we must consider in our policy
formulation. We have identified which Iranian policies we find
objectionable. To convince Tehran to abandon these policies, we
have focused our efforts on limiting Iran's military capabilities
and financial resources and have taken both unilateral and
multilateral
action to achieve those limits. Because of the attention and
resources
devoted to this issue, it is now reasonable to consider the
impact
we are having.
<P>
Because of U.S. leadership, 28 nations have agreed to cooperate
in preventing Iran from acquiring armaments and sensitive
dual-use
goods and technology for military end-uses. As these nations
include
most of the world's major arms suppliers, this collective
consensus
should dramatically limit Iran's future acquisitions.
<P>
In addition, most nuclear suppliers, including our major allies,
have assured us that they will not engage in nuclear cooperation
with Iran. For example, earlier this year in Halifax, Canadian
Prime Minister Chretien spoke on behalf of the G-7 nations,
stating
that: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;G-7 countries have adopted restrictive policies on nuclear
cooperation with Iran . . .out of our grave concern that such
cooperation could be misused by Iran toward a nuclear weapons
program.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Russia and China remain exceptions to this consensus, although
our vigorous diplomacy has resulted in some modest limits on
their
nuclear cooperation with Iran. However, we will not be satisfied
until they stop all nuclear cooperation with Iran, and we
continue
to discuss this issue with Moscow and Beijing at the highest
levels
of government. We also work closely with other supplier nations
to limit Iran's access to goods and technologies applicable to
chemical or biological weapons programs. Similarly, we seek to
block transfers useful to Iran's ballistic missile program. We
have succeeded in gaining the cooperation of most industrialized
nations, and we are working to bring around those few states that
lack our commitment to denial.
<P>
Our efforts to block Iran's access to international finance have
also met with some important successes. Since the President
announced
the embargo, no government has extended new official credit to
Iran. Japan continues to withhold development assistance to Iran.
We continue to successfully block aid to Iran from the World Bank
and other international financial institutions. Specific U.S.
action also has hurt Iran's economy. The embargo resulted in a
dramatic devaluation of Iran's currency, which is still
aggravating
Iran's inflation and impeding commercial activity. By making Iran
work harder to sell its oil, the embargo has added operating
costs
and cut into the government's available hard currency. Moreover,
the effectiveness of our action has been boosted by Iran's own
economic mismanagement. The cumulative impact of these factors
is imposing strains on Iran's ability to meet its external
expenses,
and we expect the situation to worsen next year when the
government's
debt payments are scheduled to double.
<P>
While our allies share our concerns about Iranian behavior, they
do not share our conclusion that economic pressure is the most
effective way to change this behavior. They prefer a policy of
dialogue. We point out to them that their dialogue has not
produced
an improvement in Iran's behavior. Yet they remain reluctant to
take action, in part because it would negatively affect the
commercial
interests of their businesses, and in part because of an honest
disagreement with us over whether or not economic pressure will
alter Iran's behavior. Still, I believe that our constant
diplomatic
pressure on our international partners is resulting in tangible
measures that support U.S. policy. For example, it is reasonable
for us to expect that we can hold the line on stopping new
official
credit, government aid, and investment in Iran.
<P>
<B>Taking Additional Action</B>
<P>
We have drawn some lessons from our regular discussions about
Iran with our G-7 partners and other nations. Building a
coalition
requires time and determination. We believe our current approach
of leading by example and working cooperatively with allies needs
to be given a real chance to work.
<P>
We also know that Congress is now considering a proposal to
sanction
foreign companies that sell equipment and technology to Iran's
petroleum industry. We share your desire to explore additional
steps that increase pressure on Iran. We, too, want to limit the
development and exploitation of  Iran's oil and gas resources
and obtain support from foreign companies for our embargo. We
have some concerns with the bill, however, that we would want
to work with you to address.
<P>
First, we must find a way to further our objectives that hurts
Iran more than it hurts America's broader interests. For example,
we need to ensure that any proposed sanctions do not just drive
foreign firms to cut off their business relations with U.S.
companies
in favor of Iran's market. This would only jeopardize American
jobs and exports without restricting Iran's ability to acquire
imports.
<P>
A second concern is whether we could administer such sanctions.
Accurately monitoring trade between Iran and the world's major
foreign suppliers would be very difficult, especially since we
could not count on trading nations to cooperate with us.
<P>
A final concern is that, whatever approach we and the Congress
choose, we not engender a spate of acrimonious international
litigation
with our closest trading partners or fragment the increasingly
effective diplomatic coalition that we have successfully forged
to counter objectionable Iranian policies. We would also weigh
carefully the implications for our broader trading interests of
adopting a secondary boycott.
<P>
We would welcome the opportunity to consult with you in greater
detail about this legislation and to discuss the most appropriate
timing for any further action.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
Our comprehensive efforts have checked Iran's military ambition
and frustrated its financial situation. We must maintain and
strengthen
these efforts, but our vigilance is succeeding in protecting
American
interests. We are working from a strong base to implement a
responsible
policy. Because our policy is grounded in a thoughtful assessment
of  regional and international realities, we are confident that
we can deter any Iranian threat. We depend on Congressional
support
for and commitment to our efforts, and we look forward to
continuing
consultations on this policy.

<TITLE>2nd meeting Commercial Ties</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000">
<H2>U.S., SOUTH AFRICA SIGN AGREEMENTS RENEWING COMMERCIAL TIES</H2>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- The United States and South Africa signed four
agreements July 23 aimed at improving relations and reinstating
commercial ties that were sundered more than nine years ago
during the apartheid era. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore, who signed the agreements for the United
States during a ceremony at the White House, said the new era of
U.S.-South African cooperation was based on one fundamental idea:
 &quot;that our nations can grow stronger, wiser, more free and
prosperous when our citizens join together in common cause to
confront common challenges and take advantage of shared
opportunities.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
The four agreements included two dealing with air transport
issues, a &quot;declaration of intent&quot; regarding the GLOBE
environmental program and a &quot;declaration of mutual
anti-crime cooperation.&quot;  Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
signed on behalf of the South African government.
</P>
<P>
 The agreement signing took place against the backdrop of the
two-day U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission (BNC) meeting. 
The BNC was established more than a year ago to smooth commercial
relations between the two trading partners.  Gore and Mbeki head
the body, whose six special committees, led by Cabinet-level
energy, transport, and trade officials from both countries, meet
semiannually in alternating capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Gore noted that when Presidents Clinton and Mandela formed the
BNC &quot;it was really a statement by the two of them and by our
two peoples that each nation regards its relationship with the
other as being sufficiently important to warrant a very heavy
investment of time, thought, and energy&quot; on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
The result, he explained, was a commission meant &quot;to engage
at a high level in an effort to remove all the obstacles to
further improvement&quot; in U.S.-South African relations and &quot;seek
out opportunities to work together.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
Deputy President Mbeki and his party, which included Minister for
Trade and Industry Alec Erwin, took advantage of the BNC meeting
to have discussions with top U.S. government officials,
legislators, and business representatives.  In addition, the
South Africans were honored at receptions hosted by the State
Department, the U.S. Information Agency, and the U.S.-South
Africa Business Council.  The delegation also visited the Olympic
Games in Atlanta, where they witnessed the winning of a gold
medal by a South African swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the commission's deliberations in Pretoria six
months ago, Gore said:  &quot;We have accomplished a great deal
since our last meeting.  Together, we have explored ways to
reduce pollution, conserve water, manage wastes, educate young
people, empower our citizens, improve agricultural practices,
build free markets and free minds, and help open the door to real
economic opportunity for all of our citizens.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
The vice president mentioned a number of initiatives undertaken
by the U.S. government to help the new South Africa, including
professional exchanges in which more than 100 South African
leaders have traveled to America to interact with their American
counterparts, and the Mandela Scholars Program, launched to
provide graduate-level training in economics to historically
disadvantaged South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that in the past few days the commission's
efforts have resulted in further U.S. initiatives, including the
signing by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) of
an investment fund protocol to support a $120 million private
equity fund that will invest in businesses in South Africa owned
by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Gore pointed out that the OPIC fund &quot;represents a major step
towards spurring investment, trade, job creation, and growth in a
new, robust, and prosperous South Africa -- it is a major step
forward.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
The civil aviation agreements that were signed, said Gore, &quot;will
restore formal aviation relations between the United States and
South Africa for the first time since they were broken in protest
over apartheid more than nine years ago.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
Such an agreement is timely, the vice president pointed out,
considering that &quot;the flow of trade, tourism, and investment
between our two countries has grown enormously during the past
two years.  By recent count, one new U.S. business per week has
set up shop in South Africa.  And American tourism to South
Africa has doubled during that period,&quot; he added. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Gore noted that the United States has agreed to do
the following:  help South Africa improve its law enforcement
techniques, especially in the area of criminal intelligence
gathering; proceed with a partnership to establish a Fulbright
commission, &quot;which will improve and expand the ways
Americans and South Africans study and conduct research together&quot;;
and send Peace Corps volunteers who &quot;will work with South
Africans where they live to help improve education and foster
good will.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
The vice president emphasized that it is through such initiatives
of the BNC that the United States and South Africa &quot;are
building a matrix of mutually beneficial connections, programs,
exchanges, and business ventures...to establish a healthy and
equal give-and-take across all aspects of our two societies and
to nurture the possibilities of peace, justice, and prosperity
for all our citizens.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
Turning to Gore, Deputy President Mbeki said, &quot;I wish to
reiterate our appreciation for the warmth with which you have
received us and join you in noting the extraordinary amount of
work that has been done, during this session, in the great growth
and scope of cooperation&quot; between South Africa and the
United States. 
</P>
<P>
During a press conference following the signing ceremony, Gore
added that &quot;Deputy President Mbeki and I have an ongoing
dialogue on what we call 'off-line' issues.  And they encompass
virtually every issue in the [U.S.-South African] relationship. 
We can't solve all of them [problems], but we try.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
One of those problems -- the U.S. federal court case against the
South African parastatal Armscor corporation charging its
involvement in the illegal transference of arms to countries the
United States regards as terrorist/aggressor nations -- is
something that Gore said &quot;Deputy President Mbeki and I have
worked on for quite some time now.&quot;
</P>
<P>
 &quot;We've had some very good, substantive discussion over the
past two days&quot; on the Armscor issue, Gore added.  And &quot;our
representatives have had very good, substantive discussions over
the past 10 days.  Both sides very much want this matter
resolved.  We are cautiously optimistic.  But beyond that we have
decided not to comment lest we complicate the productive
discussions at this very delicate stage.&quot;

<P>
Good morning Senator McGovern, distinguished guests, colleagues,
and friends. I'd like to
congratulate Senator McGovern and the Middle East Policy Council
for organizing this
conference on Oman. I am honored to be your kick-off speaker. It
is a pleasure to be here
and to participate in honoring the twenty-fifth accession to the
throne of His Majesty Sultan
Qaboos. Today, Oman has become a leader on the Arabian Peninsula
in areas as diverse as
enhancing regional security and free trade, support for the
Middle East peace process,
delinking terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, the education and
political empowerment of
women, protecting the environment, and the effort to develop a
post-oil economy. Under His
Majesty's leadership, Oman has made great strides in its
development during the past
twenty-five years, both domestically and internationally. The
evolution of the close and
cooperative relationship between the U.S. and Oman during this
time is a result of His
Majesty's interest and guidance. His Majesty Sultan Qaboos
visited Washington in 1983.
Vice President Bush twice visited Oman, in 1983 and in 1986, and
Vice President Gore
recently traveled to Oman this past March. We are proud to count
Oman and His Majesty as
close partners and friends.
<P>
The U.S. and Oman have a long tradition of commercial relations
dating back to the early
days of American independence. Others will no doubt talk to you
about our early contacts:
early American merchantmen's contacts with Zanzibar; the famous
voyage of the Sultana to
New York; our trade negotiations in the 1830s. Our current
political relationship, however,
can be traced to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos' accession to the
throne in 1970. One of His
Majesty's first priorities was to end his country's earlier
isolatction designed to increase
Oman's regional and international profile and to expand Oman's
relations with its regional
neighbors and the rest of the world.
<P>
Our relationship began to evolve in the 1970s. In 1972, the first
U.S. ambassador was
accredited to Oman. Several events promoted the growth of the
strong and cooperative
relationship between Oman and the U.S., as we both sought to
promote our mutual interests
in security, prosperity, and stability in the region. The rise of
Soviet influence in Yemen and
later in Afghanistan, the Iranian revolution, the U.S.
initiatives for peace in the Middle East,
and Oman's geographic location on the Strait of Hormuz combined
to establish the
foundation of a close relationship between our two countries.
<P>
The traditional American route to the Arab world has been
eastward across the Atlantic
Ocean, through the Gates of Hercules and along the Mediterranean
to the Levant, or Holy
Land. It was only more recently, with the emerging importance of
the Gulf to American
interests, that our strategic planners began approaching the Arab
world from the south,
around the Cape of Good Hope or coming out of the Pacific. On
this axis, the importance of
Oman becomes self-evident. Oman's strategic location, wrapped
around the southeastern
corner of the Arabian Peninsula and guarding the southern
approaches to the Strait of
Hormuz across from Iran, makes it an essential partner in
preserving freedom of navigation
in the Gulf and a key participant in regional strategic planning.
Following the fall of the Shah
and the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, Oman was the first
country in the Gulf with which
we negotiated a security cooperation agreement. This accord,
signed in 1980, was renewed
and expanded in 1990 and remains in effect today. During the Gulf
War, Oman contributed
forces to liberating Kuwait and aircraft of the international
coalition operated from Omani
airfields. Oman continues to work closely with the U.S. in
providing crucial logistics and
prepositioning support, and in participating in joint exercises
in the region. Oman is also a
strong supporter of collective security within the Gulf
Cooperation Council.
<P>
Oman has been a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council since its
formation in 1981. It has
contributed to and benefited from GCC efforts to maintain
regional security, as well on other
issues of interest to the Gulf states. In September 1994, Oman
joined with the other five
GCC members to announce their decision to no longer enforce the
secondary and tertiary
aspects of theael. Oman will take over the chair of the GCC in
December.
<P>
At the same time, in keeping with Oman's tradition as a seafaring
nation, Sultan Qaboos has
pursued an independent foreign policy. One example has been
Oman's unhesitating support
for peace efforts in the Middle East. Resisting pressure to
isolate Egypt in the wake of its
peace treaty with Israel in 1979, Oman maintained its ties to
Cairo. In April 1994, Oman
was the first Gulf state to host an Israeli delegation to a
multilateral peace process meeting.
In December 1994, Oman welcomed Prime Minister Rabin on his first
visit to a Gulf state.
The two countries' foreign ministers have met several times. At
the beginning of October,
Oman and Israel announced an agreement to open trade
representation in each other's
country. Oman has been active in all aspects of the multilateral
peace process working
groups. Oman has taken the lead in promoting the establishment of
a regional desalination
research center in Muscat under the auspices of the Multilateral
Working Group on Water,
working with Israel and other regional states, as part of the
peace process.
<P>
Sultan Qaboos has publicly stood with the U.S. in condemning
terrorism and violence. He
has spoken out against those who would use terror or manipulate
Islam in support of violent
opposition to the peace process or stable governments. Following
an unsuccessful attempt in
1994 to destabilize the Sultan's government, by plotters
allegedly under the influence of
Islamist extremists, His Majesty Sultan Qaboos publicly condemned
extremism.
<P>
As a member of the United Nations Security Council since January
1994, Oman has worked
closely and successfully with the U.S. on a variety of issues.
These have included containing
the effects of the Yemeni civil war and maintaining the Iraq
sanctions regime until Iraq
complies with all its obligations to the Security Council. We
both share a deep concern for
the humanitarian hardship of the Iraqi people. Our two countries
worked closely together to
draft UNSCR 986, which allows for the provision of humanitarian
aid to the Iraqi people
through the controlled sale of Iraqi oil, while maintaining the
integrity of the sanctions
regime. In its two years on the Security Council, Oman has been a
serious, responsible and
contributing member of that important body.
<P>
The politics of economics also is an important factor in our
relationship with Oman. On a
bilateral level, our commercial relationship dates back over two
centuries. In 1908, we were
Oman's second largest export market. Then California began
producing dates and trade
tapered off. Today we are coming back. The U.S. is Oman's fourth
largest trading partner.
U.S. companies are working in Oman across various sectors from
oil and natural gas to
manufacturing. We will work with Oman to share knowledge and
experience and to provide
training and opportunities for younr economic opportunities and
cooperation. We recognize
and support Oman's own economic priorities aimed at diversifying
its economy and
developing the interior of the country.
<P>
On a multilateral level, the upcoming Amman Summit at the end of
October will enhance
economic cooperation in the region. Following on last year's
Casablanca Summit, the
Amman Summit represents an opportunity to expand business and
trade among all the
countries in the region and to take advantage of new
opportunities opened by the peace
agreements. We have encouraged Oman to take advantage of the
summit as an opportunity to
promote Omani projects. We understand that an important
delegation representing both the
government and the private sector will attend.
<P>
Domestically, Sultan Qaboos has taken important political and
social steps to ensure Oman's
place as a stable, modern country. He has been a leader on the
Arabian Peninsula in
promoting the education and political empowerment of women and in
articulating a vision of
gradually expanding popular participation in government. In 1991
the Sultan established a
59-seat Consultative Council, or Majlis Ash-Shura, which replaced
an older advisory body.
Council members are selected from lists of nominees proposed by
each of the nation's
regions, become educated and immersed in issues affecting the
nation, question government
ministers and recommend changes to new laws on economic and
social policy. In 1994 Oman
became the first Gulf Cooperative Council state to welcome women
to serve in its
Consultative Council, and there are now two new women members.
Oman is working to
improve worker rights. Oman joined the International Labor
Organization in 1994, and the
Government is drafting a new labor law that addresses worker
rights.
<P>
The future of the U.S.-Oman relationship will continue to be
based on mutual respect and
our common concern for regional security and stability. Last
week, we spend a full morning
with Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusef bin Alawi
reviewing conditions in the region
and our bilateral relations, which are sold and healthy. We will
continue to cooperate on
economic, political and security issues and to seek new and
creative ways to enhance our
broad bilateral relationship. We will also work together on
multilateral issues, including the
peace process, Iraq sanctions, and expanded economic
opportunities in the region. Sultan
Qaboos has played an important role in the development of our
strong, cooperative
relationship through his commitment to pursuing an active role in
international policy for
Oman. We appreciate the importance of this relationship and of
His Majesty's interest and
guidance. We look forward to another twenty-five years of His
Majesty's leadership.

Secretary of Defense John P. White Press Conference in Abu
Dhabi</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff><IMG SRC="usis2.jpg">

Press Conference in Abu Dhabi<BR>

<P> 
 (Stresses U.S. commitment to Gulf security, stability) (2450)

Abu Dhabi -- "The United States has a long enduring, interesting
commitment to security and stability in the Gulf.  We have a
commitment to work closely with our friends in this region for
those ends ...," says a Defense Department official.
<P>
During a March 28 press conference at the conclusion of his visit
to the United Arab Emirates, John P. White, Deputy Secretary of
Defense, said the United States counts the UAE "as one of our
best
friends in the region." He said he had a "very productive set of
discussions on a range of topics" of mutual interest.
<P>
In response to questions from the press, White said the U.S. is
concerned about instability in the Gulf but most of the concern
is
about terrorism. Terrorism of the sort that has occurred in
Bahrain
and Saudi Arabia, he said,  "clearly leads to instability. 
Therefore we are continuing to talk here and elsewhere with our
friends about ways that we can reduce terrorism."
<P>
"We are particularly concerned about Iran with respect to
terrorism
and the fact that they've exported terrorism around the world,"
he
stated.  "We continue to be very clear here and elsewhere about
how
reprehensible all that is, and that their terrorist activities
ought to be terminated."
<P>
Regarding the sanctions against Iraq, White stressed that "the
problem here is the Iraqi leadership.  It's Saddam Hussein, it's
not the question of the sanctions."  The U.S. is concerned about
the plight of the Iraqi people, he said, but the problem that has
to be resolved is "the brutality of the leadership."
<P>
Following is a transcript of the press conference: (Begin
transcript) AMBASSADOR LITT:  Ladies and Gentlemen, as the
American
Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, I am proud to present to
you the Deputy Secretary of Defense Dr. John White.
<P>
DR. WHITE:  Thank you Mr. Ambassador.  I will begin if I may with
a couple of brief comments.  My colleagues and I have just
concluded a really excellent, although too short a visit to the
UAE.  I came as an emissary from President Clinton and delivered
a
letter to His Highness President Sheikh Zayed.  We had excellent
meetings with the Crown Prince, and with the Chief of Staff,
Sheikh
Mohamed.  As you know we have a long and enduring interesting
commitment to stability and security in the Gulf.  We have a
commitment to work closely with our friends in this region for
those ends and of course we count the UAE as one of our best
friends in the region.  And we were able to have some very
friendly
common discussions about areas of interest to both countries.  So
I am pleased to say that I will be able to return to the United
States with a word to the President and to Secretary Perry that
we
have had a very productive set of discussions on a range of
topics. 
Thank you.  I'd be happy to answer any questions.
<P>
Q:  We hear that there is an increase in the deployment of troops
in the area.
<P>
A:  I wouldn't be in a position today to discuss any details of
any
deployments in the area.  We do not, as a rule, ever discuss
future
deployments.  We did discuss the exercise Iron Falcon which will
be
coming up soon, which will be a joint exercise with the UAE and
the
U.S.  In fact we had a very informative airplane tour this
morning
in the general region where that's going to be and it's a great
interest to both of us.  So we're looking forward to that, and
that
will happen shortly.
<P>
Q:  Regarding the security arrangements in the area, have you
discussed with the UAE officials here the case of the  Emirates'
Islands occupied by Iran?
<P>
A:  Of course.  As I think you know, we have been concerned about
those islands, we continue to be concerned.  We did discuss the
general issue of security in the region, and particularly with
respect to Iran.
<P>
Q:  There's been a lot of talk about threats from Iran and Iraq. 
Do you think that there is a new kind of threat in the Gulf from
internal instability, home-grown instability in Bahrain, the bomb
explosion in Saudi Arabia!  Are you concerned about this?
<P>
A:  We're concerned about instability but most of our concern in
that regard has to do with terrorism.  As you know we are
strongly
opposed to terrorism in the region and the world at large and we
think any terrorism of the sort that's been experienced clearly
leads to instability.  Therefore we are continuing to talk here
and
elsewhere with our friends about ways that we can reduce
terrorism. 
That was the point of the President's visit to the region
recently
and I think he clearly underlined that commitment.
<P>
Q:  The United States has big deals with United Arab Emirates and
other Gulf countries and they also signed many deals through
offset
programs.  Can you tell us about steps made by the American side
and the Emirates during the past three years?
<P>
A:  I can't recount Mr. Ambassador all the details.  Can you?
AMBASSADOR LITT:  You're speaking specifically in terms of
military
and defense.  Over the last three years, of course we have had an
ongoing program with the United Arab Emirates in terms of Apache
helicopters and Hawk Missile program.  And we are engaged with
them
and have been for quite a long time to see if there are other
defense systems that they would like to acquire from the United
States.  Over the last three years I don't know off hand of any
major systems that they have purchased.
<P>
Q:  -- talked with Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed about defense. 
Jurisdiction of American personnel (inaudible).
<P>
A:  We as you know have a cooperative defense agreement that's
very
important.  It's been in place since 1994.  It provides a
framework
for a whole range of inter-relationships and we obviously talked
about the agreement and the inter-relationships but beyond that
we
didn't get into any specifics.
<P>
Q:  (inaudible) A:  We have a relationship, both sides think the
relationship continues to work well.  It's an evolving
relationship
between friends, and it will evolve over time.
<P>
Q:  The UAE defense minister has voiced concern about the
sanctions
against Iraq and the UAE has sent relief aid to the Iraqis.  Did
you discuss the sanctions and the need to maintain the sanctions?
<P>
A:  Yes we did.  We did discuss Iraq and we did discuss the
sanctions.  From our point of view, we also are concerned about
the
plight of the Iraqi people.  But I think we have a common
understanding that the problem here is the Iraqi leadership. 
It's
Saddam Hussein, it's not the question of the sanctions.  The
sanctions are a result of the brutality of the leadership and if
we
can solve that that's the problem that has to be solved not the
issue of sanctions so we are supportive of the concerns that were
expressed during our visit with respect to the Iraqi people.
<P>
Q:  Did the UAE reiterate its position on sanctions, that there
should be some kind of reconciliation with Iraq during the talks?
<P>
A:  Well, I am not going to go into the details of the talks. 
Let
me just say that we talked about sanctions, we talked about a
whole
set of security issues in the region, and it was a very mutually
satisfactory conversation.
<P>
Q:  How do you look at Iran as a military threat? A:  Well, we
think that Iran is a military threat.  We watch them closely in
terms of their military activities.  But as I said earlier we are
particularly concerned about Iran with respect to terrorism and
the
fact that they've exported terrorism around the world.  We've
been
very clear about that over time and we continue to be very clear
here and elsewhere about how reprehensible all that is, and that
their terrorist activities ought to be terminated.
<P>
Q:  Let's take the economic sanctions ... have the economic
sanctions against Iran been effective?  Or do you think that
other
measures are needed?  I mean, when you say you're going to fight
terrorism, how are you going to do it?
<P>
A:  I'm not going to go into speculation about hypothetical
situations, or what we might do in the future.  We think that
we've
been realistically and generally supportive and positive, but
nevertheless, we are continually concerned about terrorism.
<P>
Q:  Dr. White, you believe that Iran is a very important player
in
the Gulf as far as security and peace are concerned.  Why has not
the United States tried to bring Iran into the fold instead of a
constant policy of confrontation with it?
<P>
A:  We would be happy to see a better relationship with Iran if
they would terminate the practices that we object to.  But as
long
as they conduct themselves as they have been, we are not in a
situation where we can accommodate them.  There's an easy
solution
to that.
<P>
Q:  What do you mean by that? A:  Well I mentioned terrorism in
particular, which is something that is of particular concern to
us.
<P>
Q:  Why did the United States not ask the Israeli Government to
remove the economic sanctions against the Palestinians, and at
the
same time, the United States increased its support for Israel
(inaudible) and finally it is altogether against the peace
process
and the Middle East at the same time.
<P>
A:  Well let me just say in general first of all, that my focus
here obviously has been on this specific region.  Secondly, that
we
continue to support the peace process, and support it in the
broad
sense as we have over time now.  Thirdly that we are acting based
on the President' recent visit to provide a series of support,
conditional support, to that peace process, and we're  hoping
that
we can continue to have some progress on that regard.
<P>
Q:  (inaudible) relationship with Iran.  Is the U.S. prepared to
sit with Iran without any condition and discuss the relationship?
<P>
A:  Well, I think I would only be repeating what I said before. 
We
have a basic concern with respect to the way the Iranian regime
conducts itself, and as long as that's the case, we are going to
have a problem.  We would like to see that changed.  If that
changed then, obviously, that would open up other issues.
<P>
Q:  Are you aware of some talk about (inaudible) A:  The AEF? Q: 
Yes. A:  Yes.  That's been announced here.  We do have an air
expeditionary force which we have deployed in the region before,
and which we do anticipate deploying again, and we anticipate
that
in the future to be in Jordan.  The King was in the United States
a couple of weeks ago.   We talked with him about that.  He's
supportive of that.  The King, as you know, is a friend of ours,
and so we do anticipate having that happen, and I think next
month,
or the month after April.
<P>
Q:  We got some idea regarding Idex 97 in Abu Dhabi.  We heard
that
a lot of American companies will participate.  Did you discuss
that
with Sheikh Mohamed?
<P>
A:  No.  We did not. Q:  Going now to the Syrian track, one of
the
issues has to do with the surveillance forces ... (inaudible). 
What sort of solution do you see that would be satisfactory to
both
sides, and what military role ... that the U.S. could play?
<P>
A:  Again I don't think it is for me to get into these kinds of
details here.  That's not why I'm here.
<P>
Q:  Are you prepared to militarily come to the aid of the UAE if
Iran boosts its activities on islands?
<P>
A:  Again, I wouldn't speculate about hypothetical situations. 
These people are friends here.  We've had a good visit.  We
continue to work very closely together.
<P>
Q:  You have a defense agreement with the UAE.  Does the
agreement
provide for military protection in case Iran attacks the UAE?
<P>
AMBASSADOR LITT:  I wouldn't go into details about our defense
cooperation agreement.
<P>
Q:  There is (inaudible) between the United States, the United
Kingdom, and France.  (inaudible) armaments marketing.  Did you
discuss with the United Arab Emirates officials, or are you going
to discuss in Kuwait, aircraft sales?
<P>
A:  We did discuss here with Sheikh Mohamed, issues around
aircraft
sales, fighter aircraft sales, but that is a discussion we have
been having for quite some time.  We have offered, in the spirit
of
the cooperation that we have, and in the context of the DCA, to
make those sales.  We think we clearly make the best fighter
aircraft in the world.  We would like to see a situation in which
the UAE would acquire some of our aircraft.  That would improve
our
cooperation with the UAE.  It would enhance training, enhance
(inaudible) and therefore we did discuss that, and we had a very
useful conversation.
<P>
Q:  it seems there is a special relationship between Qatar and
Iran.  How do you view that relationship?
<P>
A:  I can't comment on that, I'm sorry. Q:  Dr. White, you'd have
thought that once Iraq started actively to support terrorist
activity, that it would be better to ...
<P>
A:  I didn't affirm that.  What I simply said was, that as long
as
we have the situation that we have, we have a problem with the
regime in Iran.
<P>
Q:  What is the situation now in Taiwan, now after the Chinese
(inaudible) A:  Again I'm not going to go into the Chinese
situation.  That's a very complicated situation.  As you know, we
have been talking actively with the Chinese with respect to that
situation over the recent period.  We took certain actions that
we
thought were important at that time.  We now see those exercises
winding down, and we think that's good.  We would hope that they
reduce the exercises and that everything gets back to normal.
<P>
Q:  The recent defections from Iraq raised apparently false hopes
or false perceptions that Saddam was losing a grip on power.  How
long do you think these sanctions are going to affect his grip on
power, any time soon, or do you think he's in as strong a
position
as ever?
<P>
A:  We think the sanctions have been very effective, and as long
as Saddam continues to conduct himself the way he has, and to be
there, we will be in favor of these sanctions, and as I say, I
think the evidence is clear that they've been successful.  Thank
you very much.

<B><H2>Remarks by Assistant Secretary Pelletreau<br>
at the Center for Arab Studies Seminar<br>
Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of the UAE<br>
December 12, 1996</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<p>
Thank you, Dr. Hudson.  Ambassador Shaali, my U.S. ambassadorial
colleagues, I am delighted to join with you today in
commemorating the United Arab Emirates' first 25 years of
independence.  As some of you will recall,  there were voices in
1971 who doubted the federation would survive infancy, let alone
be standing proudly among the community of nations to celebrate
its Silver Jubilee.  Today, we can say that nation-building in
the UAE has been a resounding success.  Despite surrounding
turmoil in the form of the Iraq-Iran war of the 1980s, and then
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and its subsequent liberation by an
international coalition of nations, the UAE steadily knit
together the sinews of nationhood and is today practicing a
vigorous prosperity.  In a world too often governed by petty
jealousies, this remarkable accomplishment is a tribute to the
far-sighted leadership of His Highness Shaykh Zayid, to the
commitment of his fellow rulers, and to the abilities of the
people of the UAE.  
<P>
In guiding the federation's development, Shaykh Zayid showed his
commitment to unity by generously sharing the wealth of Abu Dhabi
with less well-endowed northern emirates, and by funding the
federal government while respecting the right of each emirate to
run its own internal affairs.
<P>
No figure in the Arab world is more universally respected than
Shaykh Zayid.  He has remained true to his traditional values
while presiding over the rapid modernization of his country.  And
what extraordinary changes he has brought his people in their 25
years of independence!  Life expectancy has increased by more
than ten years.  The population has quadrupled, as has the
overall literacy rate.  Petroleum exports now account for only
one-third of GDP.  In downtown Abu Dhabi, you can stroll through
lush park land and watch a wild falcon hunting for its next meal,
while across the street stands a gleaming high-rise office tower
with a fast-food restaurant on the ground floor.  On his
instructions, local institutions pioneered in developing
hydroponic agriculture and other modern techniques to lessen
reliance on food imports.
<P>
When I had the pleasure of revisiting the UAE in October, I was
delighted to see how much new development had taken place since
my previous visit, and how much additional construction is taking
place.  Dubai has become the hub of commerce and shipping for the
entire region.  The late Shaykh Rashid Al Maktoum and his sons
have shown remarkable vision by investing ambitiously in
infrastructure and opening their emirate to international
business.  The impressive port facility at Jebel Ali is not only
the only one in the region large enough to host U.S. aircraft
carriers, but its booming free port area now includes offices or
warehouses of some sixty-five American companies which use it as
a hub for their business activities up and down the Gulf.  The
vision of Shaikh Rashid, may he rest in peace, on that day over
twenty years ago when he went out with his advisors and put his
walking stick firmly into the desert sand and said "here," has
been confirmed a hundred times over.
<P>
More and more, the United States and the UAE are discovering the
benefits of doing business together. Our bilateral trade has
grown by some 37% in the past two years alone. This year, it is
projected to exceed $2.3 billion.  I believe this trend will
continue.  American business has a great deal to contribute to
the continued development of the UAE.  And thanks to the silver
anniversary celebrations, many more Americans are hearing about
the UAE's remarkable transformation.  Our embassy estimates there
are now 14,000 Americans in the UAE, and projects that the number
will continue to grow by 10-20% each year.  
<P>
While the United States has enjoyed good relations with the UAE
since it was founded, we have grown closer in this decade, when
we stood together to defend the independence of Kuwait.   
<P>
Iraq's invasion, and the support Baghdad received in some
quarters, constituted a wake-up call for all the GCC states.  The
dangers of relying on Iraqi strength to balance Iranian threats
was brought home.  Their very prosperity and success made them
targets of aggression, and they found out who were the friends
they could count on and who were not.  The United States'
response to that aggression demonstrated more clearly than words
how genuinely we are committed to the security of the Gulf.  We
showed that we can and will defend our friends as well as our
interests -- preferably by deterring potential threats, but with
overwhelming military force, if necessary.  Perhaps more
importantly, we showed that American power could serve the cause
of stability in the region.  And we showed we could do so in a
way that did not impinge on the sovereignty of our friends or
their values.  When the hundreds of thousands of troops we had
massed in the region had accomplished their mission, they came
home, ready to return in case of need.
<P>
Although we seek no bases or permanent presence on the sovereign
territory of our friends, let there be no mistake:  the security
and stability of the Gulf remains a vital national interest of
the United States.  
<P>
Our economy, indeed that of the entire modernizing world, depends
on the unimpeded flow of oil and gas from the Gulf, which has 65%
of the world's proven reserves of oil.  The UAE alone accounts
for nearly 10% of world oil reserves and 4% of gas reserves, and
its reserves will last well over a hundred years at current rates
of production.  
<P>
The Gulf War stimulated the UAE's interest in building a security
relationship with the United States.  We cooperate in many ways
already, and I am confident our partnership will grow in the
months and years ahead.  Our two countries concluded a Defense
Cooperation Agreement in 1994.  Today, U.S. Air Force aerial
refueling tankers fly out of al-Dhafra air base in support of
Operation Southern Watch, the "no-fly" zone in southern Iraq. 
Our Navy calls regularly at ports of the Emirates, both for
necessary maintenance and for R and R for our sailors and Marines
on duty in the Gulf region, and our forces exercise together
regularly, often with those of other GCC states. 
<P>
As we seek to build a lasting security relationship, our two
governments are consulting closely to devise mutually acceptable
arrangements to complete implementation of the 1994 agreement. 
We also welcome the establishment two years ago of the Emirates
Center for Strategic Studies and Research and appreciate the work
of the Center under its energetic and capable director, Dr. Jamal
al-Suweidi.
<P>
Clearly, the UAE is a valued partner for us in this strategic
region.  Among other things, it has a crucial role to play in
enforcing United Nations sanctions against the Iraqi regime.  As
Security Council Resolution 986 is implemented, sanctions
enforcement will become even more important.  The sheer volume of
shipping in the Gulf will make the Multinational Interdiction
Force's job even more difficult than it already is.  And Baghdad
is falsely portraying 986 as the beginning of the end of
sanctions.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The
"oil-for-food" formula was always part of the framework of
Security Council resolutions because the Security Council did not
want the Iraqi people to suffer undue hardship for the sins of
its government.  Until this year, however, Baghdad refused to
accept this resolution even though its own people would be the
beneficiaries.  There should be no doubt in anyone's mind that
the sanctions must and will remain in effect until Iraq has
complied fully with all the Security Council resolutions.  
<P>
When I visited the UAE in October, I stressed the importance of
cracking down on sanctions-busters, some of whom unfortunately
operate out of the UAE, principally Dubai and the northern
Emirates.  I want to note here that the UAE has cooperated in the
handling of these violators.  It has readily accepted vessels
diverted for sanctions violations, and this summer the UAE
government warned its shipping community that it would deflag
vessels that are caught violating sanctions repeatedly.
<P>
Moving eastward in the Gulf, the United States and the UAE share
concerns about Iran's policies and behavior in the region: its
support for terrorism; its drive to acquire weapons of mass
destruction; its efforts to destabilize other governments; its
hegemonic behavior in the Gulf; and its opposition to the peace
process.  The United States supports the UAE's call for peaceful
resolution of its dispute with Iran over the islands of Abu Musa
and Greater and Lesser Tunb.
<P>
The United States has no more important goal in the Middle East
than to secure a just, lasting and comprehensive peace between
Israel and all its neighbors.  The UAE shares the realization
that peace is in the interest of all peoples of the region.  Just
the other day, Ambassador Shaali remarked to me that the success
of the peace process is vital to his country's future security
and development.  We appreciate that the UAE has demonstrated its
support for the peace process by its participation in the
multilateral track of the process.  We were gratified that
Foreign Minister Rashid Abdullah personally headed his country's
delegation to the recent Middle East North Africa Economic
Conference in Cairo.  We also encourage the UAE to continue
contributing generously to the development needs of the
Palestinian people.  
<P>
The UAE has played a constructive role in international affairs
beyond the Middle East.  It contributed troops to the UN peace
keeping mission in Somalia.  Right now, it is a key participant
with us and other donors in the program to strengthen the Bosnian
Federation militarily, so that it will be able to deter future
attack--or defend itself if deterrence fails.
<P>
Let me close by stressing again how much my government values its
growing ties with the UAE.  Emiris are getting to know the United
States better too, as many attend university here or come on
business or tourism.  The growing interaction between Americans
and Emiris is good for both sides.  I look forward to the day
when U.S. airlines stop regularly in the Emirates and when
Emirates Airline also flies to the States.  Incidentally, it's a
wonderful airline.  I took it recently and had a great flight.  I
also stopped in the Dubai free shops -- bought this necktie in
fact.  Now you may not agree with my taste in ties (I have that
problem in the family, too), but there can be no disagreement
that a visit to the Dubai free shop is a memorable experience.  I
believe that increasing day-to-day contact between our peoples is
one of the most effective ways to foster mutual understanding and
awareness of each other's concerns, and can lead us to appreciate
how much we share common values and interests.  Arabs and Muslims
are all too often misunderstood in this country, just as
Americans sometimes are misunderstood in the Middle East.
<P>
We extend our warmest congratulations to all citizens of the
United Arab Emirates on this important anniversary.  Given all
that the UAE has accomplished during this first quarter century,
the people of the Emirates can look forward to the future with
confidence.  And Americans and Emiris can look forward to the
continuing expansion of productive relations between our
governments and peoples in greater understanding, closer
communication, and mutual respect.

before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee<br>
June 20, 1995</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, it is an honor and
privilege to appear before you today as you consider my
nomination
to be the Ambassador of the United States to the State of Qatar. 
I am very grateful to the President and Secretary of State for
the
confidence and trust they have shown in me by this nomination.
<P>
Mr. Chairman, although America's formal relations with the State
of
Qatar date less than three decades, they are characterized by a
depth of mutual support and understanding that could be the envy
of
many countries whose intercourse with us is centuries older. 
Qatar's soldiers, sailors and airmen, though few in number,
distinguished themselves as fighting allies during Desert Storm. 
A Qatari battalion halted and held the Iraqi thrust at Khafji,
permitting American air power to destroy the attackers.  Qatar
has
been at the forefront of states in the region offering military
cooperation, support in kind and facilities to US forces in
defense
of our mutual interests.  American companies have been welcomed
to
participate prominently and profitably in the development of
Qatar's enormous gas reserves.  Finally, Qatar has been out in
front in working to integrate Israel economically and politically
with the Arab World; "warm peace" has real meaning in Doha.
<P>
I believe the information provided to the Committee documents my
thirty-two years of experience in the Foreign Service.  I will
not
elaborate on them in this statement but would be happy to answer
any questions that you might have.
<P>
I will state for the record, however, that I view my nomination
as
an opportunity to advance the strategic and economic interests of
the United States, and of its citizens, through deepening the
relationship with a small, but brave and valuable partner.  If
confirmed, I plan to work closely with this committee, with the
Congress as a whole and with American business.

Commemorated in Washington<br>

by Joanne L. Nix<BR>
USIA Staff Writer</CENTER> 
<P>
Washington -- This week in Washington, ceremonies were held to
commemorate a brief but remarkable chapter of naval history --
the meeting in 1945 of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt of the
United States and King Abdul Aziz (Ibn Saud), the founder of
modern-day Saudi Arabia.  What began as a warm, personal
friendship fifty years ago is now a strong, mutually advantageous
partnership between two great countries.
<P>
On February 15, U.S. sailors who served during World War II
aboard
the U.S. destroyers the USS Murphy, the ship that carried King
Ibn
Saud to the top-secret meeting, and crew members of the USS
Quincy,
the ship where the meeting with Roosevelt took place, traveled
with
their families from cities and towns throughout the U.S. to
Washington.  They were the special guests of the United States
Navy
and the Embassy of Saudi Arabia at an event commemorating the
formal beginning of strategic, economic and cultural relations
between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
<P>
The crewmen were honored at a Navy Memorial Foundation-sponsored
ceremony and reception attended by high-ranking diplomatic
representatives of Saudi Arabia, including Saleh Al-Rajhy,
Counselor of the Royal Embassy, Captain Mogbel Al-Mogbel, Naval
Attache of the Saudi Embassy and Dr. Mohsin Helal.
<P>
The hour-long ceremony was opened by the President's Own, the
U.S.
Marine Corps band, which played the Saudi and American national
anthems. Dignitaries and special guests arrived and were escorted
down to the first two rows of the Arleigh and Roberta Burke
Theater.
<P>
February 15 marked the actual day the two leaders met 50 years
ago. 
Among the U.S. officials present at the commemoration were the
widow and two sons of the late Captain John S. Keating, who
commanded the Murphy's destroyer squadron and Secretary of the
Navy
John Dalton who described the bond that was formed when "the men
of
the desert met the men of the sea as friends and allies."
<P>
"This ceremony," said the Secretary, "is both a reunion and a
remembrance. It is a reunion for the officers and sailors of the
USS Murphy and USS Quincy ... shipmates who served their nation
in
a time of grave peril.  It is a remembrance of their deeds.  But
it
is also a ... celebration ... of the relationship of two nations
who have been allies in war, and friends in peace:  the United
States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
<P>
"The Great Bitter Lake Summit," so named because King Ibn Saud
and
President Roosevelt held their secret meeting in the Great Bitter
Lake that forms part of the Suez Canal, was not the first time
the
United States and the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia pledged mutual
cooperation.
<P>
Secretary Dalton explained that in 1933, America and Saudi Arabia
signed a treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation.  In
February of 1943, President Roosevelt -- who had once served as
Assistant Secretary of the Navy -- "declared that the defense of
Saudi Arabia was a vital interest of the United States."  Later,
during World War II, the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia became allies against the Axis powers.
<P>
Dalton emphasized that the ties that were forged during that
summit
are still strong.  "In 1991," he said, "the Armed Forces of Saudi
Arabia met again with the United States Navy and United States
Marine Corps ... and all the American Armed Forces ... to help
liberate (Kuwait)."
<P>
Saleh Al-Rajhy, Counselor of the Saudi Embassy, acting on behalf
of
the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin
Sultan
bin Abdulaziz, accepted a framed photograph of the historic
meeting.  The 1945 Summit, he said, "was a landmark in the
history
of our friendship and set the stage for cordial relationships ..
(between) our two countries."
<P>
"In Saudi Arabia, even today," the Counselor said, "pictures of
President 1oosevelt hang in our offices and homes.... (Although)
times have changed, our feelings of friendship and gratitude have
only grown stronger."
<P>
Following the remarks by officials, the crewmen of the two
vessels
were presented with certificates of appreciation from the Saudi
Arabian Embassy and the Navy Memorial Foundation.
<P>
As part of the ceremony, original film footage of the voyage of
the
Murphy and the meeting aboard the Quincy was shown to the guests.

Included in the film was an interview with Commander Bernard
Smith,
Captain of the USS Murphy.
<P>
In the film, Smith described the meeting between two very
different
groups of people -- the Saudi contingent and American sailors,
who
developed mutual  understanding and admiration while taking part
in
the history-making journey.
<P>
The voyage marked the first time the Saudi king had left his
homeland.  His staff was anxious that the 63-year-old ruler would
be comfortable aboard the American warship so they brought aboard
the trappings of his own country.
<P>
According to Smith, the King had at the departure point in Jidda
100 live sheep to be loaded on the destroyer Murphy to feed not
only his party, but the ship's crew and President Roosevelt as
well.
<P>
The commander of the Murphy was shocked at the prospect of
loading
live animals aboard his ship so a compromise was finally reached
and only seven sheep were loaded on board.
<P>
Once on board, the King spurned the offer of the Captain's cabin
and slept under a specially constructed tent on deck.  According
to
other historical sources, Ibn Saud's servants lit fires for
coffee
despite live ammunition racks and guns nearby.  Both Saudi and
ship
staff shared cooking duties in the galley in relative harmony.
<P>
Five times each day, the navigator provided the Saudis with a
compass heading pointing toward Mecca so that the King and his
party could say their customary prayers.
<P>
Ambassador Bandar, Ibn Saud's grandson, recalled the historic
meeting in a 50th anniversary article written for "Middle East
Insight" magazine.  The prince revealed that King Ibn Saud posed
only two questions about Roosevelt and his country:  Do Americans
believe in God, and do they have colonies? Assured that the
Americans believed in God and had no colonies, the king embarked
on
the relationship that even today represents the heart of Saudi
Arabia's diplomatic and security policy.
<P>
According to Prince Bandar, at no time did Ibn Saud even hint at
financial aid for Saudi Arabia.  He traveled to the meeting
seeking
friends and not funds in spite of the fact that at that time, his
land was cut off by war from foreign import markets.
<P>
Although President Roosevelt died less than two months after the
historic meeting, he lived long enough to make in person one
address to Congress in the course of which he said, "I learned
more
(about the Near East) by talking with Ibn Saud for five minutes
than I could have learned in exchange of two or three dozen
letters."
<P>
Ever since that day fifty years ago, every American president has
attested to Saudi Arabia's vital importance to the United States.

On the occasion of the Murphy/Quincy commemoration, President
Clinton wrote: "It gives me great pleasure to reflect on the warm
personal relationship that King Fahd and I have developed, which
mirrors the Saudi Arabia over the past half-century.  I believe
King Abdul Aziz and President Roosevelt would be very pleased
with
the results of their meeting fifty years ago.  And I am 1onfident
that the foundations they laid will continue to ensure a vibrant
U.S.-Saudi partnership for many decades to come."

House
Briefing on Iran/Libya Act</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff><IMG SRC="usis2.jpg">
<CENTER><B><H2>Special White House Briefing<br>
on the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act<BR>
August 5, 1996</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
Washington -- Robert Kyle, director of international economic
affairs for the NEC and NSC staffs at the White House, says that
with regard to Iran, the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act President
Clinton signed August 5 "covers foreign companies that invest in
the petroleum sector, in the development of petroleum resources
in Iran in amounts over $40 million.
<P>
"So it would not cover those (companies) who simply sold
equipment in that case," Kyle said. "In the case of Libya, the
same type of investment in Libya would be covered. And in
addition, foreign companies that violate the U.N. sanctions would
be covered."
<P>
Kyle said that "some of the U.N. sanctions prohibit trade in
certain oil and gas equipment, and to that extent, companies that
do that in violation of the U.N. sanctions would be covered by
the bill."
<P>
Following is the official transcript from the White House Home
Page:
<P>
PRESS BRIEFING BY: 
<P>
MARK RICHARD, DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR INTERNATIONAL
ENFORCEMENT IN THE CRIMINAL DIVISION;
<P>
AND ROBERT KYLE, ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR OF
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AFFAIRS AT NEC AND NSC
<P>
The Briefing Room
<P>
2:35 P.M.  EDT
<P>
DAVID JOHNSON: Good afternoon. As all of you know I think,
there's
been a couple of things this morning which have focused very
heavily on terrorism. And before we start the main part of the
briefing with Mike today I thought it would be a good opportunity
for some of you to ask some questions if you had them about some
items that might be remaining from this morning.
<P>
We have with us today to answer your questions, Mark Richard, the
Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division who
would be glad to address any questions you might have about the
International Crime Control Act of 1996 that the President
introduced in his speech this morning. We have Phil Wilcox, the
Ambassador-at-large for Counterterrorism from the State
Department.  He'll be glad to answer more general questions about
terrorism and our work with our allies and partners abroad. And
we also have Robert Kyle, the Senior Director for International
Economic Policy from the NEC and NSC staffs, who would be glad to
address questions you might have about the Iran and Libya
Sanctions Act of 1996.
<P>
So if you would raise your hands if you have any questions about
those issues.
<P>
Q: What about the extent of the embargo -- does this still cover
companies which make oil equipment that they sell to oil
companies?  Does it cover the whole oil sector or only the
exportation? 
<P>
KYLE: The bill covers several things. First of all, with regard
to Iran, the bill covers foreign companies that invest in the
petroleum sector, in the development of petroleum resources in
Iran in amounts over $40 million. So it would not cover those who
simply sold equipment in that case.
<P>
In the case of Libya, the same type of investment in Libya would
be covered. And in addition, foreign companies that violate the
U.N. sanctions would be covered. Some of the U.N. sanctions
prohibit trade in certain oil and gas equipment, and to that
extent, companies that do that in violation of the U.N. sanctions
would be covered by the bill.
<P>
Q: To make it clear, a company that could invest in a plant in
Libya or Iran, a plant making equipment, oil equipment, would not
be subject to the embargo?
<P>
KYLE: No, I do not believe they'd be covered. Companies that do
have questions about their coverage can apply to the State
Department for a ruling in that regard. And, of course, I'd have
to know the specifics of that case and so forth.
<P>
Q: A question about the International Crime Control Act of 1996
-- what's new in it? What does it specifically do that existing
law does not provide for? And is this more organized-crime
oriented than terrorism oriented?
<P>
RICHARD: Well, it certainly has potential impact on terrorist
cases, but it's much broader than just terrorism. As far as
what's knew I think there is a factual handout emphasizing a
variety of areas. It does, among other things, extend the
jurisdiction of the FBI to address certain violent acts committed
against U.S. nationals, business people abroad, involving murder,
kidnapping, extortion and the like, under certain circumstances.
It also affords us an opportunity to extradite people from the
U.S. without an extradition treaty, but consistent with due
process and the rule of law.
<P>
It has a variety of steps designed to facilitate money-laundering
prosecutions in the international arena. It enables us to exclude
from the U.S., from entry into the U.S. individuals who are
organized crime figures. And it permits us to deny entry to
people who are wanted in other countries and to return them to
the country where they are wanted for prosecution. And there are
many, many examples of what I would regard as new enforcement
initiatives contained in this proposed bill.
<P>
Q: There was no mechanism previously to deny entry to those who
are trying to avoid prosecution?
<P>
RICHARD: Per se, that's correct. That would not be a basis per se
of exclusion. Moreover, even if they were excludable we could not
return them to the country that wanted them. 
<P>
Now, I would emphasize that this proposal does not in any way
modify the asylum provisions or obligations under asylum
conventions. But, nevertheless, it would afford us new mechanisms
to, in effect, preclude the U.S. from becoming a safe haven for
international organized crime figures.
<P>
Q: Could you explain -- could you elaborate by which companies
would be targets for sanctions under this new law?
<P>
KYLE: The bill is perspective in the sense that it covers new
investments or new violations of the U.N. sanctions against
Libya.  So it's not possible for me right now to identify which
company because it's perspective.
<P>
Q:  You mean it would not affect Total or it would affect -
<P>
Q:  So, it wouldn't affect it -
<P>
KYLE: It affects companies that engage in new investments. So
existing investments are not covered by the sanctions under the
act.
<P>
Q: And where does Total S.A. rank in those categories? Is that
new or is it -
<P>
KYLE: Well, what Total did prior to enactment of the act
presumably is an existing investment. What Total does in the
future would be subject to the provisions of the act and a
determination would have to be made whether it's a new investment
or not.  
<P>
Q: So if it doesn't an existing investments doesn't that kind of
defeat the purpose of the bill then? I mean, if it's going to -
<P>
KYLE: First of all, there are very few foreign investments in
Iran
right now, but the purpose of the bill was to deny Iran and Libya
new revenues that could help fund activities that we oppose. And
the bill does deter new investments or new trading of the type
that
is prohibited by the U.N. sanctions.
<P>
Q: Do you have some notion of what the economic impact would be,
the potential in, say, the next few years of lost investments,
revenues to these two countries?
<P>
KYLE: It's tough to predict that because you would have to have
some sense of what investments would have occurred but for this
and
what it will deter, and I don't think we'll know that until we
see
how the bill -
<P>
Q:  Is this considered significant or minor or --
<P>
KYLE: I think there are significant provisions, but whether I can
put a specific dollar value on it I think is pretty much
impossible
at this time.
<P>
Q: I just want to go back to the point I was trying to make
earlier. It may not be hugely significant, but the fact is there
is
a loophole there for ongoing investments. Don't you seek to try
and
close those at any point?
<P>
KYLE: It's not a loophole. I mean, there are -- the concept of
contract sanctity is a fairly established idea in U.S. law. And
the
idea here was to address new investments and new activities by
companies that would know that this law was in effect and try to
stop them.
<P>
Q: Can you elaborate a little bit on the money laundering aspects
of the new crime bill. They're talking about expanding the list
of
money laundering and predicate crimes. What does this mean? And
what effectively -- what more powers does this give to the
President than was not existing previously?
<P>
KYLE:  Well, I'm sure I can't, but I think Mark probably can.
<P>
RICHARD: It affords us new opportunities. As you know, the money
laundering provision contains a variety of predicate acts. It
expands the range of predicate acts that would be covered,
including would enable us to go by way of the money laundering
statute to reach, for example, activities involving the use of
explosives, offenses involving public corruption, fraud schemes
directed against foreign governments and the like.
<P>
It also clarifies the obligation of why a transfer concern's to
report suspicious transactions and the like, which should be very
significant in terms of surfacing in this context possible
ongoing
money laundering schemes. So it does have a variety of money
laundering direct provisions and related provisions that could
enhance our ability to respond to these problems.
<P>
Q: Is there anyone of a political background here who could
estimate what the chances are in Congress? Is there any
Republican
opposition looming to this bill?
<P>
RICHARD: I would say that this bill was crafted through an
interagency process that began at the direction of President
Clinton. If you recall, in his speech before the United Nations
of
October of '95 I think it was, he directed the Department of
Justice to commence an interagency process to explore possible
gaps
in responding to the problem of international organized crime,
and
this is the product, if you will, of that interagency process.
<P>
Q: Just to make sure I'm clear, this law, this new law doesn't
affect any existing contracts?
<P>
KYLE: It doesn't. It affects only new investments in Iran and
Libya. So existing contracts are not covered by the new law.
<P>
Q:  Are you aware of any activity that was on the horizon?
<P>
KYLE: I don't know of activity, necessarily, on the horizon, and
obviously that company would probably take into account this
legislation as it's trying to figure out whether to make the new
investment or not. Remember, these are large investments. I mean,
we're talking about over $40 million or so.
<P>
Q:  Why did you set it at $40 million?
<P>
KYLE: So that there would -- basically any normal-sized
investment
in petroleum development in either of these countries would tend
to
exceed $40 million. So, though it's large, it would tend to
capture
most of the investments that are made. But we did want to make
sure
that we didn't cover de minimis exceptions, and that level has
been
in there since the beginning in the Senate bill.
<P>
Q: Isn't it possible that, theoretically, you could, depending
upon
how this act is implemented, the President could choose a couple
of
the, I guess, six possible sanctions that might have no
conceivable
effect on the target company? Let's say this company never
participated in Ex-Im Bank loans, never bid for U.S. government
contracts -- the President could choose those two sanctions and
it
would have no conceivable effect.
<P>
KYLE: Well, the President has to choose among, in effect, seven
sanctions in the bill, frankly. And obviously, the sanctions --
what the question is referring to is that the sanctions may apply
to some companies, may not apply to other companies. Obviously,
if
we have a situation where a company is violating the bill, we're
going to look to see what effect it has on the company and seek
to
choose the route that has the most effect in stopping the
activity
we want to deter.
<P>
So there's flexibility for the President to choose among the
sanctions. On the other hand, we have to assume a situation where
we're opposed to the activity that the company's undertaken.

of
Staff Shalikashvili Press Conference in Kuwait,
5/27</TITLE></HEAD>

<CENTER><B><H2>Joint Chief of Staff Shalikashvili<br>
Press Conference in Kuwait<br>
May 27, 1996</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
TRANSCRIPT:(General expresses U.S. solidarity with Kuwait) (910)
<P>
Kuwait City -- The relationship between the United States and
Kuwait "is on very solid footing and ... we will continue working
together every bit as well as we have done in the past," General
John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said
May 27.
<p>
At a press conference at Kuwait Airport following his earlier
meeting with Kuwaiti defense officials, Shalikashvili said that
in
addition to discussions about the bilateral defense relationship,
they also commented on United Nations Security Council Resolution
986, the Iraq oil-for-food agreement.
<p>
Shalikashvili said the U.S. is "absolutely committed to ensure
that
986 is not used to circumvent the intent of it, which is to
provide
humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq who have suffered
so
much under Saddam Hussein."  He also emphasized that the
sanctions
regime will remain in place until Iraq complies with the relevant
UNSC resolutions that deal with sanctions.
<p>
Following is the official transcript of the press conference, as
provided by USIS Kuwait:
<p>
(Begin transcript)
<p>
General:  Thank you very much for coming and I appreciate the
opportunity in this public way to thank General Ali for his
gracious invitation to come here to share an opportunity to
discuss
the United States' commitment to the peace and stability of this
region and to express our solidarity with Kuwait.  It also gave
me
the opportunity to visit some of our men and women who are
serving
here and to see how very, very well they are hosted by their
Kuwaiti counterparts.  So, I leave here very much assured that
our
relationship is on very solid footing and that we will continue
working together every bit as well as we have done in the past. 
With that, ladies and gentlemen, I am prepared to answer any of
your questions.
<p>
Q:  What issues did you address in your meetings?
<p>
General:  We discussed principally the relationship between us,
if
there were any issues that we needed to work on.  I am very happy
to report to you that everything is working well.  We did comment
in our discussions on such issues as United Nations Security
Council Resolution 986, and our firm commitment that 986 in no
way
lessens the requirements on the part of Iraq to fulfill all
relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, and
certainly
that resolution dealing with Kuwaiti POWs and those missing.
Those
kinds of resolutions must be fully complied with.
<p>
Q:  Did you discuss the resolution results which involved the
imports into Iraq from the rest of the world dealing with food
and
humanitarian aid? Are you going to monitor the shipments going to
Um Qasr and are you going to use any Kuwaiti ports?
<p>
General:  I don't think I am the one to talk about the specifics
of
the monitoring regime that is being set up, other than to tell
you
that we are absolutely committed to ensure that 986 is not used
to
circumvent the intent of it, which is to provide humanitarian
assistance to the people of Iraq who have suffered so much under
Saddam Hussein.  We will make sure that none of that money from
the
sale of oil is diverted to such things as improving his military
capability.
<p>
Q:  Don't you think the implementation of this resolution will
give
Iraq the opportunity to forestall implementing the other U.N.
resolutions?
<p>
General:  I think it is up to the community of nations to be sure
that that does not happen.  It's absolutely important that
everyone
understands our continued commitment to hold Saddam Hussein
accountable for the full compliance of all relevant United
Nations
Security Council resolutions.
<p>
Q:  Would you like to comment about the Iran exercise?
<p>
General:  I think it is too early to tell about the specifics of
the exercises that just finished the other day.  I must tell you
that I, for one, as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
watch very carefully what is happening in Iran and certainly that
we are committed to ensure that no one in this region threatens
or
intimidates any of our friends or our allies.
<p>
Q:  Will the role of the U.S. Navy change in the Gulf?
<p>
General:  I think that to talk about specifics it's a little too
early.  But remember that the operation that's being run in the
Gulf is one essentially of ensuring that the sanctions regime is
complied with, the sanction regime remains in place and so the
task
of ensuring that Iraq abides by the relevant sanctions is still a
requirement, that we will ensure that we do our part to insist
that
it is complied with.
<p>
Q:  (Inaudible)
<p>
General:  It's too early to tell, but the function will not
change,
that is the compliance on the part of Iraq with the relevant
United
Nations Security Council resolutions that deal with sanctions.
<p>
Q:  Did you discuss any increase in the American presence in
Kuwait?
<p>
General:  No, we did not discuss any specific increases.  What we
discussed is the presence that we have here now, and we both
expressed our satisfaction with the way our relationship is
moving
along.  I took the opportunity to express my deep appreciation
for
the way our troops here are being hosted.  It's being done in an
excellent way.  Thank you very much.

<CENTER><B><H2>Joint Statement on U.S.-Oman Cooperation<br></H2>
by Nicholas Burns, Department of State Spokesman<br>
October 10, 1996</B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
Washington -- The governments of the United States and Oman have
begun their annual review of bilateral, regional and global
issues. At the State Department October 10, the U.S. side was led
by Under Secretary Peter Tarnoff, and the Sultanate of Oman was
represented by H.E. Yusif bin Alawi, Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs.
<P>
State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns, in an official
statement, reported that "the United States and Oman have long
enjoyed a very close and cooperative relationship" working
together "to achieve peace and stability in the region."
<P>
Burns outlined the U.S. and Oman's "mutually productive
relationship (and) cooperation in fostering economic development
and growth. While originally focused on economic assistance," he
said, "our relationship has been evolving -- in recent weeks, we
have commenced efforts to develop a new, three-pronged approach
to economic cooperation."
<P>
He also noted a particular emphasis on "ways to advance the
Middle East peace process" and the need to "implement all
Security Council resolutions resulting from Iraq's aggression
against Kuwait."
<P>
According to Burns, that the two sides "discussed the concerns of
the GCC countries regarding Iranian efforts to build weapons of
mass destruction and by Iranian opposition to the Middle East
peace process, support for terrorism, and refusal to engage in a
peaceful settlement of the dispute over Iranian occupation of Abu
Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunb islands."
<P>
Following is the official text of Burns' statement, provided by
the Office of the Spokesman:
<P>
(Begin text)
<P>
The Governments of the United States and the Sultanate of Oman
conducted their annual review of bilateral, regional, and global
issues today at the State Department. The U.S. side was led by
Under Secretary Tarnoff, and the Sultanate of Oman was
represented by H.E. Yusif bin Alawi, Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs.
<P>
The two sides reviewed, in particular ways to advance the Middle
East peace process and agreed on the need to implement all
Security Council resolutions resulting from Iraq's aggression
against Kuwait. With regard to the latter, they discussed ways to
assist the United Nations Special Commission to continue its
monitoring mission. The two sides discussed the concerns of the
GCC countries regarding Iranian efforts to build weapons of mass
destruction and by Iranian opposition to the Middle East peace
process, support for terrorism, and refusal to engage in a
peaceful settlement of the dispute over Iranian occupation of Abu
Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunb islands.
<P>
The United States and Oman have long enjoyed a very close and
cooperative relationship in our efforts to achieve peace and
stability in the region. One of the hallmarks of our mutually
productive relationship has been cooperation in fostering
economic development and growth. While originally focused on
economic assistance, our relationship has been evolving -- in
recent weeks, we have commenced efforts to develop a new,
three-pronged approach to economic cooperation.
<P>
Two weeks ago, in Muscat, our governments signed a Memorandum of
Understanding that provides arrangements for technical assistance
to Oman for an additional four years. This MOU will provide a
framework for continued U.S. cooperation in Oman's development.
Today, we have begun to define two other aspects of joint
cooperation: a business and commercial group and a science and
technology group.
<P>
The Government of Oman is committed to support the growth and
development of the private sector as the engine for the future
economic prosperity of the Sultanate. The U.S. welcomes and
supports that commitment, and is pleased to have witnessed
growing interest in Oman by the U.S. business community. Through
our bilateral cooperation, the U.S. and Oman will seek to
stimulate further development of private sector ties by improving
the climate for trade and investment and by increasing awareness
of the opportunities available to our business communities.
<P>
Similarly, the U.S. and Oman confront common challenges in a
number of areas of scientific endeavor. In coming years, we will
seek to broaden and strengthen bilateral cooperation in such
diverse fields as arid land agriculture, water conservation,
environmental protection, and health.
<P>
As U.S.-Omani relations mature, we will continue to explore and
develop new areas for cooperation. The discussions that we have
now commenced provide clear evidence of our shared commitment to
work together to enhance the economic prosperity, health, and
well-being of the peoples of our two countries.

Clinton
Remarks for Janadriah Cultural Festival</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff><IMG SRC="usis2.jpg">
<CENTER><B><H2>Hillary Clinton Remarks<BR>
for Janadriah Cultural Festival<br>
March 11, 1996</H2></B><P>
<IMG SRC="footer.gif"></CENTER> 
<P>
Washington -- First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed her
hopes
that "Islamic countries and the West will continue to expand
their
dialogue so that we can learn to appreciate the many values and
aspirations we share as people and nations."
<P>
Mrs. Clinton was speaking in remarks televised especially for the
11th National Heritage and Cultural Festival in Janadriah, Saudi
Arabia, a major Arab cultural event which has attracted artists
and
intellectuals from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf.  The festival is
sponsored by Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abd al-Aziz.
<P>
In her remarks, Mrs. Clinton spoke of how "opportunities to share
in Muslim life have enriched her own experience."  She spoke
warmly
of her meeting with American Muslim children at the Eid Al-Fitr
celebration she hosted recently at the White House, saying "Now
Muslim children also know that their religion has a place in
their
President's House."
<P>
Following is the text of Mrs. Clinton's March 8 remarks: (Begin
text) I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address the
1996 Janadriah Cultural Festival, and to contribute in some small
way to a discussion as important as "Islam and the West."
<P>
Here in the United States, Americans are beginning to learn more
about the rich traditions of Islamic history and culture and to
appreciate the contributions of Islamic people to our own
culture.
<P>
I, myself, have become an eager student of Islam in recent years,
thanks in part to my daughter, who took a course on Islamic
history
in high school. As a result of her studies, she proved to be an
invaluable tour guide to me when we traveled to South Asia
together
last year.
<P>
I also had the opportunity last month to host the first-ever
White
House celebration of the Eid Al-Fitr holiday.  As I shared in
this
historic celebration of joy, love and family life, I thought of
how
Western society too often mischaracterizes Islam and those who
adhere to its teaching.  We have allowed a tiny minority to
define
an ugly stereotype.  The reality is that the vast majority of the
estimated 4 million Muslims in the United States are loyal
citizens
whose daily lives revolve around work, family and community.
<P>
As Americans, we are proud of our history as an open, pluralist
society that respects all religions, including Islam.  During the
Ramadan celebration I met a little Muslim American girl who spoke
to the group, saying, "Only in America, people from different
parts
of the world can come together and become one community.  I am
proud to be an American.  And I am proud to be an American
Muslim." 
In the past, children of other faiths have had the opportunity to
observe their major holidays at the White House.  Now Muslim
children also know that their religion has a place in their
President's house.
<P>
These opportunities to share in Muslim life have enriched my own
experience, and I am hopeful that Islamic countries and the West
will continue to expand their dialogue so that we can learn to
appreciate the many values and aspirations we share as people and
nations.  Thank you for your part in enriching the dialogue.  I
wish the Festival and its distinguished participants the best of
success.

<H2>AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE OF THE U.S.-SOUTH AFRICA BINATIONAL
COMMISSION    JUNE 1996</H2>
<P> The U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission was established
in March 1995 to facilitate bilateral cooperation between the
United States and South Africa to ensure that key issues of
mutual concern are discussed at the highest levels of government.
 Agriculture was the sixth committee formed under the auspices of
the Binational Commission.  The Agriculture committee is
co-chaired by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Dan
Glickman and the new South African Minister of Agriculture and
Land Affairs Derek Andre Hanekom, who assumed his ministerial
portfolio in May 2996 after the resignation of then South African
Minister of Agriculture Andre Isak van Niekerk. 
</P>
<P>The Agriculture Committee's goal is to strengthen bilateral
relations between the United States and South Africa on
agricultural and rural development issues of mutual interest. 
The committee provides a high-level, government-to-government
framework to facilitate discussion and cooperation on
agricultural programs, projects, and linkages between the two
countries in the following areas: agricultural trade, investment,
and development; rural economic and community development;
agricultural marketing, regulation, and safety of food products;
food and nutrition; sustainable use and management of natural
resources; and agricultural economics, extension, and research. 
</P>
<P>At the first meeting of the Agriculture Committee on March
26, 1996, organizational and membership issues were the focus of
discussion.  The co-chairs -- U.S. Agriculture Secretary Glickman
and the former South African Agriculture Minister van Niekerk --
agreed to sign a Terms of Reference (TOR) by the next meeting of
the Agriculture Committee on July 22, 1996.  The meeting precedes
the third full meeting of the Binational Commission on July 23,
1996.  The TOR describes the functions and organizational
structure of the committee.  The committee has formed four
working groups to address agricultural issues: Market Access,
Institutional Development, Sustainability and Agriculture in the
Rural Context, and Agricultural Technology Development for Income
Generation. 
</P>
<P>The Agriculture Committee held a U.S.-South Africa
Agribusiness Trade Opportunities Forum in Washington, D.C., on
March 27, 1996, for South African agribusinesses.  Participants
exchanged ideas and information about doing business in South
Africa.  Topics included public and private financing, food
safety requirements for export and import, transportation of food
products, and opportunities for U.S. high-value, intermediate,
and bulk products.  Additionally, the committee is funding
numerous agricultural and rural development training and
technical assistance programs in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>Other committees of the Binational Commission are the
sustainable Minerals and Energy Committee; the Human Resources
Development and Education Committee; the Conservation, Water, and
the Environment Committee; the Trade and Investment Committee,
and the Science and Technology Committee.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000">
<P>Vice President Al Gore announced today that the Conservation,
Environment and Water Committee of the U.S. - South Africa
Binational Commission, chaired by Secretary of the Interior Bruce
Babbitt, and South African Minister of Water Affairs Kadar Asmal,
 reviewed the progress of its 69 exchange visits sponsored this
year and its 22 projects.  Exchange visits have primarily been
South African officials from the national and provincial levels
of government and non-governmental organizations to the U.S. to
review such subjects as water conservation, waste management,
parks management, pollution abatement, etc. Most exchanges lasted
from two weeks to a month.  Among the 22 projects of the
Committee are included technical assistance on livestock
management in critical resource areas, dam safety, weather
monitoring, and increasing participation of non-governmental
organizations in conservation.  
</P>
<P>The Committee  also had extensive discussions on the
importance of environmental education in both countries.  The
role of non-governmental organizations in Committee activities
was reviewed as well.  The meeting concluded with a discussion of
upcoming multilateral environmental issues of common concern to
both countries. 
</P>
<P>Secretary Babbitt hosted a reception on Monday evening in
honor of the South African delegation at the new offices of the
National Council of Negro Women on Pennsylvania Avenue.    #

energy statistics and other energy market information between the
Participants. 
</P>
<P>The exchange of energy data and information will include, but
not be limited to, the following: 
</P>
<P>(A)	Annual energy market statistics (production, imports,
exports. stocks, bunkers, transformation, demand, prices, and
other data) for petrolewn, natural gas, coal, electricity,
fuelwood, and other forms of energy; 
</P>
<P>(B)	Other related data and information concerning fuel
characteristics, fossil fuel heat values, refining capacity,
reserves, and other energy information; 
</P>
<P>(C)	Information concerning statistical methods, analytic
techniques, and system documentation; 
</P>
<P>(D)	Information about electronic information dissemination;
and (E)	Exchange of personnel for the purpose of training on

<H2>U.S. AND SOUTH AFRICA GROW STRONGER THROUGH BNC, GORE SAYS</H2>
<P>
Good afternoon.  I would like to begin by thanking all the
dedicated men and women who have worked so hard these past months
to make this meeting of the U.S.-South Africa Binational
Commission a true success.  My special thanks, though, go to
South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki for the commitment
and leadership he has shown throughout the BNC process which we
began here in Washington in March of 1995 and continued in
Pretoria late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Created by the clear vision and very good sense of Presidents
Mandela and Clinton, our Binational Commission exists to support
one very simple, but fundamental idea:  that our nations can grow
stronger, wiser, more free and prosperous when our citizens join
together in common cause to confront common challenges, and to
take advantage of shared opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
We have accomplished a great deal since our last meeting. 
Together, we have explored ways to reduce pollution, conserve
water, manage waste, empower and educate our young people,
protect our environment, improve agricultural practices, build
free markets and free minds, and help open the door to real
economic opportunity for all our citizens. 
</P>
<P>
By sharing experience and know-how, we also have been enriching
both our nations.  Since our Commission's first meeting, over 100
South African leaders have participated in professional exchanges
with their American counterparts.  We also have launched the
Mandela scholars program, which is providing graduate-level
economics training for historically disadvantaged South Africans.

</P>
<P>
These young people truly are the best hope for our future.  I
would like to ask those Mandela scholars who are here today to
stand up and be recognized.... 
</P>
<P>
Each of you should know we are all very, very proud of you. 
</P>
<P>
If I may, I would like briefly to review some of the important
new steps we've taken in the past few days across the full range
of our Commission's efforts, from promoting trade and investment,
to cooperation on agriculture, sustainable energy, science and
technology, human resources development and education, and our
environment. 
</P>
<P>
-- First, I am pleased to announce that earlier today, Ruth
Harkin, the President of the U.S. Overseas Private Investment
Corporation, signed an Investment Fund Protocol to support a 120
million dollar private equity fund that will invest in businesses
in South Africa owned by the country's majority population.  This
new fund represents a major step towards spurring investment,
trade, job creation, and growth in a new, robust, and prosperous
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
I am proud that our Commission has played an important role in
making this new fund a reality. 
</P>
<P>
-- The civil aviation agreement we just signed also is emblematic
of the many other accomplishments of the BNC.  This agreement
will restore formal aviation relations between the U.S. and South
Africa for the first time since they were broken in protest over
apartheid more than nine years ago.  The agreement is born of
mutual need and will serve our mutual self-interest.  The flow of
trade, investment, and tourism between our two countries has
grown enormously in the last two years.  By recent count, one new
American business per week has set up shop in South Africa. 
American tourism to South Africa has doubled in that same period.

</P>
<P>
This new agreement will meet the existing need for more passenger
and cargo flights between our countries and provides for
increasing scheduled and charter flights to meet the further
growth that is sure to come. 
</P>
<P>
-- We also have agreed during this session to expand our
cooperative efforts to combat crime.  The U.S. will contribute
substantially to South Africa's request for assistance to help
realize the full potential of its law enforcement forces. 
</P>
<P>
Working together, sharing ideas and expertise, I know we can
improve the quality of law enforcement in both countries and can
help each other ensure the safety and security our citizens
deserve. 
</P>
<P>
-- We also signed a Declaration of Intent to help bring South
Africa into the growing community of schoolchildren, teachers,
and scientists around the world that participate in a program
which we call &quot;GLOBE&quot;; or &quot;Global Learning and
Observation to Benefit the Environment.&quot;  This is a hands-on
science and education program we formed at the beginning of the
Administration that links students, educators, and scientists
around the world through the Internet to study our environment,
and share data about our planet with scientists and each other. 
</P>
<P>
Already, some 37 nations and tens of thousands of students
participate in this important effort.  I am glad that South
Africa soon will become a GLOBE partner as well. 
</P>
<P>
-- We also pledged today to proceed with a partnership to create
a Fulbright Commission which will improve and expand the ways in
which Americans and South Africans study and conduct research
together. 
</P>
<P>
-- We are working with our partners in South Africa to build
energy-efficient housing, and to promote the use of renewable and
clean fuels, both by industry and in homes. 
</P>
<P>
-- Our Peace Corps also will soon provide talented young
Americans with the chance to work with South Africans where they
live to help improve education and foster good-will. 
</P>
<P>
Through these, and many other initiatives of our Binational
Commission, the U.S. and South Africa are building a matrix of
mutually beneficial connections, programs, exchanges, and
business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those, like the civil aviation agreement, are bearing
fruit today.  Others, like the Mandela Scholars program and the
Fulbright Commission, will pay dividends in the future.  But
these are all part of the same critical effort -- to establish a
healthy give-and-take across all aspects of our societies, and to
nurture the possibilities of peace, justice, and prosperity for
all our citizens.  I am deeply proud of our work together.  And
Mr.  Deputy President, may I say that I look forward to our next
meeting in South Africa.

<TITLE>Role of NGOs</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000">
<H2>ROLE OF NGOs IN THE WORK OF THE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE</H2>
<P> Introduction
</P>
<P> At the first meeting of the Agriculture Committee held on
March 26 here in Washington, a joint U.S.-South African position
was put forth to include NGOs and CBOs in the work of the
committee at the working group level.  It was suggested, however,
that they will not have full-fledged membership on the committee.
 This first Committee meeting was focused heavily on resolving
several organization and membership issues as outlined in its
draft Terms of Reference that will impact the final outcome of
involvement by any non-public sector organizations in the work of
the committee.  It is our position that a final report should
reflect the views of the full membership of the committee which
is a work in progress.  It is our goal to have a final report on
or before the next full commission meeting.
</P>
<P> Background
</P>
<P> USDA's pre-Committee work in South Africa, which began in
the fall of 1994, heavily utilized the experiences of NGOs,
academia, and the private agribusiness sectors in the
implementation and consultation processes of its programs and
projects in South Africa.  Collaboration with U.S. organizations
such as 21st Century Africa, U.S. Wheat Associates, Africare, and
Land O'Lakes, and South African organizations such as Wesgro, the
Rural Foundation, and the Peninsula Technician was important to
projects such as the Cochran Fellowship Program and discussions
of our food aid programs.  Expanding and continuing these
relationships is strongly desired. 
</P>
<P>The issue of the role of NGOs was an agenda item during the
pre-Committee meeting in Pretoria this past December.  However,
it was decided to table discussion on the matter until the first
full meeting of the Committee. 
</P>
<P>Role of NGOs in the Context of the First Agriculture
Committee Meeting 
</P>
<P>Secretary Dan Glickman and Minister Andre van Nickerk
convened the first meeting of the Agriculture Committee this past
March 26 here in Washington.  This meeting was heavily focused on
first order membership and organizational issues that are
important to the Terms of Reference. 
</P>
<P>First order membership issues highlighted both sides'
progress made to date on determining the membership of other USG
departments and agencies and other South African ministries and
departments.  Discussion was had concerning the potential
membership to the committee of both sides' private agribusiness
sectors, Congress/Parliament, academia, and NGOs and CBO's.  It
was put forth that none of these entities be full-fledged members
of the committee.  
</P>
<P> Initial progress was made organizationally by identifying
four broad working groups that, for starters, would serve as the
technical operating mechanisms for integrating, facilitating,
resolving, developing, and planning joint programs and
activities.  These four working groups are: 1) Agricultural
Market Access, 2) Institutional Development, 3) Sustainability of
Agriculture in the Rural Context, and 4) Agricultural Technology
Development for Rural Income Generation.  It was suggested that
NGOs would best serve the committee at this working group level. 
It was determined that further discussion would be needed to
reach a common understanding and working definition of NGOs. 
Several teleconferences will be scheduled between now and the
next commission meeting to address the details of this and other
issues.
</P>
<P> It is the goal of the Co-chairs of the Agriculture Committee
to have a completed Terms of Reference ready for signature by
both the Vice President and Executive Deputy President Mbeki by
the next full commission meeting.  A final report on the role of
NGOs will be forwarded to the OVP on or before that time.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Vice President Gore noted today that the Human Resources
Development and Education (HRDE) Committee of the Binational
Commission met on Monday, July 22, 1996 to discuss progress since
the last meeting in December 1995 and to determine next steps. 
The Committee reported on activities in its three program areas: 
	</P>
<P>
The Joint Working Group on a Fulbright Commission, a committee of
four Americans and four South Africans, met frequently from
February through May 1996 to consider the feasibility of
establishing a U.S.-South Africa Fulbright Commission.  The final
report, which  strongly recommends the establishment of a
commission,  has been received by the HRDE Committee.  The two
governments were favorably impressed with the report and are
considering the establishment of a Fulbright Commission.    	</P>
<P>
The Committee reported on activities of the Youth Development
program which is recognizing and addressing the needs of  the
disadvantaged youth of South Africa.  The potential for
collaboration on youth development issues between the United
States and South Africa holds great promise.  The National Youth
Commission was established in June 1996 in South Africa.  The
national coordinator of youth development activities, Sheila
Sisulu, and several youth commissioners exchanged information
with their American counterparts during a three-week study tour. 
  Next steps include working with the National Youth Commission
to develop a national framework and to implement, monitor and
evaluate development activities.  
</P>
<P>
  	The Post-Graduate Economics Training Program also has seen
progress.   In  December 1995 a Memorandum of Understanding was
signed for the program, which promotes post-graduate studies in
economics by members of the disadvantaged communities across
South Africa.  The first six Mandela Economic Scholars are now
beginning their training program.  Further scholars will
eventually form a cadre of 50 highly trained economists.

Warren Christopher, U.S. Secretary of State, from his remarks at
the World Conference on Human Rights, Vienna, Austria,
1993</b>
<hr>
</center>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p><br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b><i><font size=5>Q.</font></i></b><i>
One of the most important
conferences on human rights in
recent history took place in Vienna in 1993. What was the
significance of what happened there?</i>
<P>
<b><i><font size=5>A.</font></i></b>
In 1993, the World Conference on
Human Rights re-emphasized
that there are no cultural, religious, or other barriers that
should stand in the way of the universal enjoyment of basic human
rights. No one, no matter what country he or she lives in, should
be subjected to torture simply because of the cultural or
religious traditions of that country. No one should be subjected
to arbitrary execution. No one should be subjected to mass rape
as a tool of so-called ethnic cleansing, just because of
religious differences in a country. This is what universality is
all about.
<P>
Probably no situation better illustrates this issue than the
crisis in Bosnia, where the fundamental rights of the person were
massively violated in a setting in which cultural, ethnic, and
religious differences became excuses for human rights violations.
This is why universality is so important.
<P>
Those governments that claim that they can be exempt from basic
principles of human rights because they have different cultures
or different historical traditions simply fly in the face of
basic human experience at the end of the 20th century, when there
is so much global interconnectedness. Obviously, we should
celebrate differences -- different countries, different cultures,
different religions  -- and we should protect those differences.
But those differences can never be an excuse for torturing,
killing, raping, or otherwise fundamentally violating a person's
rights and freedoms, for putting them in prison for long periods
of time without a trial or without finding some guilt in due
process, or for preventing them from speaking or engaging in
basic freedoms of expression.
<P>
The Vienna Declaration made clear by its very language that human
rights are not only universal but are a legitimate subject for
international organizations and institutions. This is why any
effort to prevent the United Nations Human Rights Commission --
which meets annually to review the human rights records of
countries around the world -- from scrutinizing the record of a
country is a violation of the principle of legitimate inquiry
into human rights, which is what the Vienna Declaration is all
about. This is why it was so important in 1995 that the
commission rejected the effort of a large country -- China -- to
block consideration of its human rights record. This is also why
it is so important to build new institutions to improve human
rights in Bosnia or Rwanda or any other place where universal
values have been fundamentally shattered.
<P>
What Vienna did, I think, was show that adherence to human rights
must be more than rhetoric. It involves implementation as well,
whether through international institutions or through domestic
institutions. This is why the Human Rights Commission is so
important; this is why the human rights ombudsman is so important
in Bosnia; this is why the War Crimes Tribunal and many other
institutions that are built to advance human rights protections
are so important for Rwanda and Bosnia. This is the spirit of
Vienna.
<P>
<b><i><font size=5>Q.</font></i></b><i>
In March of 1995, the
United States submitted its first report
on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights for
United Nations scrutiny. What was the significance of this?</i>
<P>
<b><i><font size=5>A.</font></i></b>
This was the first time that the
United States, in an
international setting, publicly issued a report about its own
human rights situation. This was done pursuant to U.S.
ratification of the major covenant implementing the Universal
Declaration -- the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The
United States will be issuing other reports as well, as do other
countries. I think this emphasizes that the standards of the
Universal Declaration are as absolutely applicable within the
United States as they are around the world.
<P>
The United States is very proud of the fact that its own
Constitution and Bill of Rights in some ways provide even greater
protection to civil and political rights than the Universal
Declaration. For example, in the area of freedom of speech, the
United States is widely regarded as having higher standards than
those found throughout the world. This is one thing that was
emphasized in our report to the United Nations. But the United
States also has had its shortcomings. Certainly among these are
the history of its treatment of African-Americans and, in some
cases, of refugees and of other minority groups -- the terrible
legacy of slavery, the terrible legacy of the way in which
American Indians, Native Americans, were treated. These
shortcomings demonstrate how important it is to have a Universal
Declaration. The United States considers itself, as many other
countries do, a work in progress in terms of trying to constantly
improve its adherence to these basic international standards.
<P>
<b><i><font size=5>Q.</font></i></b><i>
You are known to be a
strong advocate of the role of
nongovernmental organizations in advancing human rights and civil
society. What is the importance of this role?</i>
<P>
<b><i><font size=5>A.</font></i></b>
Ultimately, human rights are not
about government. They are
about people. One of the most dramatic developments of the last
50 years has been the popular movement across the globe for the
advancement of democracy and human rights, for participation in
government. The greatest achievement of this movement probably
came when the Cold War ended, freeing hundreds of millions of
people from living under conditions in which there were virtually
no civil and political rights.
<P>
Nongovernmental organizations form the backbone of the protection
of human rights in any society. This is certainly true in
American society, and it is true in other societies as well. That
is why the work we do in support of the massive international
grass-roots movement to protect human rights has even greater
importance than any particular relationship we have with other
governments.
<P>
Nongovernmental organizations can do many practical things. They
can lobby on behalf of people whose rights are being violated.
They can gather information. They can provide technical expertise
in building new institutions of justice and in supporting court
systems working on reconciliation in societies torn apart by
civil war or human rights abuse. Nongovernmental organizations
are absolutely vital to the advancement of human rights the world
over. Their work is hard and sometimes dangerous. We are
constantly saluting and showing support for those human rights
workers around the world who live under dangerous conditions,
many of whom are injured or killed in the process of their work.
<P>
A new element of U.S. human rights policy in the last several
years has been to support, both financially and diplomatically,
nongovernmental organizations that are active in emerging
democracies -- in South Africa, in Russia, in the countries of
Eastern Europe, in parts of Asia. A civil society that protects
human rights and recognizes their importance can come into being
only through the work of countless small organizations that are
dedicated to their own specific work -- whether in the
environment of refugees or the administration of justice or in
political parties. Groups that are working on elections or
organizations that provide assistance to other citizens, that
provide charity -- these are basic elements of civil society.
<P>
Nongovernmental organizations clearly are central players in the
effort to develop a system that allows greater participation by
people in their own governments and, ultimately, in democracy.
That has been a major focus of U.S. foreign policy in recent
years; that is why the State Department's Bureau of Human Rights
has been renamed and expanded to become the Bureau of Democracy,
Human Rights, and Labor.
<P>
<b><i><font size=5>Q.</font></i></b><i>
The State Department has
been issuing its annual Human Rights
Reports since 1977. How has the process evolved since then?</i>
<P>
<b><i><font size=5>A.</font></i></b>
The Human Rights Reports, I think,
reflect the importance of
human rights in American foreign policy. They also reflect the
universality of human rights. All countries are covered, and the
United States now is also issuing reports on itself in response
to treaties it has signed. In 1995, a very important event
occurred when the United States appeared for the first time
before the UN Human Rights Committee  in New York and publicly
discussed its own report on civil and political rights in the
United States.
<P>
The Human Rights Reports are issued for 194 countries -- 195 if
you include the United States. They reflect the central values of
the Universal Declaration [on Human Rights], which also reflects
the basic values of America's Constitution and Bill of Rights.
The reports are issued annually and have been since 1977. They
have grown in number from approximately 50 reports to the present
195. They cover a range of political and civil rights issues, and
they are expanding into other areas, such as the rights of women,
workers' rights, the rights of disabled persons.  I'm sure
additional areas will come into focus in the future.  
<P>
It is obviously an enormous task to objectively pull together the
information that goes into these reports. The information
included is received from U.S. embassies around the world and
from other governments, as well as from nongovernmental
organizations. Each report is a measure of the state of human
rights in any country, and also a way of showing trends in the
progress in human rights around the world.
<P>
The reports can be controversial. Clearly, governments are not
very receptive to reading criticisms or statements about human
rights failures and shortcomings in their own countries. But the
reports are tremendously important to the millions of people
around the world who are struggling to improve their own
situations with regard to human rights and to engage in dialogue
with their own governments. This is true also in the United
States, which is constantly under scrutiny by its citizens in
terms of freedom of speech and freedom of religion. These are
central issues in our election campaigns, and the same should be
true throughout the world.
<P>
<b><i><font size=5>Q.</font></i></b><i>
The United States has a
very complex relationship with the
People's Republic of China. How would you describe U.S. efforts
to induce China to improve its human rights practices?</i>
<P>
<b><i><font size=5>A.</font></i></b>
The United States has made clear
from the very beginning of
its work in the human rights area that all countries, including
our own, should adhere to international standards of human
rights. At the end of the 20th century, this should be the
hallmark of enlightened government around the world. No
government should be exempt from that -- certainly not the United
States, and certainly not the People's Republic of China, if only
because China is the largest country in the world in terms of
population. So we have not hesitated to analyze and report on
human rights abuses in China and to publicly criticize those
abuses. Issues involving significant repression of the freedoms
of speech and religion frequently have been raised by the United
States both in bilateral discussions with Chinese government
officials and in the international setting, in such places as the
United Nations Human Rights Commission, where we regularly
co-sponsor resolutions on the human rights situation in China
critical of the government's handling of freedom of speech,
freedom of religion, and other basic freedoms.
<P>
<b><i><font size=5>Q.</font></i></b><i>
How do such policy
formulations fit in with the other demands
of our foreign policy relationship with China?</i>
<P>
<b><i><font size=5>A.</font></i></b>
Foreign affairs in an open,
democratic society such as our own
is a subject that is publicly debated. There is great interest in
the U.S. Congress, and there are frequent congressional hearings
on subjects such as the human rights situation in China. Our
press and nongovernmental organizations take a great interest in
these subjects as well. This means that the State Department's
report on the human rights situation in China is looked at very
closely for its accuracy. Also, the way in which the United
States raises human rights issues with China makes it very clear
that it will be impossible for the United States to have a
complete and positive relationship without improvements on the
human rights front.  
<P>
The U.S. policy toward China is one of engagement, dialogue,
discussion -- and that includes human rights very centrally.
<P>
<b><i><font size=5>Q.</font></i></b><i>
How do you see the events
in Bosnia and the creation of the
International War Crimes Tribunal in the context of the
historical evolution of human rights?</i>
<P>
<b><i><font size=5>A.</font></i></b>
Clearly, the situation in Bosnia
calls upon all the
imagination of diplomats, military specialists, and economic
specialists. The challenge of rebuilding a fundamentally
shattered society that has, in essence, been destroyed by massive
violations of human rights -- worse than anything seen in Europe
since the end of the Second World War -- is enormous. It is a
challenge of vision and of practical implementation. The vision
must have at its heart rebuilding the understanding that any
society needs to be able to function, the understanding that
there are certain basic values that hold people together. The
integrity of the person, the right not to be tortured or executed
or raped, the right to stay on your own property and in your own
house without being forced out -- these are among the rights that
have been so fundamentally violated in Bosnia by cynical leaders
who have fanned the flames of ethnic and religious
misunderstanding. The value system at the center of the Bosnia
effort is very important; it is the universal value of human
rights.
<P>
I think it is important to emphasize that all countries in the
United Nations Security Council have seen the Bosnian crisis in
the same way -- ultimately, as a catastrophe of the violation of
fundamental human values. China, Russia, the United States, the
European countries, members of the Security Council from other
states -- all have joined together in seeing this as an attack on
fundamental human values and human rights.
<P>
The implementation side of this calls upon the international
community to create new institutions to rebuild the values that
have been shattered, institutions of justice such as the
International War Crimes Tribunal, which was established by the
Security Council three years ago, not only for Bosnia but for
Rwanda, another country that was devastated in much the same way.
The new institutional structures for rebuilding Bosnia will
provide for the rights of refugees to return to their homes, will
create a framework for resolving human rights disputes as the 
[United Nations] Human Rights Commission does, and will set up
the election process mandated by the Dayton Peace Accords that
were signed by all the parties.
<P>
What has been learned so painfully over the past few years is the
need for a strong international commitment to back up this
institution-building and the reinforcement of human rights. That
is what the NATO Implementation Force is all about, with its
60,000 members. Having pulled the warring factions apart and
assured that the zone of separation is protected, that force is
now turning its attention to assisting in the civilian
implementation of human rights protections, as well as other
aspects of the peace accord.  
<P>
We have in Bosnia both a tremendous challenge and a great example
of what can be done when the world community pulls together to
address the shattering of universally held values.
<P>
I think Bosnia is the test of the late 20th century for human
rights. There are other tests as well, but Bosnia is a very
powerful example. Human rights are not just rhetoric, nor are
they just universally held values. The human rights system has to
be implemented on the ground. To overcome the horror of genocide,
it takes new institutions that we have perhaps never had before
-- human rights enforcement mechanisms that are part of a process
of reconciliation and peace. These human rights institutions will
emphasize justice as much as they will reconciliation. It is
difficult to end the spiral of violence that grips a society like
Bosnia when that violence is unleashed by criminal elements who
are claiming leadership. The only way to end the violence is to
bring to justice those responsible for unleashing it, or at least
to begin the process of bringing them to justice -- isolating
them as the International War Crimes Tribunal is doing, turning
them into pariahs within the international community. They cannot
travel anywhere without fear of being arrested, and ultimately
they must be arrested and brought to justice. Otherwise, the
violence is likely to continue.    o

free societies with highly developed infrastructures; 
</P>
<P>
Convinced that the illicit use and trafficking in drugs
constitute a problem which affects the communities of both
countries; 
</P>
<P>
Realizing that money laundering, corruption, and related
international criminal activities undermine democratic societies;

</P>
<P>
Believing that the international nature of most organized
criminal activity necessitates that governments coordinate their
law enforcement efforts; 
</P>
<P>
Alert to the need for worldwide cooperation in combating
international terrorism;

cooperation in combating international crime, including
international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation may include but need not be limited to the
following: 
</P>
<P>
-- assignment of representatives of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration to the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria to coordinate
intelligence, training, and possible joint operations in
combating transnational drug trafficking;

and other transnational crimes, as well as to facilitate the
location, arrest, and extradition of international fugitives
within the FBI's jurisdiction; 
</P>
<P>
-- development by South Africa of a police training program to
enhance professional capabilities in fighting organized crime,
financial crimes, and alien smuggling, which may include
specialized courses offered by U.S. law enforcement training
programs such as ICITAP (International Criminal Investigative
Training Assistance Program); 
</P>
<P>
-- inclusion of South African participants in U.S.-administered
courses for professionals assigned to the fields of Customs and
Immigration, narcotics interdiction, VIP protection, and
financial crimes; 
</P>
<P>
-- promotion of exchange visits by teams of law enforcement
officials ranging from working-level police to public defenders,
prosecutors, and judges, up to officials at the ministerial
level; and 
</P>
<P>
-- pursuit of other exchanges of information, training programs,
and international cooperation as may be mutually desirable. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and South Africa are convinced that their
mutual cooperation in fighting the scourges of organized crime,
drug trafficking, and international terrorism can result in a
tangible benefit to their mutual societies, the surrounding
regions, and the world.

United States-South Africa Binational Commission 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-SOUTH AFRICA ENERGY PROJECTS EXPAND ACCESS TO POWER AND
INCREASE USE OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES IN SOUTH AFRICA   	</P>
<P>
New energy  policies and programs resulting from U.S.-South
African cooperation promise to make electricity more widely
available to South Africa's citizens and increase the use of
sustainable energy technologies.  The Sustainable Energy
Committee of the U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission will
report achievements in these areas at the commission meetings
headed by Vice President Al Gore and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
next week.  The energy committee, co-chaired by Secretary of
Energy Hazel R. O'Leary and Minister of Mineral and Energy
Affairs Penuell M. Maduna, met today in Washington, D.C., to
finalize its progress report and discuss new initiatives that
will further increase the economic and environmental benefits to
South Africans.  
</P>
<P>
	Through joint efforts on the Sustainable Energy Committee, the
United States and South Africa have: 
</P>
<P>
o	Drafted electricity legislation for consideration by South
Africa's Parliament, which would ensure the legal and financial
infrastructure needed to distribute the benefits of electricity
equitably among the nation's citizens . o	Built a modular,
energy-efficient house in South Africa with financial support
from the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has
resulted in orders to build a community of 200 such homes and
plans for another 2,000.  o	Established a board of directors,
business plan, and financial incentives program for Renewable
Energy for South Africa (REFSA), a joint organization that
promotes the use of renewable technologies in off-grid
applications. o	Agreed to a natural gas action plan which will
include legislation creating a gas market in South Africa   o	Met
numerous other commitments made during Secretary O'Leary's trade
mission to South Africa in August 1995 and the Binational
Commission meeting in South Africa in December 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	&quot;Already our collaborations are starting to deliver real
benefits to real people in the form of electric power, energy
policies and laws, and energy-efficient, affordable housing,&quot;
said O'Leary.  &quot;We applaud and continue to support the
progress made so far in the energy sector under South Africa's
redevelopment plans.  While we have made a good start, however,
we cannot stop here.  What we have yet to do is to attract the
private investment that will make even more of South Africa's
energy goals a reality and ensure the economic incentives that
will make them self- sustaining.&quot;  	</P>
<P>
DOE sent a two-person team to South Africa's workshop this spring
to help draft electricity legislation that encourages economic
growth and the equitable distribution of electricity.  That team
will continue to provide expert advice throughout the regulatory
restructuring process.  DOE experts will assist in designing and
will participate in a South African  Workshop in October to
create a legislative framework for the initiation of a gas market
in South Africa.  DOE is also supporting the drafting of South
Africa's energy policy and an options paper on energy  strategy. 
	</P>
<P>
Improving access to convenient and affordable sources of energy
is one of South Africa's primary goals for the energy sector. 
The Sustainable Energy Committee is partially addressing this
goal  through Renewable Energy for South Africa, which is
developing a pilot program to install 2,500 photovoltaic systems
in rural areas that do not have access to the electricity grid. 
The solar power systems, half funded by the U.S. Agency for
International Development, will help supply power  for lighting,
television/radio, and productive uses to the estimated 2.5
million homes and 100,000 small businesses currently without it. 
  	</P>
<P>
Another avenue for increasing and conserving energy supplies is
an integrated housing project to develop, design and build an
urban housing pilot project featuring energy-efficient designs. 
A model home in Kimberley already built and exhibited by a
partnership of U.S. and South African companies showed enough
promise to result in industry orders to build 200 such houses.  A
long-term commitment by the private sector to build 2,000 more
houses is anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Another joint project that promises to deliver real benefits to
people is a series of workshops for South African industry and
community leaders to explore the benefits of investing in
low-smoke fuels for home heating and cooling.  The meetings and
tours of U.S. facilities, organized by DOE's Pittsburgh Energy
Technology Center, demonstrated the use of coal waste
reclamation, coal briquetting, and biomass and wood combustion
technologies that can provide cleaner, more efficient home energy
supplies than traditional sources.  	  </P>
<P>
	In the transportation sector, the Sustainable Energy Committee
has developed an action plan to study South Africa's
transportation needs and to form a partnership between U.S. and
South African industries to research and develop electric
vehicles and other clean, energy-efficient transportation fuels.

</P>
<P>
	Businesses and communities should find it easier to gain easy
access to statistics and information on energy use and energy
technologies through an energy database project supported by
DOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA).  Under this
effort, the South Africans are exploring the feasibility of
starting a computerized information system modeled after EIA's
service, which provides extensive information to the U.S.
government and general public on domestic and international
energy supply, demand, prices, and use.  	</P>
<P>
In addition to these projects, numerous other U.S.-South African
collaborations in the energy sector,  including  a coal bed
methane study, a power pooling effort, and provincial
initiatives, will be addressed in the Sustainable Energy
Committee's progress report.  Copies of the report will be
available  after the July 23 Binational Commission meeting from
Andrea Lockwood in DOE's Office of Policy and International
Affairs at 202-586-6082.     ###

<p>
<i><b><font size=7>A</b></I></font><i><font size=3>mericans
consider human
rights to be a
defining feature of
their national heritage. And in the almost 300 years since the
country was first settled, significant strides have been made
toward ensuring that all Americans -- and people the world over
-- enjoy those rights that are theirs as human beings. At times,
movement forward has been painfully slow. Nevertheless, the
commitment of the United States, as a nation, to universal human
rights has remained firm.</font></I>
<p>
<br>
<p>
<font size=2><b>1607</b> - Captain John Smith and 105 cavaliers
in
three ships
disembark on the Virginia coast at Jamestown on May 14 and
establish the first permanent English settlement in the "New
World."
<p>
<b>1619</b> - The first African laborers -- indentured servants
-- in
the English North American colonies arrive at Jamestown in
August, although slavery is not legally recognized until 30 years
later.
<p>
<b>1620</b> - Puritan separatists from the Church of England
arrive at
Plymouth Harbor on the Massachusetts coast on November 19. While
on board the ship <i>Mayflower</i>, they draw up the "Mayflower
Compact," America's first constitution, by which they agree to
"combine ourselves together into a civil Body Politick...for the
General good of the Colony...."
<p>
<b>1621</b> - Puritans of Plymouth Colony joined with native
Wampanoag
Indians in a Thanksgiving ceremony to celebrate a good harvest
and peace. But cordial relations do not last, and warfare between
European settlers and Native Americans soon becomes common. This
is the case throughout the American colonies, as settlers attempt
to claim greater amounts of Indian land.
<p>
<b>1634</b> - Maryland is founded as a Catholic colony with
religious
tolerance.
<p>
<b>1735</b> - A New York court recognizes freedom of the press
and due
process of law by acquitting John Peter Zenger, editor of
<i>Weekly
Journal</i>. Zenger had been charged with libeling the British
governor by criticizing his conduct in office. Alexander
Hamilton, who defended Zenger, argued successfully that the
charges printed by Zenger were true, and thus not libelous.
<p>
<b>1761</b> - Boston attorney James Otis, maintaining that "a
man's
house is his castle," opposes as unconstitutional the issuance by
the superior court of writs of assistance -- general search
warrants to aid in enforcement of the Sugar Act of 1733. Although
Otis loses the case, his argument anticipates ideas later set
forth in the U.S. Declaration of Independence regarding the
rights to life, liberty, and property.
<p>
<b>1776</b> - On June 7, at the Second Continental Congress of
delegates
from the American colonies, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia moves
that "these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and
independent states." The resolution is adopted July 2; the
Declaration of Independence (of the American colonies from
Britain) is approved by the Congress on July 4.
<p>
<b>1783</b> - The Massachusetts Supreme Court outlaws slavery in
that
state, citing from the state's bill of rights that "all men are
born free and equal."
<p>
<b>1787</b> - The Constitutional Convention opens at Philadelphia
on May
25. The Constitution of the United States is adopted by the
delegates on September 17 and declared in effect on June 21,
1788, after nine states have ratified it.
<ul><br>
     - On July 13, the Continental Congress adopts the
Northwest Ordinance, which guarantees freedom of religion and
support for schools, and prohibits slavery, in America's
"Northwest Territories."</ul>
<p>
<b>1791</b> - The Bill of Rights, 10 amendments to the
Constitution
intended to clarify individual and states' rights not
specifically mentioned in that document, goes into effect
December 15.
<p>
<b>1807</b> - The U.S. Congress outlaws the importation of
African
slaves into the United States. Nevertheless, some 250,000 slaves
are illegally imported between 1808 and 1860.
<p>
<b>1830</b> - To free land for settlement, Congress passes the
Indian
Removal Act, which allows the government to move eastern Native
American tribes to thinly settled land west of the Mississippi
River. Within 10 years, the U.S. government attempts to relocate
more than 70,000 Native Americans, many of whom die on the
arduous journey westward.
<p>
<b>1848</b> - Some 200 women and 40 men meet in Seneca Falls, New
York,
to draft a "bill of rights" outlining the social, civil, and
religious rights of women.
<p>
<b>1857</b> - A decision by the U.S. Supreme Court on March 6 --
known
because of the claimant's name as the "Dred Scott" decision --
holds that a slave does not become free when taken into a free
state, that Congress cannot bar slavery from a territory, and
that blacks cannot be citizens.
<p>
<b>1861</b> - The Civil War, America's bloody battle to preserve
the
Union, begins on April 12. Before the war ends in 1865, half a
million American lives are lost and 11 "rebellious" southern
states have seceded from the United States.
<p>
<b>1863</b> - On January 1, President Abraham Lincoln issues the
Emancipation Proclamation, declaring that "all persons held as
slaves within any State, or designated part of a State, the
people whereof shall be in rebellion against the United States"
are "forever free."
<p>
<b>1865</b> - The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution,  
abolishing
slavery in the United States, takes effect on December 18.
<p>
<b>1866</b> - The Ku Klux Klan, an organization of white men, is

disbanded between 1869 and 1871, a second Klan is later
organized.
<p>
<b>1868</b> - The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution is 
ratified
on July 28.  The amendment prohibits abridgment of citizenship
rights and reaffirms the principles of due process and equal
protection of the law for persons born or naturalized in the
United States and subject to the laws thereof.
<p>
<b>1869</b> - Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony
establish the
National Woman Suffrage Association, beginning a 50-year campaign
to gain for women the right to vote.
<p>
<b>1870</b> - The Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which
states
that "the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall
not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on
account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude," goes
into effect on March 30.
<p>
<b>1887</b> - Congress passes the Dawes (Severalty) Act, breaking
up
Native American tribal lands into small property units 
that are given to individual Indians. Remaining land is sold to
white settlers.
<p>
<b>1896</b> - The U.S. Supreme Court, in <i>Plessy v.
Ferguson</i>,
approves
racial segregation under a doctrine known as "separate but
equal," which holds that blacks are entitled to the same types of
facilities as whites, but that the two groups need not share the
same facilities. This allows some states to legislate segregation
and makes racial discrimination acceptable and protected by law.
<p>
<b>1909</b> - The National Conference on the Negro is convened on
May
30, leading to the founding of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, one of America's most powerful

identifies "Four Freedoms" as essential for all people -- freedom
of speech and religion, freedom from want and fear.
     - President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill on August 14 adopt the Atlantic Charter, in
which they state their hope, among other things, "that all the
men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from
fear and want."
<p>
<b>1942</b> - Following the attack on the United States by Japan
on
December 7, 1941, the U.S. government forcibly moves some 120,000
Japanese-Americans from the western United States to detention
camps; their exclusion lasts three years. Some 40 years later,
the government acknowledges the injustice of its actions with
payments to Japanese-Americans of that era who are still living.
<p>
<b>1945</b> - The United States becomes a charter member of the
United
Nations, a body committed to, among other things, reaffirming
"faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of
the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of
nations large and small."
<p>
<b>1947</b> - The House (of Representatives) Committee on
Un-American
Activities investigates the U.S. motion picture industry to

<p>
<b>1950</b> - U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy launches a vigorous

Senate.
<p>
<b>1952</b> - The last racial and ethnic barriers to
naturalization of
aliens living in the United States are removed in June with the
passage of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952.
 <p>
<b>1954</b> - Racial segregation in public schools is unanimously
ruled
unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court on         May 17 in a

effect, overturns the earlier "separate but equal" decision of
<i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>.
<p> 
<b>1955</b> - On December 1, an African-American woman named Rosa
Parks
refuses to give up her seat to a white man on a bus in

blacks -- this to protect voting rights -- since the
Reconstruction period following the Civil War.
<p>

<p>
<b>1975</b> - The United States, Canada, the Soviet Union, and 32

U.S.-SOUTH AFRICA ENERGY COLLABORATION PRODUCES TRAINING AND NEW
JOBS   	
</P>
<P>
Remarkable progress and agressive plans to encourage economic
growth and equitable distribution of electricity were reported to
Vice President Al Gore and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki by the
Sustainable Energy Committee of the U.S.-South africa Binational
Commission.  The report was presented this week in Pretoria by
committee co-chairs U.S. Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary and
South African Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs R.W. &quot;Pik&quot;
Botha. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited several first-track projects, including policy
and regulatory framework initiatives and projects that advance
rural electrification, energy efficiency and the peaceful uses of
nuclear energy.  The report also detailed ambitious work the
committee is pursuing to build technical and scientific capacity
in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
&quot;We were able to bring together Ambassador Andrew Young,
Chair of the Southern African Enterprise Development Fund, and
Suncorp, a majority-owned firm, resulting in the first
disbursement of $500,000 from the fund.  Since its inception
three months ago, Suncorp has demonstrated that it is a winner -
now breaking even and employing eight previously unemployed South
Africans,&quot; O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
&quot;Our committee has been able to seize the vision of our two
Presidents, and we are pleased that we have moved forward from
establishment of the committee to reporting on real successes
that already are impacting the lives of South Africans and
creating jobs both in South Africa and in the United States,&quot;
O'Leary added.  &quot;I congratulate my colleague, Minister
Botha, who has been instrumental in the start-up of Renewable
Energy For South Africa, beginning the path of electrification to
those in South Africa who live far from the grid.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
Realizing that capital investment is needed to fund
energy-related projects that can meet South Africa Reconstruction
and Development Program goals, the committee has focused its
efforts on building an investment-friendly regulatory framework.

</P>
<P>
In addition to the first investment by the Southern African
Enterprise Development Fund in Suncorp, a photovoltaic
manufacturing company formed in August with support from the U.S.
Department of Energy, the American company Spire and the South
African firm Renaissance, the committee reported progress on an
industrial development project in Gugulethu Township that will
result in 1,000 new jobs.- 2 - 
</P>
<P>
During its mission to South Africa last August, the Clinton
Administration's Delegaiton on Sustainable Energy and Empowerment
joined with the leaders from Gugulethu Township, which has 70
percent unemployment, to create a common vision for an economic
development project.  Those same leaders and project
representatives have met again to review a feasability study, and
all have agreed to work together toward the successful completion
of the joint effort. 
</P>
<P>
Presently, South Africa is developing a national energy policy
and regulatory framework to support its construction and
reconstruction and development program goals.  The U.S. has
played a major role in this by providing policy guidance and
regulatory expertise. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent national energy policy summit, Minister Botha praised
the expertise provided by U.S. government and private sector
experts, and he requested continued U.S. help in drafting energy
legislation to be introduced next year. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will continue to encourage the use of renewable
energy technologies to electrify 10 million rural homes, and it
will seek to develop technical and financial support for rural
electrifaction.  With that in mind, Secretary O'Leary and
Minister Botha dedicated a mobile demonstration unit that will
travel to rural areas to train majority South Africans to market
and maintain photovoltaic products, thereby allowing these
residents to control their energy future.  A $1.1 million
investment from the U.S. Agency for International Development
made this possible. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a discussion of ongoing projects, the committee set an
ambitious schedule for future collaboration, including the
development of a sustainable energy center, the formation of a
$50 million energy efficiency fund for South Africa and peaceful
uses for nuclear energy. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation led by Secretary O'Leary in August identified
capacity building as a key component for integrating the
previously-disenfranchised population into the economic growth
that is the future of South Africa.  Among results to date, 17
U.S. companies are sponsoring 50 South Africans for technical and
business training.  Additional results include 21 South Africans
trained in areas such as manufacturing and renewable energy
installation and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary also traveled to Secunda to observe a new training
curriculum sponsored by U.S.-based Fluor Daniel that is helping
South Africans learn home construction and pipefiting skills. 
While there, the Secretary broke ground for a new facility that
will further support this training.  In Northern Cape Province,
the Secretary showed her support for a project linking
electrification and home building with the promotion of
efficiency and environmental goals through an energy-efficient
model home with a low-smoke heater.  The home, displayed at the
Made in USA conference in South Africa in October, will be
permanently sited in Kimberley. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that provincial governments will play a key role in
achieving electrification and economic development goals. 
O'Leary also traveled to Free State Province following adjornment
of the commission meeting.  There she met with Premier Lekota and
other leaders to examine energy, environmental and economic
empowerment issues and areas for collaboration.

JOHANNESBURG</a></B></center><br>
12/4 Gore arrival statement 
<hr> 
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- Vice President Al Gore arrived
December 4 in
Johannesburg to attend the first full meeting of the U.S. South
Africa Binational Commission.
<P>
Following is the text of Gore's arrival statement, as delivered:
<P>
(BEGIN TEXT)
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to thank you all for waiting out
here so late.  Tipper and I are
delighted to be back in South Africa.  I want to say how pleased
we are to return and to
continue the important work of the U.S.-South Africa Binational
Commission.
<P>
Our two nations and our two peoples, of course, have a great deal
in common.  Three decades
ago, when the great U.S. leader Robert Kennedy came to South
Africa, he described the
common threads that bind our past and, ultimately, will shape our
future.  Now on the cusp of
a new century, and some thirty years after Robert Kennedy's
visit, our nations share far more
than a common history, we share at long last common aspirations
for our futures.
<P>
We are sister nations, united by the vision of non-racial
democracy and human rights.  Of
healing and hope.  Of renewal and redemption.
<P>
We in the United States feel that we have a great deal to learn
from the New South Africa
and that is why I very much look forward to the next two days as
Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki and I work together through our Binational Commission to
map out the themes and the
means through which our relationship will grow and flourish well
into the next century.
<P>
The U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission is a pioneering
effort to forge a new
partnership in the areas of greatest mutual interest and benefit
to both peoples:  Education,
Energy, the Environment, Science and Technology, and Business. 
And, to repeat, this is a
partnership, a two-way street.  While Americans have much to
offer South Africans, clearly,
South Africa also has much to offer us.  And so we are hear to
learn from you, to share with
you and to build with you a relationship rich in meaning and
benefit to both our peoples.
<P>
I am told there is a wonderful African concept, which I wish to
invoke here, because I
believe it describes my hopes for our future together.  That
concept is "ubuntu," the notion of
community in its fullest sense.  Ubuntu is what we seek with
South Africa, and I am certain
we will find it during our meetings these next few days.
<P>
Thank you very much and thank you again for coming out this
evening.

GORE INVOKES PRINCIPLE OF UBUNTU UPON ARRIVAL IN SOUTH AFRICA
(FR) (Vice president signs three major agreements) 
<P>
PRETORIA, South Africa -- Vice President Gore invoked the African
principle of Ubuntu
(community) upon his arrival with Mrs. Tipper Gore at
Johannesburg International Airport
late December 4 for a series of Binational Commission meetings.
<P>
"Ubuntu is what we seek with South Africa and I am certain we
will find it during these next
few days," Gore said.  "This is a partnership, a two-way street."
<P>
Gore met December 5 with his counterpart, South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki, at
one in a series of Binational Commission (BNC) events arranged by
the two vice presidents. 
After weeks of intensive discussions, bilateral agreements have
been reached in six major
areas:  business development; environment; energy; science and
technology; human resource
development and education; and agriculture.
<P>
Within the framework of the BNC, the range of prepared agreements
serves a broad sector of
South African developmental objectives in an effort to secure and
bolster the newly
democratic southern African country.  Only Russia and Egypt enjoy
similar bilateral
agreements with the United States.  The BNC signings mark a new
era in the bilateral
relationship.
<P>
The vice presidents signed three major BNC agreements:  one,
establishing a mechanism of
exchange in science and technology; another, officially launching
a Peace Corps program in
South Africa; and a third, recognizing a wide area of bilateral
programs funded by the U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID) in Pretoria.
<P>
Gore's visit was preceded by a number of other more specific
agreements, such as a solar
energy development project; a scholars program to bring South
African government officials
to the United States to study economics; and the establishment of
a working group to explore
the feasibility of creating a Fulbright Commission in South
Africa, which would be
sub-Saharan Africa's first.
<P>
A significant cohort of Washington leaders accompanies the vice
president on his historic
mission to the "new South Africa," to assist in the last-minute
negotiations and signing.  The
group includes Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary, Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, Peace Corps Director Mark Gearan, USAID
Deputy Director Carol
Lancaster, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology
John Gibbons, and Deputy
Under Secretary of Agriculture Dallas Smith.  Ambassador Andrew
Young led a business
delegation on the trip.
<P>
The vice president is joined as well by George Moose, assistant
secretary of state for African
affairs; Susan Rice, adviser to the president for African affairs
in the National Security
Council; and Leon Firth, adviser to the vice president on
national security affairs.
<P>
Gore attended a working session December 5 to outline the six
areas of future exchange and
assistance, and was the guest of honor at a lunch given by Deputy
President Mbeki for the
ranking members of the six subcommittees.
<P>
After the signing ceremony at the South African Presidential
Guest House, Gore  hosted a
reception at the residence of Princeton Lyman, the U.S.
ambassador to South Africa.
<P>
On December 6 Gore will visit a site for the training of
construction workers, near Soweto,
which is funded by USAID.  He also will make an official visit to
Gaborone, Botswana,
before stopping for an afternoon in Cape Town en route home.

<a name="plenary">GORE PRAISES SOUTH AFRICA'S LEADERSHIP ON
NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION</a>
(FR) (Text:  Gore remarks to Binational Commission) 
<P>
PRETORIA, South Africa -- Vice President Al Gore said December 5
that South Africa's
"leadership on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation provides a
model for the rest of the
world."
<P>
In remarks December 5 to the U.S.-South Africa Binational
Commission in Pretoria, Gore
added that South Africa's "work on conflict resolution offers
practical experience of vital
importance to many nations on this planet.  South Africa's vision
of and work toward a
non-racial society offers the people of the Earth remarkable
inspiration and hope for the
future."
<P>
Following is the text of the vice president's remarks:
<P>
(BEGIN TEXT)
<P>
On behalf of all the American members of Binational Commission,
let me say how delighted
we are to be here this morning.  South Africa and the United
States are truly sister nations,
tempered by similar histories of racial intolerance and religion.

We are now bound by
common vision of a future of democracy, social justice and
prosperity for all of our people.
<P>
Our two nations and our two peoples have a great deal in common. 
On the cusp of a new
century, our nations share far more than a common history, we now
share common
aspirations for a shared future.  We are united by the vision of
non-racial democracy and
human rights, of healing and hope, renewal and redemption.
<P>
We in the United States feel that we have a great deal to learn
from the New South Africa. 
That is one reason why I very much look forward to the next two
days as we all work
together through our Binational Commission and map out the themes
and the means through
which our relationship will grow and flourish.
<P>
Our task, therefore, is to work together to develop the
institutional ties that will take our
relationship to the next level.  In order to do so, we might draw
upon the traditional wisdom
of the South African people, and your concept of "masakhane."
<P>
Our reason for being here, and what drives the work today, is to
continue building together, a
broad, deep and balanced U.S.-South African partnership.  The
U.S.-South Africa Binational
Commission is a pioneering effort towards a new partnership in
the areas of greatest mutual
interest and benefit to both peoples:  education, energy, the
environment, science and
technology and trade and investment.  To repeat, this is a
partnership, a two-way street. 
While Americans believe that we have much to offer South Africa,
we also know that South
Africa has much to offer us.
<P>
Clearly South Africa has a tremendous amount to offer the United
States and the entire world. 
Your leadership on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation
provides a model for the rest of the
world.  Your work on conflict resolution offers practical
experience of vital importance to
many nations on this planet.
<P>
South Africa's vision of and work toward a non-racial society
offers the people of the Earth
remarkable inspiration and hope for the future.
<P>
So we are here to learn from you, to share with you and to build
with you a relationship rich
in meaning and benefit to both our peoples.  In this spirit let
us recommit ourselves today to
constructing a true and lasting partnership -- a partnership
which stands before the world, as a
shining example of the ideals and visions uniting our two great
nations.
<P>
There is a wonderful African concept that I was told of which I'm
given to believe describes
the one way of expressing our goals for our future together:  the
concept of "ubuntu," the
notion of community in its fullest sense.  That is what we seek
with South Africa.  In order
to achieve it we must match the expressions of hope and the
shared aspirations which we
celebrate in our partnership with the practical hard work of
completing the details of a
partnership that can be productive in a series of different
areas.
<P>
If we are diligent and if we work together to forge the
partnership in a most productive way,
I am certain now that we will succeed.  On behalf of my
colleagues that have travelled here
from the United States I want to say again how grateful we are
for your hospitality and how
hopeful we are about the work that begins this morning.

<a name="jointpc">GORE, MBEKI HOLD JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE</a>
(FR) (Transcript:  12/5 discussion of bilateral issues) 
<P>
PRETORIA -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore and South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki
held a joint news conference December 5, touching on a range of
issues of bilateral interest --
from Nigeria to Iran to the need for binational commissions.
<P>
Gore was in South Africa to attend the first full meeting of the
U.S.-South Africa Binational
Commission.
<P>
Following is transcript of that joint news conference:
<P>
(BEGIN TRANSCRIPT)
<P>
Q:  Did you discuss issues of bilateral difference, including
Armscor, Cuba and Iran?
<P>
MBEKI:  We did not discuss Cuba.  We are in a discussion about
the Armscor case.  Those
discussions are continuing between the lawyers on both sides.  We
still proceed on both sides
on the basis that it is necessary to find a solution to this
problem, so those discussions are
continuing and negotiations are taking place in the United
States.  We did not discuss the
question of Iran, except in the instance that the vice president
indicated the general
framework of the United States' policy towards Iran.  This was to
indicate to us what the
positions of the United States government are with regard to this
question.
<P>
GORE:  I would just add briefly that the Armscor case is an issue
on which our two
governments have been working in an effort to find a satisfactory
solution.  It's an important
and complex issue in that it involves matters of both law and
policy.  We are hopeful that we
will be able to reach a mutually acceptable settlement of the
issue soon.  We did discuss Iran,
as the deputy president mentioned, and I also discussed Iran with
President Mandela.
<P>
Q:  Don't you also disagree over policy toward Nigeria?
<P>
GORE:  To the contrary, I do not see any significant difference
between the United States
and South Africa where our policies toward Nigeria are concerned.

Indeed, our two countries
are working hand in hand as the two co-sponsors of the resolution
now pending in the United
Nations to condemn the recent execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and
other members of the
Ogonis -- and the lack of due process and representation and
self-government in Nigeria.  We
are agreed that an effective response must be multilateral in
order to work.  And we have
agreed to work together in search of the best and most effective
way to follow what President
Mandela has described as a two-track approach by putting pressure
on Nigeria in response to
its unacceptable activities, while at the same time searching for
ways to engage Nigeria in a
dialogue that might pull them back onto a proper path of
democracy and development.  Any
approach, in order to work, must be multilateral, and we are
considering a variety of options. 
We do believe that any option that is effective must be
multilateral, and I don't think that
there is disagreement on that score between our two countries.
<P>
Q:  (inaudible)
<P>
MBEKI:  The vice president explained to us U.S. government policy
towards Iran.  This was
not with a view to discussing this matter that we will reach a
common position.  We must, of
course, report the discussion that we had with the vice president
which he was saying he had
with the president, we must report it to the rest of the
government.  I think any discussion
that will take place within the S.A. government would only take
place at that point.  You
know the actual situation on those relations between South Africa
and Iran.  As I say, we
must take forward to the rest of the government the positions
which the vice president
explained.
<P>
Q:  Isn't there a policy inconsistency in that the United States
wants South Africa to practice
an oil boycott against Iran, a position which South Africa
rejects?  Yet, now South Africa is
asking the United States to boycott Nigerian oil?
<P>
MBEKI:  The U.S. recognizes the fact that, for the bulk of our
crude oil, they know that it
comes from Iran.  It's an old relationship, and as I was saying,
what would happen in terms
of any policy discussion would have to be on the basis of a
report that we still have to give
to the government.  Consistencies or inconsistencies in the
policies of the U.S. government,
that I can't answer for.
<P>
GORE:  Our policy is consistent, in both cases we believe that
the behavior of the
governments in question is unacceptable.  In the case of Iran,
that government has gone far
beyond a disregard for the rights of its own citizens, and the
violation of commonly accepted
principles of due process and human rights and has added the sin
of state-sponsored terrorism. 
There can be no doubt that this activity continues and is
unacceptable in the world
community, and therefore quite strong measures are warranted. 
The experience with respect
to Iran's oil certainly is consistent with our stated view that,
in order to be effective, an
embargo has to be multilateral and other sanctions have to be
multilateral.  And so we are
joining with South Africa in seeking condemnation of these
unacceptable activities in Nigeria
and working with Nigeria to add to that U.N. resolution a
possible coordinated policy with
other nations that will put economic and other pressure on
Nigeria.  At the same time, we feel
an obligation to present to our friends in the world the
unassailable evidence that documents
the sponsoring of terrorism by Iran, an activity, again let me
say, that is unacceptable in the
civilized world.
<P>
Q:  Mr. Vice President, how would you comment on the fact that
three countries, South
Africa, the United States and Russia, have established binational
commissions between each
other?  Is this, in fact, a strategic alliance for a new world?
<P>
GORE:  Let me explain why the United States of America has felt
that it is important to
establish a Binational Commission with South Africa and with
Russia.  What, you might ask,
what do these two nations have in common in our eyes?  Both are
great nations, but beyond
that we feel that the transition under way in Russia, from
communism to a free-market
democracy, is a transition vitally important to the future of
Eurasia and the entire world.  If
Russia can successfully complete that transition the future of
the entire world will look a lot
brighter.  Democracies and free markets everywhere will be
stronger.  Similarly, just as the
world used to face a threat from communism and the Cold War, the
world faced and still
faces a threat from ethnic violence and hatred from Bosnia to
Rwanda to Cambodia, in places
all around the world.  And the entire world has been inspired by
the process of reconciliation
and renewal here in the new South Africa.  Just recently, shortly
before President Clinton's
trip to Northern Ireland and Ireland, Deputy President Mbeki's
colleague in the Government
of National Unity, Second Deputy President de Klerk, was able to
describe to the Irish people
what reconciliation is all about, based on the S.A. experience. 
This is inspiring to peoples
who are attempting to transcend long-standing conflicts.  In the
world of the future, if peoples
all across our planet are able to point to South Africa and say
to those who counsel violence,
'No, that's the wrong way -- just look at the alternative that
has been pioneered successfully
by the new South Africa'; with that kind of inspiration, the
world has a much better chance to
build a bright future.  We in the United States of America want
to be a good partner to South
Africa and a strong friend to all the peoples of South Africa in
doing everything we can to
learn from their experience and to be a part of their successful
transition, just as we do in
Russia.
<P>
MBEKI:  Let me just add to that, that of course you are aware
that the United States, the
people of the United States in particular, played a very
important role in the struggle for
liberation here.  Even as the process of change was taking place
in this country, there was a
general sentiment around the United States that millions of
people that were engaged with us
to end the system of apartheid wanted to continue that
cooperation.  They wanted to see this
victory that they fought for produce the kind of society which
you all want.  So I think it was
quite natural for the United States government, reflecting that
opinion within the United
States, to say let's seek to engage each other in the manner that
we are engaging each other. 
I don't think it's got anything to do with strategic alliances
which seek to dominate the world
or do something like that.  It arises out of a common concern, as
the vice president has just
said, to see in what ways we can continue that cooperation to the
mutual benefit of both
countries.
<P>
GORE AND MBEKI:  Thank you very much.

<a name="ubttp">GORE:  SOUTH AFRICA HAS CHANCE TO BE 'BEACON OF
HOPE'</a>
(FR) (Text:  12/6 Gore excerpts at training center) (700)
<P>
JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa has an opportunity to become a
"beacon of hope" to
people around the world, Vice President Al Gore told a South
African audience December 6.
<P>
In remarks at the Union Building Trades Training Program, Gore
said such a beacon is
important, "especially in countries where people of different
ethnic backgrounds are tempted
to blame their problems on each other, whether it's in Bosnia or
Rwanda or Chechnya or
Cambodia."
<P>
Gore added that "every day that the new South Africa continues
moving forward and building
its future is a day when the rest of the world has more hope; a
day when people all over this
planet have more reasons to remain determined to build a bright
future."
<P>
Gore was in South Africa to attend the first full meeting of the
U.S.-South African Binational
Commission.
<P>
Following are excerpts of Gore's statement:
<P>
(BEGIN EXCERPTS)
<P>
Thank you very much.  I'd like to begin by saying how impressed I
am with the training
that's going on here and with the approach that's being taken....
<P>
Let me say what's on my heart here.  Nelson Mandela has brought
new hope to South Africa. 
He has also brought a program of building, reconstruction and
development.  In order for that
program to work the people have to have the skills to get the
jobs rebuilding South Africa. 
You talked about people living in shacks; on the way here I saw
with my own eyes what
visitors to this country always see when they venture outside of
the bright, shining cities.  I
saw people living in desperate conditions.  There's a housing
crisis in South Africa, as
everyone knows.  And, as new businesses are springing up, they
too must be built with brick
and mortar and the people who build these houses and businesses
need the skills to do the
job.
<P>
The labor movement in South Africa is surmounting divisions of
the past and joining in
partnership to create this training center.  My country, the
United States of America, is very
proud to be a partner with South Africa in your effort to build a
bright future.  USAID, the
AFL-CIO, the bricklayers' union, which is a very big part of this
exercise, and others, are all
forming a partnership in investing hope in the future of South
Africa.  Your skills will be the
key ingredient to making the dream that you have a reality.
<P>
The United States, and the people of the United States, have
invested a great deal of hope in
South Africa also.  We know something about hope in the world
because the United States of
America is very proud that, for quite a long time, people in
other parts of the world who have
desired freedom have sometimes taken a measure of hope from the
success of the United
States, where people are free.  And now South Africa has an
opportunity to also become a
beacon of hope to people around the world, especially in
countries where people of different
ethnic backgrounds are tempted to blame their problems on each
other, whether it's in Bosnia
or Rwanda or Chechnya or Cambodia.
<P>
Every day that the new South Africa continues moving forward and
building its future is a
day when the rest of the world has more hope; a day when people
all over this planet have
more reasons to remain determined to build a bright future.  So
we want to be a partner to
you in that exercise.  That's why this project is important to
us.  That's why, along with
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki yesterday, I signed a number of
agreements that will make
possible other partnerships like this one.  Why, for example, we
signed a major Peace Corps
agreement that will bring large numbers of Peace Corps volunteers
into South Africa from the
United States.  We're anxious to see you succeed.  Just as you
are putting the bricks one on
top of another, we want to put our partnerships and projects one
on top of another to build
the houses in your future.
<P>
Thank you very much.

<a name="gorepc">GORE ANNOUNCES SIXTH COMPONENT OF BINATIONAL
COMMISSION</a>
(FR) (Text:  12/5 Gore press conf. statement) (1150)
<P>
PRETORIA -- A sixth "crucial" committee on agriculture has been
added to the U.S.-South
Africa Binational Commission, Vice President Al Gore announced
December 5.
<P>
Appearing at a joint press conference with South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki,
Gore paid special tribute to the commission, which seeks to
foster and enhance the bilateral
relationship in five other critical areas:
human resources development and education; energy; conservation
and environment; science
and technology; and business development.
<P>
"I am very proud of the work that we have done here today," the
vice president told his
audience in Pretoria, where he attended the first full meeting of
the commission in South
Africa.
<P>
"We have listened and we have learned.  In a very real way this
Binational Commission pays
homage to the concepts of 'ubuntu,' for the special sense of
community which links South
Africa and the United States, 'masakhane' for our resolve to
build together and 'khotla' for our
determination to work through the problems that we may
encounter," he stressed.
<P>
Following is Vice President Gore's opening statement at the press
conference:
<P>
(BEGIN GORE TEXT)
<P>
Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy President, ladies and gentlemen,
members of the Cabinets
of both countries, distinguished officials.  My wife Tipper and I
are very pleased to be back
here in South Africa and today, because of Deputy President Mbeki
and his colleagues on the
South African side, and the work of the Commission, today has
been a wonderful moment of
hope and progress for the people of South Africa and the United
States.
<P>
We have worked hard today and a remarkable volume of work has
been accomplished since
my friend Deputy President Mbeki and I first discussed the
U.S.-South Africa Binational
Commission in Washington just last March.  We have engaged the
talents of our very best
people in both countries to work together in five critical areas
of our relationship:  human
resources development and education; energy; conservation and
environment; science and
technology; and business development.
<P>
Today I am pleased to join Deputy President Mbeki in announcing
that we have added a sixth
crucial component to that list:  an agriculture committee.  The
Deputy President and I have
charged each of these six committees, which are led by Cabinet
secretaries, ministers and
specialists of equivalent stature, to develop practical, concrete
programs through which both
of our peoples will benefit.  After today, we can safely say that
the work is well under way. 
We have learned here today that both countries have enormous
pools of talent, expertise and
experience to share with one another.  This is a two-way
relationship in which both sides
stand to learn and to gain.
<P>
Let me cite a few of the many examples.  First of all, Ron Brown
led another successful
meeting of the U.S.-South Africa Business Development Committee. 
Under the auspices of
the BDC, a joint statement on tourism was signed to foster
bilateral cooperation in this
important area.  The government-to-government portion of the
bilateral business relationship,
the Trade and Investment Committee, agreed on a joint communique
to advance the bilateral
commercial agenda.
<P>
The Energy Development Committee, under the leadership on our
side of Secretary Hazel
O'Leary, signed a memorandum of understanding on the reduction of
greenhouse gases and
emissions, and an energy implementing agreement under the
Environment, Science and
Technology agreement which the Deputy President and I signed. 
The committee has made
tremendous progress in the three months since Secretary O'Leary
last visited.
<P>
The Science and Technology Committee co-chaired on the U.S. side
by Dr. Jack Gibbons
signed a cooperative program on Agricultural Science and
Technology.  One of the
committee's pilot projects has to do with science education and,
for example, provides a
communications link to South African schoolchildren with an
African-American astronaut,
Winston Scott.
<P>
The Human Resources Development and Education Committee,
co-chaired on our side by
Brian Atwood, represented today by Carol Lancaster, concluded
several cooperative
agreements, including the establishment of a Fulbright Commission
[and] a memorandum of
understanding to support fifty South Africans on the Nelson
Mandela Economic Scholarships
to conduct graduate study in economics in the United States.
<P>
The Conservation, Environment and Water Committee has initiated a
variety of exchanges as
well as joint research and management programs in
desertification, water conservation,
climate change, environmental management and numerous other
areas.
<P>
These are but a sample of the score of achievements that we are
to realize through this
process.  Besides producing real results in practical terms, this
Binational Commission will
also accelerate the growth and strength of our overall bilateral
relationship.  We are working
together to build together a stable, long-term partnership that
will benefit both countries while
accommodating the remarkable political and economic changes afoot
in the world.
<P>
Already, I am happy to say, America's private sector has become
an active participant in
South Africa's economic development.  As was announced today,
Ford's South Africa plant
will soon begin exporting automobile engines to Europe, while
creating jobs for South
Africans and strengthening both our economies.  South African
Airways' purchase of Boeing
aircraft will ensure its continued ability to offer the most
modern and efficient air service
available anywhere.
<P>
I am very proud of the work that we have done here today.  We
have listened and we have
learned.  In a very real way this Binational Commission pays
homage to the concepts of
"ubuntu," for the special sense of community which links South
Africa and the United States,
"masakhane" for our resolve to build together and "khotla" for
our determination to work
through the problems that we may encounter.
<P>
I was also very pleased to have the opportunity to meet and talk
with President Mandela this
morning.  I've passed on to him President Clinton's best wishes. 
We've had an extensive
discussion of matters of common concern.  I will also have a
meeting with Deputy President
De Klerk immediately after this press conference and tomorrow I
am looking forward to
visiting Lenasia township and Cape Town.  I just wish that I
could spend more time in this
beautiful country, but as the deputy president indicated I will
have to return very quickly for
our discussions on Bosnia in the United States Senate, and our
discussion with the Congress
on the budget.
<P>
I have told the deputy president that South Africa's warm welcome
and gracious hospitality
will be difficult to match, but my colleagues and I are going to
try, and thus have invited our
colleagues on the Binational Commission to meet again in
Washington, again in summer, but
this time our summer.  I'd like to close by thanking you again,
Mr. Deputy President and all
of your colleagues, for the hospitality and friendship and for
the wonderful practical start that
we have made with our Binational Commission.  Thank you very
much.

<a name="tijoint">U.S., SOUTH AFRICA ADVANCE COMMERCIAL
AGENDA</a>
(FR) (Text: 12/5 joint communique) (500)
<P>
PRETORIA -- Vice President Al Gore and South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki on
December 5 approved a joint communique by the U.S.-South Africa
Binational Commission
Trade and Investment Committee, noting that the committee "was
able to significantly
advance" the two nations' commercial agenda.
<P>
The communique underscored "both sides' view that continued
forthright and constructive
government-to-government discussions are the key to resolving
bilateral impediments to the
expansion of the commercial relationship."  U.S. Secretary of
Commerce Ron Brown and
South African Minister of Trade Trevor Manuel chaired the
committee.
<P>
Gore was in South Africa to attend the first full meeting of the
Binational Commission.
<P>
Following is the text of the joint communique:
<P>
(BEGIN TEXT)
<P>
The Trade and Investment Committee of the Binational Commission
was able to significantly
advance the bilateral commercial agenda during its two days of
discussions in Pretoria,
underscoring both sides' view that continued forthright and
constructive government to
government discussions are the key to resolving bilateral
impediments to the expansion of the
commercial relationship.
<P>
The two sides proposed to advance the date for the meeting of the
code share working group
so that the negotiation of the bilateral air services agreement
negotiations can be resumed;
complete the information exchange regarding the bilateral
investment treaty; and expressed a
desire for the final round of the tax treaty negotiations to be
scheduled as rapidly as
practicable.
<P>
The governments of the United States and South Africa recommit to
full and early
implementation of the agreement on trade-related aspects of
intellectual property rights (trips)
and to all other international obligations relating to
intellectual property protection to which
they are signatories, including but not limited to the Paris
Convention for the protection of
industrial property (Paris convention).  In addition, we mutually
agree that the definition of
"special circumstance" will be clarified so as not to be
inconsistent with companies'
compliance with anti-apartheid laws.
<P>
Both sides are encouraged by the ambitious and creative
initiatives launched by the private
sector U.S.-S.A. Business Development Committee (BDC).  The
insights and dynamism of
these 40-some corporate executives testify to the uniqueness of
the U.S.-S.A. relationship.
<P>
The S.A. and U.S. governments are committed to their respective
BDC private sectors'
establishing a Technical Assistance Center in South Africa to
promote linkages between U.S.
and S.A. companies with specific emphasis on South African
companies....  Also, the two
governments committed to the private sectors' exploring the
establishing of a similar center in
the United States dedicated to promoting South African trade and
investment in the United
States.
<P>
The BDC will also undertake a Law in Diversity Program to open up
opportunities in the
commercial law field for historically disadvantaged attorneys in
South Africa.
<P>
Under the auspices of the BDC, a joint statement on tourism was
signed to foster bilateral
cooperation on this sector, which offers significant opportunity
for economic growth and job
creation.

<H2>Partial Inventory of U.S. Government-sponsored Fellowship
and Training Opportunities in Science and Technology Prepared by
the Human Resources Development Working Group of the U.S.-South
Africa Binational Commission Science and Technology Committee
July 11, 1996</H2>
<P>National Science Foundation  (NSF)
</P>
<P>
NSF considers proposals submitted by individuals or groups for
support in most fields of science and engineering.  A major
exception is bioscience research with disease-related goals. 
Technical assistance projects also are not supported.  NSF funds
research and education through grants and contracts to university
and other research institutions in the United States.  Although
the principal investigator on an NSF award must be a US citizen
or permanent resident, foreign scientists may participate in the
grant activities through collaborative arrangements with US
investigators. 
</P>
<P>The international activities of the National Science
Foundation extend throughout the world, from the advanced
technological nations to the developing countries.  With South
Africa during the past two years, NSF has supported collaborative
projects in the fields of biology, environmental sciences, polar
science, earth sciences, physics, engineering, and the social
sciences.  The Division of International Programs (INT) has the
responsibility within NSF for catalyzing international research
partnerships, especially those that involve investigators in the
early stages of their careers.  Several NSF officials have
visited South Africa recently, among them a group from the
Engineering Directorate, which visited major university and
training centers, including some historically disadvantaged
institutions, to discuss areas and opportunities for future
collaboration in engineering.  Areas of specific interest were
manufacturing, environmental technology, materials, and civil
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>Scientists and engineers in South Africa wishing to organize
workshops or enter into cooperative research arrangments with US
investigators should contact their counterparts in the United
States, who may then submit proposals to NSF.  For the most part,
NSF grants for cooperative research with South African scientists
would cover the costs of the travel of the US researchers to
South Africa and their living expenses there.  The costs for the
South African researchers in the United States must be provided
by an organization in that country.  </P>
<P>U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)
</P>
<P> Participant training in the United States is a major
activity in the portfolio of USAID/South Africa in support of the
Mission's Strategic Objectives.  The vast majority of participant
are here for short-term programs -- short courses, workshops, or
study tours.  Of the academic participants, most are trained at
the master's degree level, with a small number of bachelor's and
Ph.D.s.   
</P>
<P>According to information in the Human Capacity Development
Center's database, as of March 1 approximately 417 participants
were in programs in the U.S. during FY 1995.  Of these, about 126
were in various science and technology fields, since as
engineering (chemical, mechanical, civil, petroleum), computer
science, chemistry, botany, plant pathology, entomology,
forestry, psychology, mathematics, and statistics, among others. 
 
</P>
<P>Selection of participants for training is done by the USAID
Mission and its NGO and government partners.  They set the
criteria to insure that all training serves the Mission's
programmatic objectives.

</P>
<P>The International Research Fellowship (IRF) Program  	</P>
<P> This program provides opportunities for developing country
postdoctoral biomedical or behavioral scientists, in the
formative stages of their careers (less than ten years beyond the
doctorate), to extend their research experience to a laboratory
in the United States.  These fellowships help forge relationships
between U.S. and foreign scientists to study health problems of
mutual interest.  Fellowships are awarded for twelve to
twenty-four months, and stipends are dependent upon experience.  

</P>
<P>Applicants must have a U.S. sponsor and submit a proposal to
the chairman of the Nominating Committee, the President of the
South Africa Medical Research Council.  Up to six nominees may be
submitted to the FIC by each Nominating Committee each year for
consideration.  Awards are made on the basis of scientific merit,
with no quota established for specific countries or regions. 
Information and application materials are available through the
IRF Nominating Committee Chairman listed below.  	</P>

<P>The Fogarty International Research Collaboration Award
(FIRCA)  
</P>
<P>This award provides U.S. biomedical scientists with active
NIH cancer-related grants the opportunity to compete for small
grants to establish research cooperation with colleagues in
African countries.  These small grants will provide funds to the
foreign collaborator, through the U.S. grantee institution, for
equipment and supplies at his/ her home institution, and for
travel expenses for both the U.S. Principal Investigator and the
foreign collaborator.  Applicants must request support to conduct
research not already being supported by the U.S. investigator's
parent grant; however, the research proposal must be an extension
of, or related to the currently funded research project.  The
minimum grant project period will be for one year; the maximum
will be for three, dependent on the number of years remaining on
the U.S. Principal Investigator's parent grant.   Requests may be
made up to a limit of  $20,000 per year for up to three years in
direct costs.  For further information contact:

</P>
<P>These programs were created to increase the expertise of both
U.S. and foreign scientists in epidemiology related to AIDS and
the use of epidemiology in clinical trials and prevention
research.  These training programs can lead to the M.S. or Ph.D.
degree for foreign scientists.  Short term comprehensive courses
and training in laboratory research techniques related to AIDS
are available to foreign health professionals.  Additionally,
practical training related to AIDS can be conducted in the
participating foreign countries.
</P>
<P> 	I. International Training Grants in Epidemiology Related to
AIDS  are awarded to U.S. institutions with strong AIDS research
programs and international experience.  Five types of training
for foreign scientists from participating developing countries
are available through this program:   	1) training in
epidemiological concepts, methods, field studies, and research
related to 	AIDS that will lead to the M.S. or Ph.D. degree for
individuals with previous field research experience. 	2) training
in epidemiological field studies and research related to AIDS
that will  lead to the M.S. degree for individuals without prior
field research experience. 	3) short-term comprehensive courses
in epidemiology with an emphasis on AIDS,  for health
professionals. 	4) training in laboratory procedures and research
techniques related to AIDS for  individuals with the M.S. or
Ph.D. degree. 	5) practical and applied short-term training
related to AIDS conducted in the foreign  country for
professionals, technicians and allied health professionals.   
</P>
<P>	II. International Postdoctoral Research and Training in
AIDS.   This FIC program is available to U.S. and foreign
scientists to expand epidemiological skills in AIDS diagnosis,
prevention, and treatment.  Priority is given to AIDS researchers

South Africa -- the exchanges are partnerships between USIA and
USAID or private organizations or companies.  
</P>
<P>The Fulbright Exchange Program 
</P>
<P>This program brings over 1,400 foreign graduate students to
U.S. universities each year and sends over 1,000 U.S. scholars
and professionals to more than 100 countries.  In recent years
this program has annually accepted about 30 South Africans to
study or conduct research in the United States and a similar
number of Americans to conduct research or teach in South Africa.
 Over the years, leading South Africans have received advanced
degrees in a wide variety of fields at American institutions. 
</P>
<P>The Humphrey Fellowship Program  
</P>
<P>The Humphrey Fellowship Program brings 1,000 mid-level
professionals from developing countries, including South Africa,
to the U.S. for year-long university study and work-related
practical experience. 
</P>
<P> The University Affiliations Program 
</P>
<P>The University Affiliations Program provides seed funding
toward the establishment of long-term institutional partnerships
between U.S. and foreign universities and develops exchanges of
faculty and staff.  Several linkages between American and South
African universities have been selected for formal funding over
the years; many others have grown out of other USIA-funded
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>The International Visitor Program 
</P>
<P>The International Visitor Program brings approximately 2,600
first-time visitors from around the world to the U.S. each year
for targeted, short-term professional development programs. 
Among the veterans of this program are former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and former German Chancellor Willi Brandt. 
Nearly 1,200 leading South Africans, including Presidential Chief
of Staff Jakes Gerwel, ANC leader Cyril Ramaphosa, Deputy
President F.W. De Klerk and anti-apartheid parliamentarian Helen
Suzman have been International Visitors.  The program's
flexibility has been particularly valuable in the case of South
Africa, as special enhancements both from Congress and in
partnership with USAID, have substantially increased the number
of South Africans visiting the United States since 1990.  As
discussed with Minister Ngubane during his Washington visit for
the U.S. - South African Binational Commission meetings, USIA is
prepared to construct a special group program for a high-level
delegation of South African science policy experts, to be
designated by the Minister, to visit the United States for an
intensive consultations with counterparts throughout the country;
</P>
<P>The Voluntary Visitor Program 
</P>
<P>The Voluntary Visitor Program annually assists over 2,500
professionals during visits to the United States with
supplementary short-term consultations or professional
development programs.  This program has also demonstrated its
flexibility in recent years as South African political and NGO
leaders, travelling to the U.S. on other business have been able
to remain for special consultations with American experts on a
broad range of issues, e.g. conflict resolution, constitutional
and civil rights issues, democratic governance and other priority
concerns. 
</P>
<P>The U.S. Speakers Program, Academic/Cultural Specialist and
Professionals-in-Residence Programs 
</P>
<P>These programs send hundreds of U.S. professionals abroad
each year for shorter-term speaking engagements, training and
consultative activities.  These programs have proven particularly
valuable in the case of South Africa; special enhancements both
from Congress and  partnership with USAID have enabled USIA to
provide a large number of outstanding American experts to work
closely with South African government and nongovernment
organizations doing vital work in a range of issues including
conflict resolution, legal and constitutional reform,
broadcasting regulation, education and arts management; 
</P>
<P>The Office of Private Sector Programs
</P>
<P>The Office of Private Sector Programs in recent years has
facilitated a number of exchange programs in a wide variety of
targeted areas through solicited requests for proposals from
American institutions and organizations creating partnerships
with foreign institutions and organizations.  Open solicitations
for proposals area also periodically published and reviewed. 
This Office also has pioneered USIA's largest public-private
exchange program in cooperation with Warner Music Group and the
New School for Social Research, providing management internships
for South Africans in the United States. 
</P>

<P>South Africans interested in additional information about
USIA exchange programs may contact the Public Affairs Officer,
U.S. Information Service, Embassy of the United States, Pretoria.
Telephone (012) 342-3006.  
</P>
<P>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
</P>
<P>Sea Grant College Program 
</P>
<P>NOAA is the home of the National Sea Grant College Program
which links participating college and university programs across
the United States.  These programs focus on education, advisory
services and research related to the Great Lakes (large
freshwater systems), coastal and marine environments.  Foreign
national graduate students often receive research assistantships
on environmental projects funded by the National Sea Grant
Office. 
</P>
<P>Sea Grant programs are providing training for U.S. teachers
of predominantly minority students and address minority
involvement at all levels of education.  Science education
projects, directly involve middle and secondary students, train
teachers, and generate specialized educational materials for
minority Hispanic populations.  Pre-college education efforts
have been expanded into U.S.-affiliated Pacific island states
through the Pacific Island Network.  Additionally, Puerto Rico
Sea Grant extends its technical advisory assistance and education
programs into the Caribbean Basin. 
</P>
<P>NOAA has initiated the International Marine Debris Project,
coordinated through the National Marine Fisheries Service.  The
Fourth International Conference (Miami, 1994) included South
African researchers as committee chairs.  The proceedings
published through the North Carolina Sea Grant Program and a
subsequent periodical to encourage continued global networking
and exchange of knowledge could easily focus on South African
students for data on beach debris and analysis.  This project
requires technical research and low level volunteer monitoring
for data input. 
</P>
<P>International science education associations, in concert with
the National Association for Research in Science Teaching
(NARST), include university and college faculty from the U.S. and
South Africa.  U.S. membership includes educational specialists
from the Sea Grant programs.  This could provide a mechanism to
exchange/distribute pre-college curricula and strategies on
teaching about the marine and coastal environment and provide an
outlet for research findings to enter the public sector more
quickly. 
</P>
<P>Links with Research Under the Commission 
</P>
<P>NOAA is participating in the Committee on Conservation and
the Environment and the Committee on Science and Technology under
the Gore-Mbeki Commission.  Under these Committees, we chair the
Fisheries Working Group and the Weather and Climate Working
Group.  These groups are developing cooperative projects with
South African counterparts (both government and academic). 
</P>
<P>Based on a similar approach under consideration for research
in Arctic areas, the human resource development aspect could
include three components: (a) information supplied to local,
affected communities both prior to and after the conduct of
research; (b) incorporation, as appropriate, of indigenous
knowledge; and (c) inclusion of students on research or data
collection teams.  
</P>
<P>To encourage diversity in graduate research programs,
mentorship programs, beginning as early as middle grades, could
involve students with professionals, with the objective of
interesting them in future scientific careers. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Bradford E. Brown, a participant in the Fisheries Working
Group, identified several such opportunities in his Trip Report
on his participation in the October 1994 visit of the U.S.
Science and Technology Delegation. 
</P>
<P>Some of the ideas included in his report include: 
</P>
<P>o efforts by the Sea Fisheries Institute to establish links
with Historically Black Colleges to bring students on as interns;
 o increased involvement of the Oceanographic Institution (a NGO)
in Durban with local Black and Indian Communities;  o the
possibility of providing training to Black and Indian students by
the Natal Shark Board;  o supplementing efforts by the FRD to
increase involvement of Historically Black Colleges and
Universities by establishing a marine science area focus;  o
expanding present research linkages between the U.S. National
Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA) and the University of Zululand by
beginning undergraduates in off campus scientific field work. 
</P>
<P>The Globe Program 
</P>
<P>The Globe Program is initiating a global student
environmental monitoring system which could link a diverse group
of South African pre-college students to researchers and students
throughout the world.  
</P>
<P>U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  
</P>
<P>The Cochran Fellowship Program
</P>
<P> USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service has initiated a pilot
training program, called the Cochran Fellowship Program, to
provide short-term training in the United States for
agriculturists from middle-income countries.  The program is
intended to develop agricultural systems necessary to meet the
food needs of the domestic population and to strengthen and
enhance the trade linkages between eligible countries and
agricultural interests in the United States.  The Cochran
Fellowship program will include a cross-section of participants
from the public and private sector agriculture community,
including government ministries, agriculture research and
extension centers, farmers unions, and agribusiness. 
Applications were distributed and accepted through the
Agricultural Attache's office in Pretoria.  Interviews of
potential candidates were conducted between March 20-30, 1995.  
</P>
<P>USDA funds were set aside to fund up to 30 Cochran candidates
from South Africa.  A decision was made to fund 15 slots from the
public sector and 15 from the private sector and academia.  Of
the approximately 70 candidates interviewed in March, 20 were
accepted into the training program.  The remaining Cochran funds
will be set aside for FY1996 when further interviews can be
conducted. 
</P>

</P>
<P>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
</P>
<P>Each year, NIST hosts approximately 600 international guest
scientists and engineers at its Gaithersburg, Maryland and
Boulder, Colorado laboratories.  In the past year, NIST has
hosted three South Africans and hopes o increase this number.

The Deaconess is also affiliated with the Joslin Diabetes Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy.<P>Conveniently located in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area, the Hospital is close to other major health-care institutions with which it shares numerous joint programs, research efforts and staff.<P>Founded in 1896, Deaconess Hospital has long been known for combining "science and kindliness" in the delivery of state-of-the-art health-care and hospital services to the most critically ill patients.  Our reputation for providing quality patient care is internationally recognized as evidenced by the number of patients from around the world who turn to the Deaconess for management of complex illnesses.<P>Since its establishment, the Deaconess has been home to many talented physician-scientists. Clinical highlights -- including the first use of insulin in New England for the treatment of diabetic patients -- abound. The Deaconess Cancer Research Institute was established in 1951 to study causes and potential treatments for cancer. The first of its kind in New England, the Institute remains a leader in the study of chemopreventive agents and their role in the prevention of prostate, colon and breast cancers. Hepatobiliary surgeons at Deaconess Hospital performed New England's first successful liver transplant in 1983.<P>In addition, programs such as the Deaconess Mind/Body Medical Institute and the Institute for Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease have promoted innovative disease prevention modalities in the region and throughout the nation. The institutes examine the roles that life-style factors, including stress, poor nutrition and lack of exercise, play in the development of hypertension, heart disease and other life- threatening conditions.<P>The Hospital provides specialized medical and surgical services and returns patients to their physicians, community hospitals, or other health-care providers for ongoing care and monitoring. This collaboration allows for the most effective use of expertise and provides the highest level of quality patient care in the most appropriate setting.<P>Our extensive experience, research and educational programs have led us to develop multidisciplinary programs in: <P><UL>	<LI>heart and vascular disease/cardiology	<LI>diabetes complications/vascular surgery	<LI>bone &amp; joint	<LI>AIDS/HIV	<LI>gastrointestinal and liver disorders/Hepatobiliary Surgery</UL><P>By establishing these specialized areas of care, the Deaconess can maintain a variety of specialized units within the general Hospital complex.<P>Cluster units for cardiology, oncology, psychiatry, vascular disease and transplantation allow highly trained personnel to address patients' special needs.<P>Intensive and coronary care units are supplemented by stepdown units for patients recovering from vascular, cardiac and thoracic disease or surgery. These units provide greater monitoring of patients who do not require intensive care.<P>Our excellent medical and nursing care are supported by outstanding pathology laboratories and facilities in radiology and radiation therapy.  Dietitians, pharmacists, physical therapists and respiratory therapists all contribute to patient-centered care.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

Preparations for the hospital's 1996 centennial celebration afforded opportunities to reflect on the Deaconess' proud heritage as a place where "science and kindliness unite."  Just as evident, however, were the many far-ranging initiatives that the hospital has undertaken to ensure that its tradition of excellence in patient care, education, research, and community services is carried well into the next century.<P>In 1995 the Deaconess capped a decade of planning and preparation with the successful completion of a $25 million capital campaign that helped ensure timely completion of its new Clinical Center and also make possible a commitment to occupy new research space.  The Clinical Center, which opened in early 1995 to praise from patients and staff alike, is the most visible demonstration of the hospital's commitment to the future.  The building, which has won several awards honoring its design, functionality, and beauty, not only assures patients access to the region's most advanced tertiary-care facilities, but also supports the personalized, compassionate care for which the Deaconess is known.<P>The hospital reinforced its commitment to cutting-edge medical research by joining the Harvard Institutes of Medicine (HIM) project now under construction in the former Boston English High School building.  The facility will provide Deaconess physician-scientists with modern, cost-effective research space that consolidates geographically diverse laboratory activities, fosters the bench-to-bedside application of new research findings, and enhances opportunities for collaboration with colleagues from New England Baptist, Beth Israel, and Brigham and Women's hospital, who also will be located there.  To help ensure the continued growth and vitality of its scientific programs, the hospital established a special fund to support HIM construction and ongoing research activities.<P>At the same time, the hospital took steps to ensure that it remains a leader in today's health-care market.  Changes in the practice of medicine and other clinical initiatives helped reduce average length of stay by nearly a full day in 1995.  This dramatic result reflects Deaconess physicians' active involvement in cost-control and quality-improvement efforts -- working closely with management and employees to streamline procedures, improve communication, and identify and eliminate unnecessary work.  Through the efforts of multidisciplinary teams at all levels and across all departments, the hospital successfully reduced operation costs by $27 million in 1995, and identified and additional $10 million in savings to be realized in the coming fiscal year.  Part of a five-year effort projected to reduce overall expenses by 25 percent from 1992 to 1996, these actions are essential to maintaining the hospital's competitiveness in tomorrow's environment.<P>Teamwork is also at the heart of the hospital's approach to case management, which brings together nursing and social work staff to maintain patient-centered care while improving communication and facilitating cost-effective practices among care givers.  Other key clinical efforts -- including ongoing expansion of the hospital's Transitional Care Unit and further development of Behavioral Health Systems of New England, a Deaconess-initiated, full-service psychiatric network linking complementary mental-health and substance-abuse providers in eastern Massachusetts -- enhance the scope of services offered to patients.  These and other ongoing projects aimed at developing better patient outcome measures and identifying ways to improve patient care exemplify the benefits to be gained from collaboration.<P>Through efforts like these, Deaconess Hospital was able to meet the challenges of the changing market without compromising high-quality, personalized patient care or a positive work climate.  Employee and patient satisfaction surveys undertaken during the year confirmed the hospital's success in these efforts.  Ratings from employees in 10 of 16 categories surveyed, including job satisfaction and working conditions.  Patient satisfaction likewise increased, with results approaching the all-time high recorded in 1983 when the survey was initiated.  The survey provides a constant measure of efforts to ensure that each patient receives care that is warm and compassionate as well as the most advanced that medical science has to offer.  Superior scores from patients treated in the new Clinical Center highlight that facility's positive impact.  This performance was further validated by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, which gave the Deaconess excellent ratings during its survey last June.<P><B>DPPG: Positioned for the Future</B><P>Formed in 1987 as the first multispecialty physician group practice in the Harvard Medical School system, Deaconess Professional Practice Group (DPPG) works closely with the hospital to further its commitment to quality patient care, education , and research.<P>A separate corporate entity comprising physicians in Deaconess Medicine, Deaconess Surgical Associates, Deaconess Radiology Associates, Deaconess Pathology Associates, and Deaconess Psychiatry, DDPG has been instrumental in aligning hospital and physician initiatives while breaking down the institutional and divisional barriers that can impede communication and optimal coordination or patient care.<P>Efforts to better position DPPG in the evolving managed-care market advanced on several fronts during the past year, overcoming management transitions and challenges.  In September, Deaconess Department of Medicine chairman Robert C. Moellering, Jr., M.D., was named DPPG president and Dorothy Ross DPPG chief operation officer.  Working closely with the hospital to meet ambitious cost-control goals, they an others in the practice group spearheaded several important clinical and contracting initiatives.  DPPG played a critical role in the hospital's successful negotiation of a ground-breaking sub-capitated contract with Brockton-based Goddard Medical Associates, one of the state's largest multispecialty physician group practices.  Under this agreement, the first of its kind in Massachusetts, the Deaconess and New England Medical Center receive a fixed, per-member, per-month fee to provide tertiary care for approximately 20,000 HMO Blue patients.  Through the Goddard Contract, as well as Pathway Health's contract with Fallon Community Health Plan, the Deaconess and DPPG will gain valuable experience in managing capitation and similar kinds of risk-sharing arrangements that are expected to shape the health-care marketplace of the future.<P>Progress continued on the development of "product lines" in several clinical specialties, most notably cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery.  These efforts -- aimed at developing distinct, high-quality, cost-effective algorithms of care that can be priced globally for HMOs and other payers as clinical products -- bring together physicians from different departments, along with other care-team members, to make joint decisions about care plans, resource allocation, contracting, and marketing.<P>Great success also was achieved in academic endeavors that reflect a long-standing commitment to medical education and research.  Exceptional results were attained in the National Residency Matching Program fir 1995-1996, matching a total of 66 medical school graduates with residency training programs in the departments of Medicine, Surgery, Radiological Sciences, Pathology, Psychiatry.<P>Two Deaconess physicians who have pioneered research in the field of organ transplantation, Fritz Bach, M.D., and Anthony Monaco, M.D., were selected as the first recipients of two newly endowed Harvard Medical School professorships made possible by a $5 million gift from the Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation and named for two of the most significant scientists in the field.  Bach will occupy the Lewis Thomas chair, while Monaco was awarded the Peter Medawar Professorship.<P>Through cutting-edge research in other areas such as behavioral medicine, diabetes, cancer, nutrition, and AIDS, Deaconess physician-scientists are tackling some of medicine's most challenging puzzles.  In investigation of "designer T cells" and other forays into molecular biology, hospital researchers are working to harness the power of the human immune system to combat cancer and other diseases.  Last fall, Deaconess cardiologists published findings demonstrating a scientific link between anger and heart attacks; the attention and acclaim generated by studies such as this have helped the hospital maintain its national and international reputation as a center of medical knowledge.<P><B>Commitment to Community</B><P>Like Pathway Health Network, the Deaconess works to fulfill a four-part mission that comprises community service as a well as patient care, education, and research.  The commitment to outreach was underscored recently when the hospital's Board of Trustees formed it own Community Benefit Committee to provide strategic guidance for efforts to improve community health.<P>In the past year, activities focused on statewide outreach for patients with HIV and AIDS, as well as on health-promotion and disease-prevention programs geared to older adults and residents of Boston's Roxbury neighborhood.  For example, Deaconess cardiologists help staff the Roxbury Heart Center, which provides much-needed cardiac care for that community's predominantly African-American population.  The Center, a collaborative effort of Deaconess, Beth Israel, and New England Baptist hospitals, along with Roxbury Comprehensive Community Health Center, was selected by the American Hospital Association as a finalist for its NOVA Award, which honors collaborative projects that focus on improving community health status.  Another outreach activity was the Deaconess Department of Nursing's sponsorship of "Health beat on Warren Street," an all-day community health fair attended by hundreds of Roxbury residents.  The event was part of the hospital's year-long centennial celebration.<P><B>A Second Century</B><P>The Deaconess enters its second century supported by a solid financial foundation and guided by a strong, experienced leadership.  During the past year, the hospital's Board of Trustees named former executive vice president and chief operating officer Robert G. Norton as the Deaconess' new president, while Cheryl Hoffman was recruited to serve as chief financial officer.<P>With the successful conclusion of the Deaconess Campaign -- which raised $25 million in philanthropic gifts over four years -- the hospital is well positioned to provide tomorrow's health care today.  As a result of strong support from trustees, corporators, medical staff, and employees, as well as from corporations, foundations, and grateful patients and their families, the new Clinical Center is fully operational and the hospital can turn its attention to research -- renewing its commitment to the creation of new knowledge that will benefit the patients of tomorrow.  This effort will ensure that the Deaconess is able to continue to uncover the cures for diseases while providing patient-centered care -- to be a place where "science and kindliness unite" for a second century.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

For example, Dr. LoGerfo and his colleagues have prepared various composites wherein either an anticoagulant (to reduce blood clotting) or an antibiotic (to prevent infection) is linked to the graft material.  His group is also interested in the flow dynamics of vessel grafts and the biology of the cells which line blood vessels.  Dr. LoGerfo is Principal Investigator of an NIH Training Grant in Vascular Surgery which combines faculty in several of the teaching hospitals affiliated with Harvard Medical School as well as of an RO1 from the National Institutes of Health.  He also participates as an investigator in a collaboration with a biomedical company which is funded by NIH. <P><B>Dr. Sidney Levitskty</B><BR>Joined by his colleagues Drs.

Dr. Groopman is Principal Investigator on a Program Project Grant from the National Institutes of Health through which the group seeks to improve the understanding of the impairment in pulmonary host defense in the setting of HIV and HIV-associated infections. Dr. Groopman's own project within this large grant is directed towards study of the direct effects of HIV infection on alveolar macrophages - a type of cell central to the immune defense system of the lungs.  He is also the Principal investigator on an RO1 grant to explore the use of a specific growth factor (thrombopoietin) to combat a deficiency of blood platelets in HIV infected patients.  Dr. Ladius is funded by an RO1 from NIH to study the possible role of a class of nuclear receptors which he discovered in the control of HIV replication.  A second RO1 and a grant from the American Heart Association awarded to Dr. Ladius are for the study of the regulation of a lipoprotein gene product by that same family of receptors.  Recently, he has added the technique of x-ray crystallography to provide structure-function correlates.  Dr. Randal Byrn is researching potential new therapies for HIV infection.  His laboratory collaborates with a number of pharmaceutical companies in the development of new drugs.  He has established a set of biological systems which provide important information on drug effects.  The same studies are also informative with regard to our understanding of the life cycle of HIV.  One major current project involves the construction of "designer" T cells genetically engineered to kill HIV.  Dr. Byrn's funding is partially from for-profit companies and partially from non-profit foundations. Dr. Terwilliger is a molecular biologist with two RO1 grants from NIH which support his studies on how an HIV gene designated vpr is involved in the replication of the virus in macrophages/monocytes.  He is also supported by the American Foundation for AIDS Research and Concerned Parents for AIDS Research on projects related to the treatment of HIV infection by gene therapy.  In the first case, the approach is to make cells of the hematopoietic system resistant to infection by HIV and the second is directed at a more direct therapy for cells already infected.<P>Dr. Scott Hammer is lead investigator on a number of clinical studies related to AIDS therapy. At the same time, he maintains a laboratory research effort focused upon specialized assays to type HIV isolates and assays of other viruses causing opportunistic infections in AIDS patients. In both cases, he receives funding from the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) at NIH and from pharmaceutical companies.<P>Dr. Christine Wanke's research interest is in infections of the gut in AIDS patients.  Like Drs. Groopman and Hammer, she is an active clinician.  Her current research funding includes five grants from non-profit agencies and pharmaceutical companies.  In the laboratory, a main interest is on infection by E. coli,, a bacterium which is harmless in normal adults but which can cause serious infection in immunocomprimised AIDS patients.<P>A final group including Dr. Robert Moellering and Dr. George Eliopoulos studies bacterial resistance to antibiotics.  The emergence of bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics is a common but serious problem. To counter this problem, pharmaceutical companies are actively developing new antibiotics utilizing techniques such as rational drug design.  Drs. Moellering and Eliopoulos work in collaboration with a number of companies to screen new compounds against a panel of bacterial strains found in the hospital setting and to understand the molecular basis for drug resistance.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

Special emphasis is found in studies of colo-rectal cancer where there is a particularly stronglink between clinical and laboratory studies and in the treatment of liver cancer by chemoembolism through a collaboration between the Departments of Medicine and Radiology.  Our laboratory research in this field is more narrowly defined and includes four groups of investigators.<P>The first is led by Dr. J. Milburn Jessup of the Department of Surgery and includes Drs. Harvey Goldman, Max Loda, Arthur Mercurio, Ian Summerhayes and Peter Thomas.  A combination of surgeons (Jessup), pathologists (Goldman and Loda) and basic scientists (Mercurio, Summerhayes and Thomas), this group studies the pathobiology of colo-rectal cancer.  A program project grant from the National Institutes of Health is the cornerstone of funding for the group with additional funding coming from RO1 grants from NIH (Jessup, Mercurio, Summerhayes and Thomas), NASA (Jessup), the American Cancer Society (Mercurio), a training grant from NIH,  and grants from several for-profit companies.  Individual projects include: the role of carcinoembryonic antigen and of integrins in metastasis of colon tumors; the search for new markers specific for types of colo-rectal cancers and description of any correlation which exists between marker levels and disease stage and response to treatment;  and efforts to better understand the role of various oncogenes in the development and progression of tumors.<P>The second group is led by Dr. Jerome Groopman and includes Drs. Hava Avraham, Shalom Avraham, and Jadwiga Grabarek.  This group is interested in the normal development of cells of the blood system (hematopoietic cells) and the nervous system and how such development goes awry in leukemia and lymphoma.  Other studies are directed at the development of supportive therapies for patients with cancer.  For example, chemotherapy and radiation therapy can lead to a significant reduction of blood platelets.  Soluble factors which promote the formation of new platelets including the factor called thrombopoietin and antibodies which can act as growth factor agonists are currently being studied by this group.  Dr. Groopman, Dr. H. Avraham and Dr. Grabarek all have investigator-initiated grants from the National Institutes of Health for their studies.  They also collaborate with biotechnology companies interested in the commercial applications of growth and development factors.<P>Dr. Richard Junghans leads a group studying the potential of creating a strong cell mediated immune response against cancer by genetically engineering a subset of white blood cells (T derived lymphocytes) to carry a more efficient cell surface receptor for recognition of the cancers.  Dr. Junghans' studies are supported by grants from the NIH, the Department of Defense, the FDA and the American Cancer Society.<P>A final group within this category, led by Dr. Arthur Sytkowski, is studying how cells receive signals from their environment and transmit those signals within the cell.  Their more specific interest is with erythropoeitin and its receptor.  The group is supported by grants from the NIH, the Department of the Navy and by several individual postdoctoral fellowships.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

This group includes Dr. Steven Goldring, Dr. Philip Auron, Dr. Debra Galson and Dr. Mary Goldring.  They are interested in those inflammatory events which occur in the setting of artificial implants into bone (such as artificial hips and knees) and have been dissecting the inflammatory events using the tools of cell and molecular biology.  The group has cloned two forms of the calcitonin receptor which regulates the uptake of calcium in bones and a cytokine designated Il-1b, one of the soluble protein mediators of inflammatory reactions.  All of the members of this group participate in an NIH funded program project grant.  In addition, Drs. Auron and S. Goldring both also have RO1 grants from NIH while Dr. M. Goldring has independent support from the Arthritis Foundation.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

Since the inception of these programs, there has been on focus on nutritional strategies for the post-surgical patient leading to such innovations as the use of fish oils and structured lipids.  Most recently, a study led by Dr. Timothy Babineau demonstrated the effectiveness of Betafectin (a glucan) in reducing hospital stay in such patients.  The major research groups in this area include:<P>Dr. George Blackburn and colleagues are interested in lasting weight loss as a preventative strategy against several diseases.  Recognizing that failure to maintain weight loss is a major problem, their efforts have included a combination of calorie restriction, exercise, counseling and pharmacolgic intervention.  The later aspect includes clinical studies of the combination of phenteramine resin and dl-fenfluramine.  Other ongoing studies include assessment of leptin levels and attempts to identify additional genes linked to obesity.  Of particular note are the outreach efforts to minority populations in these studies as sociological issues clearly bear upon the effectiveness of some intervention strategies.  This group is supported by grants from the NIH and from industry.<P>A second group, led by Dr. Bruce Bistrian, is engaged in laboratory studies of how specific nutrients affect characteristics of the immune response such as the production of cytokines and an additional study of how hormones such as IGF-1 modulate body composition.  This group is also supported by both NIH and company funding.<P>Dr. R. Armour Forse, an active surgeon, leads a team of investigators working in the new field of "nutraceuticals" in which specific dietary components provide specific medical benefits.  Their studies include compounds such as saponins, sesamins and herbal compounds and their approach includes both the demonstration of clinical benefits and a biochemical exploration of the mechanisms behind such benefits.  A major supporter of their studies is a start-up company formed to commercialize technology developed by this group.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

Again the patient care program is supported by both clinical and laboratory research.<P>Drs. Anthony Monaco, David Lewis and Roger Jenkins are engaged in clinical studies of  immunosuppressive agents which reduce organ rejection.  Dr. Monaco's laboratory research in conjunction with Dr. Takashi Maki also emphasizes the study of immunosuppression but at the cellular and animal level.  In addition, these investigators have played a major role in the development of an artificial pancreas which is expected to enter clinical trials within the next several months.  support for these investigators comes from the NIH and several pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies.<P>A large program in the Sandoz Center for Immunobiology headed by Dr. Fritz Bach is engaged in studies to make feasible the transplantation of organs from other species into man.  Such xenotransplants are rejected by mechanisms different than those principally operative in man-to-man transplants and the hypothesis is that the barriers to xenotransplantation can be overcome more easily than those to allotransplantation.  Much of their work is directed at defining the various mechanisms involved in rejection and attempts to remove those barriers through a combination of genetic engineering and  drug therapy.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

Treatment focuses on providing cost-effective care to minimize hospitalization and deliver greater comfort and quality of life to each patient.<P>In addition to using standard forms of treatment for HIV itself as well as complicating opportunistic infections and malignancies, physicians in the Division of Infectious Disease participate in clinical trials of new treatments and innovative combinations of licensed agents. The trials, which are conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health and various international pharmaceutical companies, provide patients access to 'cutting-edge' therapy that would otherwise not be available. Recent areas of particular interest include new antiretroviral compounds (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors) as well as immune-based therapies of HIV and HIV-related malignancies. Many patients who are interested in innovative therapies have the opportunity to participate in these clinical trials of new treatment modalities.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

Particular expertise is also offered in kidney transplantation for diabetic patients.<P>Through a historical relationship with the Joslin Diabetes Center, physicians from both institutions collaborate to provide the most up-to-date medical care available to patients with diabetes. This approach has helped to develop successful programs such as the Deaconess-Joslin Nephrology program which offers expertise in the management of diabetic patients on hemodialysis.<P>Specialists in cardiology, neurology, urology and nutrition also work to treat the patient with diabetes. The Division of Urological Surgery offers particular expertise in the evaluation and treatment of male sexual dysfunction and diabetic impotence.<P>For patients of any age requiring intensive medical treatment or education to control their diabetes, an on-site Diabetic Treatment Unit (DTU) provides a team approach emphasizing patient involvement in the management of the disease. The goal is an efficient return to the referring physician once the patient is medically stable.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

<P>             
The Boston Center for Liver Cancer is a new program established at Deaconess Hospital to help study and care for patients with cancers of the liver, bile ducts or pancreas.  Designed to address all aspects of care of these diseases with their complicated medical problems, the Center is staffed by specialists in the fields of Medical Oncology, Hepatobiliary Surgery, Gastroenterology, Interventional Radiology, and Radiation Oncology.  Allied members of the Department of Nursing, Social Work, and Nutrition, who specialize in cancer care, are involved as well.
<P>
This multidisciplinary, disease-specific approach concentrates the expertise of multiple physicians so that each patient receives the most complete evaluation and recommendations possible.  Consultations and testing are all coordinated by the Center so that decisions regarding diagnosis and therapy can be made quickly and efficiently, with a minimum number of visits.  In addition, patients may be included in appropriate ongoing research studies investigating new treatment options.
<P>
The Center is dedicated to providing an organized focus on individuals with all forms of cancer involving the hepatobiliary system, while integrating exceptional patient care with quality research.

Beaser, M.D.<BR>	Phone: 632-8798</BLOCKQUOTE><P>The Diabetes Treatment Unit (DTU) provides comprehensive diabetes treatment and patient education for patients requiring inpatient care for their diabetes control and/or other medical conditions. Diabetes management issues addressed include newly diagnosed diabetes, initiation of insulin therapy, initiation of intensive diabetes therapy management programs and assessment of diabetes control problems when outpatient efforts have failed or are otherwise inappropriate. The format begins the process of optimizing metabolic control and encourages patients and significant others to participate as active members of the healthcare team. Opportunities to learn and to be motivated are made available to every patient according to his/her individuals needs and abilities to comprehend.<P>The DTU is a joint Joslin Diabetes Center/Deaconess effort combining the expertise and experience of these two institutions in this efficient cost-effective intervention. The DTU program is a team approach that involves the patient, physician, diabetes nurse educators, and nutritionists in a concentrated and coordinated effort to develop an individual program of total diabetes care that the patient can manage at home. The patient's glucose management program is assessed, and improvements in the self-treatment program are designed and initiated. The DTU provides a controlled setting for this team of multi-disciplinary specialists to closely monitor blood sugar levels and insulin doses, diet and exercise patterns. In addition, the patient is instructed on the essentials of self-care techniques including insulin use, meal planning , exercise and complications avoidance. Following the DTU inpatient stay further outpatient follow-up with either a member of the Joslin team or the primary care giver can utilize the changes initiated in the DTU to achieve optimal glucose control.<P>Deaconess Hospital and the Joslin Diabetes Center are committed to caring for the special needs of people with diabetes. If needed, subspecialty consultations can be arranged with Joslin ophthalmologists, renal specialists, podiatrists, exercise physiologists and mental health professionals.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

Founded in 1981, IPC is one of the first refugee mental health clinicals in the United States and internationally.  The clinic is affiliated with Harvard University and the Harvard Program in Refugee Trauma (HPRT).  Utilizing a bicultural approach, IPC/HPRT has pioneered the field of refugee mental health and has made major contributions to the cross-cultural understanding of the physical and psychological consequences of mass violence, human rights abuses and forced migration.  From its inception, IPC has been committed to providing excellent care for those most in need.<P><B>Program</B><P>IPC offers complete psychiatric and psychosocial evaluations, individual, group and family therapy, home visits, social services, and community consultation.  Bilingual, bicultural mental health specialists work with psychiatrists, nurse clinicians, and social workers to provide a multidisciplinary team approach.  Treatment is based on an in-depth understanding of the individual's trauma story and the impact of trauma, torture and mass violence on individuals, families and communities.  IPC's Outreach Program works with community refugee agencies to link the clinic with families who are isolated and in need of mental health services.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

<P>Our Center for Pelvic Floor And Motility Disorders integrates the expertise of a number of physicians and 
surgeons to treat patients with constipation, fecal or urinary incontinence, rectal, 
vaginal or bladder prolapse, diarrhea and pelvic floor pain. 
<p>
Specialists in gastroenterology, colorectal surgery, urology, gynecology, and 
radiology comprehensively evaluate these patients utilizing standard and 
specialized testing techniques.  Specialized tests available include anorectal 
manometry, anal electromyography, pudendal nerve terminal motor latency testing, 
defecography, urodynamic testing, and transanal/transrectal ultrasonography.  
This thorough, integrated evaluation not only identifies the causes of fecal 
incontinence and constipation, but also identifies all associated disorders 
(e.g., bladder dysfunction) that should be treated concomitantly.  
Treatment plans usually involve the integration of dietary, medical, 
biofeedback, and surgical therapies.

All services require a prescription for consultation from the referring physician. Ongoing dialogue between the therapist and the physician during the patient's rehabilitation program is encouraged.<P>Physical therapy offers functional mobility evaluation and training; evaluation and treatment of musculoskeletal dysfunction (stiffness, weakness, pain and muscle spasm); pre-operative conditioning to enhance recovery; orthotic/prosthetic evaluation and training; and discharge planning, including use of walkers, crutches, canes and other assistive devices. Modalities and equipment available include Kincom isokinetic equipment, BTE Work Simulator, as well as the more common rehab modalities. Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services are coordinated through the Division of Behavioral Medicine.<P>The PT outpatient program also offers pool therapy programs for treatment of athletic injuries, back pain, arthritis, general conditioning, etc., as well as the use of complete free weights, CYBEX (similar to Nautilus), weight rooms and indoor track for more progressive rehabilitation.<P>Occupational therapy offers upper extremity evaluation, strengthening and range of motion; splinting; training  in self-feeding, dysphagia and activities of daily living (ADL); adaptive equipment for ADL; and perceptual evaluation and treatment.  Modalities available are paraffin and whirlpool as well as the Baltimore Therapeutic Equipment (BTE) Work Simulator for upper extremity rehabilitation.<P>Occupational therapy now offers rehabilitative programs designed around the BTE. This unit can simulate most sports and vocational activities and is used for both assessment and treatment of those functional activities.<P>Speech therapy offers evaluation and treatment of swallowing and speech disorders as well as impaired hearing, perception, and cognition due to illness, disease or trauma. Treatments include instruction in the use of communication boards, electrolarynx and prostheses; swallowing programs, with guidance as to diet, based on patient's ability to swallow to avoid aspiration; follow-up for hearing aid if indicated; activities to assist patients in improving their level of perception or cognition; and assistance in discharge planning.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

The Unit provides skilled nursing, rehabilitative and other related clinical services to help the patient regain and maximize functional abilities. All services are overseen by the Unit's Medical Director.<P>The Unit offers a lower cost alternative to using acute inpatient beds for sub-acute patients. Some advantages include early intervention, coordination of post-hospital care, shorter length of stay, increased attention to functional ability and more direct nursing care. The TCU is licensed as a skilled nursing facility and, therefore, requires an interagency referral and a completed hospital medical discharge summary at the time of discharge to the TCU.<P>Skilled and restorative nursing care is provided 24 hours a day. Physical, occupational and speech therapists develop individualized plans to maximize the patient's potential and facilitate independent living. Social workers offer comprehensive discharge planning and arrangements for continued services at home.<P>Patients are referred to the Transitional Care Unit by their admitting physician and discharge planners.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

Conferences are usually one hour long and are open to any interested member of the medical community.  If you are a non-Deaconess physician, it is a good idea to call the Conference Director in advance before attending.<P>Credit is granted on a one (1) credit-per-hour basis and is good towards physicians' relicensure requirements which, in the State of Massachusetts, are: at least 100 credits, 40 of which must be Category 1.  The remaining 60 hours can be from either Category 1 or Category 2 activities, 10 of which must be risk management credits.<P>To determine whether a particular conference has been approved for risk management credit, please contact the Hospital Risk Manager, Kathleen Murray, R.N. (632-7013).<P>To find out more about <A HREF="weekdeac.html#1">Category 1</A> and <A HREF="weekdeac.html#2">Category 2</A> conferences offered at the Deaconess and affiliated sites, please click on the category that interests you.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

Members of the Beth Israel and Pathway boards, administrations, and medical staffs have been holding initial exploratory discussions for several weeks.<P>The two organizations envision a new concept of provision of care, from primary to tertiary and quaternary, and from neighborhood practice to the academic medical center. The outcome under consideration would include joining the two hospitals to form a single strengthened Beth Israel/Deaconess Medical Center, affiliated with Harvard Medical School, and located on their present neighboring sites in the heart of the Longwood Medical Area. Consolidation of clinical departments, administrative functions, and governance, along with substantial reduction of certain fixed costs, would create economies of intellectual and fiscal scale while enhancing both quality and efficiency of performance and service.<P>A major potential strength in the new network would be the opportunity to work as colleagues with other hospitals and doctors in their own communities, enhancing their ability to provide technical excellence and high medical competence locally, throughout the region, or, for the most complex illnesses, to serve as a referral source at the Harvard-affiliated academic medical center.<P>The new group, yet to be formally named, "will build upon the strengths of both systems and will constitute a significant restructuring producing a vital new force in healthcare in Massachusetts," according to Stephen B. Kay, Board Chair of Beth Israel. John Hamill, Pathway's Board Chair, hailed the joining of these two major Harvard-affiliated teaching hospitals -- Beth Israel and Deaconess -- as "permitting the vital changes in economics and clinical programs that will provide patients, their physicians, and their health plans with sophisticated medical care, a geographically diverse network of primary care providers, and the exceptional qualities of service and care for which Beth Israel and Deaconess are justifiably renowned."<P>"This cooperative relationship would help community physicians to stay at the leading edge of medical knowledge, diagnosis, and treatment, while in turn keeping the medical-center physicians in touch with and supportive of the needs of both the people in their local communities and their local physicians," said Mitchell T. Rabkin, MD, President of Beth Israel Hospital.<P>"The mission of Pathway Health Network has always been to serve patients, communities, students, and science. By bringing together academic and community-based colleagues and focusing on efficacy, quality and the cost of care, we can also add value to the health system. Collaboration will allow us best to fulfill our mission and to compete effectively in today's rapidly changing market," said J. Richard Gaintner, MD, President of Pathway Health Network.<P>The new hospital would meet the traditional responsibilities of both Beth Israel and Deaconess Hospitals, providing service for their neighboring areas at all levels from primary care on-site, in nearby doctors' offices and affiliated community health centers and hospitals, to highly specialized care for complex referral cases from a wider region, which is the traditionally provided expertise of the Harvard hospitals today.<P>The merged hospitals would provide state-of-the-art care at highly competitive prices in today's demanding economic environment, while also retaining the warmth and personalization widely recognized as particularly attractive characteristics of each institution today.<P>The new network of hospitals, physicians, and other health professionals throughout the region would include the Pathway Health Network institutions in addition to Deaconess Hospital: New England Baptist Hospital, Deaconess-Glover Hospital, Deaconess-Nashoba Hospital, and Deaconess-Waltham Hospital, their affiliated physicians, as well as many of the groups of community physicians related to Beth Israel. It is anticipated that others -- hospitals and physicians -- will join and enlarge the new network further, and that they will focus on the provision of care in their local communities, emphasizing the promotion of health, prevention of illness, and ready local access for most medical problems with the occasionally-needed tertiary support from the academic medical center.<P>This more formal phase of discussions, involving "due diligence" with detailed sharing of information and knowledge about the participants, is expected to last several months.<P><B>Beth Israel Hospital</B><BR>Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, was established in 1916 and moved to its present Longwood site in 1928. It is the cornerstone of Beth Israel HealthCare, a regional system of care promoting lifelong wellbeing. Beth Israel HealthCare includes physicians and medical groups, nurses, and other health professionals associated with Beth Israel Hospital, a major clinical, teaching, and research affiliate of Harvard Medical School.<P><B>Pathway Health Network</B><BR>Established in 1994, Pathway Health Network is an integrated system of community-based physicians, hospitals and health centers serving patients and communities in eastern Massachusetts and throughout the region. Full Network members include Deaconess Hospital and New England Baptist Hospital in Boston, Deaconess-Glover Hospital in Needham, Deaconess-Nashoba Hospital in Ayer, and Deaconess-Waltham Hospital in Waltham.<P><B>Deaconess Hospital</B><BR>Deaconess Hospital is a 385-bed specialty-referral, tertiary care facility and a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. Established in 1896, the Hospital has long been known for uniting "science and kindliness" in rendering health and hospital services. In particular, the Deaconess is recognized internationally for expertise in the treatment of heart and vascular disease, diabetic complications, cancer, infectious diseases including AIDS, transplantation, gastrointestinal and liver disorders, nutrition and behavioral medicine.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

In the minimally invasive coronary artery bypass surgery, a small incision is made near the nipple and extended toward the breast bone. The surgeon, after entering the chest cavity, exposes the left anterior descending artery of the heart. Using a section of the internal mammary artery, which is located beneath the ribs, the surgeon completes the graft, increasing blood flow to the heart muscle and bypassing the problematic arterial blockage. An anesthesiologist manages the heart in a slow, steady beat -- eliminating the need for the heart-lung machine.<P>  	In a standard coronary bypass operation, surgeons make a foot-long incision in the chest, split the breast bone and open the entire chest area. The heart is completely stopped and the patient is connected to a heart-lung machine which temporarily pumps blood through the body. The surgeon harvests a vein from the patient's leg, or an artery from the chest, and grafts it to a coronary artery to restore blood flow.<P>"This procedure is a major advance in cardiac surgery," says Levitsky. "It offers a middle level of treatment in the spectrum from standard angioplasty to formal cardiac bypass surgery utilizing the heart-lung machine. Typical bypass surgery patients recover in hospital post-operatively for seven days. The minimally invasive recovery time is two to three days," he adds.<P>Levitsky has completed two minimally invasive coronary artery bypass procedures at the Deaconess, both on patients who developed recurrent obstruction following arterial angioplasty. In angioplasty, a catheter is inserted through an artery in the patient's groin and directed up toward the blocked artery in the heart. A balloon at the tip of the catheter is inflated to clear the blockage. While extremely successful for some, angioplasty is not effective for every patient, as the coronary artery obstruction may reoccur. The minimally invasive coronary artery bypass technique offers a new treatment option, one that is more cost-effective than traditional bypass surgery, and allows patients a quicker, less painful recovery.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

According to a study published in the February issue of The American Journal of Medicine, 100% of chronic insomnia patients who were treated with a group multifactor behavioral intervention experienced improved sleep.<P>"The consequences of insomnia include reduced cognitive and intellectual performance, absenteeism, health problems and hospitalizations, traffic accidents, impaired performance and productivity," says study author, Gregg D. Jacobs, Ph.D., director of the Behavioral Medicine Insomnia Program at the Deaconess and instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School. "Sleeping pills can have serious side-effects and are limited in their effectiveness," adds Jacobs. "Our study proves that behavioral techniques are highly efficacious and safe."<P>Jacobs studied 113 patients with self-defined insomnia who participated in the seven-session Behavioral Medicine Insomnia Program. Patients were taught cognitive restructuring, sleep hygiene, sleep scheduling, gradual reduction of medication, and relaxation response techniques. At the end of treatment, 70% reported significant sleep improvement, and 91% reduced or eliminated the use of sleep medications. These results were maintained at long-term follow-up.<P>"These results suggest that millions of insomniacs can derive significant benefit and improved quality of life from this behavioral treatment," says Jacobs. The results also underscore a recent National Institutes of Health consensus panel recommendation that behavioral techniques be routinely incorporated into medical treatment for insomnia.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

By genetically engineering killer T cells to recognize and destroy specific disease targets and foreign pathogens, scientists may have identified a new form of gene therapy. Reporting in the November 1st issue of the scientific journal Blood, researchers describe the creation of anti-HIV T cells which, in laboratory experiments, specifically target and kill HIV-infected cells.<P>"Active killer T cells have been cited as a critical component in a patient's ability to fight off HIV and other diseases," says Randal Byrn, Ph.D., viral immunologist in the Division of Hematology/Oncology at Deaconess Hospital and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. "By genetically engineering killer T cells, we are developing a therapeutic AIDS strategy that works to destroy the HIV-infected cells, not just free virus."  The research began as a NCDDG program project grant awarded to Jerome Groopman, M.D., chief of Hematology/Oncology at Deaconess Hospital. <P>The anti-HIV killer T cells were created by genetically engineering CD8+ lymphocytes with Universal Receptors able to recognize and destroy HIV-infected cells. A principal component of the human immune system, CD8+ cells play an important role in eliminating virus-infected cells and tumor cells in the body. These cells were modified to express two different Universal Receptors, CD4-zeta or single chain antibody-zeta, both of which were found effective in vitro.<P>While immunotherapy with genetically modified killer T cells represents a potentially powerful therapeutic strategy, the scientists caution that extensive human clinical testing must take place to evaluate both its safety and efficacy. The first trial to test the safety and potential antiviral activity of the anti-HIV T cells will be performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and will study approximately 40 sets of identical twins, in which one twin is HIV positive, and the other is HIV negative. Killer T cells from the non-infected twin will be removed and genetically modified with the universal receptors. The re-engineered cells will then be transplanted into the HIV-infected twin in the hope of fighting off the disease. Identical twins are being studied because of their potential for circumventing transplant rejection. Phase I safety results are expected to be available in late 1995.<P><H5>Copyright 1996 Deaconess Hospital, All rights reserved.</H5></BODY></HTML>

Specific expertise on the inpatient service is provided for medical psychiatric patients with co-existing medical and psychiatric illness. Neuropsychiatric evaluation of geriatric patients involving both psychological and neuropsychological testing services, brain neuro-imaging through the Department of Radiology, and consultation with neurologists and affiliated geriatricians is available. An emphasis is placed upon the integration of the medical, psychological and psychosocial care of the geriatric patient. Particular strengths in the assessment of dementias, Alzheimer's disease and depressive disorders characterize the clinical service. Specialized services, including the provision of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for severely depressed patients, are available on an outpatient and inpatient basis.<P><B>Staff:</B><P><BLOCKQUOTE>	Kerry L.

Diagnostic assessment and treatment planning is assisted by the psychiatric chemistry laboratory, as well as by monitoring ongoing treatment with antidepressant medications. Consultation provides a perspective on the full biopsychosocial spectrum of treatments available to the patient, including medications, psychotherapy and other appropriate psychosocial interventions. Outpatient consultation is supported by the inpatient unit if more intensive diagnostic evaluation and treatment is required. Electroconvulsive therapy services also are available on an inpatient or outpatient basis if clinically indicated.<P><B>Staff:</B><P><BLOCKQUOTE>	Russell G.

About the DRJ: Company Profile
<font size=4>
<blockquote>
<img src="4a.gif" align=left>
<font size=5>Richard L. Arnold<br>
Publisher & Editor-in-Chief<p>
</blockquote><font size=3>
Richard L. Arnold is the founder and President of the Disaster Recovery Journal.  Richard has an extensive background in the information system field, ranging from applications programming to systems programming.  Some of the companies he has been employed by were: MoPac, Anheuser Busch, and Cincom, which are major employers serving the St. Louis Metropolitan area. He has been extensively involved in the disaster recovery field for the past 15 years.  Richard has been innovative in the field of DR, establishing the first Hot-site and Cold-site in the state of Missouri in 1985.  Then in 1987, he founded the Disaster Recovery Journal, the first publication dedicated to the field of disaster recovery and business continuity.  The first issue of the magazine was 22 pages in length and was distributed to 3,000 people.  Today, there are well over 40,000 subscribers and it is nearly 100 pages in length.
<p>
Besides founding the DRJ, Richard also was the founder of the Disaster Recovery Institute in 1989 and served as the Chairman of the Executive Board.  The Disaster  Recovery Institute is a not-for-profit organization offering education and certification in the disaster recovery industry.  In August of 1994, Richard retired as the Chairman of the Executive Board of the DRI.    
<p>
The DRJ also sponsors two annual conferences which began back in September of 1989.  The
first conference drew in a crowd of almost 250 disaster recovery professionals.  Today, both
conferences combined pull in over 2000 disaster recovery professionals from all over the world,
which makes our conferences the largest in the entire industry.  The DRJ is also proud to
announce that the conference fees have never been raised since the first conference in Atlanta in 1989.

</center>
<BR><BR><ALIGN=left>This INTERNET DRP is for the low end type of disaster planning.  It is for the people that have a PC or a small network. It also can be used as a check list to run against the product or plan already in use.
<BR><BR>
This version of the Plan is a result of years of rewriting and fine tuning the original Plan. New sections have been added and existing sections have been expanded. The forms found in some of the sections can be used to capture and recover vital information of your organization. One section contains a comprehensive checklist that is used to alert you to the overall contingency needs for your organization. The book is constructed in a style that allows you to add information particular to your company. Some pages have fill-in-the-blanks areas and other pages specify that you need to insert some technical information about your company.
<BR><BR>
Remember, you can use it with a PC or a small network or used as a check list to run against the product or plan already in use.

MIS CONTINGENCY PLAN</B></FONT></center>
<BR><BR>


As your MIS Contingency Plan is developing through its many phases, it will be printed and distributed to applicable people in your organization. After reviewing the document, people generally tend to tile it away with other work-related material. If a major disaster should ever occur, the data center could be totally destroyed along with copies of the MIS Contingency Plan that were kept in desks and file cabinets. If the disaster occurred outside office hours, the key personnel would probably be at home.
<BR><BR>
To plan for various situations that could occur, copies of the MIS Contingency Plan should be safeguarded both at the office and at the employees residences. An adequate number of copies should be maintained at the data center and at a minimum, additional copies should be located at the following locations:
<BR><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>   			MIS directors home<BR>
   			Operations Managers home<BR>
			Special Projects Managers home<BR>
   			Technical Support Managers home<BR>
   			Data Administration Managers home<BR>
   			Systems and Programming Managers home<BR>
   			Disaster Planning Coordinators home<BR>
   			Other team captains and alternates homes<BR>
   			Computer room<BR>
   			Tape library<BR>
   			Offsite storage<BR>
   			Backup recovery site<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
If you maintain your MIS Contingency Plan on a personal computer using some type of a word processing package, you should back up your Plan after it is entered. After each time it is updated, keep a copy of the diskette stored in a secure location offsite. Having copies of the Plan at various residences may be thought of as unnecessary and redundant since the diskettes are also stored offsite, but, should a disaster ever happen, your rime can be better utilized in disaster recovery than in locating a PC, printing multiple sets of the plan, and separating the continuous paper into usable documents for distribution.

<FONT SIZE=+6><B><CENTER>OBJECTIVES OF THE MIS CONTINGENCY PLAN</CENTER></B></FONT>

<BR><BR>
Organizations are becoming more dependent on the service and record-keeping of the data processing department. The overall objectives of the MIS Contingency Plan are to protect corporate resources and employees, to safeguard the organizations vital records of which the data center has become the custodian, and to guarantee the continued availability of essential MIS services. The role of this Plan in these objectives is to document the preagreed decisions and to design and implement a sufficient set of procedures for responding to a disaster that involves the data center and its services.
<BR><BR>
A disaster is defined as the occurrence of any event that causes a significant disruption in MIS capabilities. The central theme of the Plan is to minimize the effect a disaster will have upon on-going operations. This Plan responds to the most severe disaster, the kind that requires moving off site to a backup facility. Occurrences of a less severe nature are controlled at the appropriate management level as a part of the total Plan.
<BR><BR>

The basic approach, general assumptions, and sequence of events that need to be followed will be stated in the Plan. It will outline specific preparations prior to a disaster and emergency procedures immediately after a disaster. The Plan is your roadmap from disaster to recovery. As you follow it, you may choose at any time to take detours for various management reasons. However after the detour, you get back on the main road to recovery. The Plan will be distributed to all key personnel, and they will receive periodic updates. The general approach is to make the plan as threat-independent as possible. This means that it should be functional regardless of what type of disaster occurs. In order to limit your loss, it must provide for the logical restoring of all critical systems to a production status within 24 hours after the equipment is operational at either the home location or a backup site. By performing a risk/impact analysis, you can determine your potential dollar loss that will result from a major disaster.
<BR><BR>
For the recovery process to be effective, we have organized the Plan around the team concept. Each team has specific duties and responsibilities once the decision is made to invoke the disaster recovery mode. The captains of each team and their alternates are key MIS personnel. The Plan contains the phone numbers of the team members and represents a dynamic process that is kept up-to-date through updates, testing, and reviews. As recommendations are completed or as new areas of concern are recognized, the Plan will be updated reflecting the current status.

<FONT SIZE=+6><B><CENTER>ASSUMPTIONS OF THE MIS CONTINGENCY PLAN</CENTER>
</B></FONT>
<BR><BR>No matter how many precautions are implemented and to what extent they are enforced, most people in the data processing held agree that there are no completely secure computers. The operations of a data center could be suddenly disrupted by events we have little or no control over, involving people, mechanics, electronics, or natural disasters. It is important that you realize the exposure to your organization chat the loss of your data center would be, and that you take steps to minimize the costs resulting from loss or damage to its resources and capabilities, and the costs to the departments and customers it serves by their losses or a reduction in computer services. The computer room is the heart of a data center. Any threat in or near the computer room can affect the critical flow of information from this nerve center. The location of the disaster could be more important than the amount of damage it causes. A small problem at a critical location could cripple a data center and require it to reestablish operations at a backup facility.
<BR><BR>
This Plan assumes that a catastrophic event has severely crippled the data center, forcing it to reestablish full operations at a fully equipped backup facility. As soon as hardware can be installed in a cold site, processing will be moved from the backup facility to the less costly cold site. All applications will eventually be processed at the backup location, even those not classified as critical. Concurrent with the backup facility processing is the reconstruction of the original or alternate permanent facility, and the planning for the final move back to this site. Although this Plan follows the assumption of a catastrophic disaster, the Plan can be quickly altered to handle a less severe emergency as determined by management.
<BR><BR>
Two types of backup facilities are available, a cold site (shell) and a hot backup site. A cold site is an empty computer room normally equipped with raised floor, air-conditioning, electric power, and fire protection that is ready for the installation of computer hardware. The problems in relying only on a cold site for your backup are usually locating and installing the hardware. This generally takes the most time. A hot backup site, on the contrary, is a fully equipped and operational computer center, ready to be used by its members in the event of an emergency. The computer room is normally equipped with up-to-date hardware. The member schedules hands-on resting to process its applications on the backup hardware to ensure the validity of its Plan.
<BR><BR>
Many commerical hotsites offer many Disaster Recovery Services . It provides a number of scheduled testing periods each year as part of its contracted services agreement. These testing periods help keep the members Plan up-to-date by assuring that its applications process correctly at the backup facility. 
<BR><BR>
Many companies subscribe to both a hot backup site and a cold site. If the two backup facilities are adjacent to each other, it will enhance the recovery process. However, it is not necessary that both sites be at the same location. While emergency processing would be started and continued for a short time at the hot backup site, replacement hardware would be configured and delivered to the cold site. When the cold site becomes operational, processing would be switched from the hot backup site to the cold site. As soon as the members permanent facility is available, the hardware would be moved from the operational cold site to the members own facility.
<BR><BR>
As part of the initial start-up at the backup site, those systems defined as critical batch processing would be run first. Testing would be expanded until total recovery per your Plan is achieved.
<BR><BR>
By taking advantage of both the hot backup site and the cold site as outlined in the guidelines of the Plan, MIS personnel can restore production operations at their own facility in the shortest possible time following a catastrophic event.

Hon. James Lee Witt<br>
FEMA<br>
Building a Public/Private Partnership in Emergency Management</STRONG><br><IMG SRC="photos/jameslee.gif" align=right>
Disasters pose a threat to every segment of our nations communities-- individuals, home owners, utilities, small and large businesses, government services. For too long, our nations emergency management system has relied almost exclusively on government and volunteer groups to assist communities in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from disasters. The time has come for the business community to become a full partner in our nations emergency management system. Mr. Witt will discuss why the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is actively exploring opportunities to create a Public/Private Partnership for Emergency Management. <br>
  Mr. Witt has been director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) since April 6, 1993.

Tari Schreider<br>
Paranet, Inc.<br>
Developing a DRP On A Shoestring!</STRONG><br><IMG SRC="photos/toris.gif" align=right>
The vast majority of companies today cannot afford conventional backup and recovery strategies because of the high cost involved.

Year 2000: A Disaster in the Making?</STRONG><br><IMG SRC="photos/kennethv.gif" align=right>

Michael Mulholland<br>
SunGard Recovery Services, Inc.<br>
From Disaster Recovery to Information Recovery: The Dawning of a New Era</STRONG><br><IMG SRC="photos/michaelmu.gif" align=right>
As the year 2000 approaches, the way we process, utilize and depend on information is changing rapidly. More and more, we are becoming a data-driven society, what some have called a data-centric society. This reliance on information is causing disaster recovery professionals to refocus their strategies from protecting hardware and systems to providing continuous availability of mission-critical data.<br>
Mr. Mulholland is president and chief operating officer of SunGard Recovery Services, Inc. and responsible for overseeing the companys operations, product development, financial administration, sales, marketing and communications. Mr. Mulholland joined SunGard in 1987 as vice president for sales. <br>

<blockquote><p>
 You have been told, "You are the person who will be responsible for:  gathering a BIA together, write up a
 Business Contingency Plan, gathering Surveys about well known Vendors, gathering information about consultants."  But
 you don't know where to start.  Well let us be the first to introduce you to BIA AND BEYOND.  BIA AND BEYOND
 is the most talked about training Video to date.
<p>
Disaster Recovery Journal is debuting a series of training sessions on video which will act as a supplement for anyone interested in establishing or building upon a disaster recovery plan.
<p>
These innovative training tools will feature narration and information. The first video focuses on Business Impact Analysis and Beyond.  A workbook, especially designed for the video, will be included at no additional cost. This workbook will include all the forms necessary for gathering data and compiling a data analysis. Having the workbook provides easier understanding of the Business Impact Analysis.
<p>
Future topics will include Recovery Strategies, Plan Development,  Exercising the Plan, and other related subjects. All videos will include a workbook.
<p>
These videos provide an inexpensive, accessible way for all contingency planners to learn from an expert in the field. They are a must for anyone interested in furthering their disaster recovery knowledge. <P>

1996 Mainframe Software Survey</h1>

<br>



This survey addresses some issues to consider when purchasing a software package for mainframe computer systems. The survey does not include enough information to make a final selection; each package has its own strengths which cannot be assessed in a survey of this type. When selecting a mainframe software package, the most useful information comes from understanding your needs and discussing them with a company representative.<br><br>
The survey looks at these questions:<br><br>
Price Range/Maintenance: This is always the first question on everyones list, but comparing prices isnt necessarily a meaningful way to compare software. Prices vary drastically.<br><br>
Compatibility: Compatibility may be critical when it comes to importing an established plan or importing information from other files. You may be spared data re-entry if you can import existing files.<br><br>
Minimum base hardware configuration: This is the computer setup required to effectively run the program. Most of these package are PC-based, but some are also available for the Macintosh, and some are specifically for larger systems.<br><br>
Operating Systems: Like the hardware configuration, you must be able to match your existing system with the operating system required for the software.<br><br>
Recovery of systems or applications: This question addresses the products ability to recover data from systems and/or applications. This information should be considered when making a software choice.<br><br>
Recovery Critical Dependencies; This subject was covered in two questions. The first asks whether all critical dependencies can be recovered from systems. The second question asks whether the product can recover all critical dependencies of applications.<br><br>
Product Use Restrictions: Can the product be used during normal operations as well as a recovery? All vendors, except............,  responding answered yes to this question. Therefore the information is not included in the matrix.<br><br>
Other services: nearly all companies producing software also offer specialized consulting. A variety of other products and services are also available. This information is listed.<br><br>
For further information on products listed in the survey, please call the appropriate contact name for each company.<br><br>
To be listed in future mainframe software surveys, please contact the Disaster Recovery Journal to be added to our vendor mailing list.<br><br>

PC-Based Software Survey</h1>
<br><br>
This survey addresses some issues to consider when purchasing a software package. The survey does not include enough information to make a final selection; each package has its own strengths which cannot be assessed in a survey of this type. When selecting a software package, the most useful information comes from understanding your needs and discussing them with a company representative.<br><br>
The survey looks at these questions:<br><br>
Price Range/Maintenance: This is always the first question on everyones list, but comparing prices isnt necessarily a meaningful way to compare software. Prices vary drastically.<br><br>
Format: Most packages operate as a database, a word processor, or both. The relational database format is preferred for large or complex plans, because database maintenance is easier and more accurate. Establishing a plan may be easier on a word processing based package, and some information is best entered in a word processing format.<br><br>
Compatibility: Compatibility may be critical when it comes to importing an established plan or importing information from other files. You may be spared data re-entry if you can import existing files.<br><br>
Minimum base hardware configuration: This is the computer setup required to effectively run the program. Most of these package are PC-based, but some are also available for the Macintosh, and some are specifically for larger systems.<br><br>
Operating Systems: Like the hardware configuration, you must be able to match your existing system with the operating system required for the software.<br><br>
Risk/Impact Analysis: A good business impact analysis is an important step in developing an effective contingency plan. A program that includes an impact analysis can help you conduct one and keep it up to date. Some manufacturers offer impact analysis software as a separate package.<br><br>
Menu drive: Menu driven programs tend to be more user-friendly than those without menus, and so are often easier to use.
Other service: Nearly all companies producing software also offer specialized consulting. Using a consultant can help and may be necessary - to produce a good DR plan using the software package. The software is intended to facilitate developing a good plan, not to teach you how to do it.<br><br>
Some vendors offer both software and alternative site contracts. These software packages may work best or only be available with their alternative site plans.<br><br>
Virtually all these packages can be used on a LAN, although different licensing arrangements may apply.<br><br>

<font size=4><center><strong>ALTERNATE SITE SURVEY<br><br></center></font size></strong><font size=2>
With the growth of the disaster recovery industry, our survey of alternative site vendors has also grown. The comparative matrix on these following pages were compiled directly from responses to a set of surveys sent out to disaster recovery vendors.<br>
The categories address some of the issues pertinent to selecting an alternative site. The survey is not intended to give you all the criteria to select a site, but rather to determine which companies may be best suited to your company's needs.
An alternative site selection process only begins with examining the survey; the most important step is discussing your needs with a representative from those companies that interest you.<br><br>
The survey addresses these questions:<br>
Location: all locations where a hot site, cold site or office work recovery site is located.<br>

Host Mainframe & Midrange Computers/DASD Units/Tape Drives/Frontenal Processors/Dataline/Voice Lines: the equipment listed in these columns are available at some or all hot site locations. This information should be used to determine if a company supports your type of systems. Responses from different companies may not be directly comparable; contact a company representative for complete computer and communications configurations.<br>
Mobile Site: indicates availability of a computer-ready cold-site which can be transported to a desired location. Size and delivery time are also listed.<br>
Cold Site: indicates availability of a data processing site that is not pre-equipped with computer systems. Equipment and resources must be installed in such a facility to duplicate the critical business functions of an organization. Additional information details how well the site is equipped.<br>
Office Work Space: indicates availability of work areas for end-users. Office work space is usually used for critical business operations that are not data processing intensive, such as customer service. Available equipment is also listed.<br><br>
<hr><font  size=4><center>
To View the Survey you will need to<strong> Print all of the files out!</strong><br></center><br>
The survey is in a 2-page spread so the files on the right correspond to the files to the left of them in the table below.  They may be a little difficult to follow so I have added another company column on the right file in an attempt to clear up any confusion.   If you still have difficulties you can call our office at (314) 894-0276 or <a href="mailto:drj@mo.net">e-mail</a> us and we will fax you a copy of this survey.<br><br><br><center><blockquote>

With no other business items, the business session was formally closed.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>PROGRAM</STRONG><BR>
 - - - - - - - - - -<BR>
Part I  - Dave Perkins, Director, Operations Division, State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) gave an excellent presentation about his direct involvement of the International Eagle Flight #4184 that crashed in Roselawn, Indiana.  It was accompanied by graphic 'no-hold-barred' slides that left no survivors.<BR>
<BR>
He pointed some procedural things that were done wrong, and have since been corrected.   The interaction with the local fire department, local law enforcement agencies, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Guard, Highway Department, etc., was amazing.  And the stress on the recovery personnel was above any normal level.  I can only say, if you missed this presentation, you missed a real life situation.<BR>
<BR>
Part II  -  Alden Taylor, Director of Public Affairs, SEMA discussed his role assisting local sites with public information activities.  His slide presentation included which agency has control over a disaster event,  the cascade ripple effect from a disaster, emergency planning ideas, etc.  He also shed some light on how individuals and small business can obtain financial assistance   SEMA's role is to get resources to the disaster site; they do not take control of the disaster recovery efforts.  He provided some valuable information to include in your Disaster/Recovery Plan too.<BR>
<BR>
The meeting was adjourned at 3:45 PM.<BR>
<BR>
       Respectfully submitted by,<BR>

 <font size=6><strong>THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE</strong><p>
<font size=4>A SPECIAL REPORT FROM THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF<br>
<font size=3><i> by Richard L. Arnold, CDRP<br></i></center>
<img src="line.gif"><P>
<font size=3><blockquote>

<br><IMG SRC="sf-4.gif" img align=left WIDTH=50% HEIGHT=40% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> At 7:00 P.M. October 18, 1989, I sat down to watch the World Series, as many others did, when suddenly the channel went off the air.  Soon thereafter came a message stating that San Francisco just had an earthquake.  As time went on, they announced that the quake measured 7.0 on the Richter Scale and the bay bridge had collapsed.  They also mentioned an enormous amount of fires that occurred from gas explosions, and contended that this was a disaster of catastrophic proportions.  This was the big one that
 everyone has been predicting for a long time.  By this time I had a mental vision that San Francisco was about to break off into the ocean.  I then decided then to fly to San Jose to see the extent of the destruction firsthand.
<p>
I left Wednesday, October 19 for San Jose.  With the constant news updates relating the death and destruction that occurred in the afflicted areas, I was somewhat reluctant to go, not knowing to expect.  I kept calling the airlines to confirm that the airport was open.  One report said the San Jose airport was indeed open but the San Fransciso airport was closed due to cracks in the runway.
<p>
After I arrived in San Jose, I started inspecting the airport walls for cracks.  I soon discovered that neither the airport nor the houses in that area sustained any significant amount of damage.
<p>
Later after touring downtown San Francisco, which sustained limited damage to its business district relative to its overall size, as well as other areas that were supposed to be destroyed beyond recognition, I found nothing to substantiate the magnitude of destruction portrayed by different media.
<p>
By the end of my first full day in San Francisco, I discovered that most of the news reports on television were either misleading or else partially inaccurate.  For example, it was stated on Tuesday that the Bay Bridge would be fixed by Thursday; on Friday, the real word came out that it might be fixed within one to two months.  The press focused primarily on the loss of life and the homeless.
<p>
What the press didnt focus on was the impact that the quake had on businesses.  In the following paragraphs I will try to focus on these important issues.
<p>
The areas hardest hit were:<p>

<img src="cube.gif"> Watsonville <br>
<img src="cube.gif"> Los Gatos<br>
<img src="cube.gif"> San Fransisco <br>
<img src="cube.gif"> Oakland<br>
<img src="cube.gif"> Santa Cruz.  <br>
<p>
Watonsville lost their main business section due to the collapse of buildings and electricity; Los Gatos suffered approximately eight blocks of buildings with major stuctural damage in their business district; San Fransisco had power outages and window breakages; Oakland had approximately 10 blocks with structural damage: and Santa Cruz had approximately 12 square blocks of buildings with major structural damage, and over 50% of these will be on the demolition list.
<p>
The police had roped off the areas surrounding these business districts, and no one was allowed in.  The contents of some businesses were functionally intact, but the owners or employees were not allowed to cross the police line.  This meant immediate loss of revenue.  Imagine walking out of your building at 5:00 one day and not being allowed to return for a week or more.  I believe that most of the small to mid-size businesses affected by the quake may have to shut down for good because of the time it woul
d take for them to rebuild.  Not only will the business be lost, but hundreds of employees, many of whom have just endured private losses, will suddenly find themselves unemployed.
<p>
<font size=4>First 72 Hours<font size=3>
<p>
Cole Emerson, Senior Management Systems Consultant, SRI International, explained the effects that this disaster had on him and business in general:
<p>
<br><IMG SRC="sf-1.gif" img align=left WIDTH=50% HEIGHT=40% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>I was in my office with three other associates when the floor and walls began to shake violently.  I was standing in the doorway and yelled at everyone to get under a desk.  I then realized that I was not in the best of positions myself, so I quickly scrambled under a desk.  The irony was that the desk was moving across the floor so rapidly that I had a hard time even staying under it.  The walls were actually swaying back and forth and the windows were undulating.  It seemed to go on for 15 minutes, but w
e found out later it was only 15 seconds.
<p>
The utilities were the first to be affected by the quake.  Electricity and water were instantly cut off in most of the affected areas.  The problem was exacerbated by gas ruptures that further delayed the return of electricity.  Revenue losses occurred instantly due to electricity loss, police lines preventing entry into buildings, and absence of employees.
   <p>
When push comes to shove, employees give precedence to their domestic situation over their business.  This will almost inevitably include the person(s) in charge of the disaster recovery plan.  If a disaster similar to the California earthquake strikes your company, you may not have your allotted personnel there to pick up the pieces.  The only person who would put his company over is his family is a psychotic one, Emerson said.  I could not get my mind back on my job; I couldnt even begin to get focuse
d on my work until late Thursday night.
<p>
What was learned from this disaster is that no matter how comprehensive your disaster recovery plan is and how well it is understood by your employees, your workers will virtually abandon the business until they are certain that their domestic situation is secure.  Thus, you should appoint several alternates who can fill in if your critical employees are unavailable.  If you have employees in another state or a region that is not affected by the disaster, plan ahead for them to replace your indisposed worke
rs in the case of an emergency.
<p>
If you are using an alternate site for a backup to your business, include these out-of-town employees in your testing phase; make sure that they can restore the principal components of the company.  Also, be prepared to assist your key personnel in the personal realm as much as possible--that is, confirm that their families are safe, help them with housing accomodations if necessary, and help to look after their family for the duration of the disaster.  Once you take care of these considerations, the critic
al employees can focus on the job as quickly as possible.
<p>
<font size=4>The plan itself<font size=3>
<p>
Make sure the person(s) who has developed your particular plan has substantial credentials in the disaster recovery field.  Ideally, you want them to have experience with real disasters that have addressed broad issues of business operations, data processing, and telecommunications.  If the expert has no firsthand experience, make sure he has a sound knowledge and understanding of several past disasters of other companies and their aftermaths.  You, too, should be attuned to previous disasters and how they
were handled (or mishandled) by other companies.  Ultimately, a lack of competency in the plan will almost be as dangerous as none at all, for it will give a false sense of security and the financial life of the organization will be at risk.
<p>
Because disaster recovery planning is still a relatively new idea, most plans have yet to reach the stage where they are as good as they could be.  As the certification process continues to evolve and standards become stricter and more defined, you will have higher quality plan.  But for now, be shrewd in your decision--when you go to select a consultant or an automated Disaster Recovery plan, remember that the automated plan is only as good as the expert who developed it, said Emerson.
 <p>
<font size=4>A Corporate Perspective<font size=3>
<p>
Tom vonNovak, President of the Northern California chapter of the Association of Contingency Planners (ACP), tells how he was on the 17th floor of his 20 story office building when the quake struck at 5:04.  Although the building swayed 1 1/2-2 feet during those fateful 15 seconds, it escaped relatively unscathed.  The adjoining building, however, was immediately condemned...thefront of the building was maybe ten feet out into the street and all the bricks and mortar were completely down, vonNovak says.
Within fifteen minutes, the building was cleared and there were thousands of people on the street not knowing what to do.
<p>
Due to the immediacy and magnitude of this earthquake, several unanticipated adjustments had to be taken into account in response to the emergency.  The sudden loss of communications is a prime example of what happened in California, and what could well happen elsewhere.  Even if your company has its network backed up with T1 for its data circuits, it may be that, with the phone lines down, no one can make the essential call that will activate the recovery process.
<p>
Another unexpected element could be the extent of the long term losses, particularly for small to medium-size corporations.  They may not have the resources to withstand a long outage; a San Francisco newspaper article estimated that in the stricken areas of Northern California, up to 25% of the smaller companies will be forced to close their doors.
<p>
<font size=4>Financial Impacts on Bay Area<font size=3>
<p>
As of Sunday October 22, 1989, the estimated damages had climbed to over $9 billion.  This figure can be roughly broken down into two categories:  immediate property damages, estimated at $4.1 billion, and business interruption damages, estimated at $5 billion.
<p>
Another important economic factor that cannot be overlooked is the relocation factor.  VonNovak explained that this as a reevaluation of where a company is doing business and how much theyre going to lose should that general area become temporarily inoperable.  Essentially, this refers to the loss of productivity resulting from the actual shutdown of the facility and the subsequent reduced productivity because employees do not report for work.  This may be because employees cannot reach their workplace o
r other economic factors.  For example, the collapsed bridge was a vital artery linking the East Bay area with downtown San Francisco.  Suddenly, approximately 200,000 daily commuters must find an alternate route to travel to work.  For now, a ferry will take up the slack: however, this will cost each person $8.00 a day as opposed to a $2.00 toll for the bridge.
<p>
<font size=4>What We Can Learn From This Disaster<font size=3>
<p>
<br><IMG SRC="sf-2.gif" img align=left WIDTH=60% HEIGHT=50% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>Both executives and their employees can gain valuable hindsight from the California earthquake.  Before a disaster strikes, executives must allocate sufficient funds to ensure the safety not only of their individual employees, but also of the organization itself.  Ideally, the disaster recovery planner should have direct contact with senior management, rather than filtering information through corporate channels.
<p>
Employees should know exactly where they stand in case of a disaster such as an earthquake.  They should be aware of the compensations to which they are entitled in case of a disaster, and be certain that there is a clear understanding as to the exact nature of such compensation.
<p>
<font size=4>Company Planning<font size=3>
<p>
As you reevualate your plan, keep these questions in mind:  <p>
<img src="cube.gif"> Is your plan up to date?  <br>
<img src="cube.gif"> How often do you test it?  <br>
<img src="cube.gif"> Does your plan have alternates to your key employees to the plan?  <br>
<img src="cube.gif"> Have you considered all aspect of communications?  <br>
<img src="cube.gif"> What would happen if an extended outage occurs?  <br>
<img src="cube.gif"> What exactly do you expect from your test?  <br>
<p>
Statistics from 3 years ago said that only 5% of all corporations have plans.  Today that figure has risen to 43%.  That still leaves a considerable number of companies unprepared for the worst.  Furthermore, of the 43% with plans, only an estimated 60% have tested them.
<p>
If you are without a plan, estimate how long it would take recover without one.  The cost for recovery without a plan will increase exponentially versus the cost with one.  In addition just having a plan is not enough; it is useless to discover that your plan is insufficient or somehow lacking when it is tested under fire.
<p>
<font size=4>Building Codes<font size=3>
<p>
It seems that the one common denominator in the damaged areas was that none of them had reinforced masonry.  The pictures in this article were from Los Gatos, and Santa Cruz.  San Francisco has had building codes in effect for over 10 years now and it seems that it has paid off.  The loss of life was minimal due to these strict codes.
<p>
<br><IMG SRC="sf-3.gif" img align=left WIDTH=40% HEIGHT=60% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>If an earthquake of that magnitude hit St. Louis, Missouri, the death toll would be much higher.  A major portion of the city is unreinforced masonry.  In fact my own chruch is only 9 years old and it is not reinforced at all.  I dont think the building codes in St. Louis are as strict with regard to earthquakes, and the state and local governments are not as prepared for earthquakes, as Northern California.  I am mentioning St. Louis, because I live here and are familar with the city.  St. Louis, is not th
e only one with this condition.  Memphis, Tennessee is closer to the New Madrid Fault line than we are, and they are in the same shape we are.  Many towns in Missouri and Tennessee would fall in the same catagory as St. Louis.
<p>
Now that I am back in St. Louis, I am going to use my experiencefrom the Bay area, and safegard the welfare of my family.  I plan on purchasing earth quake insurance Monday.

 <font size=6><strong>HURRICANE ANDREW</strong><p>
<font size=4>The Human Side of Hurricane Recovery<br>
<font size=3><i> by Richard L. Arnold, CDRP Editor-In-Chief, Disaster Recovery Journal<br></i></center>

<br><IMG SRC="andrew-1.gif" img align=left WIDTH=35% HEIGHT=48% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>

1992 has been a horrible year for disasters of all kinds. Earthquakes, riots, floods and now hurricanes have caused unprecedented damage.  Unlike the Chicago Flood, business' biggest disaster ever, Hurricane Andrew wreaked a terrible human toll.
<p>
Although many businesses suffered physical and financial losses from the hurricane, the vast human crisis has complicated recovery plans. Even relatively unaffected companies with recovery plans in place have struggled because their employees were hit so hard by the disaster.
<p>
The hurricane missed the Miami business district by 20 miles, sparing many businesses from the destruction. South Florida's residential areas, however, have been completely levelled. Many residents are homeless, even more have been stripped of basic resources.
<p>
These victims are understandably more concerned about their families and their survival than they are about their jobs. People are looking for a place to live; most are too traumatized to do anything else. This vast regional disaster underscores the responsibility companies have to their employees when developing contingency plans.
<p>
Rodney Hargroder presided over a successful recovery at Premier Bank in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Hargroder learned,  We had a basic assumption in our disaster recovery plan that staff would be available for recovery, but we had some no-shows at the Emergency Operations Center. At one point, we had one person staffing our data center.
<p>
For companies in south Florida, personnel problems were worse. Organizations could not communicate with or even locate many employees. Bell South's first priority after the disaster was finding employees and helping their families recover. By mobilizing corporate emergency resources, Bell South tried to meet the survival needs of its employees, providing food, supplies and crisis trauma counseling.
<p>
Two civic groups who provided assistance were the Brotherhood Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention of Memphis, Tenn., and the Texas Baptist Men of Dallas, Texas. These two groups were already moving into Florida and Louisiana preparing relief efforts as the hurricane was approaching and later responded to the devastation in Hawaii. These relief and recovery teams used Global Water Technologies water purification systems and power generators in conjunction with mobile kitchens to provide for people
in emergency situations.
<p>
A growing number of organizations are developing corporate-wide contingency plans which address regional disasters and personnel emergencies. A safe data center is of little use if no one is there to run it.
<p>
The other articles in this special report come from other members of the disaster recovery community who were involved in the recovery from Hurricane Andrew. Lessons learned from yet another disaster can help us all to be better prepared for the future.
<p>
<hr size=10>
<font size=5>Nation's Costliest Disaster<p>
<br>
<font size=3><i>By Mike Tobin, CDRS</i><p>
<hr size=10>
<br>
<br><IMG SRC="andrew-2.gif" img align=left WIDTH=35% HEIGHT=48% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>By almost any traditional measure, Hurricane Andrew was the worst natural disasters in disaster recovery history. In addition to the staggering human cost, the valuation of destroyed property was the largest in United States history.  At the time of this special report, thousands of individuals and families remain homeless, with no prospects for returning home within weeks; it may be years before life returns to normal in this stricken area.
<p>
From a business continuity perspective, Hurricane Andrew ranks among the major recovery events in history. A large number of companies lost computing capability and many had to relocate to recovery centers in order to continue business operations. In at least one way, however, Hurricane Andrew was not as devastating as it could have been. Its point of landfall in Florida lies a mere twenty miles south of the heavy concentration of large data centers in Miami. Had Andrew struck Miami directly, the damage to
computing capability would have been far greater.
<p>
As it was, CDRS received nine disaster declarations from seven companies, ranking Hurricane Andrew the third largest multiple recovery event in the company's history. One major customer, John Alden Life Insurance Company, ran its processing from a recovery facility for 15 days. While it was challenging, this recovery typified the advantages a well prepared, well tested company has in dealing with such events. John Alden had in place a well detailed hurricane recovery plan which provided for the forwarding o
f data and people to a recovery site prior to the storm impact. The recovery ran smoothly for its entire 15 days.
<p>
Another factor which may have softened the business impact of Hurricane Andrew is the predictability of hurricanes relative to other types of disasters. Many of our customers undertook advance preparations for the storm, aligning people and data away from the projected impact area. While most of these companies never actually switched their processing to the recovery site, they were able to effectively run in parallel for the duration of their crisis.
<p>
Running parallel operations was more prevalent in the storm's second phase in Louisiana and Texas, where the damage was substantially lower. Experiences from previous hurricanes (Hugo and Gilbert) proved valuable for recovery vendors and subscribers alike.
<p>
Of course, there was a human side to the recovery as well. Many of those individuals involved in the recovery spent time away from their homes and families during a time of extreme psychological uncertainty. The performance of these people under fire was truly admirable. In several cases where customer staff were physically unable to relocate due to the impact of the storm, they were replaced on site by CDRS staff, to insure successful recovery.
<p>
CDRS wishes to salute the entire South Florida business community for their effort and resilience under very trying circumstances.

<font size=5>Wind, Water & Devastation<br>
<font size=4>Restoration Priorities Meet Hurricane Andrew<br>
<font size=3><i>By Pat Williams Moore, BMS CATASTROPHE</i><p>
<hr size=10>
"The best laid plans of mice and men..." would find it a struggle to deal with Andrew's wrath and the damage it left in its wake. The psychological and financial scars will be felt by the people who suffered its effects for many years.
<p>
<br>
<br><IMG SRC="andrew-3.gif" img align=left WIDTH=35% HEIGHT=48% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>As our physical operation centers in threatened areas were "battening down the hatches" in addition to preparing to respond to customer needs, our BMS CAT Catastrophe team moved into northern Florida on Sunday, September 23. Knowing from past experience that airports and highways would soon be closed, our Team took emergency and restoration supplies and moved into these outlying areas so that response time would be minimized.
<p>
Our supply trucks carrying generators, fuel, radios, cellular phones, emergency lighting equipment, ladders, chain saws, dehumidifiers, corrosion control kits, restoration chemicals, drinking water, emergency supplies of food and first-aid kits rolled out to supply and distribution points in selected areas so that they could move in as quickly as possible.
<p>
Once the storm moved out and it was safe to drive further south toward Miami. Driving south we saw uprooted trees, twisted road signs, broken billboards and intermittent roof damage. Once we reached south Miami, the devastation was much worse, roofs torn off, road signs missing completely, landmark building locations blown away and power lines down. Even the concrete poles holding the main power lines were snapped off.
<p>
Traffic lights, dangling perilously close to the cars were not working, police barricades were everywhere and traffic was backed up for miles. Unless you could prove you had a hotel reservation, a security pass or an emergency contractor permit, it was almost impossible to get through security check points.
<p>
An important factor in disaster recovery plans, especially for dealing with a "community-wide" disaster, is to include directions to your facilities that do not necessarily depend on road or highway signs, because those signs may not exist after the incident occurs. Landmark buildings, such as a specific gas station on a corner where you are to turn right, may no longer exist. It may sound strange, but if the signs are missing, how do you find your client's building which may have the address sign missing?
Getting to and from different locations could take hours due to the traffic and debris. Vendors and insurance adjusters who did not house their personnel early enough after the disaster had trouble finding hotel rooms, and some hotels had no power and/or no water for at least the first week after the hurricane. Those who were able to find hotels with power and water were usually as far away as Fort Lauderdale.
<p>
The initial stages of restoration involved removing debris, cutting away fallen trees, removing water and dehumidifying facilities. Generators and sufficient fuel were critical.
<p>
Restoring facilities and their contents damaged by Hurricane Andrew resembled a battlefield triage operation. Our normal access to affected electronics, telecommunications, documents and media were severely hampered by extensive debris, structural collapse, highly corrosive salt water, lack of power and negligible support services. Removing debris and water, acquiring emergency power, clearing corridors and lowering the relative humidity were our first priorities.
<p>
Compared to damage from fresh water, after which equipment can often be successfully restored, the pervasive salt water and high humidity could quickly reduce success levels. It was imperative to get to those areas of the building where critical equipment and components were in operation or stored, and to apply emergency corrosion control procedures as quickly as possible. Separating the equipment that could possibly be saved had to be done immediately. Prioritizing thousands of pieces of equipment was a cr
ucial function for the project management team.
<p>
Innovative project managers removed equipment from the damaged area and temporarily erected a substitute clean room environment. In many cases where the machines were not restorable, the hard drives could be cleaned and the data retrieved.
Archival documents, vital records and critical work in progress were scattered everywhere. Rusted filing cabinets, overturned racks and shelves, documents wadded up in blocks where the water had receded from them and bound volumes filled with debris and sewage were prevalent throughout the affected buildings. What was important and cost effective to save?
<p>
Even for those companies who had prioritized their records and work in progress, access to these documents and media was critical before mold and mildew appeared. Refrigeration trucks would serve as emergency freezing units, pending freeze-drying.
Soon after Hurricane Andrew, a water main broke in New York, flooding basements and vital record storage areas, tornadoes devastated areas of Wisconsin, a major institution in the Northeast was heavily damaged by fire, and Hurricane Iniki hit Hawaii. These disasters have further tested contingency plans and recovery operations, adding to what is perhaps the worst year for disasters in history.

<font size=5>Hurricane Andrew<p>
<font size=4The Mother of All Disasters<p>
<font size=3><i> By John Nevola, ISSC</i><p>
<hr size=10>
<br>
<br><IMG SRC="andrew-4.gif" img align=left WIDTH=35% HEIGHT=48% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>No one knew of Saturday, August 22, 1992, that Hurricane Andrew would turn out to be the largest natural disaster in the nation's history. No one could predict that it would supersede Hurricane Hugo as the costliest disaster ever and cause over five times the damage of that 1989 storm.
<p>
At the IBM Business Recovery Services (BRS) "war room" in Tampa, Florida, activity kicked into high gear that Saturday. As one of the primary large and mid-range systems backup hot sites, Tampa would serve as the focal point for all customers calls, alerts and disaster declarations. A duty team of highly skilled specialists in various technical disciplines toiled through the night making technical assessments, plotting the path of the storm, evaluating options and planning for the various scenarios that were likely to unfold.
<p>
Recovery center staff created maps listing the locations of all customers in the storm's path. They made contact with local emergency management organizations. Subscribers started calling to advise IBM of their status and intentions or to put us on alert. Equipment, particularly network gear, was checked and packaged for shipment. Communication links were check out to the eleven other IBM Area Recovery Centers. Finally, key IBM executives were contacted and informed of the situation and status. Having done
all that could be done by way of preparation, the teams braced and awaited the storm.
<p>
While BRS teams toiled to assist Florida customers already in the throes of business recovery, the storm raged across the Gulf of Mexico and teams of experts in Texas and Louisiana were completing preparation and contact for customers in those areas. The two hurricane landfalls were two major disasters, separated by less than 48 hours.
<p>
When it was all over, there were an estimated 33 declarations in the industry, 17 of them handled by IBM Business Recovery Services. The customers that BRS serviced were from Florida, Louisiana and Texas. Many major industries were affected including banking, health care, financial, wholesale, chemical, transportation, data processing and travel.
<p>
As power was restored, the recovered customers returned to their home sites, wiser for the experience and more resolute in their efforts to assure recoverability in the future. Beyond the sheer magnitude of Hurricane Andrew, the business recovery lessons learned did not reveal any surprises. Non-subscribers still endeavored to avail themselves of recovery centers and services at the last minute and, unfortunately, had to be turned away. Some customers regretted not testing and updating their plans more freq
uently and returned home determined to exercise their plans more vigorously in the future. While none of these problems turned out to be show stoppers, they made some recovery efforts lengthier and more complex than necessary.
<p>
The same lessons apply: have a plan and exercise it regularly. Be confident that your hot site vendor has the skills, experience and depth of resources to assure that you can successfully recover.
<p>
Andrew won't soon be forgotten. It has again reminded us how fragile humankind is in the face of nature's wrath. Even with warning, little could have been done to reduce the devastation. It is likely that building codes in south Florida will become more stringent in the future and that measures will be taken to assure a complete social recovery as well as to minimize the impact of a reoccurrence.
<p>
Companies in affected areas will mimic these actions in an effort to strengthen their own business recovery posture. They will be better prepared in the future for having suffered through Andrew.
<p>
But somehow I can't help but feel that some, particularly those in unaffected areas, will again ignore the lessons of a recent disaster and do nothing differently. And there remains that bothersome and nagging feeling that there are far worse disasters awaiting us out there, somewhere in the future.
