<h1>My Wal-Mart 'tis of thee</h1>

<font size=1>CULPEPER, VIRGINIA</font><p>
THIS is not the standard Wal-Mart story. The standard story is about the noisy protests when the world's biggest retailer moves into a small American community. In January 1995, for example, Wal-Mart opened one of its giant new Supercenters on the outskirts of Culpeper, a quaint town in a lovely part of north-western Virginia. Culpeper is a friendly place, where visitors are greeted warmly and waitresses call customers "honey" and "sweetie". It also prides itself on its heritage, from its historic town centre to its role in both the American revolution and the civil war. In Culpeper, as elsewhere, many locals saw Wal-Mart as a threat to the very fabric of American life.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But to get a sense of American life, there is now no better place than a Supercenter. While Bill Clinton's famous bridge to the 21st century is still in the planning stages, the arguably more significant monument of another (adopted) Arkansan, Wal-Mart's late founder, Sam Walton, is already in place. To walk into the Culpeper Wal-Mart, past the red lawnmowers and log-splitting machines lined up outside, is to enter a living museum of modern America--open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first impressions are obvious but overwhelming. The place, like the country, is big. The Supercenter spreads over 201,000 square feet, the size of four American football fields. Man (or, in this instance, a young woman) resorts to technology to conquer distance: she is employed to whizz around on roller-skates, fetching and returning goods. To judge from the variety of customers--of all colours--the space is a giant melting-pot. This is a place where people from trailer parks mingle with people from designer homes, just as a couple of cappuccino-makers are on sale alongside the ordinary coffee machines. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sense of abundance (some 100,000 different product lines) evokes Bill Clinton's phrase, "the age of possibility". Attached to the handle of each shopping trolley is an electronic calculator, together with a little advertisement for some product or other. Some slogans posted around the store stress value for money ("We sell for less", or "Wal-Mart. Always the low price"); others speak to a lofty idealism. Here, a basic right is not merely the pursuit of happiness, but its attainment ("You Must Be Satisfied. Our Policy Guarantees It!"). Patriotism is prized ("We Buy American Whenever We Can. So You Can, Too. Together We Can Do It."). So is local boosterism ("Virginia Proud. Wal-Mart Salutes Our Neighbours Who Make the Products You Buy."). There is also a preachy environmentalism ("Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. Together We Can Make a Difference."). A note on the signs points out that they are made out of 89.3% reprocessed plastic.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Wal-Mart, as in America, the tension between competing values can be fascinating. Patriotism, for example, is not always compatible with the commitment to low prices. By the stacks of fishing rods--at least 80 different types--a salesman explains to a customer that, although Wal-Mart really tries to buy American, "when it comes to quality and price, they're going to buy whatever's better." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just as striking is the clash between the cultures of fitness and of gluttony. The sports section is one of the biggest. There are exercise machines, vast numbers of bicycles and equipment for just about every sport. Tellingly, the space devoted to soccer balls is now about as big as that for American footballs, although basketballs are way ahead of both. Yet over at the food market customers are lured towards an offer of 24 glazed doughnuts for $3. Doughnuts and other indulgences help to explain why the busiest section for women's clothes is the one selling so-called Plus sizes. "There are a lot of big women in Culpeper," says the saleswoman there. Plenty of them can be seen with trolleys at Wal-Mart. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most intriguing of all is the juxtaposition of extreme freedom and Orwellian controls. On the freedom side, take the ease of buying guns. Wal-Mart's gun counter is below a display--duly credited to Lacy's Taxidermy of Culpeper--of two stuffed deer heads, a bear's head, a bass, an otter and a duck. Two dozen rifles and shotguns are on display in a glass case, the cheapest model priced at $74.67. The counter is constantly busy with customers, all men, occasionally in camouflage jackets.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Buying a gun is little harder than signing up at the local Blockbuster video store. All you need is a photo <font size=-1>ID</font> with a Virginia address, plus a second document (a utilities bill, say, or a cheque book) with the same address. The store charges $2 for a call to the state police for a background check, which may take 45 minutes or less ("I got one this morning that took all of five seconds," says a salesman, who also volunteers that handguns, although not on sale over the counter, can be ordered within a week). Customers are reminded that they need pay only 10% straight away, with the balance due within 60 days. So it is possible to walk away with a lethal weapon within minutes for about what it costs to buy a compact disc.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the compact disc section, meanwhile, words and images are considered too dangerous to be sold without prior vetting and, where necessary, censorship. A young customer, complaining that megastores "suck" but that there is nowhere else nearby to buy music, points out that the artwork of Nirvana's "In Utero" has been adjusted so as to obscure the fetuses on the original version, and the title of one of the songs has been changed from "Rape Me" to "Waif Me". Other discs are marked "Sanitised for your protection". A recent <i>New York Times</i> article reported that the mere prospect of being kept out of Wal-Mart, America's biggest retailer of pop music, is sometimes enough to make artists tone down their output. An outraged media critic, Jon Katz of HotWired, has called on freedom-lovers to boycott Wal-Mart stores. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Protectiveness towards children and the elderly, prominent themes in the 1996 election campaign, are Wal-Mart themes too. A notice board for The Missing Children's Network has details of lost or abducted children from Honolulu to Florida ("We never stop trying to bring them home," the store boasts). At the pharmacy, a notice apologises to retired federal employees for a new 20% charge by the insurers on their prescriptions, and tells them to protest against the charge: the Medicare controversy in microcosm.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other social issues are alluded to in the application forms for people wanting to work at Wal-Mart, which employs more than 600,000 Americans. Applicants are informed that they must undergo a drug test, unless this is prohibited by state law. They must also be able to prove their legal right to work in America.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 450 or so employees in the Culpeper store are disproportionately female, as is increasingly the case in the new American economy. They are also unfailingly friendly and helpful. Wal-Mart staff, known as "associates", are encouraged to practise the "ten-foot attitude" preached by Sam Walton: anybody coming within ten feet of a customer should look him in the eye, greet him and ask if they can help him. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Forms and a ballot box at the service desk enable customers to choose the "most helpful associate". So Wal-Mart customers can not only shop but vote, as well as go to the bank, the hairdresser, the optician, the McDonald's franchise. One of the few things they cannot find there is a church. When it comes to religion, the competition is simply too great, with more than 100 Baptist and Southern Baptist churches alone listed in Culpeper County.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the store does sell bibles--Catholic ones, Protestant ones, bibles with big type for senior citizens and "special interest" bibles for "children of colour". And for many, Wal-Mart has become an integral part of the Sunday ritual. The place is quiet before noon on Sundays, says a chatty check-out lady; but "right after church, we really get busy."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like America itself, Sam Walton's monument excites strong reactions. People are wary of this superpower. They mistrust its motives, fear its cultural clout, deride its brashness and scoff at its contradictions. Yet they also marvel at its convenience and admire its success. And, as with America, the people keep coming.<br>

<p><b>India and Russia</b></p>
<h1>Brothers in arms</h1>

<font size=1>DELHI</font><p>
THE old Delhi-Moscow defence relationship has been revived after a gap of five years. Last weekend, India decided to buy 40 <font size=-1>SU-30</font> fighter aircraft for $1.8 billion. More could follow. Russia has also offered to sell India jet trainers, an aircraft carrier, submarines, tanks and howitzers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For some 30 years, India depended on the Soviet Union for most of its arms. Both countries had a common foe in China, and the men in Moscow offered India arms at low prices, as well as cheap credits. They also took payment in rupees. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, so did the defence relationship. The new Russian state was hard up and insisted on payment in dollars. Moreover, deliveries were delayed, and India concluded that Russia could not be relied on as a supplier.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russia now seems more settled, and it has completed deliveries of an old order for ten <font size=-1>M</font>i<font size=-1>G-29</font>s. Its prices have gone up, but are still lower than those of comparable western arms. Last year the two countries started negotiations, and India chose the <font size=-1>SU-30</font> as the aircraft for its air force in the coming decade. The Rao government made an advance payment in dollars and now the United Front government has confirmed the order. After initial purchases of the <font size=-1>SU-30</font>, India is likely to produce under licence another five to six squadrons, each with 20 aircraft, with Russian technical assistance. And it is likely to buy 70 to 100 <font size=-1>M</font>i<font size=-1>G-AT</font> jet trainers, which have many features in common with the <font size=-1>SU-30</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since its financial crisis of 1991, India has slashed defence spending. Expensive defence purchases in the 1980s were one reason for the 1991 crunch. Pakistan was getting military aid from America, and India wanted the capability to take on both Pakistan and China. But the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan ended American arms aid to Pakistan. At the same time the collapse of the Soviet Union hit supplies to India, and the two armies rusted in unison.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;India's senior officers have complained for years that they need to modernise ageing equipment. Besides, the air force has lost 82 aircraft in crashes since April 1993, mainly because of pilot errors and birds (birds sucked into engines have brought down more aircraft than India has lost in warfare). Now that India's budget deficit has come down from 8.3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> in 1991 to 5.5%, the defence chiefs believe their chances are better.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The cheapest option is to upgrade the avionics and weaponry of India's old <font size=-1>M</font>i<font size=-1>G-21</font> squadrons (mostly made domestically). At first, India approached America for this, but was turned down. Indian defence chiefs believe this proves that America is biased towards Pakistan, and reckon therefore that Russia, with all its limitations, is a more reliable partner. Besides, the Russians have agreed that India will maintain and repair Russian aircraft being supplied to Malaysia. This helps.<br>

<h1>Russia eyes the world</h1>

<font size=1>MOSCOW</font><p>
<p><b>Under the guidance of its foreign minister, Yevgeny Primakov, Russia has been carving out a tougher yet more pragmatic foreign policy</b></p><br>
THE main surprise about Russian foreign policy is that Russia seems at last to be arriving at one. After years in which anything seemed possible, two main principles are beginning to emerge. First, expect no more concessions that further diminish Russia's assets and influence, such as they are. Second, expect Russia to be warier of embarking on fresh adventures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the West, the first of those principles--"no concessions"--is clearly the less attractive. It means Russia will stand by dangerous or dubious friends such as Iraq, Iran and Serbia. It promises a harshness towards countries of the former Soviet Union in which Russia feels its interests are not being recognised or fully protected. It implies a willingness to court public friction with America, still the only power against which Russia likes to measure itself. Russia's widespread hostility to <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s planned expansion is but one expression of such friction-courting. It has been evident, too, in the refusal so far of Russia's Duma, its lower house of parliament, to ratify the <font size=-1>START-2</font> arms-reduction treaty with America.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russia's resurgent nationalism that has fostered this renewed readiness to say <i>Nyet</i> has been enhanced both by a year of election campaigning and by the illness of President Boris Yeltsin. For until and unless he recovers fully from his recent heart operation, an early presidential election will seem possible and would-be successors will go on outbidding each other in jingoism.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The latest and biggest victim of this crude Russian mood has been Ukraine. This month, hope for an end to the long-running argument over the division of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet was yet again dashed when the Duma decided that Ukraine must cede sovereignty of the Crimean port of Sebastopol to Russia rather than agree to lease it. At the last minute Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, called off a visit to Kiev, Ukraine's capital, for fear of being branded "the man who lost Sebastopol".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second principle Russia seems to have adopted--"no adventures"--is better news for the rest of the world. It was tested last month when General Alexander Lebed, briefly Russia's national security adviser, pressed for Russia to stoke up resistance in northern Afghanistan to the new Taliban government in Kabul. But he was talked down by Yevgeny Primakov, a former spymaster who became Russia's foreign minister in January. In the combustible Caucasus, where Russia has already "persuaded" governments to let it keep military bases (in Georgia and Armenia), Mr Primakov is treading warily. As for Chechnya, though still technically a domestic matter as it is constitutionally part of the Russian Federation, most Russian ministers probably accept--not publicly, of course--that the rebel republic will slide away into independence.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new sense of coherence--and of limitation--in Russia's diplomacy is largely Mr Primakov's work. Not that he thinks Russia should do less abroad. Rather, he is taking a more realistic view of the slimmer means at its disposal. His main aim is to persuade the world that Russia is a great power that is passing through a mere phase of weakness--from which other countries would try to profit at their peril.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To help sustain that illusion it is essential for Russia to avoid the sort of sabre-rattling and even sabre-drawing that serve more to advertise its weakness. Whereas Russia's generals, including this week the defence minister, Igor Rodionov, have blown hot and cold on <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s expansion, Mr Primakov has opposed it consistently and relentlessly, but without threatening any specific retaliation should it occur, as it probably will.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Primakov's command of this delicate issue--the main focus of Russia's diplomatic engagement this year with America and the West--has reflected his authority within the Russian government. The foreign ministry is back in charge. Its revived professionalism has won Mr Primakov steadily improving reviews abroad, even from western sceptics horrified at first by his previous job as boss of the Russian foreign intelligence service, and by his 25-year friendship with Saddam Hussein. At home, too, Mr Primakov has a surprisingly wide range of admirers. His background gave him credibility from the outset with communists and nationalists. His pragmatism has since given liberals little to carp at. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Mr Yeltsin's failing heart put him in hospital at the start of his second term in July, Mr Primakov's globe-trotting barely faltered. That signalled a huge change from the days of Andrei Kozyrev, his less wily predecessor, who, lacking friends in government and Duma alike, ended up as little more than a presidential messenger. When even Mr Yeltsin disowned him, as he did from time to time, foreign governments were left thoroughly confused about Russian foreign policy and who was making it.Where Russia can get away with it, its policy in the "near abroad"--the bits of the former Soviet Union that Russia lost--can be pretty rough, with the foreign ministry often content to see the Duma do the bullying. Ukraine is not the only former Soviet state still feeling the heat. Moldova, which does not even share a frontier with Russia, is another. This month the Duma declared the Russian-occupied Transdniestria, sandwiched between Moldova's main body and its border with western Ukraine, a "zone of special strategic interest"--and demanded that Russia's 14th Army should stay there permanently. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over Belarus, too, Russia's empire rebuilders have been smirking. Not that Russia can afford to draw this troubled republic fully back into its orbit. But Mr Yeltsin has been happy to play cat-and-mouse with President Alexander Lukashenka, politely noting his ambition to unite the country with Russia without actually helping him to achieve his aim. All the same, Russia, and especially its raucous Duma, sees virtue in Mr Lukashenka: the more unstable and oppressive Belarus becomes, the less it will attract the West as a strategic partner.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In some places, Russia's harsh diplomacy has actually lowered tension--by grinding down other countries into settling on Russia's terms. This month, for instance, Mr Primakov gave his nod to a border treaty with Estonia, which, chilled by the thought of dealing with a President Lebed or a President Zyuganov, withdrew its main demands. Latvia seems ready to follow suit--though Russia's Duma may yet make trouble. Stubbornness is also winning Russia ground in the struggle for control of the Caspian and its oil pipelines.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This week Mr Primakov turned his attention to Russia's Pacific neighbours. On a visit to Japan, he proposed that the two countries should set aside their dispute over ownership of the southern Kurile islands (the Northern Territories, as Japan calls them) and jointly promote investment there. Japan said it would think about it--and freed $500m in soft loans to Russia that had been frozen for five years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Next stop for Mr Primakov was China, a still trickier conundrum for Russia, which cannot decide whether to view its teeming neighbour as its greatest prospective ally or as its enemy. Russia even half-fears the Chinese investment it is publicly courting, lest China gain too much of an interest in the sparsely populated and mineral-rich Russian Far East. For all Mr Primakov's talk earlier this year of seeking a foreign policy that is more "balanced" between east and west, Russia so far seems merely to be temporising.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such jostling at Russia's Siberian end does not much alarm Western Europe or America. Russia, for sure, is a power in Asia. The sooner it and Japan come to an accommodation, the better for both. And it may be no bad thing if a would-be expansionist China has an ungainly but equally big neighbour breathing heavily down its northern neck.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more ticklish area is still Russia's western flank. But there most of the old Warsaw Pact satellites are growing stronger by the day; there is little that Russia can do about it. So long as Russia does not threaten the independence of the Baltic states or Ukraine, and does not too flagrantly fan the flames under the Caucasus cauldron, western governments are not likely to complain much about what Russia does elsewhere in its former empire.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, a big worry is that, even under Mr Primakov's relatively sophisticated tutelage, Russia seems unable to break free of its view of the world as a sort of zero-sum game in which countries become strong only by making other countries weak. In the near abroad, where it counts for something, Russia pursues that logic with hard cynicism. Presumably, it would do the same in the more distant abroad if it only had the chance. Mr Primakov is calm, he is calculating, he can be amusing. But there is something chilling in his Lubyanka-tinted eyes.<br>

<p><b>British Museum</b></p>
<h1>Poverty in the treasure-house</h1>

"A SENSATIONAL piece of marketing" is how Lindsay Stainton, former curator of the British Museum's prints and drawings, describes the decision 243 years ago to open a collection of artefacts to the public and call it "the British Museum". And it works. While Londoners regard the <font size=-1>BM</font> rather as an ancient and charming relation, to be visited only occasionally, the tourists flock in. The <font size=-1>BM</font> gets 20% more visitors than New York's Metropolian Museum; in the league of the world's most popular museums and galleries, it is second only to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Attracting people is not the <font size=-1>BM</font>'s problem. The <font size=-1>BM</font>'s problem is attracting money. The government is cutting its grant, and at the same time the museum is losing the rent it used to get from the British Library, which is moving to new premises. The effect, by 2000, will be a cut in revenue of 24% after allowing for inflation. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After two-and-a-half peaceful centuries, the <font size=-1>BM</font> is poorly equipped for dealing with financial crises. The curators who run its departments tend to be individualists, chosen not for their management skills but for their scholarship. "The place is full of primadonnas," according to an insider. Finance is frowned upon. The top financial officer has the status of a keeper, which is lower in the hierarchy than a curator. And the place lacks a clear mission: it is part-university, producing fine research on art and archaeology, and part-gallery, catering to its visitors.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>BM</font> hopes to persuade the government to make up the money it is losing from the British Library. But even then, it would still be left with a large gap. There are two ways to fill it: cut costs or make money.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly, costs can be cut. Research could be slashed without affecting the service provided to visitors. But does the <font size=-1>BM</font>'s scholarship matter less than providing a warm resort for tour groups?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It could make more money. Thanks to Britain's 19th-century adventurers, who plundered some of the world's most wonderful ancient treasures--the Elgin marbles, King Ashurbanipal's carved lion-hunt from Assyria, the head of Rameses II from Egypt, turquoise-inlaid skulls from the Aztecs--the <font size=-1>BM</font>'s collection is a valuable resource. In the past, its curators sniffed at commerce, as is evident from its cramped little shop. However, the <font size=-1>BM</font> is waking up to its potential: it has opened a shop at Heathrow, which is doing well, and when the British Library moves out, shops and restaurants will be part of the Great Court development being designed by Sir Norman Foster, an outstanding British architect.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The big question, though, is whether to charge for admission. That is the solution favoured by Andrew Edwards, a former Treasury deputy secretary, who was commissioned by the <font size=-1>BM</font>'s trustees to report on the current crisis. The museum's director, Robert Anderson, disagrees. Charges, he says, would change the public's relationship with the <font size=-1>BM</font>. It would become less like public property, and more like visiting a country house. And charging would cut numbers. When the Victoria & Albert Museum introduced a "voluntary" charge in 1985, attendance fell from 1.7m to 1.02m in the following year (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One option short of a general admission fee would be to charge foreign tourists, who make up around 60% of the visitor numbers. That is the practice in some Spanish and Russian museums. But, practicalities aside, there is a difficulty in principle in charging Greeks, Iraqis or Egyptians to see the treasures which Britons lifted from their civilisations in the first place. "This is a very international museum," says Mr Anderson delicately.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the root of the problem is a nonsense for which the government is responsible. Museums have always faced the conundrum that people are willing to give them chunks of money for the Bloggs Wing or the Himmelfarb Gallery, but nobody wants to finance the security guards or the building maintenance. The government is now exacerbating that problem. Lottery money, like private donations, is for capital projects. And while the government promised that lottery money would not replace Treasury money, that is evidently what is happening. The British Museum has got two chunks of lottery money for capital projects--&#163;30m for the Great Court scheme, which will make use of the space vacated by the British Library, and &#163;8m for a "study centre"--at the same time as its revenue for current expenditure is being slashed. If the old thing is in a tizz, it is not surprising.<br>

<h1>Debt and taxes</h1>

"STUNNINGLY good" was how economists at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, described the news on November 18th that the government repaid &#163;4.4 billion of debt in October. This view was echoed by many other City of London economists, who on average had expected a paltry &#163;2 billion repayment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If October's figure sets the trend for the rest of 1996-97, the public-sector borrowing-requirement (<font size=-1>PSBR</font>) will total around &#163;23 billion for the financial year, &#163;4 billion less than the Treasury forecast in July (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>). Many economists reckon that this frees Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, to cut taxes by more than anyone had thought possible in the budget on November 26th--without even seeming reckless.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is a danger in all this of a solitary swallow being mistaken for summer. Chris Giles, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group, points out that much of October's repayment was the making-up of ground lost earlier in the year. The big surprise was the strength of corporate-tax revenues. But these are notoriously lumpy and unpredictable. Moreover, firms paying taxes in October come disproportionately from the booming financial sector; a truer test of whether the corporate-tax take is rising comes in January, a big tax-paying month for firms from less-buoyant bits of the economy. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Richard Jeffrey, an economist at Charterhouse, an investment bank, says that even if October's good news did reflect an improved trend for the <font size=-1>PSBR</font>, that would not be a green light for bigger tax cuts. The likeliest reason for any such fall in borrowing is not a smaller structural deficit (borrowing unrelated to the economic cycle)--which might give grounds for tax cuts--but faster-than-expected economic growth. More evidence of this came on November 20th, with data showing retail sales up by 4.1% in the year to October, and broad money expanding at an annual rate of 10.3%. Rather than justifying tax cuts, warns Mr Jeffrey, a shrinking <font size=-1>PSBR</font> should be regarded as a sign of excessively fast growth, and a warning of the urgent need to raise interest rates, or taxes, to prevent inflation rising.<br>

<p><b>Education</b></p>
<h1>Thinking lessons</h1>

IT WAS bad-mark week for British education. An international study found that British teenagers are low down the league table of ability in maths (see <a href="br3.gif">chart</a>). Results of this year's national tests on 11-year-olds, while better than last year's, show that only 54% passed in maths and 58% in English. The tests were set at a level that 75% of 11-year-olds should be capable of reaching.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is to be done? The teachers say the government must spend more money. The government says the teachers must return to old-fashioned methods. That is how the argument always goes. But there are other, less-discussed possibilities. Educational researchers are coming up with better methods for helping children learn:<font size=-1><li></font> Children can be taught how to think, concludes a new study by King's College, London. The five-year study looked at schools which gave pupils special lessons in which they had to work out for themselves the basic thought processes behind science and maths. A typical lesson started with the question "Does a cup of tea taste different if you put the milk in first or last?". In the course of their inquiry, pupils learnt about the principles behind statistics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pupils being taught how to think did significantly better in their <font size=-1>GCSE</font>s than conventionally-taught pupils. They even got better grades in English--although the special "thinking" lessons were designed only to help in maths and science.<font size=-1><li></font> Computers can be used to speed up pupils' progress in reading and writing. There is nothing new about using technology in education--Edison predicted in the 1920s that instruction by radio and films could eventually replace teachers--and plenty of recent studies have shown that interactive computer "games" can help with maths.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, a study in 15 east London primary schools suggests that computers can also help children learn to read and write faster. In one of these schools, before the project began, seven-year-olds were progressing at less than half of the normal speed for their age. With the help of their computer-based lessons, they made 19 months' progress in one year.<font size=-1><li></font> After years of trying, the idea of "family literacy" is showing some promise. This aims to help under-achieving children by giving lessons to their parents, who often did badly at school themselves, and so cannot help their children to read and write. Earlier this year, the National Foundation for Educational Research evaluated four pilot schemes in Cardiff, Liverpool, Norfolk and Tyneside, and found that the children were still making progress six months after their parents' courses ended.<font size=-1><li></font> A simple idea whose effectiveness is supported by several American studies is to get bright sixth-formers to teach struggling 11-year-olds to read during lunch breaks. David Reynolds, professor of education at Newcastle University, says some British schools are now trying this out.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trick is to enthuse the older pupils. Teachers do this by playing on their social consciences ("you are on your way to a bright future at university, these poor kids are heading for the dole or worse") and limiting the coaching sessions to, say, six weeks at a time so they do not become a bore.<br>

<h1>Dealing with Dennis the Menace</h1>

IF THE recent bunfights over disruptive pupils achieved anything, it was to ensure a wide and receptive audience for a clutch of new reports showing how incompetently the problem of badly behaved children is being dealt with. Children expelled from school tend to be those most in need of education, but they often end up with next to none.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While some schools go to great lengths not to expel disruptive children, sacrificing the education of other pupils and making teachers' lives a misery, others exclude children at the slightest excuse. This is one of the damning conclusions of a new report from Ofsted, the schools inspectorate for England.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Everybody reckons that exclusions are rising, but nobody has been keeping track of the problem until recently. New research by Christ Church College, Canterbury, shows that 13,400 children were expelled from schools in England last year, up 8% on the previous year. Some get a place in another school (often after weeks or even months of negotiations) but then get chucked out again. About 40% of expelled pupils get a place in a council-run "pupil-referral unit" (<font size=-1>PRU</font>). These usually provide only a part-time education, and a pretty poor one. An earlier Ofsted report said the standards in <font size=-1>PRU</font>s were "alarming". <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Around 27% get home tuition, but often for as little as two hours a week. All in all, says a study to be published next week by the Commission for Racial Equality (<font size=-1>CRE</font>), those expelled from school get, on average, one tenth of a full-time education in the year of expulsion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That leaves plenty of time for mischief. Youth crime costs &#163;1 billion a year, and a new Audit Commission report points out that 42% of those sentenced in youth courts have been expelled from school. The <font size=-1>CRE</font>'s report reckons that each excluded pupil who turns to crime costs the police &#163;2,000 to deal with.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So even though a full-time place in a <font size=-1>PRU</font> can cost up to six times the &#163;2,300 annual cost of a typical secondary-school place, there is a growing realisation that more such places must be provided and their standards must be improved. It is also becoming clear that it is time to rethink the consensus which has prevailed for the past 20 years, which says that almost all children, whatever their behavioural problems, should go to mainstream schools.<br>

<p><b>National Health Service</b></p>
<h1>Handing out the rations</h1>

FOR the past 50 years decisions about who would live and who would die were mostly taken behind closed doors by consultants. In theory, access to treatment was determined solely on the basis of clinical need. In practice, it was often determined by age, geography, marital status and the personal prejudices of the consultants making the decisions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This will no longer wash, according to "Rationing and Rights in Health Care", a study published on November 20th by the Institute for Public Policy Research (<font size=-1>IPPR</font>). There are several reasons why. The purchaser-provider split, central to the government's health reforms, has made purchasing decisions more transparent. The Patients' Charter, which lays down maximum waiting times for operations, has also focused public attention on lack of resources. Many health authorities have had to make drastic changes to their priorities to reduce queues for operations. One in six authorities now excludes certain treatments such as cosmetic surgery, sex change and tattoo removal. Berkshire Health Authority has specifically excluded 12 treatments from <font size=-1>NHS</font> provision, among them treatment of varicose veins, snoring, and the removal of wisdom teeth.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Access to the most expensive care, such as fertility treatment, depends largely on geography. In some parts of Britain, <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation is provided free of charge. In others, such as Somerset, couples have to pay &#163;500-&#163;1,500 per treatment. Different places have different age thresholds. In Liverpool, treatment is restricted to women under the age of 35, in Humberside to those under the age of 40. Care for terminally-ill patients varies widely. Ealing and Hammersmith, for instance, provide in-hospital care for all patients who are diagnosed as likely to die within a year; in Bromley, by contrast, the threshold is two weeks.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more sensitive the rationing decisions, the more covert they tend to be. In some health authorities, if your kidneys fail and you are over 65, you will quietly be allowed to die. Only 8% of patients receiving renal dialysis in Britain in the mid-1980s were aged over 65, compared with a quarter in Germany, France and Italy. There is no clinical justification for such ageism. The five-year survival rate for pensioners on renal dialysis is 62% compared with 44% for those aged 55-64, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal. Similar unjustified discrimination on age grounds can be seen in treatments for certain types of cancer and heart disease.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is a strong case, as the <font size=-1>IPPR</font> study argues, for bringing such decisions out into the open. "Priority setting", as the politicians prefer to call rationing, involves many, often <i>ad hoc</i>, decisions taken by ministers, health authorities, hospital consultants and doctors. The <font size=-1>NHS</font> spends &#163;100m every day. Those who pay for it have a right to know rather more than they do about how this money is being spent, and why.<br>

<h1>Citizen Gates</h1>

<p><b>Microsoft has made a fortune from software. Why is it so keen to risk much of it in the media business?</b></p><br>
EVERY few years, the titans of technology seem to fall under a strange spell. No matter how successful their own businesses may be, they begin to lust after the media market, driven by the vague notion that "content is king". In the late 1980s the spell lured Japanese consumer-electronics firms to Hollywood. In the mid 1990s America's telephone firms were bewitched into investing in television. All emerged poorer and wiser. Now it is the turn of Microsoft, the giant of the software industry.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This year Microsoft will spend some $400m on media projects, ranging from Web sites on the Internet to a cable-television news channel and a film studio. Its founder and boss, Bill Gates, has said he is prepared to lose $1 billion on such investments in the next few years. Microsoft will remain a software firm but with a big media sideline. As he often remarks, media firms, such as Disney, have built themselves into some of the greatest brands in modern history.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, this ambition seems strange. Last year Microsoft made profits of $2.2 billion on revenues of $8.6 billion. That dwarfs the profits of even the best media companies. The biggest of them, the Disney empire, earned $1.4 billion last year, while Rupert Murdoch's fearsome News Corp made just under $1 billion. Even the richest newpaper empires make less than half that. At best, media firms achieve margins of less than 12% and enjoy 15% annual growth; most live with single digits for both. By comparison, Microsoft has been growing by over 30% a year, and consistently enjoys net margins of over 25%. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So why would Microsoft taint its balance sheet with something as sluggish as media? The simplest answer: because it can. Microsoft has an astounding $7 billion in cash looking for a home. Rather than return the money to its shareholders, the company is entrusting it to the vision of Mr Gates. He reckons that one way or another software and content will merge: Microsoft's best bet is to hurry it along.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anyway, he argues, the sort of media Microsoft is investing in are, for the most part, not the stodgy stuff of paper and film. Mr Gates is investing in "interactive content": as he puts it, <font size=-1>CD</font>-<font size=-1>ROM</font>s, Web sites, Internet services and the like. Such things are booming, at least in terms of the number of on-line readers and offerings, both of which are doubling each year (though no big Web publishing venture is making money yet and even <i>Wired</i>, the cybernaut's bible, is losing a fortune). Moreover, Microsoft knows a bit about this market, having executed a remarkable turnaround in the past year to become one of the leaders in Internet software.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gates reckons that there are more similarities than differences between the software business his firm is good at and the new media it is developing. Both are driven by technology in which Microsoft excels. Both are brand-name businesses. And both share the economies of scale of digital reproduction and distribution. All sound familiar? Exactly: Japanese electronics firms said much the same things when they were throwing money around Hollywood. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Subscriptions, not synergies</b></b><br>
In fact, Microsoft's real financial justification for diving into media is not to search for synergies. Instead, it wants to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities the Internet opens up. And there it sees a chance to gain the main economic advantage that the media business has over software: subscriptions. Microsoft makes its money when consumers buy a new <font size=-1>PC</font> (which comes with a Microsoft operating system already installed); when they buy a box containing Microsoft programs (be it a word processor or an educational <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>); or when they upgrade a program with a newer version. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This limits Microsoft in two ways. First, it is hard--and getting harder--to win repeat sales. Computer programs are like tools: bought once and used many times. Microsoft has to persuade customers to keep throwing old tools away. But customers are becoming fed up with what they call "bloatware"--unnecessary features added to encourage them to upgrade. Increasingly, they are sticking with the tools they already have.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, traditional software ties Microsoft's growth to the fortunes of the <font size=-1>PC</font> industry. Since the company already dominates most of the biggest software markets, growth will tend to come not from new markets but new <font size=-1>PC</font> owners. Their numbers will rise by only 16% or so this year. To keep its shareholders happy, Microsoft needs to grow twice as fast.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Subscriptions--or "recurring revenues"--are one way to do that, by continuously milking existing <font size=-1>PC</font> users for more money, rather than simply waiting for new customers to come along. Microsoft is already selling some of its office software on subscription, with an annual fee guaranteeing support and upgrades. It offers subscriptions to some of its <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> titles. But most software buyers, who are not used to working this way, have been unimpressed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Microsoft is looking for more subscription businesses, and the natural choice is media. News changes constantly, and entertainment usually has a shelf life of days. This sort of business can generate a steady flow of cash. Microsoft is prepared to blanket the market with offerings in its search for gold. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Its efforts range from <i>Slate</i>, a political magazine available in both on-line and paper versions, to <i>UnderWire</i>, a Web site aimed at women. With <font size=-1>NBC</font>, an American television network, it runs <font size=-1>MSNBC</font>, a 24-hour news service, available both as a cable <font size=-1>TV</font> station and as a Web site (see <a href="wb1.gif">table</a>). The Web sites and on-line services are aimed at Microsoft's existing market of <font size=-1>PC</font> owners. But the hope is that <font size=-1>MSNBC</font> and Microsoft's investment in DreamWorks <font size=-1>SKG</font>, a new film studio, will reach a new--and potentially bigger--audience. And Microsoft reckons that the more compelling the media products it can put on the Web, the more people will want to buy <font size=-1>PC</font>s to get them, boosting all its businesses. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seen as a loss-leader, new media may look a reasonable bet. But as a business in its own right, it is far riskier. Like most other new-media pioneers, Microsoft has no idea where, or when, it might make money from its on-line ventures. Take <font size=-1>MSNBC</font>: its cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> part works just like a normal cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> station, taking subscriptions and advertising. Its Web site, however, has a harder task: viewers on-line are reluctant to pay for subscriptions when so many other sites are free, and paying advertisers are still sceptical about the Web.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At least <font size=-1>MSNBC</font> can tap into traditional media markets. <i>Slate</i> has a harder task. It too has many rivals on the Web, most of which are free. For <i>Slate </i>to earn enough advertising revenue to pay its way, Microsoft insiders reckon that the cerebral weekly will need a regular readership of 400,000. That is about ten times as many as the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> has managed to draw with its massive daily on-line offerings. And charging for <i>Slate</i> (which Microsoft intends to do next February) is liable to chase away most of its readers. That, at any rate, has been the the experience of other Web magazines.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, unlike its rivals, Microsoft has two big advantages in this new market. The first is its $7-billion war chest--and the fact that its boss is prepared to put a great deal of this on the line. <i>Slate</i>, <font size=-1>MSNBC</font> and their siblings can afford to lose money for years. No rival can claim as much.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second is that Microsoft can market its services through its ubiquitous Windows operating system. An icon on new computer screens already puts most users a single click away from <font size=-1>MSN</font>. In its next version of Windows, Microsoft plans to make the link even tighter, weaving Web content--anything from news to advertising-- into the <font size=-1>PC</font> "desktop". Already it has divided <font size=-1>MSN</font> into "channels" along such themes as entertainment, cars and travel. Ultimately, it hopes to take the broadcast analogy further, delivering a television-like stream of Microsoft content to <font size=-1>PC</font> screens.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Plenty of other firms aim to dazzle consumers the same way, although they may not have the same technological edge. Firms such as Pointcast created a market for such Internet "broadcasting" and are sure to adopt Microsoft's new technologies nearly as fast as it does. Others, such as <font size=-1>C/NET</font> and HotWired, are creating channels of their own, and even sometimes producing cable-television programmes to show on them. Microsoft is launching Web sites for local information (starting with listings of entertainment)--but so are two competitors called CitySearch and Yahoo, while local newspapers are moving in too.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ultimately, the new media market will not be won by technology. Just as magazines distinguish themselves by the quality of writing rather than the speed of their printing presses, so the media victors will be those with the most creativity and talent. If these are qualities that can be bought, then Microsoft's greatest advantage will be its bank account. If not, Mr Gates's media ambitions may eventually join yesterday's newspapers in the bin.<br>

<h1>No Mickey Mouse business</h1>

THE media business is full of glamorous companies, but there is only one real star: Walt Disney. Last year, Disney made a profit of $1.4 billion on revenues of $12 billion, far outshining other entertainment firms. One of its biggest fans is none other than Bill Gates, the boss of Microsoft, the world's biggest independent computer-software firm.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So it is ironic that Microsoft may soon come head-to-head with Disney on what Microsoft might consider its own turf: cyberspace. On November 19th Disney launched a Web-based shop selling hundreds of bits of Disney paraphernalia from Winnie-the-Pooh pyjamas to 101-Dalmatians watches. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The shop is not Disney's first foray on to the World Wide Web: the company has launched several Web sites tacked on to its various businesses, such as one for "Toy Story", an animated film, and another for Disneyland, an amusement park. Last autumn, it set up a new division to develop products for the Internet. And in two weeks' time, it launches family.com, an advertiser-supported Web site aimed at families. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the biggest clash may be yet to come. According to <font size=-1>C/NET</font>, a trade magazine, Disney will launch its own on-line service early next year, to offer access to the Internet as well as to feature its own content and characters. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That should frighten America Online, CompuServe and <font size=-1>MSN</font>, Microsoft's newly relaunched network. These online services make much of their suitability for children (<font size=-1>MSN</font> even has an area dedicated to the youngest surfers). Disney, with its strength in home entertainment and warm, furry family values, looks an ideal partner to help children (and their parents) through the hazards of the Internet.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of Disney's other electronic ventures have succeeded. A couple of years ago it started selling educational software. In the first half of this year, four of the top six <font size=-1>PC</font> educational programs were produced by Disney, according to <font size=-1>PC</font> Data, a research firm in Virginia. Disney now holds more than 10% of a fragmented market. If Disney can do as well on-line (and it probably will), Mr Gates may wish that Donald, Mickey and their friends were not quite the impressive characters he so admires.<br>

<h1>Japan's Lou Gerstner</h1>

<p><b>Tadashi Sekizawa runs Fujitsu, Japan's biggest manufacturer of mainframe computers. Can he cope with the PC revolution?</b></p><br>
WALK into any Japanese office these days and you fall over empty boxes at every step. The reason is <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Nearly 6m of them were bought in Japan last year, up an awesome 70% from the year before. Two-thirds of them were bound for offices rather than homes. When offices in the United States went through the transition from mainframes to networked personal computers in the early 1990s, it created havoc at <font size=-1>IBM</font>, the world's largest computer maker. Now Fujitsu, the second largest, has begun to face much the same pressures. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>IBM</font> has been resuscitated over the past three years by Lou Gerstner, in one of the more dramatic corporate turnarounds of recent years. Tadashi Sekizawa, the dour 64-year-old telecommunications engineer who has run Fujitsu for the past six years, is altogether a different proposition: neither a marketing wizard nor a management guru. But he has been showing some equally impressive surgical skills. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Sekizawa has had some advantages denied to Mr Gerstner. For one thing, he had longer to prepare for the crunch. The domestic market has traditionally accounted for more than 80% of Fujitsu's business. Its large customers were locked into Fujitsu software running on Fujitsu mainframes. In addition, Japan's protracted recession discouraged Japanese companies from replacing their ageing mainframes with <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Even if they had wanted to do so, it would have been hard to find the <font size=-1>PC</font> software. Only lately has software such as Windows 95, Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Office become truly Japanised.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Luckily for Fujitsu, Mr Sekizawa saw what lay ahead. He has forced through a change in corporate culture almost as dramatic as Mr Gerstner's revolution at <font size=-1>IBM</font>. By Japanese standards, he has axed jobs brutally, cutting 10% of Fujitsu's 40,000 employees in the past three years. He has also moved vigorously into the cut-throat <font size=-1>PC</font> business. That has meant overcoming Fujitsu's snobbish dislike of manufacturing abroad. Fujitsu's new range of <font size=-1>PC</font>s is made in Taiwan, and up to 90% of the parts for its <font size=-1>PC</font>s are bought from suppliers in South-East Asia. That has cut manufacturing costs by 20-30%. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Sekizawa's other advantage over Mr Gerstner is that Fujitsu is broader than <font size=-1>IBM</font> was at its nadir. Last year, a third of its &#165;3.8 trillion ($39 billion) of consolidated sales and a similar share of its &#165;63 billion in net profit came from telecoms and microchips (Fujitsu is Japan's second largest supplier of telecoms equipment and fourth biggest microchip maker). It is thus a big beneficiary of Japan's new passion for cellular telephones. While overall profits may slide 40% or more this year, Fujitsu may well double its operating profit from cellular telephones and telecoms gear (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the key to Mr Sekizawa's vision of <font size=-1>PC</font>s is his background as a telephone engineer. He thinks <font size=-1>PC</font>s are becoming appliances like telephones. What he really wants to sell his customers is not so much the "handset", but the infrastructure that connects <font size=-1>PC</font>s together; services and software to make the tedious technology easier to use; and content that will coax subscribers to stay on line. He is enthralled by the Internet, and wants Fujitsu to be getting 30% of its revenue from Internet-related activities within two years. He has allocated almost half of Fujitsu's &#165;385-billion budget for research and development to ensure that it does.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Flights of fancy</b></b><br>
All this may turn out to be an expensive distraction from the task ahead. No one yet has found a way to deliver a reliable flow of revenue from surfing the Internet. Mr Gerstner understood that, and built his success at <font size=-1>IBM</font> on tackling problems in the most pedestrian of ways--ruthlessly cutting costs, rationalising the business and building on what he had.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Sekizawa may yet reach the same conclusion. Fujitsu's earnings are likely to be down sharply this year (from &#165;63 billion to perhaps a mere &#165;35 billion--though the company is forecasting &#165;50 billion) as the semiconductor slump continues. Last year Fujitsu invested massively in new chip-making factories in a bid to catch up on its rivals. The market promptly fell apart.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, the company's mainframe sales abroad are making heavy losses. After losing $580m in 1993 and making a small profit in 1994, Fujitsu's American mainframe subsidiary, Amdahl, lost a further $288m in the first half of this year alone. <font size=-1>ICL</font>, the British mainframe maker that Fujitsu bought in 1990 for &#163;700m ($1.2 billion), made a &#163;194m loss last year and a further unspecified loss in the first half of this year. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Sekizawa's riskiest decision so far has been to dump <font size=-1>PC</font>s on Japan's domestic market at prices that have left rivals squealing with outrage. Industry watchers believe Fujitsu is losing up to 15% on every personal computer it sells in Japan (at a cost of more than &#165;100m a day). As an effort to retain its share of the market, the ploy is succeeding. Last year, Fujitsu leapfrogged from fourth to second place in the domestic <font size=-1>PC</font> market, more than doubling its share to 18.4%. That is still well behind <font size=-1>NEC</font>'s 40%, although Fujitsu is gaining so fast that the two companies could be neck and neck within a couple of years. But few believe it can go on losing money on its <font size=-1>PC</font> sales at the current rate. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fujitsu is now where <font size=-1>IBM</font> was three or four years ago. The restructuring has begun. The agony lies ahead.<br>

<p><b>Internet offerings</b></p>
<h1>On-line capitalism</h1>

<font size=1>NEW YORK</font><p>
<p><b>For small companies, selling stock has been a hugely expensive undertaking. The Web may change that</b></p><br>
EARLY next year, Ray Dallavecchia, the boss of a small toy and foam-products firm, plans to do something uncharacteristically daring. He will attempt to raise around $5m of equity capital. But he will not take the traditional route to market offered by venture capitalists or investment bankers. Rather, he intends to launch a do-it-yourself share offering on the Internet.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He will join a growing band of bosses from small firms who think that they have found in the World Wide Web a perfect way to sidestep the perils of Wall Street. Around 30 companies are in various stages of following the lead set by Spring Street Brewing, a New York beer maker, which pioneered Internet share offerings when it raised $1.6m last February. By appealing directly to investors via the Net, firms can raise money without spending a fortune on expensive underwriters. They can even sign up with a growing number of fledgling electronic stockmarkets, so that their shares can be traded. Already some 15 online investment banks are vying to help firms use the new technology. This trend could one day prove a potent threat to every sort of financial activity, from banking and accountancy to legal services, venture capital and share-dealing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To understand why, consider the intriguingly named Poof Products, which Mr Dallavecchia has owned since 1991. The firm employs 45 people at a plant in Plymouth, Michigan, and sells more than $10m-worth of foam sports balls, puzzles and toys each year. But its industry is consolidating as retailers demand more products and broader marketing efforts than small firms can provide. Poof needs extra capital if it is to be an acquirer rather than someone else's acquisition.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hot-shot investment bankers are hardly knocking on Mr Dallavecchia's door. "Our funding needs are just too small to be of interest to most underwriters," he says. The few underwriters or venture capitalists who raise money for small firms such as Poof are astonishingly rapacious. A $5m offering might see as much as $700,000 eaten up in costs. The Internet offers an alternative. For $1,200 Mr Dallavecchia has bought a computer program called CapScape, which automates the tedious process of compiling an offer document. By using the program and then offering shares directly to investors over the Internet, Poof Products expects to raise its money at a cost of less than $100,000.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The savings offered by CapScape are formidable. The American government reckons that, on average, a share prospectus takes 900 hours to complete. CapScape's interactive worksheets shrink that to just 11 hours or so. The completed form must then be shown to a lawyer for review. But the professional fees involved in such an offering are relatively tiny: a few thousand dollars against perhaps $200,000 for a conventional prospectus for an initial public offering. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like the lawyers and accountants, the financiers too have plenty to fear from the new technology. Those who now specialise in raising money for small companies, particularly banks and venture capitalists, will face unaccustomed competition. Ben Ezra Weinstein, the investment-advisory firm from Albuquerque, New Mexico that developed CapScape, intends precisely that. Hence its choice of a toll-free phone number: 1-888-<font size=-1>VC-GOAWAY</font>.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Bypass operation</b></b><br>
Should Wall Street tremble? Not just yet, reckons Andrew Klein, a savvy lawyer who is the boss of Spring Street Brewing. "The biggest beneficiaries of this will be small and fast-growing companies," he says. "Potential Internet issuers are not likely to be complaining about the quality of the coffee at Goldman Sachs or other big investment banks. They will be firms that want to by-pass venture funds."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alongside his brewing interests, Mr Klein has started Wit Capital, an investment bank that also aspires to become an electronic stockmarket on which the shares of Internet offerings will be traded. By combining discount stockbroking with the underwriting of share issues, Mr Klein thinks he can widen the pool of investors who have access to newly-issued equity. In time, that could change how the stocks perform. New issues have a deserved reputation for volatility. On average they jump in price by nearly a fifth in the first hour of trading. That is because underwriters carefully control the pricing and direct the flow of shares to favoured customers, who then have the privilege of selling for an immediate premium. Investors who buy during that post-issue frenzy often end up with losses when prices tumble. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Imagine instead that shares in a new offering are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, as Wit Capital intends. Small investors would have the same chance as big institutions of getting in on the ground floor. The offering price would reflect true market demand, letting the issuer collect every penny of the shares' value rather than giving windfalls to a few lucky investors. Michael Weinstein, joint boss of Ben Ezra Weinstein, thinks that many of the small investors who would be drawn to a fairer market would want to hold onto their shares rather than sell them for a quick profit--an additional benefit to the issuer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not that cyberspace share-dealers will have an easy ride. Existing fund-raisers are quick to point out that any smart crook can make an Internet offering. How might investors tell the real from the fake? A few Internet sites, such as the one run by Mr Klein and another by Clay Womack, a Californian entrepreneur, address this issue by promising to do thorough checks on companies that list shares for trading. Mr Womack has formed the Small Business Capital Acquisition Association, an independent body that will offer to guarantee the integrity of companies that list their stock on the Web. But, as in the physical world, money will attract crooks and the lure of fat returns will trap the gullible.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This will not deter Mr Dallavecchia, however. The commercial logic of Internet share offerings is so compelling that he is committed to the idea. Might his company's shares thereby be condemned to trade only on some obscure electronic bulletin board? Maybe. But Mr Dallavecchia is unconcerned. If nothing else, he should have investors who want to hold his shares as a long-term investment. No captain of industry could ask for more.<br>

<h1>Junius Jayewardene</h1>

AT A conference in San Francisco in 1951, called to discuss a peace settlement with Japan, Junius Jayewardene spoke for magnanimity towards the old enemy. It was an unexpected sentiment at the time. Japan's cruelties in the 1930s and in the second world war, which even now, many years later, continue to be a disturbing subject, were then fresh in people's minds. Mr Jayewardene, appealing especially to Asians at the conference, asked them to extend "the hand of friendship" and close "this chapter in the history of man". His speech, the shortest at the conference, was received with acclamation. The Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Yoshida, usually an impassive figure, burst into tears.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some would call Mr Jayewardene an opportunist who appreciated that Japan, backed and protected by America, was rapidly rising from its ashes. Not for nothing was he known as "the old fox", a nickname he rather relished. Certainly, Japan never forgot his gesture in San Francisco, and has treated Sri Lanka with generosity ever since. But, equally, it can be claimed that Mr Jayewardene had vision, looking beyond the world of the moment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asia, he said, had to put aside the past and find solutions to the daunting problems of the future. The most important of these was how best to make a living. Today, the free market and privatisation are everyone's ideology. But in 1977, when Mr Jayewardene at last became prime minister of Sri Lanka and was able to put his ideas into practice, liberalisation was new, especially in Asia. He ended the protectionism of the previous socialist government under Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike, dismantling controls on imports and foreign exchange. "Let the robber barons come in," he said happily. Since then, much has changed in Sri Lanka. It has had to endure a civil war. Mr Jayewardene's party has lost power to a coalition led by Mrs Bandaranaike's daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga. But the economy continues to be run mostly as Mr Jayewardene would wish.<br>
</p><p><b><b>HisScottish governess</b></b><br>
For the first 40 or so years of Junius Jayewardene's life, Ceylon, as Sri Lanka used to be called, was still ruled by the British. The Jayewardenes had prospered. Mr Jayewardene's father, a judge in Ceylon's Supreme Court, believed the British empire would last for a thousand years, a view shared by other eminent Asian families who took on themselves a bit of the empire's grandeur. Young Junius had a Scottish governess, a Miss Munroe, and later kept a picture of her on his desk.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He became a lawyer, as his forebears had done for four generations. But politics lured him. One of his heroes was Benjamin Disraeli, a Victorian politician who did much to turn Britain into a world power. Mr Jayewardene helped to found the pro-western United National Party, and after independence in 1948, with his party in power, he held a number of ministries. But he had to wait until he was almost 71 to become prime minister and to reform the economy. The gains were immediately apparent, but from 1983 Sri Lanka saw its resources, including its young men, increasingly wasted in a conflict, still going on, between the Hindu Tamils, a minority who live mainly in the north, and the Buddhist Sinhalese.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Jayewardene, a Buddhist, is blamed by some Sri Lankans for misjudging the conflict. His economic reforms did not benefit the Tamil areas. While the rest of the country prospered, the Tamils continued to live in a poor ghetto. But it is uncertain whether, as some believe, the Tamils could have been wooed away from their demand for independence. The Tamil guerrillas, known as Tigers, have never wavered from their demands for a separate homeland. Generous offers by the present government, of autonomy within a form of federalism, have been rejected by the Tigers. India may be more to blame for the viciousness of the conflict. During Indira Gandhi's rule the Tigers were trained and armed by India. That policy was ended by Rajiv Gandhi, Indira's son and successor (who was later to be murdered by the Tigers). In 1987 India sent 50,000 troops into Sri Lanka as "peacekeepers", but they withdrew after suffering heavy casualties from the guerrillas they had trained too well.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A desperate Sri Lanka could have become a military dictatorship, the fate, for long periods, of its South Asian neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh. Mr Jayewardene was often accused by opponents of being a dictator, particularly after he put through constitutional changes that made him executive president on the French model. But he believed that strength at the top was needed to keep Sri Lanka from falling into anarchy. Mrs Kumaratunga has clung to the presidency, although in opposition she promised to restore the British-style system. Junius Jayewardene retired without fuss in 1989 after ruling for 11 years. Afterwards, politicians and others often came to his home (called Braemar, his governess's birthplace) to get his thoughts. He would welcome them, even his critics. "There is nothing," said the old fox, "that gentlemen cannot discuss over a drink."<br>

<h1 align=center>Into Zaire</h1>


AT LAST help seems to be on its way. Despite their early reservations, the United States and Britain are lending their support to the proposed intervention force for Zaire. With luck, this Canadian-led force will enable aid agencies to go into eastern Zaire and help more than 1m refugees and thousands of local people facing starvation. For many it is already too late. The world has wilfully stood by as a disaster has unfolded. Now that it is belatedly stirring, it had better not repeat the mistakes it committed when, two years ago, it first watched a genocide in this part of Africa and then tried to mop up after it. The trouble is that, this time, everything will be even harder than before.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one can say this crisis came unheralded. For months many voices have been warning of catastrophe and calling for the United Nations to act. This week in New York the Americans and the British delayed sending a <font size=-1>UN</font> force, first by saying intervention was unnecessary, then by blithely requesting more information. Their nervousness is understandable, though not their tardiness in overcoming it. The difficulties involved in trying to give help are huge, but it is cynical to pretend that they have not been apparent for months. The Americans in particular know that without their logistical--and financial--support, fast and effective intervention would be impossible. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even with American help, this cannot be a straightforward humanitarian operation (see <a href="ir6038.html">page</a>). Delivering food and medicine among rebels and refugees, some innocents, some guilty of genocide, has tortuous political and military implications. The only route for aid is through Rwanda. Understandably, but unforgivably, the Rwandan government is trying to dictate who joins the force and which aid agencies should be allowed to cross its borders. It does not want the removal of the new buffer zone created by its allies in eastern Zaire. Nor does it want the occupants of the Zairean refugee camps, among whom are Hutus who helped carry out the slaughters in Rwanda two years ago, to reassemble elsewhere in Zaire. Were they to do so, the new camps would become bases for attacks across the border.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These Hutus are not the only armed groups with an interest in controlling events. Some Zaireans are trying to get a slice of the action by demanding that all aid should go through the capital Kinshasa. Fortunately, they can be ignored: their army in the distant east of the country has virtually dissolved and, with the two main airports in rebel hands and no roads to send in reinforcements, central authority in the region is nil.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rebels in Zaire are more serious. They want food for themselves and--to help them gain political support--for displaced local Zaireans. But they do not want food to reach the mass of refugees or soldiers of the former Rwandan army and Hutu militiamen who hide among them. As for the militiamen, they want food for themselves and their families, and control over the distribution of aid so as to maintain their power over the other refugees. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem of the former Rwandan soldiers and Hutu militiamen arises largely because they were not disarmed, still less arrested and brought to trial, when the camps were set up two years ago. Separating them from the other refugees is one of two essential tasks for the intervention force--beyond the provision of security, shelter, food and medicine. Ideally, it should arrest the ringleaders and send them for trial at the international genocide tribunal in Tanzania. But, in the circumstances, keeping armed men out of the refugee camps may be as much as it is reasonable to expect.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second task is, in due course, to return the refugees to Rwanda. Had this been done before, the current troubles would be much simpler to deal with. One difficulty is that the better the camps are run, the more refugees will want to remain inside them. Another is that, even if the camps are dreadful, they may seem safer to frightened Hutus than returning to their villages. Separated from the extremist militiamen bent on revenge, the ordinary Hutu peasants may be more easily persuaded to go home. But, to persuade anyone to go back to such a turbulent country, it will be necessary to show them that a close watch will be kept on the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government lest it sanction persecution.<br>
</p><p><b>Havens, not Utopias</b><br>
Outsiders, however well intentioned, cannot solve all, or maybe even any, of the political disputes in this part of Africa. The people of Rwanda and Burundi--85% of them Hutus and nearly all the others Tutsis--are likely to be quite literally at each others' throats for years to come. For that reason, Rwanda's Tutsi-led government cannot be considered stable in the long term. Zaire's government is already largely a fiction: the president is in France, stricken with cancer, and large areas of the country have long been running themselves with minimal interference from Kinshasa. It is little wonder that the rebels in the east have proved so successful.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Against this background, outsiders can hope only to alleviate the suffering, and avoid making political problems worse. If this intervention force is not to be followed by another in a couple of years' time, it should at least do its utmost to ensure that the camps it creates are short-term havens of peace, not long-term training grounds for killers.<br>

<p>Biljana Plavsic, president of the <b>Bosnian Serb Republic</b>, sacked the army chief, Ratko Mladic, an alleged war criminal. Military police opposed to Mr Mladic's removal detained the defence minister, Milan Ninkovic.</p>
<h2>Zaire mission</h2>
<p>America agreed "in principle" to send troops for a Canadian-led multinational force to protect humanitarian aid for more than 1m refugees in <b>eastern Zaire</b>. Britain has also offered troops.

After two days of negotiation with rebels in Goma, relief workers began distributing food on Wednesday but came under shell fire from one of the camps of Rwandan Hutu refugees. </p>
<p>With a <b>Palestinian-Israeli</b> deal on Hebron seemingly only hours away, Binyamin Netanyahu postponed a visit to Washington. The deal was not made. Earlier, Israeli troops fired on Palestinians demonstrating against a land seizure, killing one and wounding 11.</p>
<p>For the first time since the cold war, the United States government is to give allies military aid to help overthrow a hostile neighbour. Almost $20m worth of equipment is to be sent to Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea for use against the Islamist government of Sudan.</p>

<h2>Time and motion</h2>
<p>(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The European Court of Justice ruled that Britain must obey European Union rules imposing a <b>48-hour week</b> on member states. John Major, Britain's prime minister, argued that such rules would aggravate Europe's unemployment problem. He said that Britain would disrupt <font size=-1>EU</font> business in other areas unless the rules were overturned.</p>
<p>Zhu Jiazhen, China's labour vice-minister, predicted that <b>China's loss-making state firms</b> will sack some 14m workers over the next five years in order to cut their costs, and that roughly 130m peasants will stop farming and drift to the cities. Chinese newspapers warned him that the country's urban unemployment rate could leap from 2.9% to 7.4% by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Albert Dunlap, the boss of <b>Sunbeam</b>, an American household-appliances firm, lived up to his reputation as "Chainsaw Al". Mr Dunlap promised to halve the firm's 12,000-strong workforce, to shut 39 of its 53 factories and offices, and to discontinue 87% of its products.</p>
<p>Once one of America's most diversified conglomerates, <b>Westinghouse Electric</b>, said it would spin off the rest of its industrial businesses and move into cable-<font size=-1>TV</font>. The company is already America's biggest broadcast television and radio group.</p>
<h2>A new tone</h2>
<p>America and Europe inched closer to a deal that would liberalise their <b>telecoms</b> and <b>information-technology</b> markets. At a meeting of American and <font size=-1>EU</font> delegates, America promised to liberalise underwater cable services to the United States and both Europe and America agreed to abolish tariffs on many high-tech products by the second half of 1997. </p>
<p>Carlo Ciampi, Italy's treasury minister, is ringing the changes in the country's telecoms market. He announced that <b>Stet</b>, a state-controlled telecoms holding company, is to merge with Telecom Italia, its main operating unit.

<h1>Clinton II: The Strategy</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
TWO days after the election, Bill Clinton slept the relaxed sleep of the victor, waking up past noon. He had proclaimed a mandate for the "vital centre" of American politics; his Republican opponents, newly reconfirmed in their control of Congress, had said they would be delighted to serve the centre too. On all sides, there was talk of bipartisan co-operation. Then, on the third day, the president rose up and gave a press conference. The Republicans pounced.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The press conference, and the reaction to it, suggest how different this transition is from the one that followed Mr Clinton's election four years ago. Then, Mr Clinton had issued a list of large campaign promises--a tax cut, a stimulus package, more jobs, more health insurance, welfare reform--with little thought given to how these could be implemented: Mr Clinton was agonising over his priorities right up until inauguration day. This time, however, Mr Clinton has won election on a more modest programme, and has few doubts about his priorities. But, in contrast to four years ago, he faces a Congress controlled by the opposing camp.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both at the press conference, and again in a television interview two days later, Mr Clinton declared that balancing the budget is at the top of his agenda; spreading tertiary education, making a success of welfare reform, extending health insurance in small increments and cleansing campaign finance follow. Already, reducing the deficit from $290 billion to $107 billion stands out as the big achievement of his first term in office. Other presidents have ended slavery or vanquished foreign dictators. Mr Clinton wants to be the first president since 1969 to balance the government's books.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is more than a little irony in this. Until just over a year ago, Mr Clinton disdained Republican calls to eliminate the deficit. He then changed course, seeing political advantage in fiscal virtue; but he nonetheless spent much of the election campaign denouncing Republican budget cuts as too harsh. Now, smiling genially, he marvels at how little difference there is between Republican proposals and his own. He declares that a budget-balancing deal could be done in "next to no time"--indeed, that it is "easily achievable" next year.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Republicans will come to relish these comments if Mr Clinton fails. And the obstacles are daunting. For one thing, the impressive progress on the budget in Mr Clinton's first term is due mainly to the tax increases of 1990 and 1993 and to the strong economy. Mr Clinton is not going to raise taxes again, and the economy is unlikely to remain robust for ever. In the absence of bold spending cuts, the deficit will grow rather than disappear.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And politics will make cutting tricky. Mr Clinton wants to laugh off his campaign assault on the cuts proposed last year by the Republicans, but the Republicans are not amused. On November 12th Mr Clinton invited the leaders of Congress to the White House, hoping to mark out common ground on the budget. But the Republicans conceded nothing. Having borne the brunt of Mr Clinton's attacks, they are determined that he should take the responsibility for suggesting cuts this time--cuts that Republicans can denounce at the next election. "We're in this boat together and we have to paddle it together," the president had pleaded earlier in the day. You steer, was the Republican reply. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This exchange may set the pattern of the next few months: the president longing for congressional Republicans to join him in policy-making, the Republicans politely coy. The Republicans hope that, if Mr Clinton is forced to take the lead, he will damage his reputation as much as he did during his first years in power, when his crusade for a tax increase and for health reform cost his party control of Congress in the 1994 election. Yet the Republicans' waiting game may not work much better than the president's genial smiles. For there are big differences between now and 1993-94.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike four years ago, there are few signs that Mr Clinton will veer to the unpopular left after his election. Rather than mulling a tax increase, he is committed to tax cuts. Rather than seeking a dramatic increase in the federal government's role in health care, he is set on modest advances. A month ago, it seemed possible that the trade unions' contribution to the Democrats' congressional campaign might force the new administration leftwards. But the unions' ads proved less effective than many had expected, freeing Mr Clinton to ignore their ideas.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is reflected in Mr Clinton's choice of second-term officials. Several of his more leftish advisers are on their way out: Robert Reich, the labour secretary; George Stephanopoulos and Harold Ickes, two White House officials; and possibly Henry Cisneros, the housing secretary. Meanwhile Mr Clinton's treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, and his new chief of staff, Erskine Bowles (see <a href="am3127.html">page</a>), are both conservative investment bankers. To cap it all, the president has let it be known that he hopes to appoint Republicans to his cabinet. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Mr Clinton stays on the centre ground, the Republicans' refusal to support his policies may look petty. On campaign finance, for example, Mr Clinton has declared his support for a bill that would offer candidates free television ads in exchange for voluntary spending limits, and would control the flood of cash to national parties. The Republican leadership, by contrast, scoffs at this bill, preferring to attack Democrats' fund-raising from foreigners. But the bill is sponsored, among others, by Senator John McCain, a respected Republican. On this issue, voters may give Mr Clinton credit for reaching across party lines while Republicans played politics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other issues on Mr Clinton's agenda may draw similar verdicts. It will be hard for the Republicans to block the president's education plans without looking mean. Nor can they object to incremental health reform; one law of this sort, to which many sound objections could have been raised, passed the Senate unanimously this summer. Even welfare, once a good issue for Republicans, may yet embarrass them. In the past, Republicans could attack Mr Clinton for blocking schemes that would make the supposedly indolent poor earn their own keep. Now that the new welfare law requires poor mothers to get work, Mr Clinton is demanding only that jobs should be found for them. Republicans can hardly object to that. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the end, all the squabbles over these parts of Mr Clinton's second-term agenda will matter less than the big one on the budget. Yet here, too, the Republicans may be on weaker ground than they suppose. If they wait for Mr Clinton to propose his own budget cuts, they will undoubtedly get ones that promise progress on the deficit, but which nonetheless preserve the president's claim that he is less harsh than his adversaries. The Republicans will then be faced with a tough choice. If they pass the budget, they will allow the president to claim victory for his plan; if they block it, they allow him to accuse them of reckless obstruction. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because of this, the Republicans may not stick to their waiting game for long. They will strive, instead, to come up with their own agenda for a second term, and to push it in parallel to the president's. This may bring them some success. On November 11th the Republicans let it be known that, by their count, the election had given them the votes to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. This had an immediate effect: the next day Mr Clinton softened his old opposition to the measure. Their appetites whetted by this easy victory, Republicans may soon be pushing other schemes. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of which suggests a paradox. A week ago, when the election results came in, Americans seemed to have voted for gridlock. They had not liked either party's schemes, and so they had sought to block both sides by dividing power between them. And yet, if the Republican waiting game does backfire, the opposite of gridlock may transpire. Mr Clinton may find that his policies sail through Congress; the Republicans may find that many of their ideas win Mr Clinton's support. Instead of one activist government, America might just get two of them.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Thrills, no; discipline, yes</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
ALL presidents tend to develop a growing sense of the importance of good management. As an aide to President Kennedy once said, "Everybody believes in democracy until he gets to the White House, and then you begin to believe in dictatorship, because it's so hard to get things done." Jimmy Carter at first thought he could get by without a chief of staff, but discovered the hard way that he was wrong. From the contrast between Mr Clinton's first chief of staff (his old Arkansas friend Mack McLarty, a nice man but a Washington novice) and his second (Washington-wise Leon Panetta, a huge success), Mr Clinton has had a clear lesson in what a vital post it is.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So vital that the president chose as his first post-election task the replacement of Mr Panetta, who wants to return to California. With some effort, Mr Clinton persuaded Erskine Bowles, a banker who learnt his trade with Morgan Stanley, to drop his new banking venture in North Carolina and return to Washington. The choice drew a warm reaction even from two usually hostile Republicans, Senators Jesse Helms and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina. They respect Mr Bowles not only for his business acumen, but also for his pedigree: his wife, Crandall, is from a prominent local textile family and his father grew up with Mr Helms in Monroe, North Carolina.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton met Mr Bowles only four years ago, when Mr Bowles was raising money for the 1992 campaign. They quickly bonded, not least on the golf course. Appointed to head the Small Business Administration, Mr Bowles set about reducing the voluminous paperwork for <font size=-1>SBA</font> loans to a single sheet. Then, as deputy chief of staff, he reorganised the president's schedule to allow more time for thinking. Even after he left the White House last January, Mr Clinton still turned to Mr Bowles for delicate tasks such as handling the resignation of Dick Morris, the president's political consultant, in the midst of a sex scandal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Businesslike" and "focused" are the words used to describe Mr Bowles by people who have worked with him. You will not hear from him any dreamy talk of bridges to the new millennium. Instead, in a deliberate southern drawl, you hear the sort of phrases found in business textbooks: "I believe in having an administration that has clearly defined goals, objectives and time lines such that it and its people can be held accountable." The Bowles regime promises few thrills and much discipline.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which is how it should be. Without the prospect of an election to concentrate the presidential mind, the need for discipline in the White House is all the greater. Bowlesian management should help with agenda-setting, too. For the past two years, Mr Clinton has proved himself to be brilliant on the counter-attack against a Republican Congress. But now the policy initiative is back with him. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike Mr Panetta, Mr Bowles does not have years of experience on Capitol Hill to help him in the delicate task of dealing with Congress. But he does have a keen sense of time-management, at a stage when time is precious. To put it in the language of the new administration, Mr Clinton's stock is now up, but typically the bull market for second-term presidents does not last long. <br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Hello, world</h1>

WHAT a rude interruption. Bill Clinton had hardly had time to celebrate his election victory. He was in the process of trying to put together a new foreign-policy team, one that could help him earn a distinguished place in the history books. He was about to set off to the Pacific for a bit of rest and a bit of diplomacy. And what should intrude? A foreign-policy crisis.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With memories still fresh of America's humiliation in Somalia early in Mr Clinton's first term, hurried decisions over sending troops to another African disaster area were not what the president would have wished for as an immediate post-election challenge. The situation in Zaire has all the potential for the sort of trouble that Americans are so wary of: complicated lines of command, the possibility of mission creep, fuzziness of objectives and of exit strategy. Awkwardly, the costs will complicate the administration's budget-balancing efforts. And embarrassingly, just as Mr Clinton was hoping for a second term marked by "indispensible" American world leadership, here was America struggling to keep up with an initiative promoted and headed by Canadians. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In truth, America was caught napping. First there was the distraction of the election, not a time when a president wants to talk about putting American soldiers in harm's way. Then there was the distraction of personnel changes. The president's top foreign-policy priority was reshuffling his team. The secretary of state, Warren Christopher, his sights on his own exit, set off on a final diplomatic journey. The Pentagon, whose boss, William Perry, is also on the way out, had the added diversion of a growing sexual-harassment scandal at army training camps.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the world does not wait obligingly for Americans to get their administrative house in order before posing its problems. Zaire is not the only matter calling for urgent attention. In Bosnia, which this week has seen the worst outbreak of fighting since the Dayton peace agreement nearly a year ago, decisions loom on the commitment of American troops for the longer term. Other issues--from <font size=-1>NATO</font> enlargement to the appointment of the United Nations secretary general, from the currently scratchy relations with France to the perpetually fraught policy towards Cuba--are crowding in.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this is complicated by the outcome of last week's election. Many of the senators who knew and cared most about the world have now left Congress. But one cantankerous presence remains as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: Jesse Helms, the senior senator from North Carolina. Mr Helms is not only stingy to a fault on the budget for foreign policy, meddling in his attempts to reorganise agencies and determined to intensify the cold war against Cuba. He is also deeply hostile towards the <font size=-1>UN</font>. In a recent article in <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, he argued that that this "power-hungry and dysfunctional organisation" was a threat to American national interests and that its bureaucracy needed to be cut at least by half; if it failed to reform, according to Mr Helms, America should withdraw from it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet in another sense the conditions for grappling with foreign-policy decisions are more benign than they have ever been under the Clinton presidency. When Mr Clinton first came to the White House, he tended to see such issues as an unwelcome distraction from his busy domestic agenda. Over the past four years, through many a stumble, he has gained experience and credibility. And now, with a relatively slim agenda at home, foreign policy offers a bigger field for Mr Clinton's energies, a worthy challenge for a maturing second-term president.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He should therefore welcome the intrusion of the outside world, with all its complications. A new foreign-policy team--in particular, a more dynamic secretary of state--can signal a new sense of activism. But an effective team needs strong leadership from its captain, the president himself.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In part, the president's task is one of salesmanship. He has to sell the idea of foreign troop deployments, for example, to an inward-looking nation and a sceptical Congress. Further trade liberalisation, of the sort he will be discussing with America's Asia-Pacific partners, is also a hard sell, which is why so little was said about it during the election campaign; but it would be a worthy second-term crusade, which could begin with an effort to persuade Congress to expand the North American Free-Trade Agreement to allow the entry of Chile. The president will have to convince Congress to approve the extension of <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s security guarantees to new members in Central Europe. He will need to make allies see the seriousness of America's security concerns (in their dealings with Iran, say) and make sure that enemies (such as Iraq) appreciate the serious consequences of any misbehaviour. Not least, there is the job of persuading Congress to provide adequate money for the conduct of foreign policy. Leadership does not come cheap.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Effective salesmanship is difficult if it comes in the context of a foreign policy conducted on a case-by-case basis. That has been the approach taken by Mr Christopher, on the assumption that the post-cold-war world remains too confusing, and its security challenges too diffuse, for any overarching vision or doctrine to have much practical value. It is high time to question that assumption and to work out a clear ordering of American interests, along with a clearer rationale for the resources needed to pursue them. That would facilitate the task of salesmanship-- and it would make America's foreign policy less reactive and more creative.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one would pretend that such clarity of purpose can come easily. It requires a formidable investment of time and effort. That is why Mr Clinton's designated time-manager--the next chief of staff, Erskine Bowles--should make sure that plenty of presidential "thinking time" is set aside for foreign policy. Too bad that it takes an African tragedy and Canadian prodding for America to wake up. But with the election out of the way, at least Mr Clinton is beginning to give foreign policy the attention it deserves.<br>

<h1>The world makes up its mind(s) about Zaire</h1>

<font size=1>KIGALI</font><p>
SHAMED by Canada, the United States at last this week declared its willingness to send troops to Zaire--albeit, it said initially, only "in principle" and "in a limited fashion". Its commitment will help clear the way for a United Nations mandate under Chapter 7 which will allow the force to deal firmly with anyone who obstructs it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Memories of American deaths in Somalia, the presidential election, the end of a reign at the State Department and anxiety about the cost of an open-ended military commitment in a political quagmire, all contributed to American hesitation. But in the end the humanitarian imperative once again is dragging in the armies of the rich, even before their screens have been filled with images of disease and death among the 1m-plus refugees in eastern Zaire. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Zaire is no Somalia, but the core of the mission, protecting humanitarian aid in a war zone, is similar. The rest of the world may want to see starving children saved, but this is not necessarily a priority for the region's governments, rebels and warlords. So what are the local agendas that an intervening force will bump up against? <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Zaire itself, for example, the government spokesman has called it treason for any aid agency to negotiate with the rebels in eastern Zaire, demanding that all aid go through Kinshasa. Top of any normal Zairean politician's agenda is his own rake-off; second, his future when President Mobutu Sese Seko has gone. Zaireans are also watching anxiously for other uprisings in parts of Zaire with a history of secession, though so far even the traditionally rebellious provinces of Shaba and Kasai are quiet. The eruption in Kivu seems to have united Zaireans in nationalist fervour against a "Rwandan invasion" which, they say, is aimed at establishing a Tutsi empire. Too bad that years of neglect of the region that is now so dear meant that no roads were built to it, so that Zaire's defeated troops in Kivu cannot be reinforced. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rebels too have strong views on food aid. Laurent Kabila, their leader, wants it for local Zaireans, so long as he can be identified with the distribution. But he does not want food to reach the Hutu refugee camps north and west of Goma that his troops are now attacking. On his mind is the prospect, or fantasy, of sweeping across Zaire and overthrowing the government in Kinshasa. His immediate task--vigorously under way on Thursday--is to defeat the remains of the old Rwandan army and the Hutu militiamen in the camps. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What do these Hutus think about food aid or multinational force? They are hard pressed by the rebels and must be desperate for food. Their fears that an intervention force may try to disarm or even arrest them are likely to prove false. But they have few friends. The Zairean government, which once supported them, is now out of reach and their former French allies will not help them unilaterally this time. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rwanda, the Americans' local ally, is the real winner in eastern Zaire. Despite appeals for the refugees to return, the Kigali government may not care whether they live or die, so long as they stop coming back across the border as guerrillas. It knows many took part in the 1994 genocide, and it might be happier if all disappeared in the jungles of Zaire. Its worry is that an intervention force will let the Hutu militiamen escape or regroup in new refugee camps. At the moment, with a buffer zone created by its allies, the Zairean rebels, Rwanda feels secure. Burundi too. Its military regime, pressed by international sanctions and Hutu guerrilla infiltrations from Zaire, has been given breathing space. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So much for regional politics. The outsiders are not neutral either. The French, once the only major foreign power in the region, are still hurt at criticism of their intervention in 1994, which saved lives but also--unavoidably, but not by mere coincidence--helped the perpetrators of genocide to escape to Zaire. They are bitter about the anglophone takeover of Rwanda, and further complain that the United States is giving unqualified support to a regime in Rwanda which is dominated by a minority, took power by force and shows no sign of allowing much democracy. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the crisis broke more than two weeks ago, the United States, like the Rwandan government, opposed sending even food aid, hoping that the trouble would drive the refugees back into Rwanda. Only last weekend the American ambassador to Rwanda asserted that military intervention was unnecessary. "The Americans are playing a power game," said a European diplomat in Kigali this week. "It matters much more to them to keep this Rwandan regime in power than to help the refugees." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rwanda is the latest in a chain of African countries stretching south from Eritrea that have become close allies of the Americans. It has had vital military aid from them. Last week it emerged that three others, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda, were to be given $20m worth of military equipment to fight Islamist Sudan. America may be reluctant to put its troops on the ground, but it has its ideas for the region.<br>

<p><b>Politics</b></p>
<h1>Polls apart</h1>

IF YOU read the <i>Sunday Times</i>, you recently learnt that Labour's lead over the Tories had "fallen to its lowest for nearly three years". If you read the <i>Guardian</i>, the Tories received "a powerful boost" with a five-point cut in Labour's poll lead. If you read <i>The Times</i> you were first told that "Blair surges ahead" but then that "Tory support has jumped". If, however, you read the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, an "ominous black cloud" still hangs over the Tories.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Divergent findings are not good for polling firms' credibility--and after their failure to predict the Tory win in the 1992 general election the polls do not have credibility to spare. The pollsters are therefore worried. <font size=-1>MORI</font> reacted to criticism of its first <i>Times</i> poll, which showed an unlikely-sounding 28-point Labour lead, by putting out a table of recent polls, published and unpublished, claiming most were in line with its<i> </i>finding. However, it also conducted a second poll for <i>The Times</i>, published on November 14th, which showed Labour's lead down from 28% to 17%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem is compounded because different firms publish results compiled on different bases. Some pollsters believe that crude results exaggerate Labour's lead. They argue that those who refuse to answer their questions include a disproportionate percentage of Tories, reluctant to admit the fact in today's hostile climate. They also point out that, when you ask people how they voted in 1992, more say "Labour" than "Tory", although the Tories won the election. This suggests that their samples may be biased towards Labour. They try to correct for these factors.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such adjustments are not yet proven to produce more accurate figures. So other pollsters prefer not to make them. Of the controversial recent polls, two (by <font size=-1>ICM</font> and <font size=-1>NOP</font>) which show the Tories doing well headlined their adjusted figures. The other three (the two <i>Times</i> polls by <font size=-1>MORI</font> and one by Gallup) did not. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, adjustment does not fully explain the differences. Even when you compare like with like, the results are all over the place. The adjusted Tory vote is put at between 30% (<font size=-1>MORI</font> 1) and 34% (<font size=-1>ICM</font> and <font size=-1>MORI</font> 2); Labour at between 47% (<font size=-1>NOP</font>) and 53% (<font size=-1>MORI</font> 1); the Labour lead at between 13% (<font size=-1>ICM</font>) and 23% (<font size=-1>MORI</font> 1). Two polls had Labour sharply up on the month and three had it down.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may be a run of bad luck. Over time, most samples will more or less accurately reflect the whole population, but individual samples may not. Internal evidence casts doubt on some of this month's samples. <font size=-1>ICM</font>'s, for example, showed that an unusually high proportion of those questioned said that they had voted Tory in 1992, while <font size=-1>MORI</font> 1's had an unusually high proportion saying they had voted Labour then. <font size=-1>ICM</font> scaled down its usual adjustments to allow for this, but it may be that they just happened on an unusually pro-Tory sample and <font size=-1>MORI</font> 1 a pro-Labour sample in the month.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the moment, all polls agree on one finding: Labour is miles ahead. As the election approaches, however, the margin seems sure to narrow. Pollsters will secretly pray that the margin between their findings narrows too. Otherwise voters may start to switch off polls just at the stage in the political cycle when they ought to be of greatest interest.<br>

<font size=1>EDINBURGH</font><p>
UNIONISTS like to warn nationalist-minded Scots of the awful things that would happen to their vulnerable economy, should they be silly enough to vote for devolution or independence. But a stockmarket index of Scottish companies' performance which became available on November 11th shows that Scotland's indigenous companies have performed better, over the past decade, than those of Britain as a whole.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The index has been compiled by the <i>Scotsman </i>newspaper, Reuters, a news and financial data agency, and <font size=-1>HSBC</font> James Capel, a stockbroking firm. They have tracked the share performance of the biggest 50 Scottish companies (those which have Scottish head offices or do most of their business from Scotland) quoted on the Stock Exchange from 1985 (see <a href="br1.gif">chart)</a>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Scottish firms are pretty small-- the index has a market capitalisation of &#163;32 billion, compared with the <font size=-1>FTSE</font> 100's &#163;670 billion. Banks and insurance firms (35% of the index) are over-represented; pharmaceutical firms and telecommunications companies are not represented at all. Yet despite these weaknesses, while the Scottish index closely followed the ups and downs of the <font size=-1>FTSE</font> index, the value of the Scottish companies has steadily grown at a faster pace: &#163;300 invested in Scottish firms in 1985 would now be worth &#163;1,000, whereas a similar sum invested in the <font size=-1>FTSE</font> 100 companies would have risen to &#163;800.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite Tory claims that Scottish nationalism frightens the markets, politics does not seem to have much effect on the index. Between August 1991 and March 1992, when opinion polls claimed to show that Labour was likely to win the 1992 election and when devolution and even independence were high on the Scots' agenda, the Reuters/Scotsman 50 index fell by 10%. But the <font size=-1>FTSE</font> 100 index also dropped by 8% over the same period.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Takeovers make more difference. In 1987, when <font size=-1>BP</font> bid for Britoil, a Glasgow-based oil firm, the Scottish index leapt up by 38%, three times more than the <font size=-1>FTSE</font> 100 index rose. This particular takeover, while it cheered investors, dismayed many Scots who feared that control of too many Scottish firms might be draining away to distant boardrooms, leaving a vulnerable branch economy north of the border.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But privatisation (also much deplored by Scots) has helped to reverse the takeover trend. Six of the companies in the index are former state-owned businesses which have all expanded by buying up rivals. Two, Scottish Power, an electricity generator, and Stagecoach, a bus operator, have snapped up enough firms in England to make them feared predators rather than juicy targets.<br>

<p><b>Civil service</b></p>
<h1>Mission impossible</h1>

SIR ROBIN BUTLER, the cabinet secretary, has a mission to resist the politicisation of Britain's non-partisan civil service. His latest target is Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This summer, Mr Heseltine instructed Whitehall civil servants to identify "cheerleaders" among providers of government services to speak up for the government's public-service reforms--ie, defend the Tories. One cabinet minister who learnt of the instruction ordered officials to bin it. Then, at Sir Robin's behest, Mr Heseltine withdrew. "A blatant abuse of government power," said John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, when news of the incident emerged this week. "No minister will tolerate the politicisation of the civil service in this country," Mr Heseltine retorted.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Allegations of politicisation keep popping up all the same. This summer the First Division Association, the mandarins' union, reported more than 20 complaints from members who had been asked to do work which might compromise their political neutrality. Examples included preparing material for election manifestos, altering official reports to provide a party political slant, and briefing for public-relations events during party conferences.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In theory, mandarins are better protected against this kind of thing than they have ever been. The rules set out in "Questions of Procedure for Ministers" say that ministers must not use public resources for party-political purposes. A new civil-service code protects civil-service ethics, and gives civil servants the right of appeal to Sir Michael Bett, the independent First Civil service commissioner, if they feel they have been asked to act improperly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Detailed instructions govern their relations with journalists. Yet more instructions lay down what civil servants may and may not do to cost Labour proposals. Roger Freeman, Mr Heseltine's deputy, on November 11th proposed further protection for them, offering to co-operate with Labour to put a new Civil Service Act on the statute book. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So why do allegations of impropriety keep surfacing? The immediate cause is the approach of the general election. Ministers are more and more desperate to win the propaganda war with Labour, and want Whitehall to provide the ammunition. Whitehall knows it may soon be serving new masters, and does not want to prejudice its acceptability to them. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there is a longer-term trend at work too. Thirty or forty years ago, the line between government and party matters was clearer. Politics intruded less into ministerial lives. They governed largely according to the advice of their civil servants, only rarely taking to the platform or the airwaves to score political points. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All that has changed. In their new book, "The State under Stress" (Open University Press, &#163;16.99), Sir Christopher Foster and Francis Plowden chart the increased politicisation of government. Ministers often take decisions without civil service advice. The system of cabinet committees has atrophied in favour of government by <i>ad hoc </i>cabals of ministers. Ministers allow themselves to be directly lobbied by <font size=-1>MP</font>s who are themselves often directly in the pay of commercial organisations. Moreover, a successful minister is a minister who is on <font size=-1>TV</font>--and when he is, his party expects him to score partisan points.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We thus have a world where the "government of the day", headed by ministers, is far more political than it used to be, and where partisan politics becomes ever more intense. No wonder civil servants find it harder and harder to draw lines between their duty to serve the government loyally and their equal duty to be non-partisan. Acts, appeals and codes cannot resolve such tensions--which may mean that Sir Robin's mission turns out to be impossible.<br>

<p><b>Complementary medicine</b></p><h1>The new-age NHS</h1><br><p><b>Unorthodox remedies such as aromatherapy and healing are becoming available on the NHS as doctors find they can do miracles for their budgets</b></p><p>AN ELDERLY woman goes to her doctor complaining of arthritis in her knees. He gives her some tablets but the next week she is back in the surgery complaining that the pills give her an upset stomach. She is given more tablets to treat this side-effect but is soon back again saying that the second set of pills made her ankles swell. She is in turn given tablets to treat this, which cause muscle cramps, requiring a fourth set of pills, and so on. By now, the woman feels sicker than when she started.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This sort of case, not uncommon, is one reason why the medical profession is abandoning its customary conservatism and becoming less dismissive of "new-age remedies", from osteopathy (which is on the verge of becoming orthodox) to faith healing (which is not). Even though most doctors still doubt the scientific validity of such treatments, they are increasingly prepared to use them, because they seem to work better on some types of patient than stuffing them with pills--and often at a lower cost.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The medical authorities have gradually adopted a softer line on their use, and many such treatments are now available on the National Health Service (<font size=-1>NHS</font>). Since doctors are prescribing them alongside the orthodox ones they learnt at medical school, they are now officially described as "complementary medicine". Until quite recently doctors could be struck off if they prescribed unconventional treatments. As recently as 1986 the British Medical Association (<font size=-1>BMA</font>) dismissed them as a "passing fashion". However, an exception has long been made for homoeopathy: this has been available on the <font size=-1>NHS</font> since its foundation in 1948, partly because of the royal family's patronage.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The increasing use of complementary therapies has mostly been the result of individual doctors acting on their own initiative. In order to study the implications for the <font size=-1>NHS</font> as a whole, the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts recently launched a detailed study of why doctors are prescribing complementary therapies, how much they are spending on them, and what they are doing to measure their effectiveness. A preliminary survey, in 1993, found that the <font size=-1>NHS</font> was spending at least &#163;1m a year on complementary medicine, but the new study is expected to show that the actual figure is far higher.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year, a survey by Sheffield University of 760 general practicioners found that 40% were offering some form of complementary therapy on the <font size=-1>NHS</font>, especially acupuncture (an ancient Chinese method which aims to cure patients by sticking needles into them), homoeopathy (the use of extremely dilute extracts of natural substances which cause symptoms similar to those being treated), osteopathy and chiropractic (which both involve manipulation of the joints). One doctor's surgery, in Cullompton, Devon, employs a healer who believes her powers come from God. The Royal Liverpool University Hospital offers aromatherapy (massage with plant oils) and reflexology (massaging points on the feet and hands which are supposedly linked to other parts of the body) to treat kidney, bowel and ear complaints.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Edzard Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University, says that, apart from osteopathy and chiropractic, there is little convincing evidence that there is anything to most complementary therapies other than the placebo effect, a phenomenon long recognised by doctors: patients can get better simply because they believe their treatment will work, even if they are given pills without any active ingredients. Studies of some treatments have been done, but often the methods used in such studies are flawed and open to bias. It may be that most, perhaps all, of the effectiveness of complementary therapies is attributable to the placebo effect.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet doctors have come to realise that the placebo effect itself can be a valuable therapeutic tool. Dr Vivienne Nathanson, head of ethics at the <font size=-1>BMA</font>, says conventional western medicine has not been much help in treating chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. So doctors are taking the pragmatic view that if a treatment seems to work, and has no harmful effects, then it is worth a try.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is the approach of Michael Dixon, the doctor whose surgery in Cullompton employs a healer. Dr Dixon says that, although the healer believes she is passing some form of divine energy to the patients, he carefully avoids expressing an opinion on the matter. As well as helping patients for whom no other treatment has worked, Dr Dixon has found that the healer has a soothing effect on his budget: in a rough survey of 50 patients who visited the healer, about a third needed fewer drugs, saving the <font size=-1>NHS</font> up to &#163;1,500 a year between them. The government's <font size=-1>NHS</font> reforms, which allow general practitioners to take over the funding of their patients' treatments, have given doctors a little more freedom over which treatments to choose. More importantly, the reforms have made doctors think harder about the costs and benefits of rival courses of treatment.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While softening its stance on unorthodox therapies, the <font size=-1>BMA</font> has also been pressing for the compulsory registration of those practising them. So far it has succeeded only with osteopathy. In February the government set up the General Osteopathic Council. When it is granted its full powers (probably some time next year), practising osteopathy without a licence from the council will become illegal. Until registration is extended to the other complementary therapies, it is unclear how far doctors and other medical staff can go: a health authority in south London recently found that tarot cards were being used at one of its drug-dependency clinics--it quickly put a stop to this. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clearly a line has to be drawn somewhere. The medical profession should certainly not get involved in pretending there are mystical forces at work in complementary therapies. And if, in future, rigorous studies find that a particular treatment has no scientific basis, patients should be told this. Human nature being what it is, many will probably be happy to give it a try nevertheless.

<h1>Cable television's long march</h1>

<font size=1>DENVER AND NEW YORK</font><p>
<p><b>The advent of the railway turned Britain's Victorian canal builders from technological leaders into industrial curiosities. Will satellite television have the same effect on John Malone and the rest of America's cable-TV barons?</b></p><br>
OPEN a copy of <i>USA Today</i> and your eye is likely to be caught by vast advertisements for satellite television. "Up to 60 pay-per-view movies every night", they promise, along with oodles of sport, a crystalline picture, and several hundred television and radio channels. All this for a mere $199 purchase of a pizza-sized satellite dish and a subscription not far out of line with the price of basic cable television.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such blandishments have had a disastrous effect on the shares of the cable-television industry--including those of Tele-Communications Inc (<font size=-1>TCI</font>), the firm with the largest cable systems (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). Only three years ago, Bell Atlantic, a regional Bell telephone company, offered to pay $35 a share for <font size=-1>TCI</font>, and John Malone, <font size=-1>TCI</font>'s boss, was being touted as the most powerful man in American media. Now the shares trade at just $13.50--"dirt cheap" according to Mr Malone, who points out that this valuation is more than covered by <font size=-1>TCI</font>'s non-cable assets: "Our cable company is selling at negative equity."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many critics say such a stockmarket valuation is fair. History is littered with examples of expensive capital assets that quickly became obsolete, just as Britain's canal network did within 30 years or so of being built; or that were worth owning only once the cost of constructing them had been largely written off, as is likely to be the case with Eurotunnel, which runs the Channel tunnel. In a world of fast-changing technology, the fixed networks of the cable systems look vulnerable. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Worse, unlike America's telephone companies, which also have extensive fixed networks, cable firms have huge debts. For each of its 14.5m subscribers, <font size=-1>TCI</font> has accumulated $1,000 of debt: a total of $14.5 billion. Time Warner, the second-biggest cable firm--and one in which <font size=-1>TCI</font> has an indirect 9% stake--has debts of more than $17 billion (see <a href="wb8445.html">page</a>). As Richard Parsons, its president and a down-to-earth former banker, points out, debt is a liability. "We have low inflation, moderate interest rates and a healthy economy. But what if that changes? All of a sudden, that debt's going to eat you up."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the past, the most worrying thing about the cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> industry for most bankers was that it was too successful (Congress periodically demanded that it cut rates). Now the success of satellite-<font size=-1>TV</font>, which since its launch in 1994 has won nearly 4m customers (maybe half of them from the cable industry), looks a more realistic threat. Put simply, satellite television is cheaper to deliver than cable-<font size=-1>TV</font>, and because--unlike cable--it is digital, it provides more choice.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The start-up costs for a satellite company are relatively low, notably because viewers themselves buy and erect the receiving equipment. For their investment, customers get up to 200 channels (whereas a cable system typically offers around 50-60); significantly better picture and sound quality; and, in the case of Direc<font size=-1>TV</font>, the market leader, an exclusive package of football games across the country. Satellite-<font size=-1>TV</font> thus appeals to sport and film fans, who are big spenders. No wonder Mr Malone grumbles that "satellite is a cherry-picking, cream-skimming technology."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That said, it is hard to think of how the cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> barons could have played their hand worse. For years, they have blathered on about offering 500 channels of television, various interactive services, high-speed Internet access and so on. None of these has yet come to pass. They can hardly blame viewers for choosing a future that they themselves have advertised. All the same, the outlook for their industry is not quite as bleak as the stockmarket thinks.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From the cable firms' point of view, the forthcoming war can be divided into two battlefields: defending their franchise in multichannel television and trying to win one for various interactive services. A glance at the numbers suggests that some of the gloom in the television market is overdone. Arthur Gruen of Wilkofsky Gruen, a New York firm of media analysts, notes that in 1995 cable added 2.2m subscribers, compared with 1.5m for satellite and 200,000 for wireless television--another rival, promoted by the telephone companies.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is partly because satellite-<font size=-1>TV</font> has its own drawbacks. For a start, each television set in a home needs its own expensive receiving equipment (an important flaw, according to Tom Wolzein of Sanford Bernstein, a Wall Street stockbroker, seeing that 55% of cable homes have more than one set). Cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> also offers local programming; satellite, at least for now, offers only a national package. The cable companies are also beginning to close the gap between the number of channels that they and their airborne rivals can offer. The big barrier is that much of their network can currently carry only analogue television; converting that to higher-capacity digital fibre would cost a fortune (roughly $250 per home).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now <font size=-1>TCI</font>, Time Warner and <font size=-1>US</font>West (which is buying Continental Cablevision, America's third-largest operator) are developing ways to push more channels through their existing systems. This month, for example, <font size=-1>TCI</font> launches a digital-television service that uses a proprietary compression technology called Imedia to double the current 55 or so channels that the company carries. Digital channels, delivered this way, will be available to most <font size=-1>TCI</font> customers by the end of 1998. Unlike satellite customers, boast <font size=-1>TCI</font> bosses, their cable customers will not have to pay extra to buy or lease receiving equipment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The aim is not only to halt the drift to satellite, but also to persuade existing subscribers to spend more, especially on pay-per-view services. So far, says Emily Green of Forrester Research, a consultancy in Boston, most of the rise in cable revenues has come from extending systems rather than from squeezing higher revenues from existing customers. (By contrast, satellite services, which offer a simple point-and-click way to order a film, have boosted pay-per-view revenues considerably). Mr Malone hopes that there will be a "huge surge of pay-per-view activity." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The signs are that cable customers buy more if they are offered more. In Atlanta, where <font size=-1>US</font>West Media has recently begun offering 100 channels, including 20 pay-per-view options, Doug Holmes, the company's chief financial officer, says that pay-per-view revenues have risen by more than 10%, and the proportion of homes that sign up for cable television is up from 60% to 65%.<br>
</p><p><b><b>A new vision</b></b><br>
Fighting a rearguard action (even a successful one) against satellite-<font size=-1>TV</font> is not quite the glamorous multimedia future that Mr Malone envisaged a few years ago. The only way that cable firms will begin to seem exciting again is if they can show that their networks can be used for interactive services. After all, why squabble over coaxing people into spending another $5 a month for films if they can be persuaded to pay $35 a month for high-speed Internet access, or even more for telephone calls?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once a cable system has been upgraded it should be able to offer all types of interactive services. But upgrading networks is costly, particularly if you are already knee-deep in debt. The cable firms are showing unfamiliar caution. <font size=-1>TCI</font> will eventually offer its new digital-<font size=-1>TV</font> customers an Internet service, for a few dollars a month, based on the World Wide Web. They will be able to order video shots of local news and weather, and take advantage of local advertising promotions. A smaller number of customers, whose networks will be expensively upgraded to offer high-speed Internet access first, will be carefully chosen-- from, for instance, university towns, full of wealthy computer addicts.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Local telephony, which the cable firms are now free to enter, offers a bigger target, but also requires even more investment. The idea of house-to-house combat with a cash-rich Baby Bell is far from enticing for most cable operators. However, this procrastination cannot last for long. Local cable firms are now ideal takeover targets (or "partners", as they prefer to put it) for long-distance telephone companies and Baby Bells from other areas who want to force their way into local telephony. <font size=-1>US</font>West, for instance, views its acquisition of Continental and its stake in Time Warner's well-clustered cable systems partly as a cheap way to break into other local markets.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the end, the problem for the cable barons is financial, not commercial. At the operating level their cash flow is strong; but they have too much debt to be able to make the most of their position. (Pointedly, <font size=-1>US</font>West boasts of being the only cable company with an investment-grade credit rating.) Many smaller cable firms will vanish into the maw of the telephone companies. As for Mr Malone, he mutters about buying back the cable side of <font size=-1>TCI</font> himself. Given current valuations, that may be a bargain.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Time for a change</h1>

<font size=1>NEW YORK AND ATLANTA</font><p>
WHILE all cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> companies are battered by competition from satellite channels, Time Warner, the second-largest, has a further big headache of its own: its corporate structure. Roughly half its 12m cable subscribers belong to networks that are owned by Time Warner Entertainment (<font size=-1>TWE</font>), a company in which Time Warner has a 75%<b> </b>stake and <font size=-1>US</font>West, a local telephone company, the remainder. One side effect of this is that Time Warner does not have direct access to some of the cash flow that is the main attraction of owning cable firms. Its Warner Brothers studio and Home Box Office, a profitable pay-television business, are also tied up in <font size=-1>TWE</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The stockmarket hates this messy structure almost as much as it dislikes Time Warner's involvement in cable. Could both problems be solved in one go? Only if Gerald Levin, the company's chief executive, can overcome his emotional attachment to cable. Mr Levin comes from the cable business and has long invested heavily in cable-TV assets. However, others within the company do not share his enthusiasm. "At the core, Time Warner is a content business," says Richard Parsons, the firm's president. "Cable is an enormous consumer of capital, and the capital it is consuming is not necessarily related to our content business." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Parsons is not a lone voice. The managers brought into the company from Turner Broadcasting, Ted Turner's television empire, which Mr Levin has just bought for $7.5 billion, also seem dismissive about cable's long-term future. John Malone, the boss of <font size=-1>TCI</font>, an even larger cable network that now holds a non-voting 9% stake in Time Warner, argues that the firm's shares "would do miraculously better if they spun off the cable business to their shareholders. So instead of owning a programming company that owns a cable company, I would own a programming company <i>and</i> a cable company." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the cable side of <font size=-1>TWE</font> were to be spun off, it could probably take with it roughly half of Time Warner's current debt mountain of $17.5 billion. But such a solution requires the agreement of <font size=-1>US</font>West. That relationship has been soured by Time Warner's acquisition-- without consulting the telephone company--of Turner Broadcasting.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, <font size=-1>US</font>West can demand a high price for agreeing to a solution. Mr Parsons, who is supposed to charm the telecoms company into a deal, claims that if <font size=-1>US</font>West will not co-operate, Time Warner could simply sell off "a big chunk" of its other cable holdings to pay off its debt. But this would not unscramble the relationship with <font size=-1>US</font>West. And there is an even bigger drawback to jettisoning cable. "To be a major programmer with no distribution isn't the greatest thing in the world," observes Mr Malone dryly.<br>

<h1>A Big Bang for Japan</h1>

<font size=1>TOKYO</font><p>
<p><b>The Japanese government has announced its intention to reform the financial system. Should its proposals be taken seriously?></b></p><br>
WHEN Japan's voters returned the Liberal Democratic Party to power in October after a three-year interregnum, most people assumed that the victors would quickly forget their election promises of "administrative reform"--shorthand for taking power over the economy out of the hands of Japanese bureaucrats. For once, the sceptics may be wrong. On November 11th Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister, promised that his government would undertake a sweeping deregulation of the country's financial system by 2001. Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the new finance minister, called the proposals "the equivalent of London's Big Bang".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In search of a good, if hackneyed image (earlier this year South Korea used the same phrase to describe its own financial-reform package), Mr Mitsuzuka may have been overstating his case. Few of these proposals are new; many were proposed by a government committee in August. Detail is lacking. Some important areas for reform have been ignored. And there will be opposition from vested interests, especially Japan's big securities firms, to those reforms that the government has proposed. But for all that, the prime minister has set a deadline and given his pledge. This time, at least, there seems to be the political will for serious reform. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;About time too. Bureaucrats and politicians alike appear to have realised at last that the glacial pace of Japan's previous financial reforms has strangled the country's economic recovery and thwarted Tokyo's pretensions to be an international financial centre. While it has been mired in red tape, the world's two other big financial centres, London and New York, have roared ahead. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tokyo also faces a growing challenge from Hong Kong and Singapore, which would both like to become Asia's main financial hub. Fed up with Japanese bureaucracy, some financial folk are already moving to Singapore and other centres with a lighter regulatory touch. They are not the only ones leaving town: over the past three years, 54 companies have delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. "Shock therapy is necessary. The alternative is for Tokyo to become a local market," a senior bureaucrat at the finance ministry told foreign journalists this week.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan's over-regulated and compartmentalised financial system is a product of both accident and design. After the second world war, the Americans imposed a version of their own Glass-Steagall act, which separates commercial and investment banking, in the shape of Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Law. But bureaucrats also designed the financial system to make it easier to channel savings into favoured industries: the more segregated the various parts of the financial sector were, the easier it was to control the institutions through which savings were channelled. For example, long-term credit banks made long-term loans to industry. In addition, they were given a monopoly on issuing fixed-rate debt. Commercial banks took deposits and lent at floating rates. All interest rates were set by the finance ministry.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much of this apparatus is still intact. Banks face fierce competition for corporate business, especially now that big companies can tap the capital markets themselves. But the regulations prevent bankers from meeting this challenge by underwriting equities. They are also barred from selling insurance. Other sorts of financial firms also have their hands tied: securities firms cannot offer banking or insurance services, and insurance firms cannot go into banking or securities.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Still too tight</b></b><br>
The sharp divisions between businesses have been relaxed a bit, but only gradually. Interest rates began to be liberalised in 1984. At the end of 1993, banks were finally allowed to underwrite corporate bonds (though not equities) through subsidiaries. And from the beginning of October, life and non-life insurers have been free to enter each other's business, again via subsidiaries. In spite of all this, the boundaries that remain between businesses are still substantial.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such tight control has become not just redundant, but positively harmful. To enable financial firms to earn a crust, bureaucrats have allowed the cost of many financial products and services to remain high by approving cartels and discouraging aggressive competition. Insurance premiums are fixed by bureaucratic fiat. Two decades after they were scrapped in America, and a decade after they disappeared in Britain, fixed commissions on all but the biggest share trades still raise the cost of buying equities in Japan.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Hashimoto now says that he wants to do away with this rigid financial system. Insurers, banks and securities firms, he promises, will be allowed to enter one another's business. Legal barriers separating the different sorts of banks are to be scrapped. Stock commissions and insurance premiums will be deregulated. The asset-management business will be opened up and the detailed rules that govern how pension funds allocate their money will be abandoned for a more general prudential requirement.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Light the fuse. . .</b></b><br>
That is not all. The quality of financial information disclosed by companies will be improved by the adoption of accounts "consistent" with those of other developed countries. In short, assets will be valued at their proper market price, not the price at which they were bought. Pension funds will have to do this from next April. (Given the precarious state of many Japanese banks, however, the government will surely give them much longer to make a change that will make their financial situation appear far gloomier.) <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With a list of reforms this long, it would seem churlish to quibble that the government is not planning to do enough. Yet conspicuously absent from its "to do" list is any mention of the privatisation of the banking operations of the post office. Japan's post office is the world's biggest bank. Since it does not have to worry about shareholders, it can offer higher rates than the banks. And its deposits are fully guaranteed by the government. Small wonder, given fears about the health of private banks, that its deposits have grown by over 11% since 1994. Banks claim, justifiably, that a publicly-owned post office distorts competition. On November 11th Shunsaku Hashimoto, the chairman of Japan's bankers' association, chastised the government for not tackling this question. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such carping aside, the government's deregulatory proposals are generally excellent in intent. Does it have the stomach to push them through? The finance ministry claims that it has. As evidence, it says that a bill to scrap the law that allows only licensed banks to deal in foreign exchange will be introduced in the next session of the Diet (parliament). This, however, is fairly uncontroversial. Few, if any, institutions will be put out of business. Other steps will be implemented only if the government is prepared to put up with the squeals of pain from those whose profits are threatened by deregulation. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chief squealers will be Japan's 230 securities firms. Their income comes from commissions on share-trading and from selling mutual funds. They are already suffering from a sluggish Japanese stockmarket: turnover has fallen 75% since the late 1980s. Deregulation of stockbrokers' commissions, and the entry of big banks and insurers with lots of branches into the equity and mutual-fund business, will put many brokers out of business. The prime minister says that he will tolerate such bankruptcies. Perhaps he will. But a fear of letting firms fail probably means that the government will shy away from scrapping the Article 65 restrictions altogether. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead, the authorities are likely to go for a more convoluted solution. To "moderate" competition throughout the financial industry, it seems likely that firms will be allowed to enter markets from which they have hitherto been excluded only by setting up a new business under the umbrella of a holding company. First, however, holding companies, which were banned after the second world war, will have to be legalised. Even then they will prove attractive to financial firms only if the government introduces a consolidated tax system, so that profits in one part of a company's operations can be offset by losses in another. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Implementing all of this in five years and making sure that vested interests do not neuter the proposals will be a Herculean task. A lot of people think that the government is not up to it. There have been many deregulatory promises unkept in the past. And when change has occurred, it has been frustratingly slow. But there now seems to be a consensus among politicians and bureaucrats that the Japanese financial system needs root-and-branch reform. It is surely telling that a top official at the finance ministry, the country's most powerful bureaucracy, says that, in effect, Japan should have a more freewheeling financial system before its current one makes the country an also-ran. <br>

<h1 align=center>Now tell the truth</h1>


O ZYMANDIAS built his colossus in the desert; Mitterrand filled Paris with fantasies in glass; Franklin Roosevelt erected a welfare state. The chance of political longevity turns the mind to grandiose things. Before his re-election, Bill Clinton promised to build a bridge to the 21st century. Will this be another of his glittering rhetorical constructions, with spans of hot air and no visible means of support? Or could it be, against expectation, a solid and useful monument? <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much will depend on Mr Clinton's estimate of how much America loves him. His 49% of the popular vote was an improvement on 1992; but it was neither hearty, nor a mandate. The fact that the Senate and the House remain Republican shows the limits of public trust in Mr Clinton and his party. Surprisingly, the divided government of the past two years proved rather productive; more important, it brought out a vein of responsibility in the president. Americans seem to want to make sure that a second-term Clinton preserves that virtue, and eschews both hubris and leftish Grand Designs. Yes, they like Mr Clinton; but not that much.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The president, who could never be accused of insensitivity to the public mood, comes into his new term knowing that flexibility has brought his presidency back from the dead. He knows, too, how to make people love him more. His last campaigning year has brought a succession of small presents to the virtuous middle class from a benevolent government: parental leave, college tuition credits, <font size=-1>V</font>-chips to protect children from video nastiness. A hundred such tiny bricks might build a Clinton monument. But it might not be enough for him; and it would certainly not be enough for America.<b><br>
</p><p><b>Unpalatable subjects</b></b><br>
All through the dreary campaign of 1996, certain issues went virtually unmentioned. They are the ones America's people and politicians find hardest to face. They are not amenable to minimalist measures, and offer no immediate return of popular gratitude. Mr Clinton hates that. But the beginning of a second and last term is the best chance--indeed, the only chance--for this shifting and ingratiating character to try to bring America face to face with the facts. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Top of the list come the inner cities, where a bundle of different social pathologies are combining to produce a deeply demoralised, unemployable and even criminal population. A Democrat of the Johnson school might suppose that only massive federal investment could save these places. Mr Clinton knows he does not have that option. But the country is full of local experiments in ghetto housing, welfare, transport and day care which, with visible presidential encouragement and a little well-directed federal money, could be applied more generally. Mr Clinton will have no giant government programmes to announce; but he could make sure that America does more than turn its back. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Part of this policy might involve reforming America's public schools: an issue Mr Clinton has recognised, but without much courage. Despite the tiny federal share of the education budget, the president is not powerless as an advocate. He could lend his support (underlined by careful disposition of existing federal funds) to charter schools that are properly independent, not suborned by his friends in the teachers' unions; to experimental voucher plans; and, most of all, to a standardised system of national examinations. And he should do so with one end in view: to persuade Americans that they are behind in the race to produce competent workers, and that this is a danger to the country's economic health.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor need straight talk end there. During the campaign, the economic and fiscal cycles greatly helped Mr Clinton. But the recovery is already showing signs of slowing down, while the deficit is set to rise again. This means that Mr Clinton can no longer dissemble over where his spending cuts must fall if he wants, as he claims, to leave the legacy of a balanced budget. He should name departments, agencies and programmes; and, most of all, he must tackle middle-class entitlements. This year, he screwed up his courage to end the biggest entitlement for the poor; but the poor are easily dealt with. Mr Clinton's name would ring more loudly down the years if he could revamp Social Security and cut the soaring cost of Medicare, two jealously protected programmes that are on the brink of failing to provide for their dependants. <b><br>
</p><p><b>The necessary focus</b></b><br>
The list could go on. It could include trade (show that America has laid the ghost of protectionism by abandoning talk of "fair trade" and pushing for <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> expansion); racial quotas (admit that current programmes have caused as much resentment as progress, and that they should be either ended or recast to help the poor); and foreign policy (persuade Americans that their involvement in Bosnia, or in other unstable but deserving places, must last if necessary beyond the election cycle and their own comfort level). It is a long agenda. But it is not entirely new. Mr Clinton had already started on some of it, before getting fidgety or hamstrung by his need for the love and gratitude of the voters. Now that that love has been more or less returned, what is needed is a focus on hard facts.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tricky words indeed for the glowing re-elected president: "focus" and "hard facts". Neither has ever been his strong point; and even as he celebrates, he knows that Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater special prosecutor, also has those two themes in mind. Grand strategies and bridges may soon tumble down in partisan strife, or may never be erected. Yet forthrightness about his private dealings, if it comes to that, might not doom him, as some suppose; and forthrightness about the country's failings would be a positive service. Bill Clinton's skill so far--his consummate skill--has been to persuade Americans that by nimble repositioning and soothing rhetoric they are being well-governed. This is not wholly implausible: <i>faute de mieux</i>, it got him re-elected. Now, however, he has a chance to do something really great: to tell the truth.<br>

<h2>Yes, he won</h2>
<p><b>Bill Clinton </b>won the American presidential election with 49% of the popular vote against Bob Dole's 41%, and 31 states against his 19. He becomes the first Democrat to be elected twice since Franklin Roosevelt. But the Republicans held on to both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Ross Perot won 8% of the vote. Less than half of the eligible voters cast their ballots, a record low.</p>
<p><b>Warren Christopher</b> resigned as secretary of state, but will stay on until Mr Clinton's inauguration in January. Several other team members, including William Perry, the defence secretary, Mickey Kantor, the commerce secretary, and Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, are also to go. </p>
<p>Voters in California approved by a large margin a proposition to end <b>racial quotas </b>in state contracting and employment.</p>
<p>In <b>Nicaragua</b>, expecting official (but still provisional) results of its October 20th elections on November 7th, the Sandinists accused the seemingly victorious Liberal Alliance of fraud. They demanded a fresh vote in two big provinces, and called a day of "civic protest"--peaceful, apparently--on November 8th. </p>
<h2>Hell in Zaire</h2>
<p>All parties in the war in eastern <b>Zaire </b>have agreed to accept a multinational force to save refugees, but few countries have offered troops. France wants military intervention; European Union aid ministers met to discuss proposals. More than a million people, mostly Hutu refugees, have been left without food or shelter after aid agencies were driven out of the region by fighting. Having seized part of eastern Zaire, rebels offered a three-week ceasefire. </p>
<p>Leaders of big <b>third-world countries</b>, meeting in Zimbabwe, accused rich countries of trying to dictate rules of world trade. One big gripe: rules on labour conditions, seen by the poor as a way of negating their lower wages. But Bangladesh, which supplies half of Europe's <font size=-1>T</font>-shirts, said it no longer used child labour in its textile factories. </p>
<p>Israel's infrastructure minister, Ariel Sharon, unveiled a plan to settle 100,000 more colonists in the occupied <b>West Bank</b>. Not a government plan, said a spokesman.</p>
<p>In <b>Algeria</b>, Islamist guerrillas seized ten women and three children at a village and slit their throats. Later, in another village, 31 more people were murdered the same way.</p>
<h2>Interregnum</h2>
<p>Russia's president, <b>Boris Yeltsin</b>, took back presidential powers less than 24 hours after handing them over to his prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, to undergo a heart operation. Doctors said the seven-hour quintuple bypass went well.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Robert Tatum, an American businessman, was<b> murdered in Moscow</b>. He had been seeking control of the city's Radisson-Slavyanskaya hotel. In Ukraine Evheny Sherban, a prominent businessman and member of parliament, was also murdered.</p>
<p><b>Russia's trade unions </b>said that up to 2m workers went on strike to demand payment of $7 billion in unpaid wages by federal and local governments. Some parts of Russia are running short of food and fuel as winter approaches.</p>
<p>The European Commission said 12 of the 15 <font size=-1>EU</font> countries would meet the Maastricht treaty's requirement for <b>budget deficits </b>of no more than 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> in 1997 if they are to join <font size=-1>EMU</font>. Britain, Italy and Greece were the exceptions. But the European Monetary Institute, precursor to a central bank, felt that progress towards deficit reduction has been too slow.</p>
<p>Voters in <b>Romania and Bulgaria</b> rebuffed ex-communists and supported reformists. Romanians made the Democratic Convention the largest party, and in his race for re-election President Ion Iliescu holds a slim lead over Emil Constantinescu, the Democratic Convention candidate, before a run-off on November 17th. In Bulgaria's presidential election, Petar Stoyanov, a pro-reform lawyer, defeated the Socialist candidate, Ivan Marazov.</p>
<p>Allies of Serbia's president, <b>Slobodan Milosevic</b>, easily won elections for the federal Yugoslav parliament and the parliament of Montenegro, the second republic in the Yugoslav federation.</p>
<p>The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development predicted that growth in<b> former communist economies</b> would accelerate next year from a projected 4% rate in 1996. But all of them, it said, must do more to reform their financial systems and improve infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Bhutto out</h2>
<p>Benazir Bhutto was dismissed as prime minister of <b>Pakistan </b>by the country's president. The president said her government was incompetent and corrupt; it, and parliament, were also dismissed. Miss Bhutto was put under house arrest, but later freed. A general election is to be held in February.</p>
<p>Japan's Liberal Democratic Party won over enough defectors to form a government. <b>Ryutaro Hashimoto </b>was formally reappointed prime minister.</p>
<p>A <b>Khmer Rouge commander </b>and 300 fighters became the latest rebel group to defect to the Cambodian government. But Pol Pot, the rebel leader, was reported to be preparing to renew his attacks on government forces.</p>
<p>A senior official in Washington said America had revised its view, and saw no prospect of <b>Afghanistan's civil war </b> coming to an early end.</p>

<h2>Engaged</h2>
<p>In the biggest-ever foreign takeover of an American company, <b>BT</b>, a British telecoms firm, agreed to pay around $21 billion for the 80% of America's <b>MCI Communications</b> that it does not already own to create a transatlantic giant called Concert. With annual revenues of almost $38 billion, Concert will be the world's fourth-largest telecoms company.</p>
<p>(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>International <b>mergers and acquisitions</b> rose to $181.7 billion in the first nine months, and were on target for a record year even before <font size=-1>BT</font>'s monumental move. More money was spent on fewer targets and the greatest activity was across the Atlantic; America invested $11.7 billion in Britain, which reciprocated with $11.4 billion--a figure dwarfed by <font size=-1>BT</font>'s acquisition.</p>
<p>Invesco, a British fund manager, also did its bit by paying $1.6 billion for <b>AIMManagement Group</b>, the biggest foreign purchase yet of an American mutual-fund firm. The combined group, Amvesco, will combine Invesco's strength in retail funds with <font size=-1>AIM</font>'s big stockbroker network in America.</p>
<h2>Stormy Sky</h2>
<p><font size=-1>BS</font>ky<font size=-1>B</font> delayed the launch of a Time Warner channel in Britain as the spat between <b>Rupert Murdoch</b>, whose News Corp owns 40% of the <font size=-1>BS</font>ky<font size=-1>B</font> network, and <b>Ted Turner</b>, whose cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> outfit is now owned by Time Warner, worsened. Time Warner has refused to allow a 24-hour news channel from News Corp's Fox on to its New York city cable system. </p>
<p>Italy's Carlo De Benedetti sold his 27.4% stake in <b>Valeo</b>, a car-parts maker, for FFr6.5 billion ($1.3 billion). Because Valeo is that rarest of beasts-- a successful French company in a competitive industry-- many in France wanted it to remain in safe French hands. Their wish was granted: <font size=-1>CGIP</font>, a local holding company, bought 20.3% of the shares, with the rest going to a French financial firm and to J.P. Morgan, <font size=-1>CGIP</font>'s adviser.</p>
<p>In an effort to boost shareholder value, <b>Hoechst</b>, a giant German chemicals company, said it will seek a listing in New York next year. It will also divide itself into six subsidiaries, one of which may be separately quoted.</p>
<p>America's fourth-largest retailer, <b>J.C. Penney</b>, jumped into the fast-consolidating drugstore business by agreeing to buy <b>Eckerd </b>for $2.5 billion and assuming $760m of its debt. The deal will make J.C. Penney the second-largest drug retailer in America.</p>
<p>In Europe, the battle for control of <b>Lloyds Chemists</b>, a British drug retailer, intensified. Gehe of Germany reckons that it has pipped Britain's UniChem with a cash offer of &#163;650.6m ($1.1 billion) for Lloyds. But the contest could well continue.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>

<h2>Mopping up</h2>
<p>Determined to cleanse its Augean stables, Japan's new bad-loans agency began bankruptcy proceedings against <b>Sueno Kosan</b>, a property firm that borrowed heavily from the sick mortgage companies at the core of Japan's banking crisis. With over &#165;600 billion ($5.3 billion) in debt, it will be Japan's biggest-ever bankruptcy. More will follow.</p>
<p>The dollar fell sharply against <b>the yen</b> after Eisuke Sakakibara, a senior official at Japan's finance ministry, said in a newspaper interview that he thought the dollar's recovery from its sharp slide last year was about to finish. Japanese bond prices also fell after he described the market's view of the economy as too pessimistic.</p>
<p>The Hungarian government gave <b>ABN Amro</b>, a Dutch bank, the go-ahead to buy an 89% stake in <b>Magyar Hitel Bank</b>, the country's fifth biggest bank by assets. <font size=-1>ABN</font> Amro's bid was chosen ahead of another from Austria's Creditanstalt.</p>
<p>A grand jury in New York is examining whether criminal charges can be laid against some executives<b> </b>of <b>Texaco</b>, an American oil company. The move came after tape transcripts submitted in a discrimination suit brought by some black employees revealed executives using racist terms and discussing whether to destroy papers requested by the employees' lawyer.</p>
<p>Russia's "emergency commission" for <b>tax collection </b>is investigating state-owned Almazy Rossii-Sakha (<font size=-1>ARS</font>), which has a near-monopoly of Russian diamond production. The commission wants details of <font size=-1>ARS</font>'s dealings with De Beers of South Africa, which operates an international diamond cartel, and an explanation of the firm's $570m in debts and its failure to pay dividends even though it had $1.4 billion of sales last year.</p>
<h2>Flying high</h2>
<p>In what could be the biggest-ever order for Europe's <b>Airbus</b> consortium if all the options go through, <b>USAir</b> ordered 120 single-aisle aircraft valued at $5 billion, with options on a further 280. Airbus also announced a price of $198m for its proposed 550-seater plane-- matching Boeing's planned price for a similar aircraft.</p>
<p><font size=-1>(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>IATA</font> members--250 <b>international airlines</b>--are still on route to make record profits of $5.5 billion this year, but earlier forecasts have been trimmed because of a jump in fuel costs. Morevover those profits are equivalent to a mere 4% return on revenues of $129 billion; combine that with higher costs from increasing regulation and many international airlines still look vulnerable.</p>
<p><b>British Airways</b> won permission from a French court to take over Air Libert&eacute; in partnership with Banque Rivaud. It will invest a FFr440m ($86m) in the defunct regional airline and merge it with <font size=-1>TAT</font>, another regional French carrier that it already owns. <font size=-1>BA</font> also reported a 9.3% rise in first-half profits, to &#163;470m ($718m).</p>

<h1 align=left>Dial M for merger</h1>


<p><b>BT and MCI are following airlines down the runway to a global free-for-all</b></p><br>
AS THEY jetted back and forward across the Atlantic last month, plighting their troth, did the bosses of Britain's <font size=-1>BT</font> and America's <font size=-1>MCI</font>, two telecoms giants, pause to ponder the parallels between the airlines that flew them and their own industry? If so, they may well have felt a little smug. Airlines, like telephone companies, were once fat monopolies, relying on national and international restrictions to shore up their profits. Now, at least in some markets, both types of firm face stiff competition. But while airlines find it hard to make fat profits, even during a boom, telephone companies are rolling in money. <font size=-1>BT</font> is using some of its enormous cash pile to finance its $21 billion merger with <font size=-1>MCI</font>. Why are telephone companies so flush and airlines so poor?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a few years' time, that question will seem anachronistic. For the deal, which is the largest takeover ever of an American company by a foreign one, is actually a bit of seatbelt-fastening in advance of a bumpy flight. While many airlines have been living with competition for years as deregulation has spread from America to Europe, most telephone companies are still protected in their local or national markets. Even in much of America, the monopolies of most of the regional Bells are, for now, intact. Where legal protection has gone, the grip of a former monopolist is hard to dislodge. In Britain, which has a regulator, Oftel, that is determined to help newcomers, <font size=-1>BT</font> still controls nine-tenths of the market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In future, however, it will be harder for even the most profitable telecoms company to dodge greater competition. In the airline industry, technical novelties such as wide-bodied jets have helped to cut costs. Prices have broadly followed. In telecoms, the impact of innovation has been far more dramatic--the cost of delivering an ordinary telephone call is now about one-thousandth as much as it was in the late 1950s--while prices have fallen much more slowly. But not for much longer. Technological change is already creating choice: many customers are still stuck with only one local telephone company, but they already have the option of several sorts of wireless telephone, of cable telephony in a few countries, and of callback services and Internet telephony as ways around excessive international charges.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The world's big telephone companies can see where all this will lead. Falling prices will stimulate demand, as they have done in air travel, but they will also dent profits. Only the strongest, most efficient firms will survive. Just as airlines have formed international alliances to share codes on busy routes to fill their planes, so <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font> have recognised the need for a global alliance to offer multinational businesses an end-to-end telephone service. The merged group will turn Britain's telephone network into a sort of virtual Heathrow, scooping up calls from all over Europe and funnelling them across the Atlantic. Because the two companies will be able to carry a call all the way, they will not have to make costly settlement payments for using other networks.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is this good news for customers? It is tempting to draw another parallel with the airline business. When, in June, British Airways and American Airlines announced what was, in some ways, tantamount to a merger, rivals argued that <font size=-1>BA</font>'s dominance of landing slots at Heathrow would reduce competition: together, the two firms would control more than 60% of flights between Britain and the United States. Without a free market in aviation, guaranteed by an open skies agreement between the two countries, customers could suffer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Might the <font size=-1>BT</font>/<font size=-1>MCI</font> deal have a similar effect? America's <font size=-1>AT&T</font> is already complaining that the British telephone market is less open than it appears. But in telecoms, much more so than in aviation, Britain's rules favour newcomers. Oftel has done far more to rig the odds in the domestic market against <font size=-1>BT</font> than America's Federal Communications Commission has done in the case of <font size=-1>AT&T</font>. And the market for international calls from Britain is about to be thrown open when the government next month licenses 46 new competitors, including <font size=-1>AT&T</font> and 21 other American companies. Unlike international airlines, those firms will be able to operate without constraints on the prices that they charge, or the number of calls that they carry. <b><p>
Anticipating the death of distance</b><br>
In merging, <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font> are making a bid to be one of a handful of global telecoms carriers in the next few decades. Although their merger is basically a defensive one (see <a href="wb8436.html">page</a>), it will also create new opportunities. So long as the two firms can overcome the formidable problems that cross-border mergers inevitably throw up, they should prosper.  For governments, the deal holds two lessons. The first is that privatisation helps firms to become world-beaters. It is no coincidence that <font size=-1>BT</font>, which was floated in 1984, is in far better shape than bloated European rivals such as Deutsche Telekom, which is only now gearing up for privatisation, and France T&eacute;l&eacute;com, which is still run partly by civil servants. The second lesson is that privatisation is not enough. What has driven <font size=-1>BT</font> to this deal is tough regulation at home that ensures competition. That battling for business in domestic markets is a good preparation for battling for it elsewhere may seem obvious. But in many countries, it is a truth that is only now beginning to dawn. Time to dial <font size=-1>C</font> for competition.<br>

<h1>The last best campaign</h1>

<font size=1>LITTLE ROCK</font><p>
LONG before the voting finished on November 5th, street vendors in Little Rock were doing a brisk business in <font size=-1>T</font>-shirts with a spoof front-page story from the <i>Arkansas Democrat Gazette</i>. It declared a resounding victory for Bill Clinton. The <font size=-1>T</font>-shirt sellers, like everyone else, had been reading the polls. And the actual results brought no surprise. The only real tension was over the size of Mr Clinton's victory (big, but no landslide) and whether it would help the Democrats recapture at least one of the houses of Congress (it didn't). Shamefully, early estimates suggest that only 49% of eligible voters bothered to vote, the lowest turnout since 1924. (See <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, the final days of the presidential campaign managed a sense of sleepless drama worthy of this great exercise in democracy. Recalling that the first time he had fought round the clock for his country was on the battlefields of Italy in 1945, Mr Dole took off on a 96-hour dash across 20 states with barely a pause for rest, before arriving to vote in his native Russell, Kansas. "I couldn't think of anything else," he explained. "It's my last option." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The "Marathon Man", as he called himself, travelled day and night from diner to parking lot, from airport tarmac to truck stop. To preserve his fading voice, he kept his speeches short and drank "Throat Coat" herbal tea. The valiant effort restored some of the respect that Mr Dole had been in danger of losing in his generally hapless campaign. It was a reminder of the story of his life: an endurance test, and one that he survived.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He might even have dared believe his own brave predictions of victory. For once, he was capturing the imagination, and his opponent was on the defensive over foreign campaign contributions. The race seemed to be narrowing as undecided voters made up their minds, and one tracking poll briefly suggested Mr Dole might just win. The wee hours of Tuesday morning found him in Independence, Missouri, paying homage to Harry Truman, the model for come-from-behind triumph.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it was not to be. Valiant as Mr Dole's final effort was, it also smacked of desperation, and drew attention to one of his main vulnerabilities: his age. Mr Clinton, on a sleepless marathon of his own, looked relentlessly vigorous as he moved from the sunshine of California to the first snows of New England and on to the autumnal colours of the mid-west.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This, as Mr Clinton repeatedly pointed out, was the final campaign of a man who has been running for some office or other for the past 23 years. The last day of the last campaign began with a nostalgic visit to New Hampshire, birthplace of his 1992 comeback. The president moved on to Ohio, Kentucky and Iowa before holding his final rally in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. There, about to leave after his speech and the handshakes along the rope line, he suddenly turned and went back to the podium, waving and striding the stage, hanging on to the last minutes of the campaigning life. Then he was off to Arkansas for his triumphant homecoming.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His triumph is the sweeter because it had looked so improbable after the Republican surge in 1994. The Republicans looked forward to 1996 as the "confirming" election, the year that would give them control of the White House as well as of Congress. Instead, Mr Clinton not only won, but he won with nearly 50% of the popular vote to Mr Dole's 41%. Ross Perot, who took 19% of the vote four years ago, managed only 8% this time as the candidate of his new Reform Party. It could be argued that in 1992 Mr Clinton owed his victory to Mr Perot; not so in 1996. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet even as the voters rewarded the president, they also restrained him. If this election "confirmed" anything, it was the status quo. Republicans held on to the House of Representatives for the first time in 68 years, and increased their majority slightly in the Senate. So much for theories about presidential "coat-tails". Eleven governors' races left the split between the parties unchanged (32 Republican governors, 17 Democrats, one independent). Across the country, it was a good day for incumbents.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With a healthy economy and, of late, a government getting down to business, a reasonably contented electorate decided to keep things much as they were. Neither party can make extravagant claims for a "mandate". Both have to reckon with a political era that is neither of the right nor of the left, but one of extreme competitiveness, notably over what might be called the three "<font size=-1>G</font>s": geography, gender, and the role of government.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Take geography first. On the face of it, the electoral map looks straightforward. Mr Dole carried a swathe of loyally Republican states in the West and the South; Mr Clinton took most of the rest, including bellwether states such as Ohio. Look closer, and the picture is more complicated. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By winning Arizona, which last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1948, and the huge prize of Florida, which voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976 but has been Republican ever since, Mr Clinton showed that the Republicans cannot take their traditional strongholds for granted. The president's defence of Medicare played well with retired folk in both those states. In the north-east, Mr Clinton swept 11 states that had all voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984. Much as conservative southern Democrats turned against liberal Democratic presidential candidates from the 1960s, so the social conservatism of the Republican Party's ascendant southerners now alienates the voters of the north-east. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, the "gender gap" was as wide as it has ever been. Among men, according to the Voter News Service exit polls, the contest was a tie, 44% for each of the main candidates. Among women, Mr Clinton romped home by 55% to 37%. He did so by talking engagingly about issues that women care most about, such as education and family leave. Henceforth, the competition for women's votes will intensify.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Women also tend to look more favourably than men on government activism, the third big area of competition between the parties. It is true that Mr Clinton won by running as a conservative, reforming welfare, promising to balance the budget and proclaiming the era of big government to be over. But it is also true that he won by insisting that government action can help people in their ordinary lives, in contrast to the harsh anti-government message of Republican revolutionaries. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How much action will actually happen? On a balmy election night in Little Rock, the president spoke of the need to put country ahead of party. The election, he emphasised, had shown the strength of the "vital centre" in America. Americans could achieve so much if only they could work together as one big happy family.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But any sense of togetherness will be hard to maintain. Mr Clinton's cabinet is already being shaken out, with four members--including the secretary of state, Warren Christopher, and the secretary of defence, William Perry--offering their resignations. The Democrats generally, remarkably united behind their president for this election, are likely to be a less orderly bunch from now on. For their part, the Republicans are already arguing over whether their failure to recapture the White House was due to an excess of ideology or of moderation. And the continuing Republican control of Congress guarantees yet more hearings into alleged Clintonian scandals.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the prospect of the subpoenas hitting the fan explained the less-than-ecstatic mood of the thousands gathered for the victory celebration at the Old State House. Perhaps, too, like the rest of the country, everyone was glad it was over. Or almost everyone. Mr Clinton would, if he could, go on campaigning for ever.<br>

<p><b>The Senate</b></p>
<h1>Consolation</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
THE prize for the most entertaining Senate race goes to Louisiana, and particularly to a shocking fax entitled "Convicts for Landrieu". "Louisiana's felons, convicts and the like formally endorse Mary Landrieu," it proclaimed. Her candidacy represented a "once-in-a-life-sentence opportunity" for convicts to be let out of prison early. A retired archbishop of New Orleans thought voting for Ms Landrieu, a Democrat who believes women should judge the morality of abortion for themselves, was tantamount to sin. Asked in a television debate to say something nice about this lady, all her Republican opponent could manage was, "I love New Orleans. She's from New Orleans and that's good."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In its vitriol, its ideological charge and indeed its sheer closeness, the Louisiana race combined many of the themes that dominated the 34 Senate fights around the country. The resignation of 14 senators, more than in any year since popular elections to the Senate were first held in 1914, created many hot contests, Louisiana's among them. On the eve of the election, half of the 34 races looked very close. And, although Ms Landrieu won her race (by a margin of less than 1%), Republicans came off better overall. As <i>The Economist </i>went to press, the outcome in Oregon was still in doubt. But the Republicans had won 20 of the remaining 33 seats, having held 19 before. Of the Senate's 100 seats, they will hold 54, or 55 if they win Oregon. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Across the country, it had been assumed that Senate victories would be won in the political middle. This proved true only in the South. Ms Landrieu squeaked home because she posed as a centrist, and because her opponent, Woody Jenkins, was unabashedly right-wing. (He led Louisiana's anti-abortionists; he had promised to scrap the Internal Revenue Service; and he spoke warmly of law-breaking Oliver North.) In Georgia's tight race, Max Cleland fought as a Democratic centrist, too. Despite unattractive episodes from his past (he had asked for the early release of a murderer who killed again, and had fired an employee without due process), he won because his opponent was so far to the right.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leftish southern Democrats, in contrast, fared less well. Harvey Gantt in North Carolina and Victor Morales in Texas both failed to upset entrenched Republicans. In Alabama, Roger Bedford also lost, even though a Democrat had easily won the seat six years ago, and even though his opponent had once said he thought Ku Klux Klan members "were okay guys until I found out they smoked dope". Mr Bedford went down because he came from the party's left, having beaten a more centrist candidate in the primary.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Outside the South, Democratic centrists were in trouble. In Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska--all open seats--the Democrats nominated moderates who sought to label their opponents as extreme. All were defeated. In Kansas, Democrats had hoped that their stockbroker-candidate, Jill Docking, could win the seat vacated by the retiring Bob Dole, especially since her views were arguably closer to Mr Dole's than those of her right-wing opponent, Sam Brownback. In New Hampshire, Democrats had big hopes for Dick Swett, a candidate more anxiously centrist even than Bill Clinton. But, though New Hampshire leaned Democrat this year (electing a Democratic governor), Mr Swett lost.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These setbacks are a disappointment for Bob Kerrey, organiser of the Democrats' Senate strategy. He went out of his way to recruit moderates, preferably wealthy ones with cash to spend on advertisements. Had the Democrats recaptured the Senate, Mr Kerrey's stock might have risen enough for him to contemplate the presidency again. As it was, Republicans fought off the Kerrey moderates by linking them to immoderate colleagues. Mr Brownback, for example, warned Kansans that a vote for his opponent was a vote for Edward Kennedy, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts. Meanwhile old-style Democrats, such as Paul Wellstone in Minnesota and Dick Durbin in Illinois, won with little difficulty.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was a good year for incumbents. Several had been at risk, but only South Dakota's Larry Pressler, a Republican, tumbled. In Massachusetts, John Kerry won with surprising ease (see <a href="am3109.html">page</a>). In North Carolina, Jesse Helms won despite his frailty. South Carolina's Strom Thurmond, who turns 94 next month, won with a campaign stressing his experience.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In all, the Republicans won three seats previously in Democratic hands: in Alabama, Nebraska and Arkansas. Of these, Arkansas was sweetest, partly because Tim Hutchinson will be the first Republican senator from the state in more than 100 years, but more because this is the president's home turf. Before the election, there was talk that Republican-instigated investigations into Whitewater, which have already led to the imprisonment of some of Mr Clinton's old friends, would produce a backlash against the Republicans. The Hutchinson victory killed that theory.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was fortunate for the Republicans, as they gathered at their election-night party in Washington to mourn Mr Dole's defeat, that they had Congress to smile about. Above the tables of tortilla chips and broccoli, huge screens displayed the results as they came in. There were boos when Mr Clinton took one state after another, and cheers when the Republicans notched up a Senate victory. But, from the flow of data on the screen, one number may soon assume particular significance. Of the voters in Arkansas, this poll said, 56% believed that Mr Clinton had not told the truth about Whitewater. Their House and Senate majority assured, the Republicans now have ample opportunity to demand the truth from the administration.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Meanwhile, in Athens . . . </h1>

<font size=1>BOSTON</font><p>
GLOWING under the klieg lights in Boston's magnificent old Faneuil Hall, John Forbes Kerry, the junior Democratic senator from Massachusetts, stood in front of a white marble bust of John Quincy Adams. William Floyd Weld, the Republican governor who was unsuccessfully trying to snatch Mr Kerry's job, stood in front of a bust of Daniel Webster. No one watching the two men in debate on October 28th thought Messrs Kerry and Weld quite that grand. But there was no hooting at this implicit comparison either, as one might expect if, say, Alfonse D'Amato had been held up against Alexander Hamilton.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Massachusetts Senate race has not been perfect, but it was highbrow enough for the good folk of Massachusetts--always prone to compare themselves to Athenians--to be proud of the example they set for the rest of the country. Both candidates showed experience and brains. They argued fiercely, intelligently and even (more or less) fairly. They debated a staggering eight times, often in head-to-head Lincoln-Douglas format. The outcome changed exactly nothing: Mr Kerry will return to Capitol Hill with a bit more stature, and Mr Weld to Beacon Hill with a lot less. But now the election is finally over, the state is positively soggy with nostalgia.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The race was cracklingly fierce to the last minute. In the home stretch, the <i>Boston Globe </i>revealed that Mr Kerry had once lived for nothing in a fancy Washington apartment owned by a lobbyist, and that Mr Weld's state agency for workers' compensation was shot through with corruption. On October 30th Ross Perot whizzed into Boston to bless Mr Weld's candidacy in weird terms: "If John Kerry is a veterans' advocate, I'm a Chinese aviator." On November 1st, Vice-President Al Gore stumped on Mr Kerry's behalf, and on the 3rd Mr Clinton himself--up a mere 32 points over Bob Dole in Massachusetts--rode to Mr Kerry's rescue at a joint appearance in Springfield.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the real joy of the Massachusetts race was that the candidates were not cynical. There was no doubting Mr Weld's seriousness about cutting taxes and shrinking government, or Mr Kerry's on fighting Republican excesses and improving education. The Clinton and Dole campaigns treated the electorate with contempt, and the electorate reciprocated. The Weld and Kerry campaigns treated the electorate with some respect, and the electorate repaid them.<br>

<p><b>The House</b></p>
<h1>Not booted</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC, AND DECATUR, GEORGIA</font><p>
IN THE last weeks of the campaign, as his re-election appeared certain, Bill Clinton basked in predictions that he would be the first Democrat since Franklin Roosevelt to win a second term as president. But Mr Clinton has also made history in a different way, at once more impressive and less pleasing. Not since Woodrow Wilson was elected president in 1916 has a victorious Democrat failed to lead his party to victory in the House. But Mr Clinton has done just that. By Wednesday, with only a few of 435 House races still in doubt, it seemed Mr Clinton's coat-tails would boost Democratic representation in the House by nine seats. The Democrats had needed a 19-seat gain in order to control the chamber.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Republicans, this represents a heartening change. Their House victory in 1994 had ended 40 years of continuous Democratic control, triggering a furious debate as to whether their ascendancy was a temporary fluke or a lasting realignment. Since the second world war, Republicans had captured the House twice before, in 1946 and 1952; but both triumphs had been erased two years later. Now, with a Republican House re-elected for the first time since 1928, Republicans have laid the fluke theory to rest. And, if history is any guide, they will increase their majority in 1998. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Republicans' biggest achievement was to hold on to all but a few of the 73 seats won for the first time in 1994. Freshmen are always vulnerable, and this year they seemed especially so. As a group, they had acquired a reputation for radical government-cutting. Their enthusiasm for scrapping environmental laws, and for curbing the cost of pensioners' health care, was thought to be especially unpopular. Moreover, the trade unions had spent $35m to try to unseat 32 of the most wobbly freshmen, an unprecedented effort. And yet only 14 freshmen were defeated.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This reflects three factors. Some voters, assuming Mr Clinton would win the presidency, may have shrunk from giving Democrats a "blank cheque". Others may have retained unhappy memories of the last time Democrats ran the House, when official cheques bounced with scandalous abandon. Still others may have been turned against the Democrats by the trade-union campaign. The union ads, accusing freshmen of wanting to "cut" education and health care, were pretty crude; and Republicans were able to hit back with ads saying that the unions, which are not popular in most parts of the land, were plotting to steal the election.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All in all, 77 Republican candidates were defending seats in districts that Mr Clinton carried for the Democrats in 1992. Yet all but 18 (11 freshmen plus seven others) triumphed. The Republicans offset this loss by toppling three Democrats. They also picked up ten formerly Democratic open seats. The large number of Democratic retirements this year (30 in all) worked against the party's hope of gaining the majority. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As in the presidential race, men, especially white men, voted Republican; and rich voters leaned to the Republicans also. As in the presidential race, more money was spent on campaigning than in the past. Yet, as of October 26th, the total raised by all House candidates came to $374m, representing less than $500,000 per candidate. The presidential and Senate campaigns have grown slick to the point of discarding volunteers, whose old tasks of envelope-stuffing and phone-banking have been usurped by computerised professionals. The House races still have home-made charm; they are still chaotic and surprising.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This contributed to one of the more cheering results of this election. Back in the summer, there were fears that black representation in the House would tumble. Judges had ruled unconstitutional nine districts that had been drawn so as to ensure black representation. Despite this, 37 blacks were elected to the House this time. That is one fewer than after the 1994 election, but still an improvement on the 25 returned in 1990.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Best of all, this election showed that blacks can win white votes, even in the South and even without having to compensate for race by espousing conservative opinions. Until now, the only blacks elected from majority-white districts were two Republicans (and one of these, Gary Franks, lost his seat this week). This time round, however, four black Democrats won in majority-white seats. Among them, Cynthia McKinney won with 58% of the vote in a two-thirds white district. And her victory took place a mere half-hour's drive from the district of Newt Gingrich, the conservative House speaker.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The McKinney triumph was unprofessional, unslick, and so all the more endearing. Ms McKinney declared, four days before the vote, that her main ally was "street heat". She had walked across more than a third of her district over the past month, delivering thousands of newsletters by hand. She had stood each morning at highway intersections for two hours, waving placards at commuters. And, with the help of a multiracial band of volunteers, she was set to win. Only one of her wishes failed to come true. Her baseball cap said "Boot Newt" on it.<br>

<p><b>Voter initiatives</b></p>
<h1>Progressives all</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
FOR candidates, election day settles the argument. They win or lose. In the case of propositions--of which there were 93 on the ballot this year, in 20 of the 24 states that allow them--election day is often merely the prelude to years of contention in court. Popular approval of measures does not mean they are constitutional. Nor does it mean that their opponents will gracefully concede defeat.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In California, where 12 propositions were on the ballot this year, the two most controversial passed handsomely: and immediately ran into legal challenges, which may have to go as far as the Supreme Court. The most important of these, Proposition 209, seeks to end all race-or gender-based preferences in state and local-government hiring, contracts and education. Just over 54% of the voters approved this measure; 46% opposed it, including top officials of all the state's colleges and universities. On Wednesday, civil-rights groups filed suit to block the measure, claiming not only that it was unconstitutional but that it conflicted with existing federal law.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Also passed, but delayed by legal challenges, was Proposition 215, which would legalise the use of marijuana in California (under doctor's orders) as a palliative in severe illness. Although cannabis relieves a host of ailments--from seizures to glaucoma to the nausea induced by chemotherapy--the federal government restricts it more tightly than even cocaine or morphine, forbidding doctors' prescriptions and blocking most research.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Arizona voters went further, approving not only the medical use of marijuana but also the parole of drug criminals not deemed to pose a risk to public safety. The money saved from incarceration is to be ploughed back into education and treatment, to which first-and second-time offenders will be sentenced instead of jail. Bill Clinton's drug tsar, Barry McCaffrey, called the proposition "a cruel hoax wrapped up in some attractive ideas", but voters apparently disagreed. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Election day also saw continued machinations by lovers of term limits. Facing a Supreme Court decision that ruled such limits on Congress unconstitutional, a group in Arlington, Virginia, placed similarly-worded initiatives on 14 different state ballots. Nine passed. In those states, legislators are now required to press for a constitutional amendment imposing term limits and, if they do not, to face re-election with ballots saying that they disregarded voters' instructions. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The technique is creative, to say the least. A similar plan worked early this century, when senators were first made subject to a popular vote. It is hard to get excited about term limits, which force voters into a choice they are free to make anyway by booting incumbents out. On the other hand, this is a good place to use referendums to make the public's wishes clear to their representatives. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Campaign-finance reform offers a similar challenge, but voters were encouraged by a heated national debate in the closing weeks of the campaign. Broad reforms passed this year in California, Colorado, Arkansas, Nevada and Maine. And the morally-concerned majority also had its say in Alaska, Colorado, and Washington, rural states where gun groups and hunters wield power disproportionate to their numbers. Propositions were passed there to restrain the use of bait, traps and hunting from aircraft, although anti-hunting measures failed in Michigan and Idaho.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like the affirmative action fight in California, a number of state initiatives mirror national debates. Proposals to raise the minimum wage beyond the new federal level of $5.15 an hour were rejected in Denver, Missouri and Montana, but passed in California and Oregon. The larger significance of the huge number of initiatives-- more than double the number posted ten years ago--is a return to the enthusiasm for direct democracy that marked the first decades of the century, when many of the laws allowing initiatives were passed in the first place. It is also fitting for the time, now that a Republican Congress and a Democratic president both purport to embrace the states as laboratories of democracy. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;California saw the largest sum ever spent to defeat a proposition: $37m, poured out by corporations to deter Proposition 211, which would have made it exceptionally easy for shareholders to sue them for fraud. The measure was defeated by 74% to 26%. Money's usefulness apart, the moral of 1996 is clear: if you are a white male who wants to work for the minimum wage, bilk small investors and smoke joints when you're ill, California is the place to be.<br>

<p><b>Campaign money</b></p>
<h1>Loose change</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
THE limp campaign of 1996 has one resonant claim to fame. It was the most expensive ever. Between them, the parties had raised more than $207m by October 16th, compared with $75m in the previous presidential-election year. When donations from individuals and political-action committees (<font size=-1>PAC</font>s), public financing and "independent" expenditures are included, Common Cause, an organisation that worries about such things, reckons the campaign cost a total of $2 billion. Most of it was spent on television advertising.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last June, the Supreme Court handed down a broad interpretation of "independent" expenditures which emboldened parties to throw even more soft money into important races. Fifteen House candidates had spent more than $1m each by September 30th, with the speaker, Newt Gingrich, on top with $4.1m. According to Common Cause, 68 Senate candidates had by then spent $155m between them: Jesse Helms of North Carolina accounted for $12.2m, John Kerry of Massachusetts for $9.3m and Phil Gramm of Texas for $7.9m. Mr Gramm's opponent, Victor Morales, spent only $323,279. Texas is a particularly lopsided example of a general trend. In 20 races where an incumbent was running, only one challenger had spent more than the incumbent by September 30th.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From his perch in Little Rock on Tuesday night, President Clinton said "we must act and act now" on campaign-finance reform. With enough pressure from Ross Perot, it might happen. Mr Perot's 8% of the vote on Tuesday was a shadow of his 1992 performance, but his voice is still heard. As usual, he offers few specific solutions; he just demands that the problem be "fixed". But how? The Supreme Court has called restrictions on campaign spending a violation of free speech. Short of amending the constitution, then, legislators can assemble only a patchwork of voluntary limits, restriction on donations and free access to the media. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The voters of Maine opted on election day for a more radical approach, in a referendum calling for strict limits on spending and on private donations but offering public money to help candidates with their campaigns. A group of businessmen has derided this as "welfare for politicians". But David Donnelly, a backer of the idea, argues that his state will "truly sever the link" between private money and public officials. The law was designed to meet the Supreme Court's conditions, so it does not stop millionaires spending their own fortunes on their campaigns. But the millionaires' opponents can exceed the ordinary limits, and get extra public money to do so.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some say the current state of affairs is a small price to pay for the quadrennial choice of the country's leader. After all, Americans spent an estimated $2.5 billion on Halloween this year. But most Americans regularly put on their Halloween masks. Only one in 400 gives more than $100 to a political campaign. Behind the mask of politics, cash gets turned into unfair influence. Americans who deplore this phenomenon will be watching Maine with interest.<br>

WAS the 1996 campaign really so boring? We think not. Dole-speak, provided liberally (as it were) by the Republican candidate, gave delight and bafflement in equal measure. Here, nostalgically, is a parting selection:</b><p><br>
We've had millions and millions of dollars spent in Florida saying Bob Dole is against Medicare, Bob Dole is against Social Security, Bob Dole is against veterans, Bob Dole is against children. There<i>'</i>s nobody left. I<i>'</i>m against everybody.<br>
<i>St Petersburg, Florida, September 9th</i><p>[Clinton] came out against truancy, which I thought was courageous, said he's opposed to it. And I said, <i>'</i>'That's . . .that's statesmanship." Didn<i>'</i>t even take a poll. He just did it on his own.<br>
<i>Springfield, Virginia, September 23rd</i><p>
The cause of crime can be explained with one simple word: criminals, criminals, criminals.<br>
<i>Philadelphia, September 16th</i><p>They [the Clinton administration] look you in the eye and say<i>, </i>we're going to give you targeted tax cuts if you keep your room clean and eat your vegetables and do all the other things the government wants you to do. And if you eat your vegetables, you could live as long as Senator Thurmond, who is going to be re-elected without any problems. I used to follow him around. When he ate a banana, I ate a banana. Whatever worked.<i><br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>A new Newt</h1>

"I'M GOING to write several books . . . the founding of the New York Zoological Society was a key moment in our history . . . you know, we could save $14 billion a year by reforming what we do on diabetes . . . " With that, Newt Gingrich bounces up from his seat on top of his roofless double-decker bus, turns his back to the cold wind, and surveys the campaign cavalcade that is following him. Each vehicle is filled with clean-cut supporters decked out in Newt shirts, dedicated to boosting the Republican vote in Mr Gingrich's Georgia district. Mr Gingrich seems thrilled. "Isn't this great?" he exclaims. "Five buses!"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This was the Newt Gingrich on display in the last days of the campaign, in his home district outside Atlanta. It is also the Newt Gingrich whom Americans are soon going to meet, a very different figure from the grim ogre vilified by Democrats since the summer. Having defied predictions that his Republican troops would lose control of the House, Mr Gingrich has every reason to bubble with good cheer. He can now look forward to at least another two years as speaker of the House-- and probably to more than that, since the president's party tends to lose seats in mid-term elections. Bob Dole's retirement makes him the Republicans' pre-eminent leader, as well as their most dynamic one. "I think Newt is in the early-middle phase of his career as a national leader," says one of the speaker's henchmen.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The old Newt--the one attacked in 75,000 Democratic campaign ads--wanted to impose radical budget cuts on a country unprepared for such stern measures. This backfired, so the new Newt on the double-decker bus mixes big ideas with tactical humility. He acknowledges the danger of pushing legislation without building public support first. He even sees the advantage in not pushing anything at all, and leaving the risks of leadership to others. When Mr Clinton proposed an ambitious solution to the inadequacies of American health care, he was butchered for his pains; when Mr Gingrich promoted necessary budgetary reform, he was similarly demonised. If you lead you bleed, is the conclusion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Old Newt (gleefully caricatured by Democrats these past months) was prepared to shut down the government to get his way. New Newt is a magician of compromise and coalition-building. His aides now boast that, rather than resist Democratic calls for a higher minimum wage earlier this year, Mr Gingrich brilliantly caved in, persuading fellow Republicans that so popular a measure could not be buried. He even went so far as to allow Phil English, a Republican from a Democratic-leaning district in Pennsylvania, to sponsor the minimum-wage bill. Mr English duly stressed this feat in his re-election campaign. His victory this week was a triumph of New-Newt tactics. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Old Newt demanded nothing less than revolutionary cuts in government. New Newt is adept at settling for small reforms and making the most of them. On the stump this autumn, Mr Gingrich liked to wave an ice-bucket before his audiences and regale them with the news that, by eliminating free ice deliveries to congressmen, he saved taxpayers the princely sum of $500,000 a year. Never mind that the speaker's plans to control the vast cost of retired Americans' health benefits crashed and burned. Mr Gingrich has privatised a congressional shoeshine stand, a post office and a beauty parlour.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is a rich irony in this. In his celebration of micro-policies, as in his newly pragmatic pose, Mr Gingrich looks uncannily like Mr Clinton, his fellow-victor of the week. This has not been lost on anti-government purists, who hiss with contempt for the speaker these days, as David Brooks has pointed out in the <i>Weekly Standard</i>. "He's randomly conservative," says one Republican. "He has no conservative instincts," says another. Old Newt was the hero of such folk. New Newt is accused of parroting fuzzy lines fed to him by focus groups.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet this seeming Gingrich-Clinton equivalence masks a big difference. Over the past two years, Mr Clinton has essentially conceded ideological victory to the Republicans, promising that the era of big government is over, ending guaranteed welfare payments and embracing the Republican drive to balance the budget. Mr Gingrich, in contrast, has conceded that his style was too abrupt, but his ideas are winning. He can afford to become a pragmatic compromiser now, because his grand ideological battles have mostly been won. "In just two years, Newt Gingrich has accomplished more than most leaders do in a lifetime," proclaim the leaflets in the speaker's campaign headquarters. The hyperbole is hard to digest, yet there is something to be said for the thought.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At some point in the next two years, Mr Clinton will probably appoint a commission to curb the cost of retired people's health care, even though the Democrats lashed Mr Gingrich for saying that this was necessary. The commission will no doubt look at ways to cut costs without compromising the quality of service to old folk, and so Mr Gingrich's excited talk about diabetes on the campaign bus (you can save money and improve health by moving to preventive care) may well turn into solid policy. Equally, the next two years are likely to see a debate about encouraging volunteers to work as a complement to the bureaucratic welfare state. Mr Gingrich's recalling of the volunteer heroism of America's past (as in the founding of the Zoological Society in New York) will doubtless become fashionable. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of which points to the difficulty in interpreting this week's elections. Mr Clinton won by running against Gingrichite cuts in government, or at least a cartoon version of them. On the other hand, Mr Clinton stole many of Mr Gingrich's ideas; and Mr Gingrich survived a congressional election that was, to a large extent, a referendum on his speakership. The lessons of this mixed verdict will be debated for years. Among the many books that will offer an infallible interpretation, count on at least one from Mr Gingrich.<br>

<p><b>Singapore</b></p>
<h1>Goh slow</h1>

JUST as races are not always to the swift, nor battles to the strong, so elections are not always to ruling parties. But in Singapore, that is certainly the way to bet. The People's Action Party is assured of a big victory in the general election that has to be held by next April. Even the <font size=-1>PAP</font>, however, is subject to the ravages of time and chance, which Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister, is doing his best to mitigate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the approach to an election, incumbents like their voters to be basking in the glow of rosy economic statistics. Unfortunately for Mr Goh, his government had on November 5th to reveal figures which showed that in the third quarter of this year, <font size=-1>GDP</font> was only 3.2% higher than in the same period in 1995--the lowest quarterly increase for ten years (see <a href="as1.gif">chart</a>). The growth forecast for the year as a whole was cut for the third time, to 6%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is hardly the stuff of recession as commonly understood (although, compared with the immediately preceding period rather than with last year, the economy had contracted for the second successive quarter, meeting the technical definition of the term used in America). Singaporean officials also point out, rightly, that the problems facing the economy are cyclical rather than fundamental. It has been hit by a regional slowdown and, in particular, by a global slump in sales and prices of some electronics products (see <a href="wb8439.html">page</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the less than usually hectic growth rate may be one reason why Mr Goh has said that this parliament will serve out its full term, until January 5th. Like British prime ministers, he has the tactical advantage of being able to choose the election date and, unusually for Singapore, has opted to wait almost as long as he can.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if the electorate does react badly to a hint of harder times, recent changes to the election laws will make it more difficult for the small opposition to increase its representation in parliament from the four out of 81 seats it currently holds. Last month Parliament passed bills that would allow an increase in the number of candidates elected in each "group representation constituency" or <font size=-1>GRC</font>. At present, there are 15 <font size=-1>GRC</font>s, each of which elects four members of Parliament from a single party slate. The other 21 come from single-member constituencies. Now the size of a <font size=-1>GRC</font> slate can be up to six candidates.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>GRC</font>s were introduced in 1988, to ensure that Singapore's minority races were represented in parliament, despite a public-housing policy that prevents ethnic enclaves from forming. Each party must field a candidate from a minority group, such as ethnic Indians or Malays, on its slate. However, because it has difficulty in finding enough credible candidates, the opposition has always seen the <font size=-1>GRC</font> system as evidence of the <font size=-1>PAP</font>'s determination to entrench its power. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The opposition has other troubles, too. Chee Soon Juan, leader of the Singapore Democratic Party, and one of the government's most prominent critics, got some figures wrong in a debate in August over health care. Last month, as a consequence, he was grilled for seven hours by parliament's privileges committee, and faces the threat of criminal charges and jail. The local pro-government newspaper, the <i>Straits Times</i>, reported that Mr Chee's evidence had been "confused" and "careless". An editorial on the parlous state of the opposition lamented that "Singapore deserves better". But given the fate of Dr Chee, it is hardly surprising if there are few volunteers to stand against the <font size=-1>PAP</font>.<br>

<p><b>Public spending</b></p>
<h1>Out of control</h1>

TO READ November 6th's newspapers, you would think that the previous day's cabinet had decided to spend its way out of the government's political difficulties. Ministers had agreed, they reported, to spend more next year on health (&#163;600m on top of &#163;34.2 billion); more on education (a "generous settlement"); more on police and prisons (with Michael Howard, the home secretary, "delighted"); and more on defence. Even Scotland and Wales seem to have fought off Treasury efforts to scrap the formulas which give them an anomalously big share of public spending.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;William Waldegrave, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who supervised this process, maintained a dignified silence. But he was far from pleased by the reports. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Five of the six "wise men", the Treasury's outside advisers, recommended on October 31st that Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, should not cut taxes in his November 26th budget. He will cut them all the same. It would therefore have suited the Treasury to have appeared tough on spending. Otherwise, markets may interpret the tax cuts as inflation-provoking election bribes, adding to the pressure for higher interest rates. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the collective interests of the cabinet as a whole took second place to the departmental interests of its individual members. Out of control in their eagerness to proclaim victory in the spending round, they have undermined the Chancellor's efforts to seem prudent.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, the settlement represents an honourable draw between spenders and controllers. Inflation has turned out rather lower than was expected at the time of the 1995 budget. To hold state spending next year to the real level planned then, Mr Waldegrave would have had to cut cash spending plans by some &#163;3.5 billion. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But that could only have been achieved at the cost of disagreeable political consequences--for example, rising hospital waiting lists. In the event, Mr Clarke, whose political antennae are second to none, seems to have settled for around half that amount. Public spending next year will be higher in real terms than this year. But according to Chris Giles, of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, the increase will only be around 0.3%. Compared with the 1991 Budget, when Norman Lamont planned a real spending rise of 4%, Mr Clarke's pre-election bribery so far is small beer.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Oil bonus</h1>

ONE bit of inflation has been good news for Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer: the rising oil price (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). Since August, the price of Brent North Sea, the marker crude, has risen from less than $20 to more than $25 a barrel. In the last few days, it has fallen back a bit but it is still nearly 25% higher than three months ago. Since the $14 low-point in the first quarter of 1994, oil prices have risen by 75%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the last Treasury pronouncement on the effect of the oil price on government revenues, six years ago, officials estimated that a $10 rise in the price of a barrel of crude, if sustained for a year, would result in an increase in revenues of about &#163;2 billion. Since 1990, taxes on North Sea oil have been lowered, so, according to analysts, the benefit of a $10 increase is now reckoned to be about &#163;1.5 billion. Still, this windfall, equivalent to a reduction of more than 1p in the standard rate of income tax, is not to be sneezed at--especially by a hard-pressed Chancellor facing a pre-election budget in a month's time.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the longer term, however, the effects of higher oil prices are less beneficial. According to Opal, an oil-price research company, the price of unleaded petrol at the pumps has risen by an average of about 5p per litre since the low point of 54p per litre in July. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, predicts that inflation in the world's five richest countries is likely to increase by 0.2-0.3% by the end of the year as a direct result of the movement in crude. British exporters are also anxiously monitoring the exchange rate. Over the past two months, the pound has risen strongly against both the dollar and the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark, to $1.64 and DM2.49 respectively.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will the price stay high? Goldman Sachs predicts that the price of crude will average $25 a barrel in the last quarter of this year and in the first quarter of 1997. Other oil analysts disagree: there is still plenty of spare capacity, and production may start increasing. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The oil companies, meanwhile, are not complaining. <font size=-1>BP</font> announced on November 5th that its third-quarter profits had risen 33% to &#163;761m. Sir David Simon, its chairman, said the chancellor should not even think of a windfall tax. Now there's a thought.<br>

<p><b>Broadcasting</b></p>
<h1>Big bad Rupert</h1>

A KIND of hysteria has gripped some of the British press at the sight of <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, that notorious but successful satellite-television broadcaster, preparing to order the first set-top boxes to receive and decode digital signals. <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> is 40% owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Within a few years the whole of British broadcasting will be under his control," yelped the <i>Independent</i>. Mr Murdoch is not quite that close to a monopoly--whatever happens to the airwaves, cable television will still provide competition--but this is a crucial time for other broadcasters.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Digital television requires special receiving equipment. Signals sent from a satellite, through cable or over the air all require different devices, and most of the channels will be encrypted, so that they can be watched only by subscribers. Because <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> seems certain to be ready to launch digital satellite television in Britain before anybody else, rival broadcasters worry that people will buy its set-top-box decoders. When their own channels are launched, people will not want to buy a second set-top box.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This prospect especially alarms the <font size=-1>BBC</font>, which cannot afford to underwrite its own set-top boxes. Even so, it still hopes to produce a package of digital subscription channels. The public broadcaster has been lobbying furiously for guaranteed access to the <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> decoder box.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, for its part, grumbles that the <font size=-1>BBC</font> wants a free ride. It is afraid of the cable industry, which is increasing its share of the market in areas where the two compete head-on, and is also likely to go digital next year. For now, <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>'s main problem is to find partners to help it subsidise the set-top boxes, which will otherwise cost viewers an unattractive &#163;500 or so apiece. It has been talking to <font size=-1>BT</font> and Barclays Bank about the possibility of sharing the bill, in exchange for using the boxes for home shopping and banking. But a deal with <font size=-1>BT</font>, the richest potential partner, will have to get past Oftel, the telephone industry's regulator. Last month Oftel stopped a joint promotion between <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, offering cheap calls to <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> subscribers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government, harried on one side by the <font size=-1>BBC</font> and on the other by <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, has failed to satisfy either. A new set of regulations, about to be published, will oblige anybody offering a set-top-box gateway to allow access to other broadcasters on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The <font size=-1>BBC</font> fears that <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> is so far ahead that these regulations will mean nothing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is probably too bleak. Oftel will police the rules, which is appropriate, for the problem is much the same as the interconnection arguments that arise endlessly in the telephone network, when one telephone company wants to send calls across a rival company's network. There, the argument is usually not about access, but about price.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, the bones of a possible compromise are emerging. <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> has decided that its set-top boxes should have a plug to allow the attachment of an inexpensive receiver for digital terrestrial television. Because digital terrestrial television will be available in many more homes than satellite services, it is likely to have a much bigger market than satellite alone would provide. In exchange for a terrestrial slot on good terms, <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> might just consider a common interface, to allow its set-top boxes to be used by other broadcasters. This would encourage customers to buy the boxes and could help <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> defray the costs and win more viewers. Would that be a victory for the <font size=-1>BBC</font>? As the telephone business proves, having access to a rival's network is no guarantee of a bigger market.<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Belatedly, it is catching up. On November 6th Roger Freeman, the public-services minister, published a consultative green paper--on <font size=-1>CD</font>-<font size=-1>ROM</font>, naturally--on the electronic delivery of state services. Three pilot schemes to pave the way to one-stop electronic access to government data were launched, including terminals at a branch of the NatWest bank in London. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Making it easier to extract information from government will be phase one. Phase two will allow proper two-way communication. People will be able to get into the system using home personal computers, digital television or terminals in public places such as libraries. The provision of access might even be contracted out to building societies and banks which already have a network to serve their own customers. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In time, people will be able to submit their income-tax returns electronically. Biometric identification (for example, a nifty device that recognises people by studying their iris) may take the place of a written signature on the return.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government claims that services will be available where you want them, when you want them. Responses will often be instant. But those who want to go on using paper and stamps will be able to do so.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The programme could cost an average of &#163;200m a year over ten years, but savings will be higher. Moreover, the cash to pay for it will come from the private sector. Before private firms get paid for what they have installed, they will have to make it work. Deals will be structured so that the more the public uses the system, the higher the return to providers, so they will have an incentive to make their systems user-friendly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This being Britain, there are plenty of sceptics. Civil-service trade unions worry that the new technology will cost clerical jobs. Some civil servants are concerned that too much is being handed over to private firms, which may fail to respond quickly and sensitively to the demands of democratic politicians. Civil libertarians conjure up nightmare scenarios whereby police, tax and benefit data are linked up, giving bureaucrats total knowledge of every citizen. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peter Lilley, the social-security secretary, is about to lend credibility to this charge. He wants to change the law so that he can get access to tax records to check claims for benefits. This will be tough on fraud but also tough on law-abiding people who don't want any old <i>apparatchik </i>crawling over their tax affairs.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The green paper tries to soothe these fears. It suggests that a single database of names and addresses held by government would be useful, so people who move house would have to send the state only one change-of-address card. But otherwise, it floats proposals for data-sharing only cautiously. Each department will be allowed to use information only for the intended purpose. Data-protection safeguards will not be changed. Big brother? A friendly one, maybe, but keep watching.<br>

<p><b>The Co-operative movement</b></p>
<h1>A lot at stake</h1>

<font size=1>MANCHESTER</font><p>
GRAHAM MELMOTH hopes to be the Tony Blair of retailing. On November 4th Mr Melmoth became chief executive of the largest part of Britain's Co-op movement: the Co-operative Wholesale Society (<font size=-1>CWS</font>), a mutually owned conglomerate with annual sales of &#163;3 billion ranging from fish fingers to funerals, pensions to package holidays. Like Labour before Mr Blair became its leader, the Co-ops have been losing business to their capitalist rivals, and finding it hard to recruit young people. Not only does Mr Melmoth want a New Labour-style revival, he sees a modernised Co-op as the very heart of the "stakeholder society" that Mr Blair dreams of.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour and the Co-ops share common roots. Poor conditions in Britain's industrial towns in the 19th century led to the Labour movement's rise and were the reason why the Rochdale Pioneers set up the first Co-op in 1844, so that the poor could club together to buy decent, affordable food. The idea spread across Britain and at one point there were 1,400 local Co-op societies. But in modern times, fierce competition from privately owned supermarkets has led to a string of mergers and closures. There are now just 52 Co-op societies, of which by far the largest are <font size=-1>CWS</font> (which started out as the movement's wholesaler) and Co-operative Retail Services (<font size=-1>CRS</font>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In spite of repeated attempts at modernisation, the Co-ops have continued to lose customers in recent years (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>). Their main problem is that whatever they do, capitalist firms do it better. Their original job of feeding the poor is now done by deep-discount supermarket chains like Aldi and Netto, whose prices are lower. Most Co-ops these days are aimed at the mass market. But, says Richard Hyman of Verdict, a retail consultancy, the stores and their product lines are often years behind their capitalist competitors.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Co-ops' mutual-ownership status means they cannot easily raise capital on the stockmarket, limiting their ability to invest in updating their stores. But, unlike those building societies which are heading for the stockmarket, Mr Melmoth does not accept that mutuality is past its sell-by date. Anyway, <font size=-1>CWS</font>'s complex ownership (it is owned both by individual shoppers and by other Co-op societies) would make a flotation highly impractical. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Melmoth says the Co-ops still have a strong position in catering to small towns and in running "convenience" stores. But even such unfashionable redoubts are now under attack. Giants like Tesco are building smaller shops in such secondary locations because new planning rules are limiting the number of sites for giant stores. Convenience stores are also being added at many petrol stations, and the deep-discounters are still expanding, grabbing more of the Co-op's cash-strapped shoppers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How can the Co-ops fight this fresh onslaught? Recently, they have decided that if they cannot compete on price or product range, then they will compete on morals. Updating the principles of the Rochdale Pioneers, <font size=-1>CWS</font> is promoting itself as the "Responsible Retailer", championing "fair trade" with poor countries and selling environmentally friendly products. Its Co-op Bank subsidiary has won new customers by promising not to lend to dictators or firms that test their products on animals. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has two big flaws. First, such lofty principles appeal most to the young and affluent, not the old and poor, who shop at the Co-op (and which it would not want to desert). Second, if ethics sell groceries, you can bet that capitalist supermarkets will turn moral. As if to prove this, on October 28th Tesco began selling organically grown fruit and vegetables at the same price as their intensively farmed equivalents.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As well as joining Tony Blair on the moral bandwagon, Mr Melmoth hopes to emulate his successful recruitment drive, by turning more Co-op shoppers into "stakeholders", ie, members of a Co-op society. Members used to be rewarded through the "divi", a loyalty-card scheme which most Co-ops abandoned years ago because it was too costly. Ironically, just as Co-ops are talking of bringing the divi back, their rivals, led by Tesco, have got in first with loyalty cards of their own. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One way of making the 52 Co-op societies more competitive would be to merge them, thereby cutting costs and rationalising the muddle of different names and formats that they trade under. But repeated attempts to merge <font size=-1>CWS</font> and <font size=-1>CRS</font> have failed; last month, plans to merge their non-food stores collapsed. Mr Melmoth plans to have another go, but even if he succeeds, a united Co-op would still be too small. So his short-term job (again, like Tony Blair's) is to continue his predecessors' work of modernising <font size=-1>CWS</font>, replacing a bureaucratic regional structure with a strong, centralised management and a clear marketing strategy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New Labour might not like to be associated with the Co-op's dowdy image but it should take an interest nonetheless. The Co-op movement is the nearest Britain gets to Mr Blair's "stakeholder" vision. If its approach cannot survive in competition with shareholder capitalism, the movement will prove that Mrs Thatcher was right when she said "there is no alternative". And one day soon, there may be no such thing as the Co-operative Wholesale Society.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Clinton's slippery coat-tails</h1>

AS THE barber-shop quartet at the American embassy's election-night bash swung into "Georgia on my Mind", Bagehot spotted two modernising members of Britain's rival political parties in animated conversation. Were they debating what President Clinton's victory meant for America's budget deficit? Whether he would remain involved in Bosnia? Where next for the Helms-Burton act and Europe's trade with Cuba? Bagehot sidled nearer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's just as we've been telling you," he heard the one in the Armani suit with the blue carnation in the buttonhole say. "It's the economy, stupid. Wait until next May when voters here start focusing on the bottom line, and they'll be flocking back to John Major just like they've flocked back to Bill Clinton on the other side of the pond. I don't care whether it's Bill or John, whatever you throw at an incumbent, you're not going to persuade voters that everything is bad when they are feeling good."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Trust you to be superficial," replied the one in the Armani suit with the red rose in the buttonhole. "Yes, of course the economy is important in any election, but that plays for us, not you. American voters admire the way Bill Clinton has cut the deficit, just as British voters admire the way Tony Blair got Labour away from tax-and-spend. When Bill talks education and training, voters think he talks sense--just as they do when Tony does it for us. As for your government, the voters fingered you as a load of bunglers from the day Britain left the European exchange-rate mechanism in 1992."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though he was drinking only Perrier with his pecan pie, Mr Blair's colleague was becoming animated. "Here's the real message of tonight. Two years ago America fell into the hands of the crew who dominate your party here. There was Newt Gingrich and his 'Contract with America' and the religious right. Sure, it had its appeal; I don't deny that. But the American people tried it, and they didn't like it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's the same with your lot here. Voters have had it up to their necks with right-wing policies. They've had it with right-wing rhetoric. And don't forget they've had 17 years of it where America has only had two.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Of course, they don't want the left either, which is why we've modernised. We've done just what Bill Clinton did to the Democrats, moving away from big government. Tony is Bill without the sex and the sleaze, which is why in May your lot will be history."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sleaze, you're on to that old story again are you?" his Tory friend interposed. "Like your blessed Tony with that holier-than-thou crap of his? Look what has happened in America. There's Bob Dole, the war hero; there's Bill Clinton, sleaze incarnate--and who wins? Mr Sleaze. John Major is 'Honest John'. Do you really think sleaze could actually destroy him, when it hasn't stopped Clinton being re-elected?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Alright, sleaze may not have worked in America but neither have tax cuts," said his Labour friend. "You keep on telling me that Kenneth Clarke has only to cut taxes now, and promise more to come, and our poll ratings will plummet.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well that didn't work in America, did it? Bob Dole promised tax cuts yet the voters were not interested. Some of them remembered that he used to be against bribery. It's the same with you. If you start cutting taxes now, British voters will remember the 22 times you've put them up since 1992."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That proves nothing," said the Tory. "Bob Dole's problem was not that he promised tax cuts. Bob Dole's problem was that he was a lousy candidate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He never had a strategy. First he said that Clinton was a liberal, then he said he was stealing the Republicans' clothes. First he refused to play the sleaze card, then he was attacking Hillary. Bob Dole must be the worst candidate for high office since you ran Michael Foot in 1983. And despite all that, he started the campaign 20 points behind the president and finished up only eight points down.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We Tories are going to stick to our lines. At least, we're going to stick to them unless the goons from Central Office persuade the prime minister to get side-tracked on to <font size=-1>EMU</font>. 'The Enterprise Centre of Europe.' 'New Labour, New Danger.' 'Opportunity for all.' And even you have to admit that John Major is a great campaigner. Remember the soap box? Remember his passion over the constitution in 1992? Well, you ain't seen nothing yet." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two paused to wave away a waiter bearing a tray of margaritas. Bagehot could bear to remain silent no longer. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Gentlemen, gentlemen. I have listened to you burbling on for the last half-hour and it has rarely been my misfortune to endure such a farrago of stuff and nonsense. The truth is that the American election and the British election are different sorts of events in different political systems played to different rules with different campaigning instruments. It is therefore not surprising that, as a cursory glance at the record will show, there is no correlation of any kind to be found between the results of 13 post-war presidential elections and those of Britain's 14 general elections. Incumbents win, incumbents lose; left and right advance and retreat; good candidates do well and bad candidates do badly on both sides of the Atlantic, in a way that is entirely <i>sui generis</i> to each particular election in each country in the circumstances of each election year; and therefore, despite your half-plausible theorising and your special pleading and your ingenious attempts to link what is not linked, nothing you have said has the least bearing on the question of which of your parties will win Britain's general election next year. Gentlemen, I bid you both good night."<br>

<h1>A marriage of convenience</h1>

<font size=1>LONDON AND NEW YORK</font><p>
<p><b>BT's takeover of MCI is the biggest transatlantic deal ever, but the merger is still surprisingly light on substance</b></p><br>
AS WEDDINGS go, it lacked romance. The bride and groom had been living together for years, and already had a child. They got along pretty well, but he had been worried that her head might be turned by another man. Better, he reckoned, to wed her now and avoid the prospect of fighting for her heart later. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That, with a little lacy licence, is the reality behind the biggest transatlantic merger in history, which was announced on November 3rd: the $21 billion takeover of <font size=-1>MCI</font>, an American telecoms firm, by Britain's <font size=-1>BT</font> (See <a href="wb1.gif">table</a>). The wedding invitations--full of breathless talk of global logic and synergy--were echoed by starstruck analysts, who hailed the deal as a harbinger of a coming revolution in the global telecoms industry. But a closer look reveals a largely defensive move that, at least internally, will mean few real changes at all.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is not to say that the deal is a mistake; indeed, it may have been unavoidable. <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font> have been linked since 1993, when the British ex-monopoly bought 20% of the nimble long-distance carrier. Together, the two set up Concert, a joint venture to provide global telecoms services for multinational firms. Arguably, because they had already cemented their link with cash, their partnership was more cohesive than a loose web of global alliances offered by <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, a big American rival.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>BT</font>'s worry was that <font size=-1>MCI</font> might be bought by another firm. The American company carries one-fifth of the country's long-distance calls and two-fifths of its overseas calls. But after its early success in grabbing market share from <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, it has been struggling. It would have been a tempting target for one of the regional "Baby Bells", spun off when the original <font size=-1>AT&T</font> was broken up in 1984. They expect to be allowed into the long-distance market soon, under the terms of the Telecommunications Act passed earlier this year. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>BT</font>'s 20% stake entitled it to match any offer for <font size=-1>MCI</font>. But, with several potential suitors, some even bigger than <font size=-1>BT</font>, it seemed safer to slip the ring on <font size=-1>MCI</font>'s finger now, even if doing so meant paying a 44% premium over its current share value. Sealing the deal should take another year or so, a delay due mainly to the need for the union to be blessed by America's regulators. With some tweaking, they are likely to clear it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the past, <font size=-1>MCI</font> has been promiscuous in its search of a strategy, flitting from liaison to liaison. In 1994 it invested $1.3 billion in Nextel Communications, a wireless-telecoms company--a deal that was subsequently broken off. Then it took a stake in Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, an alliance that is now looking cool. It has also formed alliances with everyone from Microsoft down.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now both <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font> claim that, simply by combining their operations--the new company, like the existing global partnership, will be called Concert--they will increase their annual pre-tax profit by nearly $850m by the fifth year after the merger. Set against a combined pre-tax profit of nearly $6 billion today, that is hardly a reason to merge. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bigger gains might come from using <font size=-1>BT</font>'s financial muscle and expertise learnt in Britain's local market to launch an assault on America's $100-billion-a-year local telephone market. Gross profit margins on long-distance calls in the United States are well over 40%; profits on international calls are even higher. But at present each long-distance call starts and finishes in a Baby Bell's local territory--and for that privilege long-distance carriers such as <font size=-1>MCI</font> pay the Bells 45 cents out of every dollar of long-distance revenues.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One way <font size=-1>MCI</font> could have sidestepped this tariff would have been to hook up with a Baby Bell, which is why it had in recent months been holding exploratory talks with two previously merged pairs--Bell Atlantic and Nynex, and <font size=-1>SBC</font> Communications and Pacific Telesis--as well as <font size=-1>GTE</font>. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It has also been trying to crack the local market itself with a venture called <font size=-1>MCI</font> Metro, which is building networks to connect corporate clients in 34 American cities. This has had limited success. By the end of this year <font size=-1>MCI</font> will have spent $1 billion on such networks; yet in the third quarter of the year, <font size=-1>MCI</font> Metro generated a paltry $45m in revenues, out of <font size=-1>MCI</font>'s total quarterly revenues of $4.7 billion. And most of its sales were to <font size=-1>MCI</font>'s other businesses.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Making money in the local market will grow harder as competition cuts prices. Many analysts expect local-call revenues to grow only slowly during the next few years. Worse, the new rules for opening local telephone markets are delayed in the courts. Until <font size=-1>MCI</font> is sure what those rules will be-- and it may be another year before they are clear--it cannot decide whether it is wiser to buy or lease network capacity from the incumbent Bells, or to build more of its own network, as it has done so far. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That leaves the global strategy. The theory behind the original Concert joint venture was that multinational clients could avoid having to deal with lots of different carriers. <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s WorldPartners and the GlobalOne trio of Deutsche Telekom, France T&eacute;l&eacute;com and America's Sprint offer something similar (see <a href="wb8442.html">page</a>). Of the three, Concert has been the most successful, winning more than $1.5 billion-worth of contracts and claiming more than 3,000 corporate customers. But its revenues are tiny--in its most recent quarter, <font size=-1>MCI</font> reported $160m in overall sales for the venture--and it is unprofitable. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Concertina</b></b><br>
It is hard to see what Concert gains from a merger. <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font> have already integrated their global networks more successfully than their competitors have. And <font size=-1>MCI</font>'s marketing skills have already been applied to the venture. <font size=-1>BT</font>'s chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, suggests that gains will mostly be made by doing more of the same: merging the sales and marketing forces a bit further, and sharing more technology. In fact, an even bigger benefit may come from winning the confidence of customers, who tend to view loose global alliances with suspicion because they are prone to acrimonious collapse.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best thing that could now happen to the deal would be for a regional Bell to buy into it. Such an addition would, in a single move, bring more local customers than <font size=-1>MCI</font> could hope to assemble by itself in a decade. The Nynex and Bell Atlantic duo seems the best match--they have the most customers making calls across the Atlantic--but <font size=-1>GTE</font> would be available to do a deal earlier. It is the only regional giant already allowed into the long-distance market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"<font size=-1>BT</font> has reinforced its western front," says Joseph Kraemer, a telecoms analyst with <font size=-1>A.T.</font> Kearney, a consultancy. From there, Asia and Europe beckon. Continental Europe's biggest telecoms markets will open in 1998, and Sir Peter says that <font size=-1>BT</font> will bid for licences where it can. It already has joint ventures in a number of other big European countries, notably France and Germany. Asia is trickier. Had <font size=-1>BT</font> been able to buy Cable & Wireless, as it had hoped earlier this year, it would have won Hong Kong Telecom to boot--and a chance to break into the Chinese market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead, Concert is now hoping for some arrangement with Japan's <font size=-1>NTT</font>, with which <font size=-1>BT</font> already has long-standing links. <font size=-1>BT</font>'s bosses said this week that a deal would have to wait until next year at the earliest, when Japan's regulators are expected to rule on the company's own future. Transforming a transatlantic tryst into a global <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i> will not be easy.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Marriage guidance for would-be brides</h1>

THREE alliances offer global telecoms services. Concert, progeny of the liaison between <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font>, is one; the others are WorldPartners, led by <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, and GlobalOne, combining Deutsche Telekom, France T&eacute;l&eacute;com, and America's Sprint. Both the American carriers may sometimes wish that they had found a beau with such a liberal upbringing as <font size=-1>BT</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All three alliances are oddities. They offer the largest customers of the big telephone companies that own them a one-stop shop for telephone services and rates on international calls that sometimes undercut those charged by local monopolies. Often, local laws allow such discounting providing the ventures limit their reach to big companies.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a relatively new business, but one that is growing quickly--together the three global alliances claim about $3.3 billion in contracts. Yet their ultimate ambitions lie far beyond catering for rich corporate clients. Eventually, they hope to use their global networks to destroy the telecoms rules and rate conventions that have kept standard international calls so expensive for so long.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most such calls are charged according to rates set by each country, in most cases by a monopoly national carrier, as part of a process called "settlement". These rates are usually much higher than the firms' true costs and vary wildly: a call from France to the United States costs twice as much as one in the opposite direction. Because the three main global networks send calls along their own wires, and do not have to hand them off to another carrier at either end, they are able to bypass the settlement system altogether. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today, these networks carry only a small percentage of global telecoms traffic. But as national markets start to open over the next decade, they hope to carry ordinary calls from individuals the same way. In a report to be published later this month, Analysys, a British consultancy, predicts that this could lead to the erosion and eventual collapse of the cosy settlement system. As more traffic bypasses it through global networks, call-back services, and routing through telecoms hubs in low-cost countries, the settlement rates will be eroded.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This will mean not just cheaper calls for all. Most telephone companies will find international business suddenly becomes a lot less profitable. Concert's two rivals consist mainly of telephone companies from countries where markets are still closed--France T&eacute;l&eacute;com and Deutsche Telekom for GlobalOne; 16 companies covering 31 countries for WorldPartners. These companies may be reluctant to cut their prices too fiercely, lest they cannibalise their owners' profits. As a result, they may be least aggressive in the very markets where they have the greatest technical advantages--those of their parents. This weakness is something that Concert, made up of two firms from competitive markets, is sure to exploit.<br>

<p><b>Asian electronics</b></p>
<h1>The silicon tigers' electric shocker</h1>

<font size=1>SINGAPORE</font><p>
<p><b>The economic fortunes of Asian economies are bound up with the electronics industry. A self-inflicted glut is causing a scare</b></p><br>
WHETHER it is making cellular telephones, computers, televisions, pocket calculators or the chips that make them all work, nearly every country in Asia is involved in some aspect of the electronics industry. That is only natural. The electronics business can be entered in all sorts of ways, by making anything from simple components to elaborate consumer products. But too many tigers chasing even as buoyant a market as electronics is a recipe for glut. If the market turns down, Asian economies' fortunes will be dragged down with it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asian countries' dominance of some consumer-electronics markets is phenomenal. Taiwanese companies, for instance, make eight out of ten circuit boards found in the world's personal computers and half of the keyboards plugged into them. Singapore makes some 40% of the world's disk drives, and a third of <font size=-1>PC</font> microprocessors are packaged and tested in Malaysia. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the market into which Asian companies have leapt furthest is the one for memory chips. When shortages drove up chip prices four years running in the early 1990s, even Taiwanese food companies and plastic makers began building $1 billion-a-pop chip-making plants. Such diversification no doubt seemed irresistible at a time when margins were sometimes above 80%. But the resulting glut caused prices to collapse earlier this year--by as much as 70% for memory chips, which are used in products ranging from <font size=-1>PC</font>s to photocopiers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now there appear to be signs of a return to what the semiconductor industry apparently considers "normal": output is set to rise and prices to resume their long-term decline at 30% a year. America's Semiconductor Industry Association forecasts that the value of chip sales will grow worldwide by 3.5% in the fourth quarter; but that is still modest compared with last year's 42% increase. For the time being, some of the new plants are likely to be mothballed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The markets for the things that chips go into are still growing briskly (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart</a>). The number of personal computers worldwide is still forecast to rise by 16% between this year and 1997, according to International Data Corp, an American research firm. But prices are unlikely to stop falling--especially now that Hitachi and Sony, two of Japan's biggest consumer-electronics giants, are muscling into the computer business.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The danger in this is that the fortunes of Asia's economies are closely linked to those of the electronics industry, and especially to memory chips. The repercussions of plunging chip prices have been felt throughout the region. In the first half of this year, export growth throughout East Asia collapsed to just 7%, compared with 28% in the same period a year earlier, according to the Asian Development Bank (<font size=-1>ADB</font>). The bank suggests several reasons: the weaker yen has made Japan more competitive, and some countries in the region, such as China and Indonesia, are trying to cool their economies. But the <font size=-1>ADB</font>'s economists also lay a large part of the blame on a downturn in the electronics business.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Depressed demand for electronic products partly explains slower growth in Singapore. Its manufactured exports (two-thirds of which are electronics goods) shrank by 6% in September, while <font size=-1>GDP</font> growth in the third quarter had slowed to just 3.2% from a year earlier, when it was racing along at 8%. South Korea and Taiwan, two other countries that rely heavily on electronics, are also turning in lower growth figures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To make matters worse for Asia's tigers, the region's poorer nations are also trying to muscle into the electronics business. The ensuing battle could keep capacity running well ahead of demand. The Philippines is one of the latest to push into electronics in a big way. From a low base, the value of its electronics exports surged by 45% in the first seven months of this year. With a relatively cheap, well-educated, workforce that speaks good English--the language of the computer industry--the country is pitching hard for more business. "I think we can assume overcapacity will be here for some time," says Liow Voon Kheong, director of the electronics division of Singapore's Economic Development Board. To help its electronics companies cope, Singapore recently launched a crash training programme to give more people the sort of skills the firms might want.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Faced with stiffer competition, firms will search out the fastest-growing niches. Many Taiwanese firms think that they have found a promising one: making lap-top computers, mostly for western firms such as Compaq, <font size=-1>IBM</font>, Hewlett-Packard, Apple and Dell. Lap-top computers tend to have higher profit margins than desktop <font size=-1>PC</font>s because they are more complex to make, and unit sales have been growing by 30% a year. This year Taiwan aims to make nearly 4m of them, overtaking Japan as the world's leading producer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If other Asian firms follow suit, the Taiwanese could respond by shifting production to cheaper areas. Taiwan's Acer, which is the world's fourth-largest computer firm, has already opened a factory in the Philippines. Yet chasing cheap labour around the Pacific rim is no longer as helpful as it used to be. These days, wages account for less than 5% of the cost of producing many electronic goods. Far more value may therefore be added by nimble staff who can quickly redesign a product, rather than by opening an assembly plant in a country paying lower wages. The sooner Asia's tigers learn that lesson, the better.<br>

<html><head><title>What a choice</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width="78" height="39" alt="The Economist" border=0></p>

<h1 align=center>What a choice</h1>


THE presidential election campaign has been a strange affair, and not just because it has afflicted voters and onlookers alike with many months of torture-by-tedium. It has been strange because the two candidates have spent so much of the time wearing each other's clothes. Bill Clinton, a man who normally cannot let a bandwagon pass without leaping on to it, has cast himself as the solid, reliable, unflinching incumbent, looking to the future rather than to the past, of course, but doing so sober of mien and straight of spine. Meanwhile, Bob Dole, who for 36 years in Congress stood for prudence and for the non-existence of fairies, has run as a tax-cutting radical, declaring (against all available evidence) that the economy is doing miserably and that he has a magic formula to make everyone richer. Since both these poses test credulity to the limit, it is no surprise that many voters snoozed off as the contest went on.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, on November 5th a choice must be made. Or must it? The fact that the opinion polls suggest that Bill Clinton will win easily, and perhaps even by a landslide, may be enough to persuade even more people not to bother to vote than is usual in America, or at least to focus their attention instead on the battle between Democrats and Republicans for control of Congress. That likelihood even makes it tempting for <i>The Economist</i> to suspend its four-yearly habit of endorsing a candidate for the presidency, for making a choice feels less poignant when the outcome seems so clear.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet such apathy would be wrong for us, and it would be wrong for the voter. Although the congressional vote is the more exciting one, because it is more finely balanced, many of the important issues concern both these races. Both races will help determine--in Congress by the outcome, for the presidency if only by the size of Bill Clinton's victory-- whether the broadly Republican ideas of trimmer government and fiscal austerity that have held sway during the past two years will continue to do so during the coming four. And choosing a president ought never to be a casual, shoulder-shrugging affair: getting the right man to lead the world's superpower may be a trying business, but it is also vital.<b><p>A flawed challenger</b><br>
That point holds true even when the men on offer are far from appealing. In the spring of this year Bob Dole looked the sounder of the two even if not the likeliest winner in November. The tragedy of his inept campaign is that he has looked less sound as each week has passed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reputation that made him the Republicans' senior figure, and clear front-runner throughout 1995 for that party's nomination, was that he stood for what nostalgics see as old-fashioned values and what others see as merely high standards. In Congress, most recently as Senate majority leader, he had been a deal-maker; after all, that was his job. But he stood up for his beliefs, supporting free trade against many of his own party's protectionists and attacking Ronald Reagan's supply-side tax cuts in the early 1980s. His speeches rambled, his wit was sometimes mean, his campaigning dire. But what marked him out was character. Whereas most politicians look good on the surface but rather shabbier beneath, Bob Dole was an exception: apparently too honest to try hard to look good, but rather admirable once you got to know him.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a character would be well suited for the presidency, if combined with a steely determination in foreign affairs and a willingness to appoint (and listen to) top-notch advisers. Mr Dole's terrible error this year has been to drop that character and try another one: at best, that of the tax-cutting radical; at worst, that of a man willing to discard his principles to get himself elected. His economic plan contains many good ideas, including tax reform and reductions in federal regulation. But its biggest supposed vote-winner, a 15% cut in personal income tax, would be a disaster. Like the Reagan cuts that Mr Dole opposed, it would widen the budget deficit; with unemployment low and the economy growing strongly, it would stoke up inflation. With that plan, and that character change, he made himself an unappealing choice.<b><p>
A flawed incumbent</b><br>
Until, that is, you compare him with the alternative. Mr Dole has thrown his principles away for four months. Bill Clinton has been doing that for four years. That may be a little unfair. But not much, for the difficulty with Mr Clinton is that he changes so often that it is hard to know what you are supporting, or opposing. In 1992, <i>The Economist</i> endorsed this relatively unknown but energetic governor, arguing that President Bush had run out of steam. Four years of hindsight later, that choice looks like a mistake.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under Second-Term Bush the economy would have been just as healthy as under Mr Clinton, and Alan Greenspan would have done exactly the job at the Federal Reserve that he has anyway been doing. There would have been no distracting fiasco over health-care reform, and the task of reforming welfare might (thanks more to Congress than Mr Bush) have begun sooner. Even more important, there would have been some constancy in foreign policy, built on the foundation of the Gulf war victory. Errors would doubtless have been made. But America and the world would have been spared Mr Clinton's first two years of foreign policy made on the hoof; generally getting it right in the end, but taking several wrong turns along the way.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton has not been a bad president; just a mediocre one. He may have been helped by the fact that he has not had to deal with any huge international crises (he nearly helped to cause one, over China and Taiwan), though he would argue that this has hindered him, by not allowing him to show his mettle. His great achievement was the North American Free-Trade Agreement, a deal begun by Mr Bush but in the end well marketed by President Clinton. His worst error came also on trade, however: taking Japan, supposedly one of America's closest allies, to the brink of a trade war over cars.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has, to be sure, learned from his mistakes. His foreign-policy touch has grown sharper. Brought to his knees by the 1994 mid-term congressional elections, he recast himself as a moderate Republican, keen to balance the budget by 2002, to declare that the "era of big government was over" and, at last, to begin reforming welfare. It is on that ticket that he has run this year, making many small pledges but no new big ones. If he sticks to that position, his second term might not be at all bad. Such a president would be a good balance to a Republican Congress, if (as is to be hoped) that party retains its control of it. Many of the ideas that such a Congress would stand for, including tax reform and further reform of the government safety net, are good ones; President Clinton could usefully restrain the Republicans' social-policy extremists. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But will he stick to that position? That is the question that will always surround him. If he does, this newspaper will congratulate him in 2000 when he retires. But the risk is that he will not. He will face financial constraints imposed by the bond markets, but none of the constraints of re-election. He may be beset by ethical problems, whether over campaign finance or Whitewater indictments, even conceivably of his wife. These might lead him in all sorts of new directions, especially if he has been re-elected on a landslide, and if the Democrats were to regain control of one or both of the houses of Congress. No one can be sure what he would do in such circumstances. And that is why <i>The Economist</i> feels unable to endorse him. We would not know what we were backing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Would we know with Bob Dole? It is hard to be sure. We choose him on the assumption that the real Bob Dole is the one who spent three decades on Capitol Hill, not this year's dubious character; that he would be more prudent than his economic plan implies. That is an awkward basis for an endorsement. But the choice is a lousy one.<br>

<h2>Zaire on the brink</h2>
<p>Zaire and Rwanda appeared close to war as the Zairean army was driven back by Tutsi militias in <b>eastern Zaire</b>. More than half a million people, mainly Hutu refugees, have been displaced yet again, and aid workers, forced out by the fighting, are unable to provide help.</p>
<p><b>Eugene de Kock</b>, a former South African policeman who assassinated opponents of apartheid, was jailed for more than 200 years for murder, fraud and other crimes.</p>
<p><b>Palestinians and Israelis </b>negotiated on, and on, over Hebron. Yasser Arafat went to Europe, hoping for cash and support. The <font size=-1>EU</font> appointed its own "envoy" to (but not in) the talks. West Bank tensions rose after the killing of a Palestinian child. </p>
<p>A <font size=-1>UN</font> report said many children are dying of malnutrition and disease in <b>Iraq</b> because of sanctions. Rival factions of Iraqi Kurds began peace talks, under American sponsorship, in Turkey.</p>
<h2>Germany gasps</h2>
<p>Germany will <b>fail to meet the criteria</b> for joining Europe's currency union because of its debt and budget deficit, according to Germany's six leading economic institutes. The finance minister, Theo Waigel, was mauled in parliament. Germany, Britain and the Netherlands objected to <b>France</b>'s accounting methods for meeting the criteria.</p>
<p><b>Helmut Kohl </b>became Germany's longest-serving chancellor this century, surpassing the record 14 years and one month set by Konrad Adenauer in 1963.</p>
<p><font size=-1>EU</font> farm ministers agreed in a majority vote (Germany dissented) to give an extra 500m ecus ($630m) to farmers financially hurt by the <b>mad-cow crisis</b>. France, Germany and Britain will get over half the extra aid, which is on top of 850m ecus already agreed.</p>
<p>A candidate for the right-wing opposition, Petar Stoyanov, won the first round of <b>Bulgaria</b>'s presidential election, beating the (ex-communist) Socialist, Ivan Marazov.</p>
<p>The centre-left Labour Party, led by Alfred Sant, beat <b>Malta</b>'s ruling conservatives in a general election. The new government says it will leave <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s Partnership for Peace programme immediately.</p>
<p><b>Britain and Albania</b> settled a 50-year dispute. Albania will pay $2m for damaging two British navy ships and causing the deaths of 44 sailors off the Albanian coast in 1946. Britain will give back gold worth $20m taken from Albania by Nazi Germany during the second world war and which has since been held in the Bank of England.</p>
<p>A sale in Vienna of <b>Jewish-owned art</b> looted by the Nazis raised more than 153m schillings ($14m), four times estimate. The money will go to victims of the Holocaust.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<h2>Random variable</h2>
<p><b>North Korea </b>upset its neighbours by announcing that any missile it develops will be tested "whenever and in what manner" it sees fit. South Korea kept up the tension in the peninsula by refusing further dealings with the North until it apologises for sending a submarine into the South's waters in September.</p>
<p>Wang Dan, a campaigner for <b>democracy </b>in China, was sentenced to 11 years in jail for, it was claimed, plotting to overthrow the government. Mr Wang previously spent several years in prison after taking part in democracy demonstrations in 1989.</p>
<p>Around 30 candidates put their names forward for the post of chief executive of <b>Hong Kong </b>after the British colony is handed back to China in 1997.</p>
<p><b>Japan </b>now has a minority government. In the wake of the general election, a loose alliance was agreed between the Liberal Democratic Party, led by prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, and the smaller parties that have been part of the governing coalition.</p>
<p>The Pakistani capital, Islamabad, was sealed off by the government for three days to prevent a march on parliament by <b>Islamic fundamentalists </b>calling for the resignation of the prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. In another development, the International Monetary Fund said that it would renew financial support to Pakistan.</p>
<p><b>Narasimha Rao</b>,<b> </b>India's former prime minister, appeared in court accused in connection with a forgery case seven years ago.</p>
<h2>The third man</h2>
<p>In the last week of the <b>American presidential race</b>, Bill Clinton held on to his commanding lead over Bob Dole, the Republican, in the polls. Ross Perot, the Reform Party candidate, rejected a request by the Dole campaign that he should withdraw. In turn, Mr Clinton rejected Mr Perot's request for an hour-long debate on ethics. </p>
<p>The Justice Department formally acknowledged that <b>Richard Jewell</b>, a security guard named as a suspect in the bombing at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, was no longer a suspect in the case.</p>
<p>The judge in the <b>Oklahoma bombing trial </b>said that the two defendants would be tried separately. </p>
<p>Awaiting the official results of <b>Nicaragua's elections</b>, the Sandinists'<b> </b>presidential candidate, ex-president Daniel Ortega, still refused to concede.</p>
<p>A nearly new Fokker jet on an internal flight <b>crashed </b>soon after take-off in Sao Paulo, Brazil, killing all 95 people on board, and destroying homes.</p>
<p>The United States' ambassador to <b>Colombia</b> denounced a draft allowing extradition of drug-traffickers because it would not be retroactive. "He thinks he's a viceroy," said one minister.</p>

<h2>Currency capers</h2>
<p>(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The <b>dollar </b>reached a 3.5-year high against a flagging yen. But the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark rose strongly against the greenback after the country's leading economic institutes predicted that Germany might not fulfil the criteria for joining European economic and monetary union, and that German interest rates could soon rise. Meanwhile, an unexpected quarter-point rise in British interest rates caused an already strong pound to jump to a 20-month high of $1.63.</p>
<p>In South Africa, the <b>rand </b>fell to a record low of 4.74 to the dollar. Worries about the country's minuscule foreign reserves were among the things that were blamed for the currency's decline.</p>
<p>The <font size=-1>IMF</font> said payments of its $10 billion loan to Russia could resume soon. But first it wants to be sure that the government is tackling the country's <b>massive tax arrears</b>. Russian officials have launched bankruptcy proceedings against four big companies and threatened several others with similar action.</p>
<h2>Called to account</h2>
<p>Independent auditors, under the aegis of a committee led by a former chairman of America's Fed, Paul Volcker, are to be granted unprecedented access to <b>Swiss bank accounts</b> as part of an investigation into whether Swiss banks have disguised the assets of Nazi victims from their rightful owners.</p>
<p>Two of the biggest <b>German regional banks</b>,<b> </b>state-owned Norddeutsche Landesbank and Bankgesellschaft Berlin, in which the state of Berlin has a 56% stake, said that they were discussing a closer alliance. A full merger between the two would create Germany's second-biggest bank, with DM500 billion ($330 billion) of assets.</p>
<p><b>Deutsche Bank</b>, Germany's biggest, said that Rolf Breuer, a management-board member, will succeed Hilmar Kopper as its chief executive next May. Mr Breuer has helped to mastermind the bank's aggressive push into investment banking.</p>
<p>Several current and former senior executives of <b>ITC</b>, an Indian tobacco company in which Britain's <font size=-1>B.A.T</font> Industries has a stake, were arrested in connection with alleged violations of the country's foreign-exchange rules. </p>
<h2>Border controls</h2>
<p>France's prime minister, Alain Jupp&eacute;, promised to hold a parliamentary debate on the transfer of <b>Thomson Multimedia</b> to Daewoo, a South Korean company, as part of the government's plan to sell Thomson <font size=-1>SA</font>, a state conglomerate, to the Lagard&egrave;re group. Opposition to a sale of the consumer-electronics arm to the Korean firm is growing.</p>
<p>After winning over a recalcitrant Denmark, European Union foreign ministers formed a united front against America's <b>anti-Cuba legislation</b>. European legislation will make it illegal for <font size=-1>EU</font> firms to comply with American court rulings on the issue.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Italy's privatisation plans were boosted when its heavily oversubscribed sale of 14% of <b>ENI</b>, an energy giant, raised 7.7 trillion lire ($5 billion). The sell-off, which was the country's largest ever, cuts the state's stake in <font size=-1>ENI</font> to 71%. But plans to privatise <font size=-1>STET</font>, a telecoms group, are likely to be delayed until late 1997 because of political wrangling.</p>
<p>Britain's privatised utilities attracted attention yet again. <b>CalEnergy </b>of Nebraska launched a &#163;766m ($1.25 billion) hostile bid for <b>Northern Electric</b> and grabbed 13% of its shares in a dawn raid. </p>
<p>Battling on-line rivals and the Internet, <b>America Online</b> is separating into three operating divisions and revamping its pricing structure. Robert Pittman, former head of <font size=-1>MTV</font> Networks, will head the firm's core on-line division. The firm is also taking a $460m charge for its restructuring.<b> Microsoft</b> also created a new division, which will separate its Network on-line service and cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> channel from its software operations.</p>
<p>A French luxury-goods firm, <font size=-1>LVMH</font> Mo&euml;t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, is paying FFr12.6 billion ($2.5 billion) for a majority stake in San Francisco's <font size=-1>DFS</font>, the world's largest distributor of <b>luxury goods</b>,<b> </b> which has extensive dealings in East Asia. The deal is being challenged by some of <font size=-1>DFS</font>'s minority shareholders in America.</p>
<p>Dieter Bock resigned as chief executive of <b>Lonrho</b>, a British conglomerate, to become its non-executive deputy chairman, and sold his 18.3% stake to South Africa's Anglo American for &#163;258m ($422m). He will re-invest the cash in Lonrho's trading operations when the group completes its three-way split into hotels, trading and mining businesses. Stakis, a British hotel and casino group, offered to buy Lonrho's five luxury Metropole Hotels for &#163;327m.</p>
<h2>Lotus-eating</h2>
<p><b>Proton</b>, a Malaysian car maker, is paying &#163;51m ($83m) for a 64% stake in <b>Lotus</b>, a British car maker best known for its luxurious sports cars.</p>
<p><b>Volkswagen</b> said that it would appeal against a decision by a German court to dismiss its lawsuit accusing Opel, a subsidiary of General Motors, of defamation. The charge relates to a press conference in March, when Opel and <font size=-1>GM</font> announced that they had filed a lawsuit against <font size=-1>VW</font> alleging industrial espionage.</p>
<p><b>McDonnell Douglas </b> dropped a $3 billion plan to build what would have been its biggest-ever aircraft, the long-range <font size=-1>MD</font>-<font size=-1>XX</font>. The plane was to have put the company back in the big jet market.</p>

<h1>Where's the outrage?</h1>

<p><b>In January, America's voters were thought to be furious. Now, on the eve of the election, they seem remarkably content. What happened?</b></p><br>
THIS was meant to be an election fuelled by anger. Back in February, when Pat Buchanan won the New Hampshire primary, pundits noted that Americans were miserable, furious, insecure in their jobs, frightened of technology and still incensed with politicians. Of the candidates available then, only Mr Buchanan, with his eloquent invocations of class warfare and immigrant hordes, seemed to tap that feeling. "The peasants are coming with pitchforks!" he cried, summoning up a vision of his supporters besieging Evil Baron Bill in White Castle. Naturally, he could not win. But it was no surprise to see first Bob Dole, the Republican, and then Bill Clinton himself, setting off in hot pursuit of the discontented voters Mr Buchanan had spoken for. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a time, "insecurity" was the issue of the day. The candidates remembered, all too acutely, the fate of George Bush in 1992. Mr Bush had been taken by surprise in New Hampshire, again by Mr Buchanan, because he had failed to note that three-quarters of the voters there were worried about the economy<i>.</i> In 1992, the worries had been genuine. The economy had been slow to recover from recession; and, although the underlying indicators were healthy, the electorate was not then feeling the benefit. Bill Clinton's campaign mantra, "The rich got richer, and the middle class got the shaft", hit home; in their droves, the blue-collar Democrats who had switched to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s turned back to the Democratic Party. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This year, to all appearances, the state of the middle class (which in America encompasses almost everyone between janitors and millionaires), seemed equally unhappy. Since 1993, the North American Free-Trade Agreement had potentially enabled more jobs to be lost to low-wage Mexico (the "giant sucking sound"). Immigration, both legal and illegal, was at record levels. Companies were plunging headlong into the new vogue of "downsizing", boosting share prices while eliminating jobs in their thousands--and these were in secure industries, such as aerospace or telecoms, on which the post-war American dream had been founded. Worst of all, stagnant wages, which had been a feature of the 1980s, began to affect larger numbers of people higher up the income scale. Two jobs, rather than one, were needed to keep a middle-class family in the style to which it had become accustomed; and with working women had come a host of new social strains and difficulties.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The candidates in 1996 played with these issues for weeks. Yet, try as they might, they could not suggest what to do about them. In 1992, the solution had been relatively easy: a middle-class tax cut. Both Mr Clinton and Mr Bush offered one, and it was eagerly received: so eagerly, that it took Ross Perot to remind both candidates of the virtues of a balanced budget. This year, however, taxes have seemed to have little to do with the underlying malaise.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The presence in the Republican primaries of Steve Forbes, a billionaire publisher with a one-plank platform of a flat tax, encouraged most of the Republican candidates to flirt with their versions of a flat tax in the early months of the year. Mr Forbes disappeared early and the flat tax went with him, at least as an election issue. Only a shade of it--Mr Dole's vague promise of a "fairer and flatter" system--survived in the Republicans' economic plan. To the degree they grasped the flat-tax argument, voters seemed genuinely worried that it would not be revenue-neutral, but would be an unacceptable crimp on government. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once the flat tax was set aside, both Mr Dole and Mr Clinton began to emphasise their original offer of tax cuts for the middle classes. But here was another surprise: the voters seemed wary, and not even particularly interested. Mr Dole's offer of a cut of 15%, the central theme of his campaign, never caught fire. Voters simply did not believe his arithmetic. Mr Clinton's smaller tax cut, not much more than a token nod to middle-class worries, was preferred because it was safer. Indeed, polls showed that most Americans, offered a choice between the Republican tax cut and a balanced budget, much preferred the latter.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps, then, the issue of job insecurity could be addressed directly. But this proved hard. Suggestions by Robert Reich, the labour secretary, that the government should try to oblige corporations to behave "more responsibly" towards their workers, got precisely nowhere. Mr Dole's brief attack on Wall Street greed was so ridiculous that it was abandoned the next day. Mr Clinton, who was not then actively campaigning, wisely kept his head down. Candidates were quickly reminded that it is unthinkable for an American government-- even one controlled by Democrats--to tell firms how to behave. The flurry died down.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But if corporations could not be blamed for middle-class anxiety, other things could. On the right, the Republicans had already taken up cudgels against both affirmative action and immigration, on no firm evidence that either was a stealer of middle-class jobs. The Clinton administration, too, had promised to review policies in both fields. Bills to overturn affirmative action and to crack down on immigration were already going through Congress. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a time, it seemed that these might be the hot issues of 1996. They were not. Outside California--where both issues have been the subject of contentious local propositions--voters failed to seize on either racial quotas or immigration as a focus for their anger. And once Mr Buchanan had retired from the scene, no candidate tried to encourage them. The votes of blacks and Latinos were not so lightly to be tossed away. Besides, as far as jobs and wages were concerned, most Americans were not at all as angry as they seemed. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This fact became increasingly clear as the campaign proceeded. In retrospect, the fury of January and February looks like the last gasp of wilful economic ignorance, before the figures became so relentlessly encouraging that Americans could no longer ignore them. Even at the end of last year, employment in the old manufacturing industries of the mid-west was rising so fast that workers had to be recruited from other states. <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> was found not to have exported jobs to Mexico; on the contrary, a new taste for American goods there added to job-creation north of the border. Downsizing had been balanced either by the creation of new jobs in the same companies, or by the opening of new opportunities elsewhere.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Increasingly, voters reported that they felt happier both about Mr Clinton's management of the economy, and about their own prospects. The president's bold claims to have created 10.5m new jobs, to have lowered unemployment to 5.1% and to have encouraged a long and solid expansion, were allowed to pass without much remark even by Republicans.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole's assertion that the economy was "in bad shape" found no hearers; the claims of Jack Kemp, his running mate, that the economy could grow at twice the rate of the Clinton years were received with the ridicule they deserved. The typical swing voter was no longer the anguished man with a pink slip; it was the "soccer mom" whose four-wheel-drive car, demanding job and attendance at well-groomed football pitches suggested a prosperity hampered only by a chronic lack of time. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Undoubtedly, not everyone was lifted by the economic boom. But those who were left behind were increasingly the young, black, ill-educated or unskilled, whose votes were insignificant because they often did not bother to vote. Once most Americans reported that they felt more cheerful about their prospects, the issue of insecurity vanished: at least for the moment, and at least as fuel for anyone's campaign. <br>
</p><p><b>The moral high ground</b><br>What then of the other angry issues? At one time, there were plenty of them. Abortion, for example, had not died down since 1973, when a decision of the Supreme Court made it legal. The Christian right (disappointed in its efforts to get anti-abortion measures included in the Republicans' "Contract with America" of 1994) had vowed to fill the Republican convention with delegates pledged to oppose abortion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Its efforts were largely successful. Yet the issue, while still mentioned locally, never surfaced for long in the national debate. This was largely because Mr Dole let it be known that the Republican Party could comfortably accommodate both supporters and opponents of abortion. Such an assurance stretched credulity, but it worked. For in truth, again, most of America is not angry about abortion; it dislikes the practice, believes it should be legal but rare, and is sick of the politicisation of the subject. Even Mr Clinton's veto of a bill banning partial-birth abortions, which provoked angry protests from America's Catholic bishops, caused barely a flicker in the mood of the electorate. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There might have been more mileage in that other pre-eminent issue of the right, moral decline. The topic was passionately debated in 1992, after Dan Quayle, Mr Bush's running mate, regretted the portrayal of single motherhood as an acceptable "lifestyle choice" in a television soap opera. At the Republican convention in Houston that year, Mr Buchanan's tirade about the liberal onslaught on Judeo-Christian values was rapturously received.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From a conservative moralist's point of view, nothing in American media or public life has improved since that speech was made. Indeed, the presidency itself is now occupied by a man of questionable moral character. But the fate of the issue lay with the personality of the conservative candidate. Mr Dole was intent on avoiding moral righteousness to preserve the unity of his party, and the embarrassed cough of a decent man was no substitute. He struck a chord for a time with a bold attack on Hollywood for filling America's screens with violence and promiscuity; but, after Hollywood huffed, he more or less dropped the subject. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the closing weeks of the campaign, and especially in the second presidential debate, Mr Dole homed in on the ethically-challenged White House itself; but the connection between impenetrable Arkansas scandals, Asian fund-raisers and any wider sense of moral drift proved difficult to make. "Where's the outrage?" asked Mr Dole, plaintively, in Dallas on October 25th. Good question. But time and again, polls showed that voters were not much bothered by Mr Clinton's personal shortcomings. If he was a good <font size=-1>CEO</font>, they were happy to overlook the rest. And by September, the president did indeed seem to be the successful manager of contented folk: which raises the question: if he had not been, would he have weathered so buoyantly the justified attacks on his character? <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is not quite the whole story. To some extent, Mr Clinton's embrace of welfare reform in mid-campaign also deflated the issue of moral decline. In 1992, it could be argued (and was by both sides) that the system of welfare payments was a prime cause of demoralisation, dependency and inner-city failure. By 1996, the key word "responsibility" was being proclaimed at full blast by both parties. The easy dichotomy of 1992 (or, even more, of 1994) between morally stern Republicans and sloppily compassionate Democrats had disappeared in at least one vital area of government policy; it therefore became harder to argue that it was true in general. <br></p><p><b>A pox on both parties<br></b>Americans, however, were meant to be angry with politicians as a species this year, regardless of label. Observers of politics just before the Republican cataclysm of 1994 had described an electorate seething with a fury that could scarcely be explained. Incumbents were self-satisfied; the power of special interests was unbudgeable; too much time was spent in Washington; there was no accountability or control. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since most of the 1994 incumbents were Democrats, this discontent seemed easily remedied by a switch of parties in Congress--especially when Republicans were promising an upheaval. But voters remained angry even after they had kicked the Democratic bums out. The Republican honeymoon (and, in particular, the honeymoon of Newt Gingrich, the abrasive speaker of the House and self-appointed revolutionary leader) ended within a year, even though the freshmen in Congress delivered, or tried to deliver, almost everything they had promised. Rumour had it that the American voter was unappeasable; he hated both Republicans and Democrats. And his anger this time might really induce him to go for a third party.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It did not happen. It hardly ever happens, of course; but Ross Perot's 19% in 1992 had been impressive, and voters did not seem so angry then. Why did Mr Perot's campaign fail so signally in 1996? Partly because he was neither as fresh nor as visible as before; partly because his suppression of dissent in his Reform Party left a sour taste. But Americans were also not half as angry with the status quo as they were said to be. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For all the tirades against Republicans and Democrats, the truth is that the two big parties still deliver the goods both nationally and, more to the point, locally. At election time, the big-party machinery (with its plentiful lubricant of special-interest money) swings impressively into gear, and voters are swept along by it. Americans this year might have had some cause to be angry about a rotten choice of candidates; instead, they were resigned and passionless.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, a third party succeeds only when it can harness an issue that is stirring the country to some extraordinary degree, but which the big parties are ignoring. Mr Perot's anti-deficit jeremiads almost provided such an issue in 1992; but both Republicans and Democrats have now seized that theme for their own, and no other similarly galvanising issue can be found these days. Americans in early 1996, asked which issues worried them, gave about 11% equally to crime, schools, the economy and a number of other things (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>). This was the clearest sign--and it should not, perhaps, have come as a surprise--that there was no single furious torrent in January, more a confluence of streams which have since trickled out along numerous different channels and are now on the point of sinking into the ground. <br></p><p><b>The good old status quo</b><br>In fact, the overwhelming impression of the 1996 campaign is that voters, far from being furious with government, want things to remain pretty much as they are. They want none of the big entitlement programmes--Medicare, Social Security and the rest--to be touched. They like Mr Clinton's little bits of government-intervention-at-the-margin, on such matters as school uniforms and parental leave. They succeeded two years ago in kicking out an entrenched form of government, which has refreshed the debate; but they have also had their brush with revolution, and a little went a long way.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Republicans after the 1994 election misread voters' anger as badly as the Democrats did before it. They thought they had been given a mandate to deregulate, shrink government, cut spending and cut taxes. In fact, the negative grumpiness of voters did not translate into a positive passion for something different. Americans did not really know what they wanted. As it happens, parts of the revolution they got--from the banning of unfunded federal mandates to the turning over of welfare payments to the states--have made voters feel they are slightly more in control of the machinery of government. And there is nothing like the delegation of a portion of responsibility to make people feel that they are happy for the government to go on doing the rest.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of the various shows of temper of the past few years, only two cases of genuine anger can be discerned: frustration with stagnant wages and with incumbent politicians. Incomes have still not moved much: although average household income rose in 1995 for the first time in six years, earnings for full-time workers, both men and women, declined. As for incumbents, plenty are still ensconced, while the brave new freshmen of 1994 have discovered the charms of special-interest money. But even a small sign of movement in the right direction has made for a generally placid electorate, who seem poised to return a mediocre incumbent by a massive margin. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For America's mainstream politicians, this is good news. It is probably good, too, for American politics, for no democracy can function successfully if the electorate is in a state of permanent disgruntlement. But for America as a whole, there is also a dark side. There is no shortage of issues in America worthy of public outrage--but these are being aired only partially in the political debate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The inner cities are home to a growing number of people who have no regard for, or connection with, the moral, political or social mores of the country as a whole. Guns and drugs are a growing menace. The public-school system, once internationally admired, looks ramshackle, and too few Americans are leaving school with the skills needed to compete in the global marketplace. Relations between the races are rockier than they have been for some time. And America remains burdened by an unfair and over-complex tax system. Any one of these issues is worth a campaign in itself. But the lesson of 1996 is that none of them will count for anything if the average middle-class voter feels her wallet is well-filled and her prospects satisfactory. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is this a sign of narcoleptic boredom induced by television? Is it exhaustion produced by over-excitement two years ago? Is it the proof of an attention span no longer than the president's? Yes, all these things; and one more. Most Americans know in their hearts that they are the world's most fortunate nation, the most secure from war, the most economically self-reliant, and the most free. Under such circumstances, of course, it is still possible to be unhappy. But to be politically furious for any length of time takes effort: effort which, in the mid-1990s, most voters simply do not have the time or the inclination to make.<br>

<h1>A Democratic Nixon?</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON DC</font><p>
THE presidential race is winding to a close, and in some ways it seems to have been extravagantly fruitless. More cash--clean, laundered, or otherwise-- was spent on campaign ads than ever before; but for nearly a year Bill Clinton's lead over Bob Dole has remained more or less static. And yet something remarkable has transpired. Mr Clinton's Democratic Party has shifted sharply right; and this change is forcing Republicans to change also. The result may be a long-term shift in the identity and electoral appeal of both big parties. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Democrats used to be the party of the welfare state, of misgovernment-as-usual, of a tendency to believe that the poor and the unconventional and even the criminal deserved more sympathy than average Americans. Starting with his 1992 campaign, and even more convincingly this time, Mr Clinton has abandoned those positions. He has ended guaranteed welfare, and proclaimed the era of big government over. He has trumpeted his tough policies on crime. He has talked little about helping gays or feminists or poor blacks, addressing himself instead to the concerns of the middle class--of people who "work hard and play by the rules", as his campaign rhetoric has it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In so doing, Mr Clinton has put his party in America's middle ground, a territory once occupied by Republicans. In the late 1960s the Democrats chose to be the exciting party rather than the majority party. They embraced civil rights, feminism and the new campus counter-culture; and these fashionable crusades alienated ordinary voters. Because the Democrats had vacated the middle ground, Richard Nixon could pitch his campaign to the "silent majority" in 1968. He won, and Republicans held the White House for 20 of the next 24 years. The Democrats' single victory, in 1976, was a post-Watergate anomaly. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now America is experiencing the mirror image of this process. Under Newt Gingrich, the radical speaker of the House, the Republicans have become the exciting party. They have latched on to this decade's trendy themes: resentment of government, rising religious fervour, the belief that the era of the Internet will compel radical decentralisation of power. But the exciting party, in the 1960s as now, is not the majority party--at least not when it comes to presidential elections. The Gingrichite drive to curb public spending, to close down several departments of the federal government and to hand their functions to the states, has made Mr Dole seem extreme. As a result, the silent majority that backed Nixon now looks to Mr Clinton. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the moment, not many commentators are willing to see this as a lasting shift. After all, Mr Clinton has not been re-elected yet, and a last-minute catastrophe is always possible. More likely, Mr Clinton could be re-elected and then tack left, as he did after his 1992 victory. The labour unions, which have spent an unprecedented $35m on getting Democrats elected to the House, will demand a pay-off. Indeed, their opposition to spending cuts may be so strong as to undermine Mr Clinton's centrist pledge to balance the budget.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A post-election leftward shift cannot be ruled out, but the odds are against it. Mr Clinton's most obvious leftish policy in 1993 was his attempted revamp of health care; this time round, his campaign is devoid of equivalent promises. Moreover, although the unions will emerge from the election with some clout, other trends will balance this. Democratic candidates for the House and Senate this year have done their best to cast themselves as moderates. They are less likely to push Mr Clinton left than their peers were four years ago. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, there is another reason to believe in the Clinton-Nixon analogy, and it is the most telling. Whatever a re-elected Clinton might do in office for the next four years, the next Democratic presidential nominee is almost bound to be a centrist. The lesson of the past two years is simply too powerful to ignore. At the start of 1995, when Mr Clinton was seen as being on the left, he lagged likely Republican rivals by huge margins in the polls. A year later, when the president was on the right, he was ahead by equally huge margins. For this reason, Dick Gephardt, the likeliest leftish contender for the Democratic nomination four years from now, has lately been tacking right. Al Gore, the probable nominee, is on the right already.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the Democrats continue to claim the middle ground, can Republicans stave off a string of losses like the one suffered by Democrats before them? This year's campaign shows how difficult this is. For much of this year, Mr Dole has tried to devise policies with mass appeal, but which Mr Clinton had not claimed before him. The Democrats had usurped the Republicans' traditional role as the pro-business party, so for a while Mr Dole echoed Pat Buchanan's attacks on corporate downsizing. The Democrats had become the party of fiscal discipline, so Mr Dole abandoned years of fiscal caution in favour of cutting taxes. Casting around for more ways to look different, Mr Dole put aside his old support for racial quotas and denounced them. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of this really worked, with the result that Mr Dole flitted from one theme to the next, sacrificing his claim to be the constant leader who could be trusted by the electorate. It is the crowning irony of this campaign that the garrulous president has promised only small things, leaving people to guess what he would do in his second term. Meanwhile the taciturn challenger has thrown out a promiscuous list of half-explained proposals.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Might things work out differently four years from now? Some of Mr Dole's ploys, such as his attacks on business, are never likely to get a Republican elected. Others, such as his attack on Mr Clinton's character, will not work against a different candidate. But the Republicans are not without hope. On two issues, the Democrats have yet to seize the middle ground, leaving an opening for skilled attack. These issues are school choice and racial quotas.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a speech in California on October 28th, Mr Dole gave a glimpse of the powerful case to be made against racial quotas. Opposition to discrimination of this kind is not a blow against blacks, but a blow in favour of individual rights, he said. He could have gone further. Quotas tend to help the black middle class; by replacing them with a drive to find work for the underclass, government compassion could better find its target. Strangely, neither party has yet made this case. The Democrats urge the need to find jobs for the welfare underclass; the Republicans attack racial quotas. Neither has grabbed the middle ground by putting the two together. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole tried, but failed, to make a winning argument on school choice. All Americans want better schools; most would like a choice of where to send their children. The Republicans say the answer is to give parents education vouchers. The Democrats are not willing to go so far, partly because of their strong ties to teachers' unions. A more skilled orator than Mr Dole could have feasted on this: his opponents stood in the way of parental freedom and children's opportunity to learn, because of their ties to a special interest. Four years from now, a Republican candidate may well return to this promising subject.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of which is to say that the Democrats' shift to the centre, though remarkably well advanced, is not complete yet. Mr Clinton has stolen many Republican ideas, just as Nixon governed like a Democrat. But he has not stolen all of them. Over the next four years, this may change: the Democratic Leadership Council, home of the party's intellectual right, is urging a break with racial quotas and progress towards school choice. That would make the centrist Democrats even harder to defeat. Unless, that is, the Nixon-Clinton analogy holds in one final way, and second-term Clinton is disgraced by a Watergate of his own.<br>

More surprisingly, Mr Perot says he thinks "every American" would pick Mr Dole over Mr Clinton if that were the only choice (thanks to Mr Perot, it isn't).

<b>Counter-omen: </b>"The presidential candidate with the greatest number of royal genes has always been the victor since George Washington," says Harold Brooks-Baker of Burke's Peerage. Both Messrs Clinton and Dole can trace their ancestry to King Henry III; Mr Clinton can also trace his directly to Simon de Montfort and Robert I of France. This makes his blood marginally bluer. However, says Mr Brooks-Baker, "President Clinton's descent from Henry III is illegitimate." <br>

<p><b>The campaign</b></p>
<h1>A long day's journey</h1>

<font size=1>UNIVERSITY CITY, MISSOURI, AND DENVER, COLORADO</font><p>
YOU do not need to have spent months on the campaign trail to get a pretty good sense of the way things have gone. Just a day will do. Take last Monday, October 28th, eight days before the election.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bill Clinton was in University City, Missouri, where his own polls tell him he is some 12 points ahead. Bob Dole was in Anaheim, California, where he trails by up to 20 points. In front of Mr Dole was a podium with the word "Trust"; behind him and in every camera shot, thanks to amazing stage-management, stood the eccentric congressman, Bob Dornan, who makes Newt Gingrich look like a moderate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Having prolonged the visit to California, the Dole camp needed to decide where to travel next. The first plan--an overnight stop in Denver on Monday, then on to Ohio before returning to Washington--was abandoned. Maybe Mr Dole would go to Denver on Tuesday, then on to Louisiana. Or maybe not. Throughout Monday, planners waited for the candidate to "sign off" on a schedule; but on Monday evening, with time running out to organise the next day's events, staff were still unsure where their candidate would be going.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was a telling illustration of a campaign plagued by indecision. Mr Dole had lurched from one tactic to another, from economics to ethics, from optimism to anger. Towards the end, he had turned his anger against the "liberal" media (always a bad sign) and against the supposedly sleepy electorate (even worse). He had sent his campaign manager on a bizarre and ultimately humiliating mission to try to persuade Ross Perot to drop out of the race. Now, with barely a week to go, he had apparently lost all sense of direction.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Back in Missouri, Mr Clinton was, as usual, basking in bright sunlight and-- voice slightly hoarse, body reaching towards the crowd, hands resting intimately on the front of the podium--showing off to the "Show-Me" state the latest piece of good economic news. The budget deficit for 1996, the president revealed, was a smaller-than-forecast $107 billion, 63% lower than when he took office. In the distance, a few demonstrators were shouting and holding signs such as "Cattle Futures" and "Paula Jones". But Mr Clinton carried on constructing his metaphorical bridge to the 21st century, before departing to squeeze in stops in Minneapolis and Chicago.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even the mishaps at Clinton events play to his advantage. The president was supposed to be joined at the rally by the best-known local politician, Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader who hopes to replace Mr Gingrich as speaker if the Democrats recapture Congress. But Mr Gephardt missed his flight from Washington. Republicans were thus deprived of perfect images to illustrate their end-of-campaign warnings of a Clinton-Gephardt nightmare (that is, a return to unchecked Democratic power).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the end, Mr Dole opted for a quick stop in Denver on Tuesday before returning to Washington. His campaign cobbled together an event at the Colorado Convention Centre, inviting geologists in town for their annual meeting in an effort to boost turnout. A few geologists turned up, despite the fact that Mr Dole was competing with sessions such as "The Godzilla Syndrome: scientific inaccuracies of pre-historic animals in the movies." Uncharacteristically, it was an animated evening in a packed hall, but Mr Dole was clearly desperate to get back to Washington. Perhaps he should have headed for University City, too. There, in a restaurant called Blueberry Hill, he would have seen Chuck Berry's guitar on display. A famous Berry refrain would make an apt theme for the Dole campaign: "No Particular Place To Go."<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>The Rules of the game</h1>

"DON'T accept a Saturday-night date after Wednesday." Thus <i>Rule#7 </i>of "The Rules: Time-tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr Right" (Warner Books). The slim volume by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider is taking America by storm (or rather, by confetti). It is discussed on talk shows, chuckled over in newspaper features, debated at dinner parties. American girls--not women, in Rules-speak--are either religiously following the 35 Rules in order to find a husband, or else deriding the ideas but buying the book and handing it on to their friends. Either way, America is Rules crazy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why limit this to winning your man? Might there not be equally potent Rules for winning elections? Indeed there are. They are tested, immutable, obvious. Play by them, you win. You may think the Rules crass, calculating and simplistic, a codification of the sort of manipulation that has given politics a bad name. Maybe. But would-be presidents ignore them at their peril. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The essence of the dating Rules for girls can be reduced to four old-fashioned words: play hard to get. With the political Rules, the guiding principle is just the opposite: play easy to get. Do not be mysterious, reticent, enigmatic, busy with other things. Be understandable, accessible, willing, solicitous, relentless. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Above all, don't break the Rules. "Now we're having Texas state troopers rush to some other state to stop the flow of whatever," Bob Dole said in Houston last week. Impenetrable Dole-speak is against the Rules. You can probably think of many candidates who thought they would do things their own way, follow their instincts, win it on their own terms--only to lose on polling day. They should have stuck to the Rules. Our space is limited, so here are just ten of the most important.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule#1</i>: Spend, spend, spend. This is the reverse of the dating Rules--a Rules girl never spends a penny. Raise as much money as you can, be it hard or soft, in big lumps or small (though beware of Asians bearing gifts). And never run out of it. Bob Dole was broke between the primaries and the convention--and was duly outclassed by a free-spending Bill Clinton. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #2</i>: Always return phone calls. (Again, the opposite of girls' Rules, and the opposite of the often hard-to-get Dole campaign.) Indeed, be the first to phone or fax. The Clinton/Gore people pioneered "prebuttal" and handed their state press secretaries red buttons marking them as a "Rapid Response Team"--a Rules badge if ever there was one.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #3</i>: Have a plan, stick to it. Mr Clinton can drive you nuts with his 21st-century bridge-building, and his "<font size=-1>MMEE</font>" mantra of Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment. But consistency is part of the Rules. The Dole campaign changed course with disconcerting frequency. "There never was a strategy," Don Sipple, a former Dole strategist, told <i>Newsweek</i>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #4</i>: Flattery will get you everywhere. Sweet-talk the voters, especially swing ones such as soccer moms. Talk about things that matter to them--such as <font size=-1>V</font>-chips for televisions, school uniforms, gun-free schools, getting kids through college-- even if you cannot really help that much. Promise to cut their taxes and spend some money on them (see <i>Rule#1</i>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #5:</i> If you lie, lie well. Don't promise things that you probably don't believe in (such as a 15% tax cut with a balanced budget) or that are inconsistent with your record (ditto). Sound plausible even when you are exaggerating wildly: Mr Clinton's achievements on crime prevention and compassionate leave grow even as he recites them. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #6</i>: Demonise your rival, while remaining saintly yourself. So, leave the trashing to surrogates and ads. Better to associate your opponent with discredited figures or ideas (Newt Gingrich, say, or liberalism) than to attack directly. Come across as the person voters would feel safer leaving their children with.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #7</i>: Think image, not just words. The Clinton campaign has been the master of the photo-opportunity--whether on the edge of the Grand Canyon, or surrounded by police officers, or on the caboose of the <i>21st Century Express</i>. From the New Hampshire primary onwards, notes Jennifer Laszlo, a political consultant who has written her own manual of campaign do's and don'ts, the Dole campaign has contrived to make their candidate "look like a boring man in a suit".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #8</i>: Make yourself desirable. Look good and energetic. Practise a beatific smile. Dress well and comfortably to suit any occasion. Surround yourself with beautiful people. Have pop stars sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" at your rallies. Do this constantly, so that it seems natural. Otherwise, taking Bo Derek on a bus tour (as Mr Dole did in California this week) looks calculating rather than cool. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i> Rule #9</i>: Don't blink too much. Research shows that the less frequent blinker wins debates. In the San Diego debate, Mr Dole's blink rate was 105 per minute, Mr Clinton's 48.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Rule #10</i>: Know why you're running, and why it's good for the country. You need a convincing answer to the question: Why will voters be better off if they elect you? The answer is your message, which you must repeat <i>ad nauseam </i>(see <i>Rule #3</i>). It is not enough to be running because you think it is "your turn".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Following the Rules requires a fantastic amount of self-control--discipline would be <i>Rule #11</i>, but the full set of Rules will have to wait for our forthcoming bestseller. From the selection of ten provided here, it should be obvious that one side in the 1996 presidential race has stuck strictly, almost obsessively to the Rules, while the other almost seems to have gone out of its way to break them. You may draw your own conclusions for the likely outcome next Tuesday.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dating Rules promise happiness-ever-after: no divorces, infidelities or other heartbreaks. Alas, the political Rules offer no such guarantees. They are merely good for getting elected. Governing is another matter entirely.<br>

<h1>China's grassroots democracy</h1>

<font size=1>BEIJING</font><p>
<p><b>Is political change taking root in the Chinese countryside?</b></p><br>
THE crushing of the democracy movement in 1989 seemed to freeze China's political development. Seven years on, repression continues. This week Wang Dan, a leading dissident, was sentenced to 11 years in prison, for "plotting to overthrow the government". But, behind this depressing picture, some observers claim to see signs of incipient political liberalisation in China. One minor sign of this is said to be the occasional assertiveness of the National People's Congress, China's parliament (see <a href="as4425.html">page</a>). But the most important development is an experiment with democracy now under way in the Chinese countryside. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The advent of village democracy in China certainly sounds impressive. There are around 900,000 villages in China, housing perhaps three-quarters of the country's 1.3 billion people. Since 1988, over 80% of these villages have elected, through universal suffrage and secret ballots, their own chiefs and village committees, who serve for terms of three years. By next year, 95% of villages will have held elections-- some will be staging their third election in a row. Although many of the village heads who are elected are Communist Party members, the majority are not. For China as a whole, it marks the party's most sweeping abdication of power since the People's Republic was founded in 1949.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is going on and why? The answer seems to be that village democratisation has flowed from the economic reforms set in train by Deng Xiaoping. Until these reforms were launched in 1978, the party ran a command economy in China's countryside and created a horrible mess. Farm production stagnated, and rural incomes fell. By the mid-1970s the average farmer in Sichuan, to take an extreme example, was no better off than during the war-torn ravages of the 1930s.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After 1978, incomes rose steeply when farmers were allowed to manage their own plots and sell produce on the open market. But although the economy was transformed in most of rural China, local political structures struggled to catch up. Chen Jinluo, from the China Council of Law, a government body, <ul><font size=1>Local leaders were all appointed by higher authorities. In theory, they were responsive to the peasants. In practice, they were not. After the 'family responsibility system' was adopted, which gave peasants their own land to farm, a political structure imposed from above became irrelevant.</font></ul>
The irrelevance of the old structures seems to have led to the spontaneous emergence of new village committees in southern China in the early 1980s. In 1987, a law was passed by the central government formally allowing villages to elect their own headmen and committees. The idea was that these new forms of government would be more responsive to local economic needs. The central authorities in Beijing remain quite blunt on this point. Zhan Chengfu, a civil servant who oversees village democratisation from Beijing, says: <ul><font size=1>Villagers have a much better notion of village talent than the higher authorities. If you allow the county government to choose a stupid idiot of a village chief, the whole economy will be ruined.</ul></font>The need for local talent to get the rural economy going has become still more urgent of late. The first flush of market-based reforms in rural China wore off in the late 1980s. Growth in farm incomes has been worryingly slow in recent years. Some official figures suggest that 95m Chinese still live below the poverty line; the World Bank recently put the figure at 350m, almost all of them in the countryside. "It is impossible for the central government to do much," says Mr Zhan, "and provincial and county governments are not going to be of much help either." Villages, in effect, are being asked to fend for themselves, and higher levels of government are being asked to keep out of the process. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So democratisation in the countryside, which began in piecemeal fashion, is now being pushed hard by the central authorities. Provinces which lag behind politically, such as Guangdong, Hainan and Guangxi in the south, are getting a tongue-lashing from Beijing. Local governments are being "educated" to surrender power. The central government insists that it does not vet candidates. And election procedures are said to be be increasingly safer and fairer. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But although new political structures have emerged, they often co-exist with the remnants of the old system. Although rural communes have died, their leaders live on. Every village still has a Communist Party secretary, often set in old ways. In Pingyuan, a dirt-poor village in the mountains outside Beijing that <i>The Economist</i> visited recently, the villagers were at a loss to say what the party secretary did, apart from attend endless conferences elsewhere. The village headman, however, was lauded as a natural leader, who would do something about Pingyuan's water shortage.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The central government, at least, is proud of the little victories scored by villagers over their overlords in nearby towns. In Hunan province this year, a township government thought that one village was too factionalised to deserve an elected chief. The villagers sued the local government in the provincial courts, the township leaders were sacked, and the villagers allowed to hold their election. Village committees from Hebei province regularly come to nearby Beijing to complain that their county government is taxing peasants too much. They are given a sympathetic ear: by law, the state may take no more than 5% of farmers' incomes. Village democracy, say officials in Beijing, will reinforce peasants' rights in future.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Officials are also upbeat about the economic consequences of democracy. The best-known example is an entrepreneur in Liaoning province, a yuan millionaire in a very poor village who ran his own transport company. While away on business three years ago, he was elected village chief. He has since brought several million dollars of business to the village, which now sports factories and processing plants.<br>
</p><p><b>From small seeds</b></b><br>
Many contenders for village chief campaign on the promise of bringing in investment. Du Xiaoshan, from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government's main think-tank, says that "the differences between two villages on the same plain can be striking. Good village heads spot commodities that are in demand." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The big question is whether this experiment with democracy will begin and end in China's villages. In urban areas, the Communist Party still guards power jealously, and promises to do so come what may. (Members of the Peoples' Congresses in small towns are elected--but the bodies they serve on are powerless and elections are closely controlled and often uncontested.) Some Communist Party cadres are prepared to suggest, quietly, that proper elections for real jobs, of the sort held in villages, may now be allowed to spread up to townships of around 10,000 people. Eventually, they suggest, democracy could spread onwards and upwards to counties, provinces and the central government. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet that would need a far greater willingness to risk Communist control than has been seen so far. Once proper elections spread beyond villages, it is hard to see how the crucial distinction between multi-candidate and multi-party elections could be preserved. And while some cadres are prepared to suggest that democracy in the villages may lead to bigger things, it is not at all clear that this is what the architects of village democratisation have in mind. On the contrary, the Communist Party leadership may feel that a limited, closely monitored local democracy may even win back some power for the party. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Their reasoning is that peasants who enjoy greater prosperity and autonomy may be less surly about central authority, and local leaders may be readier to carry out central policy. That is why the political thaw continued in the countryside after the Tiananmen Square killings of 1989 froze reform elsewhere. "Because peasants associate everything with the Communist Party," says Du Xiaoshan, "then if life is freer, the party gets the credit." The party, says one senior cadre, hopes that village democracy "can help safeguard central authority, particularly the one-child policy." In Pingyuan, villagers confirm that the new village chief and committee are even tougher on enforcing family planning than the Communist authorities.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some in the party insist, however, that senior party members are now actively considering allowing the democracy process to bubble up to the level of county government. Could it go further than that? "I can't give you a timetable," says a member on the party's liberal wing. "But one thing is clear: the democratic process in China largely hangs on the results of autonomous democracy in the countryside."<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>China's parliament-in-waiting</h1>

<font size=1>BEIJING</font><p>
WHENEVER a foreign reporter writes of the National People's Congress (<font size=-1>NPC</font>), his fingers instinctively tap out "rubber-stamp" before it. China's parliament was established in 1954. It is, according to the constitution, the highest body in the land, to which all other organs of state power report; the <font size=-1>NPC</font>'s chairman is even supposed to rank alongside the president as dual head of state. But this is all a polite fiction. Power in China is held by the Communist Party, which is not even mentioned in the constitution; the <font size=-1>NPC</font> has a well-deserved reputation as the party's plaything.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The plaything, however, has been a bit more unruly of late. The first real sign of this came in 1992, when the <font size=-1>NPC</font>--which has 3,000 delegates, only 60-70% of them party members--registered a strong note of protest against plans to build the Three Gorges dam on the Yangzi river. Not all the objectors shared western concerns that the dam would carry huge environmental and human costs. Many were instead peeved that it would suck investment away from their own regions. Whatever, 841 delegates abstained or voted against the plan. This year, the <font size=-1>NPC</font>'s chairman, Qiao Shi, led a working group to the Three Gorges to assess the main criticisms. His spokesman acknowledges that forced resettlements have been badly handled. Such meddling was unheard of five years ago.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The congress has issued other mild rebukes to the central leadership. Last year some 550 delegates withheld approval of the routine work reports submitted by China's judiciary. They objected less to the content of the reports, more to the way they were being rammed through the congress, with little time to consider them. One-third of the delegates also objected to a new banking law, after arguing for greater supervisory powers for the <font size=-1>NPC</font>, including (God help citizens of any parliament that gets this) the right to oversee monetary policy. Most famously, last year, 37% of delegates voted against the appointment of a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Jiang Zemin, China's president, to an important government post.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is worth noting that none of these minor protests actually led to a serious reversal of party policy. And it will be many years, if ever, before the <font size=-1>NPC</font> votes down the annual ritual of the government work report, delivered by the prime minister. This year, Li Peng's report registered only a handful of nays or abstentions. But, arguably, headline votes at the <font size=-1>NPC</font>'s annual gathering are not as important as reforms to the way the congress conducts its day-to-day business. In particular, the 150-strong Standing Committee of the <font size=-1>NPC</font> was given law-drafting powers in 1979. It now works hard at turning into clean laws the nightmarish web of rules, regulations and party <i>diktats</i> by which China is governed. The Standing Committee's permanent staff, insists one western diplomat, are now "really committed".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some observers see in the <font size=-1>NPC</font> a vehicle for China's future liberalisation. Few would claim, however, that the <font size=-1>NPC</font> is such a vehicle now. Last week, when the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Freedom of Thought prize to Wei Jingsheng, China's best-known dissident, China's foreign ministry lodged an angry protest with the European Commission at this impertinence. "Parliaments in Europe", said the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s ambassador in a pointed reply, "do not take instructions from executives." <br>

<h1>Delinquent behaviour</h1>

<p><b>There are plenty of reasons behind the moral panic currently engulfing Britain. Real evidence of a decline in children's behaviour is not one of them</b></p> <br>
A HEADMASTER is stabbed to death; a school is shut because its staff say an unruly ten-year-old is making it impossible to teach the rest; staff at another insist that 60 pupils are unteachable. It is as though the devil's own spawn have overrun Britain's classrooms, and are ripping apart the very fabric of society. Except that, while there is plenty of rhetoric about rising numbers of violent and disruptive pupils, there is not much evidence to back it up.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Teachers tend to say that they think there are more troublesome pupils than there used to be, but the older generation always thinks that of the younger. The number of pupils excluded from schools has quadrupled in the past five years, but this is probably because schools are under much more pressure to perform (from national tests, league tables and external inspections), and so are less likely to tolerate disruption.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The evidence suggests, if anything, that the young are behaving better than their forebears did. The proportion of all 10-17-year-olds cautioned for or convicted of criminal offences actually fell by almost 20% in the ten years to 1994.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But of course, once a moral panic gets started, evidence gets flattened by an avalanche of anecdotes. This happened five years ago, when there was a moral panic not about devil children but about devil dogs. In May 1991, newspapers published horrible pictures of a six-year-old Bradford girl who had been mauled by a pit bull terrier. Suddenly, the newspapers were full of other cases of dogs biting children, which happen all the time and normally go unreported. The resulting kerfuffle led to the passing of the Dangerous Dogs Act, hastily drafted and repented at leisure because it proved impossible to implement.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The stabbing of Philip Lawrence, a London headmaster, by a teenage gang member in December 1995, has had a similar effect. This one extreme case has triggered other stories of juvenile delinquency in schools, and a panic about the immorality of modern children.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But none of these stories can obviously be generalised. Take the crisis over a ten-year-old in a school in Worksop. The disturbed boy whom the teachers refuse to teach has seen his father and uncle die, while his mother has cancer. The chairman of the school governors, a Tory, was unwilling to bow to pressure from the teaching unions. The local authority, which has refused to pay for the boy to be taught separately, is based in Nottingham, which regards Worksop as northern and foreign. Memories of the miners' strike have made local politics unusually vicious. All this is interesting, but not informative about the moral condition of British children.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The general themes to be drawn from these stories are political rather than moral. Rivalry between the teaching unions is an important factor. In contrast to other workplaces, almost all teachers belong to a union, so unions can expand only at each other's expense. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Union of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, has been using the issue of unruly pupils to help him achieve his union's ambition of overtaking in size the National Union of Teachers, currently the largest one.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr de Gruchy, a skilled publicist who pops up continually in front of cameras at school gates, has encouraged members to express their grievances by calling strikes, and has cleverly identified discipline as one area on which teachers are likely to win public support. His tactics are paying off. His membership grew by 7% last year to 157,000, closing the gap with the <font size=-1>NUT</font>, whose membership was hardly changed at 192,000.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Government policy to allow parents to choose between schools is also making things worse in unpopular schools. The Ridings, the school in Halifax where teachers want 60 pupils suspended, is the local dumping-ground in an area where parents have plenty of schools to choose from. The creation of such dumps was an inevitable consequence of the policy, which the government has failed to address.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And naturally, too, pre-election posturing is also doing its bit. Politicians have found a convenient scapegoat for modern malaise: children, who, unlike any other slice of society, can be attacked with impunity without the risk of losing votes.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the two main parties have fewer differences than they used to on the substance of policy, mood and image have become ever more important. An issue as vapid and insubstantial as morality is therefore the stuff of current politics. Tony Blair, Labour's leader, has sensed an opportunity to win votes because he regards morality and family values as his strength and the government's weakness. The government, meanwhile, is seeking to show that it is still the true party of law and order. A sort of arms-race of authoritarianism has developed, with both sides reluctant to be the first to say that things have gone far enough.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, hoping to pre-empt new disciplinary measures in the government's education bill, David Blunkett, Labour's education spokesman, told a radio interviewer that parents should be forced to sign contracts with schools covering their children's behaviour, ignoring the fact that unless such contracts are entered into willingly, they are unlikely to be worth the paper they are written on. Moments later, up popped Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, who said she favoured bringing back the cane, though she had no imminent plans to do so. John Major decided the silliness had gone too far, and rebuked Mrs Shephard, saying that the cane would stay banned.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On October 30th, the government hurried out a draft version of a moral code to be taught in schools, intended to persuade voters of its determination to strengthen the moral fibre of the nation's youth. This misses the point. Bigger and better sermons on morality will not make children better behaved. Lessons in good behaviour are learned by example, and the example being set this week by politicians and teachers is not a good one.<br>

<p><b>Betting</b></p>
<h1>Cart before horse</h1>

PLACE a winning wager in your local betting shop, and you will find a 9% deduction is made for tax. Place the same bet in a betting shop on a racecourse, and a deduction of only 6% is made. So what's the problem? The problem is that the exchequer does not charge tax on racecourse bets.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This scam was raised in the Commons on October 29th by Iain Duncan-Smith, Tory <font size=-1>MP</font> for Chingford. A cosy deal between the betting-shop owners and the racecourses is to blame. Punters want betting shop facilities on-course, but providing such facilities for just a few days' racing a year is expensive. So the punter is charged through the deduction, which is on top of the bookmakers' usual profits.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Punters rarely complain. Many think it is a government tax. In any case, they are better off than they were before such shops began to open in 1972. Until then, a punter wanting a bet on a race at another course had to resort to a so-called "away" bookmaker. As there were only a handful of them, they offered skimpy odds. Now, that racecourses have both "away" bookmakers and shops, the bookmakers are forced to be more generous. Any punter who does not want to pay the 6% can bet with them, and then retire to watch the race on television in the comfort of the betting shop.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Punters suffer more from another iniquitous scam. This concerns the bookmakers' arrangements for the allocation of the pitches from which they operate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best pitches are near the stands where punters congregate. The worst are far away. Pitches are allocated by the National Association of Bookmakers (<font size=-1>NAB</font>), which operates a "dead man's shoes" rule. When a bookmaker dies, his pitch is first offered to his son or a near relative. If they do not take it, everyone moves up one. Outsiders may wait 25 years before they get a pitch at all.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No competition means a bad deal for consumers. The oldest, rudest bookmakers get the convenient pitches. They refuse smaller bets, and bets "each way" (to win, and to finish first, second or third). Inefficiency rules, with bookies employing a clerk to record bets in a big book and handing customers a cardboard receipt, instead of using computer technology.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bookmaker conservatism upholds this absurd system. The <font size=-1>NAB</font> is meant to be negotiating with the Racecourse Association (<font size=-1>RCA</font>) for reform. However, Peter Watson, the chairman of <font size=-1>NAB</font>, has just been turfed out by his members for contemplating change.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Strangely, conservatism is reinforced by an equally absurd bit of law. Under the 1963 Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act, racecourses cannot charge a bookmaker more than five times the standard entrance fee to take bets at their racecourse.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The House of Commons Home Affairs Committee argued in 1991 that this law should be scrapped. Racecourses could then charge what they wanted for pitches. They could ask more for the best, forcing inefficient bookmakers out of business. They could use the proceeds to improve the facilities offered to racegoers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, Tim Kirkhope, the Home Office minister responsible, says he will consider changing the law only when the <font size=-1>RCA-NAB</font> negotiations are complete. Since they could come to a sensible conclusion only if and when the law has been changed to free up charges, Mr Kirkhope is putting the cart before the horse.<br>

<p><b>Roads</b></p>
<h1>Murdering the cathedral</h1>

FOR more than a decade, ministers have agonised over a by-pass for Salisbury which threatens one of the finest views in Britain, the view of the cathedral across the water meadows made famous by Constable. On October 29th they decided to dither some more. "Further detailed studies", the government decided, are required; which will, astonishingly, defer the decision until after the next election is due.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Salisbury by-pass saga is an example of the paralysis that now passes for transport policy. It was first mooted half a century ago. By 1984, the government included it in the roads programme. In April 1993, a year-long public inquiry began into the proposal for a dual carriageway by-pass. The inquiry's inspector, Sir Peter Buchanan, took another 18 months before he reported in its favour. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Similarly, last month the government decided to shelve a scheme to relieve traffic around Stonehenge. Britain's greatest prehistoric monument has a day-long traffic jam for a neighbour. Faced by opposition to expanding the road into a dual carriageway, ministers decided that the least unpopular option was to do nothing. The government acknowledges that a long tunnel by-passing the site is the only publicly acceptable solution but says that, at &#163;300m, it would be too expensive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The stories of Salisbury and Stonehenge show that roads can no longer be built on the cheap. Too many people are willing to fight against the concreting of more of the countryside. But then the pressures on public expenditure, which have pushed roads way down the list of priorities, mean that the Treasury will no longer pay for expensive roads.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is, however, an alternative. If the taxpayer will not foot the bill for roads, the motorist can be made to. People are used to tolls on tunnels under estuaries: the Dartford Tunnel that forms part of the <font size=-1>M</font>25, for instance, and employs an automatic collection system, has proved so successful that it is expected to repay its &#163;215m construction costs well ahead of schedule.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is no reason why a long tunnel by-passing Stonehenge should not be financed in a similar way. Objectors worry that locals would suffer; but they could carry concessional residents' permits, as with parking. Another concern is that, in order to avoid the charge, drivers would instead use little roads through neighbouring villages; but traffic-management techniques (putting in lots of lights, for instance, or snail's-pace speed limits) can help solve that problem. The obstacle is not technology, but lack of political will. Privately, politicians say that tolling is the only solution. Sooner or later, they are going to have to admit it publicly.<br>

<h1>The new age of holistic policing</h1>

<font size=1>MILTON KEYNES</font><p>
LAURA, a 13-year-old who has stolen some pens from the John Lewis department store, sits facing a police officer in Milton Keynes police station. Her face is a painful blush, her eyes red and downcast. Her parents, on either side of her, are angry: her father in a needs-a-good-hiding spirit, her mother confused. The police officer is nice. All adults have stolen something in their lives, he says, and don't believe those who tell you otherwise. However, some kids who shoplift go on to do worse things, and he intends to see that Laura does not.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Laura will get a talking to from a manager at the shopping centre she stole from. He will explain to her that shoplifting is not a victimless crime; she may be persuaded to apologise. She will get a sensible chat from a police officer about what is called "protective behaviour"--how not to get yourself into the sort of situation where you may shoplift.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other agencies are on hand. Laura could (though the officer does not think it necessary in her case) be given a session with the Prison Service about how that is not a nice place to end up. If there were bad problems at home, the social services could be brought in. If she had no friends, the youth service could help. If there were no responsible adult in her life, "Befrienders", a local service which matches adult volunteers with needy children, might step in.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rather an elaborate reaction, perhaps, to a few pens. But "Caution Plus", a programme aimed at first-time shoplifters which was designed by Caroline Nicholl, chief superintendent of Milton Keynes, two-and-a-half years ago, aims to nip criminal behaviour in the bud. Its effect is impressive. According to a study by the Home Office, the reoffending rate for first-timers in nearby Peterborough, where they will receive a police caution and then be sent home, is 35%; for those who have been through the Milton Keynes programme, it is 3%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Behind what is going on in Milton Keynes is a set of ideas known in the management-speak that has taken over the police as "problem-oriented policing". The ideas, which come from North America, are seeping through British police forces as they grapple with the problems of fast-increasing demands and slowly-increasing resources. Leicestershire, for instance, has had an increase in emergency calls of 136% in the past eight years, and a real increase in resources of 3.5% over the same period.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Problem-oriented policing aims not just to react to calls from the public, but to find out why those demands are being made and to solve problems at their source. Charles Pollard, chief constable of Thames Valley Police, and one of its principal advocates, calls it "holistic" policing, as opposed to the "sticking-plaster" variety.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To some extent, implementing these ideas means teaching policemen to go about their work in a different way. But administrative changes are also making a difference. "Sector policing", for instance, means dividing up beats and putting policemen in charge of small slices. The smaller the area, the idea is, the better a policeman can get to know it. According to David Morgan in Milton Keynes--who, as a beat officer, is likely to be sceptical about management theory--it works. "Before, if you got a 'domestic', you'd get different shifts coming fresh to it. Now, if you see the same thing happening again and again, you can do something about it." And the more you know about a neighbourhood, the more likely you are to be able to identify the culprit in a burglary or a murder.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Working with other agencies, something the police have not been good at, is central to these new ideas. Social services can help with domestic violence, which is behind most murders. Rehousing could be the solution to a long battle between warring neighbours, one of the sources of endless work for the police. Alcoholics--much crime is alcohol-related--can be pushed towards getting treatment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;David Coleman, assistant chief constable of Leicestershire, cites the case of an old man who, one policewoman discovered, had called the police 20 times in four months. She went to see him, and found that he was bored. She contacted the British Legion, who helped him to buy a television. In the following three months he made just one call.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Problem-oriented policing has been taken up enthusiastically by some forces-- Thames Valley, Leicestershire and Surrey in particular--and more patchily by others. Although top policemen seem convinced, this approach to policing runs against the government's determined push for better crime figures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Problem-oriented policing does not pay much attention to immediate trends in crime figures. It sees success in the longer term. Crime figures, as Mr Pollard points out, are too easily manipulated--as they were, he says, when he first joined the force and senior officers would discourage junior officers from recording crimes in order to keep the figures down. Policing by numbers, of the sort required by the Home Office's emphasis on performance targets, may thus be untrustworthy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anyway, by its nature, problem-oriented policing is likely to push the crime figures up. Some British police officers point out the contrast between this approach and that of the world's most-trumpeted policing success story, New York city. New York's police have achieved their results by making life tough for likely suspects (black teenagers, mainly) and have thereby generated hostility in black neighbourhoods as well as relief at the falling crime figures. If, by contrast, a policeman gets to know locals, and they trust him, the crime rate is likely to go up because they will report more crimes to him. The officer may be solving the problems of locals more effectively, and actually reducing the real level of crime, but the reported crime figures will make it look as if the opposite is happening.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Accordingly, it does not make much sense to look at what these new ideas are doing to the reported crime figures. They are new, they have been patchily implemented, they may take some time to bear fruit. But their supporters claim that they can, in the long run, have considerable effect: they point to cities such as Edmonton, in Canada, which has been pursuing this approach for years: emergency calls fell by 36% in four years, and crime by 40% in ten years. Maybe policing had something to do with it; and maybe the same will, eventually, happen in Milton Keynes too.<br>

<font size=1>INVERNESS</font><p>
CUT-PRICE sales of state-owned assets are usually roundly condemned by opposition parties. Yet when Michael Forsyth, the Scottish secretary, introduced a bill in the House of Lords on October 25th for a bargain-basement sale of government-owned land in the Highlands, his opponents raised a pious cheer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Forsyth wants to sell 259,000 acres of the Highlands to the 1,400 crofters who live on them. They are the last remnants and descendants of 4,500 soldiers and sailors demobilised after the first world war who were persuaded to settle in Scotland on land bought by the government with the grand aim of producing "a fit and healthy race", and a nation self-sufficient in food production.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the Highlands, this land came under 19th-century crofting law which was passed to protect poor tenants from being evicted by rich landlords. The law on crofts is so peculiar that Highland wits define them as small pieces of land entirely surrounded by legislation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Forsyth could ask his tenants to stump up &#163;1.5m. But he says he will hand the land over for nothing if need be, and may even give the crofters some money to band together in community trusts. These have been set up by the few crofters who have managed to buy land from private estate-owners; and the government hopes its tenants will do the same. Labour and the Scottish Nationalists, who have long sided with crofters as the victims of oppression, can hardly complain.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the government gets about &#163;150,000 a year in rent, it spends &#163;370,000 in administering and maintaining the crofts. Saving money, however, is not Mr Forsyth's main motive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Politically, the Highlands divide between landlords and tenants. Landlords are rich, aristocratic and Tory-voting; tenants (including crofters) vote anything but Tory. The Tories lost their last seat in northern Scotland--Ross, Cromarty & Skye--in 1983.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the last election threw up a political oddity. Inverness, Nairn & Lochaber became Britain's only four-way marginal seat. Sir Russell Johnston, a Liberal Democrat, held on to his seat with just 26% of the vote, with Labour (25%), the Scottish Nationalists (25%) and the Tories (23%) hard on his heels. Since Sir Russell is retiring at the next election and boundary changes have moved a few thousand Labour voters into a different seat, the Tories think they have as good a chance as anybody else of winning it. <br>

<p><b>New computers</b></p>
<h1>Microsoft steals the Sunshine</h1>

BARELY a day goes by without some computer company claiming that it is releasing a "breakthrough" product related to the Internet. Sun Microsystems' new JavaStation, which was unveiled on October 29th, should have been closer to meeting that description than most. The JavaStation is the first of the Californian firm's vaunted network computers (<font size=-1>NC</font>). Such machines, argues Sun, will oust the personal computer (<font size=-1>PC</font>), just as the <font size=-1>PC</font> toppled the mainframe. Unfortunately--but perhaps predictably--Microsoft and Intel, the two firms that have gained the most from the <font size=-1>PC</font>, are trying to spoil the party.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The JavaStation is not the first <font size=-1>NC</font>. A handful of other firms have already shown off their own versions. However, it is the first product aimed clearly at business users. Similarly, although the network computer is often associated with Oracle, another Californian software company whose boss, Larry Ellison, has been the <font size=-1>NC</font>'s loudest advocate, Sun is the firm that could gain most from the device, partly because <font size=-1>NC</font>s all use Java, Sun's Internet programming language. This is one reason why Sun's shares have recently outperformed even Microsoft's (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sun's sales pitch for the <font size=-1>NC</font> is simple: <font size=-1>PC</font>s cost too much too run. What large companies want, it argues, are "zero-administration" computers that reduce the "total cost of ownership" of information technology. The essence of the <font size=-1>NC</font> is hidden in those buzzwords: by using centralised servers to store a <font size=-1>PC</font>'s programs, rather than a local hard disk, <font size=-1>NC</font>s get rid of running costs (such as systems staff having to update software on every <font size=-1>PC</font> each time a new version comes out). According to most independent experts, <font size=-1>NC</font>s might cost less than half as much as <font size=-1>PC</font>s to maintain (see <a href="wb1.gif">table</a>). That is not quite "zero-administration", but it is still enough to tempt companies to dump <font size=-1>PC</font>s in favour of <font size=-1>NC</font>s.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This explains why on October 28th, the day before the launch of the JavaStation, Microsoft and Intel, supported by most of the biggest <font size=-1>PC</font> makers, announced the Net<font size=-1>PC</font>--an alternative answer to the problem of reducing the cost of running computer systems. Even though the details of the Net<font size=-1>PC</font> are still a little fuzzy, it will basically look like a cheap, ordinary <font size=-1>PC</font>. Its brains will be a less expensive (and slower) version of Intel's Pentium processor. Unlike the <font size=-1>NC</font>, it will have its own hard disk. But it will also have some clever (yet to be written) software that will allow systems staff to control a number of computers from one place.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If nothing else, this shows that Sun and Oracle have won part of the argument. A year ago Nathan Myrvhold, Microsoft's head of technology, wrote <font size=-1>NC</font>s off as "dorky". On October 30th Bill Gates, Microsoft's boss, said that one of the firm's top priorities is now "zero-administration" computing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One problem for Sun is that the JavaStation looks very expensive. Mr Ellison, amongst others, had been talking of <font size=-1>NC</font>s starting at $500. A basic JavaStation costs $1,200 (including the screen and keyboard). That is only $800 less than the price of a normal <font size=-1>PC</font> loaded with goodies, such as a <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> drive and sound system.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new Net<font size=-1>PC</font> is likely to cost around $1,500. It will be able to run Microsoft's Windows operating system--and hence the thousands of other programs that use it. Sun's JavaStation, by contrast, will depend on Java. Clever though the language is, applications programs written in it are still thin on the ground. And in most markets, Microsoft is much better known than Sun.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>NC</font>'s best chance of success is with firms that need computers to do one thing, such as ticketing or invoicing. But, now that the Net<font size=-1>PC</font> has appeared, the <font size=-1>NC</font> may look less attractive to the probably-far-bigger market of firms that want a machine that can perform several different tasks without necessarily being as complicated and as expensive to run as the modern <font size=-1>PC</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the moment, the <font size=-1>NC</font>'s chief advantage against the Net<font size=-1>PC</font> is that it exists. Each new version of the <font size=-1>NC</font> that Sun and its peers produce will encourage customers to try using the machines and software firms to write programs for them. By contrast, the Microsoft/Intel camp has not even produced a model of a Net<font size=-1>PC</font>: talk of it being ready to sell by mid-1997 seems optimistic. That may well be Sun's window of opportunity.<br>

<h1>The competitive depreciation of the yen</h1>

<p><b>This week the yen has continued its slide against the dollar. In this article Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, DC, says this is deliberate Japanese policy. On the next page we give our view</b></p></b></p><br>
JAPAN is up to its bad old tricks. The Ministry of Finance is seeking a further competitive depreciation of the yen of 10-20%, on top of its 40% decline against the dollar (and about 25% overall) over the past 18 months. The result would be a huge surge in Japan's trade surplus in 1997 and especially 1998. This would take jobs away from other countries, including European ones, where unemployment is already very high, and Asian countries that compete intensively with Japan. It would also rekindle protectionist pressures around the world and set the stage for another round of financial instability when the inevitable currency reversals take place.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan's motives are easy to discern. Its economy may be dropping into renewed recession despite five years of virtual stagnation. It has barely begun to restore the stability of its financial sector. But it seems incapable of attacking its problems via the proper policy tools. Short-term interest rates hover near zero, so admittedly cannot be reduced much further by easier monetary policy. But plans are in place to reduce the fiscal deficit, even though doing so will intensify the economy's weakness. Structural reform is the real answer to Japan's problems, but is slow or non-existent.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The finance ministry, which is particularly zealous in seeking fiscal contraction and avoiding serious structural reform, has thus reverted to its traditional remedy: currency depreciation. It justifies the strategy internationally by arguing that a weaker yen will not even reverse the recent decline in Tokyo's trade surplus from the gargantuan levels of 1992-94 because of the outsourcing of Japanese production that was promoted by the subsequent sharp rise of the currency. But why then does the ministry pursue depreciation so avidly, persistently jawboning its currency down and promoting outflows of Japanese capital, and buying huge quantities of dollars in the markets whenever the yen strengthens even a bit?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Virtually all models show that every 1% fall in the value of the yen has traditionally increased Japan's global current-account surplus by about $3 billion. The decline in the Japanese surplus in 1995-96 will probably reach about $60 billion, following naturally from the 20% appreciation of the yen (from 125 to 100 to the dollar) in 1993-94. This occurred despite Japan's negligible economic growth. The results demonstrate once again that Japan's trade responds to currency changes in textbook fashion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rise of the yen beyond 80 to the dollar in early 1995, which was clearly excessive, was too brief to have much effect on trade. But the currency probably settled around &#165;90 long enough to affect pricing and investment decisions by Japanese firms and help cut the surplus to tolerable levels. A new yen decline to &#165;120-130, as the Japanese authorities openly advocate, would thus represent a competitive depreciation of one-third to about one-half. Even allowing for some irreversible effects of Japan's recent foreign investments, the renewed expansion of the surplus would be enormous. It would restore the crisis levels of 1992-93 even if the relevant base were "only" &#165;100, and the currency decline would thus add up to "only" 20-30%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan itself would be the major loser from this scenario. It might gain a little growth in the short run. But pressures for constructive structural reform and thus fundamental improvement of the economy would recede still further. As the trade surplus ballooned, Japan would again ignite the wrath of its major trading partners, in East Asia and Europe as well as the United States. A sharp yen appreciation would inevitably ensue at some fairly early point, cutting growth and deepening the country's economic troubles as in 1993 and again in 1995 (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). The Ministry of Finance would once again have undermined the very economy it is supposed to manage. The Keidanren, Japan's main business federation, has recognised all this and publicly called for holding the yen-dollar rate between &#165;100 and &#165;110.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a mystery why other Group of Seven countries have accepted this renewed Japanese effort to export its domestic problems instead of dealing with them properly. The United States continues to run a record trade deficit, which will probably reach $200 billion for 1996, so should hardly welcome renewed yen undervaluation. Some Europeans complain that their currencies are already overvalued, with serious consequences for their slow growth and high unemployment, a charge that could hardly hold against the dollar in light of America's large deficit but could well apply to Japan. Countries outside the <font size=-1>G7</font> have also been strangely quiet--although, for example, Korea's record deficits are driven importantly by the yen's depreciation against the won.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>G7</font> let the yen weaken similarly in the late 1980s, bringing on the huge surpluses that triggered a global onslaught against Japan's trade policies in the early 1990s and then the sharp yen appreciation that deepened Japan's own economic malaise. We are now in fact experiencing the fifth cycle of yen swings since the early 1970s, all of which have produced serious problems for both Japan and the world economy. It is tragic that both Japan and the other major countries seem unable to learn from this dismal history. The episode is a further reminder of the dramatic decline in the effectiveness of the <font size=-1>G7</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With the yen hovering around 115 to the dollar, action is urgently needed to halt the depreciation and reverse it at least modestly. Lloyd Bentsen, the then Treasury secretary, let it be known in early 1994 that the United States would not tolerate a yen weaker than about 112 to the dollar, stating clearly that "Allowing the yen to slide is not an acceptable way out of recession for Japan." The Japanese now assert that this "Bentsen ceiling" has been lifted and recent market movements suggest they may be correct.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one wants to see the yen strengthen again to 80 to the dollar. It is time, however, for the United States and the rest of the <font size=-1>G7</font> to reassert the Bentsen principle and to let Japan know that competitive depreciation is unacceptable and will be firmly resisted. Much more constructive steps, particularly regarding structural and financial reform, are available and indeed necessary for Japan to restart its economy. The intellectual bankruptcy of the Ministry of Finance must not be permitted to push that country's new government to pursue the bad old ways once again and to plunge the world into a renewed cycle of trade protection and currency instability.<br>

<h1>An alternative viewpoint</h1>

THE gist of Fred Bergsten's argument is that the yen has fallen too far against the dollar, as a result of intervention by the Bank of Japan and jawboning by the Ministry of Finance. The result, he argues, is that Japan's trade surplus and America's deficit will widen and so reignite protectionist tensions. He urges the <font size=-1>G7</font> to act swiftly to halt the yen's decline. Is he right?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is interesting to compare the current situation with that in early 1994, when America's then Treasury secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, was quick to call foul when the dollar rose above &#165;112. This time round, Washington appears to have given its approval. Robert Rubin, the current Treasury secretary, said on October 29th that he had no problem with the dollar's recent rise.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One big difference between now and then is that in 1993 the American economy had ample spare capacity. Now, however, after several years of robust growth, American industry is working flat out. With little slack in the economy, a cheap dollar would be more likely to boost inflation than exports. In these circumstances a stronger dollar helps to keep inflation in check and so reduces the need for higher interest rates.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the strength of the American economy relative to the still-fragile state of Japan's helps to explain the yen's fall. Mr Bergsten may be right, however, in suggesting that there is something "different" about the yen: the dollar has risen by 40% against the yen since April 1995; against the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark it has gained only 12%. Another reason for the weak yen is that Japan's monetary policy is extremely lax relative to America's--just as it needs to be to boost demand. Japan's interest rates are only 0.5% compared with around 5.5% in America. Indeed, it is the current strength of American's economy relative to that of Japan's that is sucking in more imports and causing America's trade deficit to swell this year.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Bergsten, in common with many other American economists, believes that a weaker dollar and a stronger yen would go a long way to reduce America's and Japan's trade imbalances. But dollar depreciation has been ineffective as a cure for America's external deficit over the past decade. The dollar fell from &#165;270 in 1982 to &#165;80 in April 1995; even at its current rate of &#165;114 it is still cheap. Yet America's current-account deficit is expected to be $150 billion this year, not much below its peak in 1987. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason why the cheap dollar has failed to reduce trade imbalances noticeably is that America's deficit and Japan's surplus basically reflect America's low level of savings and Japan's excess of savings over investment. And a change in the exchange rate cannot by itself correct national savings and investment imbalances. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, attempts to manipulate exchange rates with the aim of reducing trade imbalances are likely to be offset by changes in prices. For instance, during the past decade of a strong yen, wholesale prices in Japan have fallen by 20%, while America's have risen by 25%. This has offset much of the yen's appreciation. Moreover, to prop up the yen, the Bank of Japan had to run an overly tight monetary policy which imposed severe deflation on the economy--the exact opposite of what it requires.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Bergsten wants the <font size=-1>G7</font> to act to push the yen higher. In fact, the dollar may soon turn by itself. There is evidence that Japan's economy is starting to pick up at last--industrial production grew faster than expected in September, leaving it 3.4% up on a year ago--so at some stage over the next year its interest rates will rise.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another factor is that central banks rather than private investors have accounted for most of the increased demand for dollars this year. A study by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, an investment bank, shows that the dollar's rise this year has been accompanied by a sharp increase in central banks' dollar reserves. The reserve figures, however, do not finger the Bank of Japan for pushing the dollar skyward of late. Japan's foreign-exchange reserves did increase sharply earlier this year, but in recent months they have barely budged. Instead, the increase in dollar reserves has been spread widely across central banks.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The significance of these figures, however, is that if the dollar's strength is partly based on central-bank purchases, then it may not be sustained. At some point, the dollar may well slip back of its own accord.<br>

<h1 align=center>Europe's heavyweight</h1>


IT IS not just height and girth that mark out Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, in a crowd. Nor even his durability. He will soon make a bit of history by overtaking Konrad Adenauer to become Germany's longest-serving chancellor since Bismarck (see <a href="sf0777.html">page</a>). Yet recent comrades-in-power have included France's Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand, Britain's Margaret Thatcher and Spain's Felipe Gonzalez, all of whom survived many gravity-defying years in office. What secures Mr Kohl a place in history is that he managed peacefully the unification of his country. Germany has gone from economic prominence to European dominance. The indefatigable Mr Kohl may have yet another election victory in him, in two years' time. So how well are the Kohl years preparing Germany, and Europe, for the future?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The mood in Germany is far from jubilant. Spirits are dampened in the east by stubbornly high levels of unemployment, and in the west by stubbornly high "solidarity" taxes designed to underpin the east's fragile economy. Mr Kohl now admits that integrating the two Germanies is proving harder than he had supposed. This week he backed away from his goal of halving German unemployment by 2000. And now western Germans face even more wrenching changes. Budget cuts needed to meet the Maastricht criteria for monetary union are bringing overdue but unpopular swipes at sick pay, and changes to job security, with more far reaching reforms of taxes and pensions to come. Though many Europeans would happily swap their economic troubles for Germany's, the scale of the reforms Germany now needs owes much to the Kohl way of government.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even before unification, the greying of West Germany's population, combined with increasing competition from lower-wage economies, had put issues of labour-market flexibility, privatisation, welfare costs, taxation and pension reform on the political agenda. More economically attuned chancellors, such as Ludwig Erhard and Helmut Schmidt, might have used the opportunity of German unity to tackle all this and reform Germany from within. Mr Kohl, following his instincts, opted for speedy unity and reassurance.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Speed was understandable. When the chance for unity came, Mr Kohl wanted to seize it fast, before the Russians got cold feet. At home, he oozed confidence that integrating the two economies would be relatively swift and painless. Eastern Germans, offered hard <font size=-1>D</font>-marks for Monopoly-money Ostmarks at one-to-one, supported Mr Kohl in droves at the ballot box. But along with the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark came western Germany's unreformed labour laws and red tape, which all but snuffed out the east's industry and drove up the costs of unity.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The collapse of the Berlin Wall not only changed the face of Germany, it also remade the map of Europe. The old German question--how to deal with a country that was too strong for its neighbours' comfort--seemed to have been answered by partition. How would a new, free and unified Germany now use its weight in the world? Mr Kohl's basic instinct--that Germany belongs inseparably to the western, democratic community of nations--cannot be faulted. Again, however, some of his policies have caused resentment. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the early years after unity, as troubles brewed elsewhere in Europe, Mr Kohl insisted that Germany should stand aloof militarily--democratic Germany's army could not be allowed to go where Hitler's armies once marched in-- while mixing it politically. So Germany chose to push for the recognition of Croatia, despite clear signs that this would intensify the violence in former Yugoslavia. To Mr Kohl's credit, the lesson has since been learned that responsible international citizenship may require the legitimate use of force for democratic ends. Hence the once unthinkable: Germany's close involvement in the military force helping to implement the Dayton peace accords in former Yugoslavia. With Germany's troops now as likely to be in foreign firing lines, Mr Kohl's foreign policy may in future be better thought out.<br>
</p><p><b><b>A determined European</b></b><br>
Is the same true of policy towards European integration? Though Mr Kohl has dropped calls for a federal Europe, he believes that only deeper political union--expressed through a single currency--can anchor Germany firmly enough and strengthen European institutions sufficiently to ensure peace in the years ahead. He wants, he insists, a European Germany, not a German Europe. But some Europeans still worry that what they get may feel uncomfortably Germanic.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though Mr Kohl is determined to press on, a single currency is not yet popular among Europe's voters, who are bearing the brunt of the budget cuts needed to bring it about. Nor would a closer political union--Mr Kohl's real aim--solve the problem of a powerful Germany, which would be just as powerful inside it. Ironically, the first effect of Mr Kohl's vision for closer union will be a split between those that join a single currency and those that do not, or cannot. It will also be harder for East Europeans to join the <font size=-1>EU</font> as full members--a surer way to defend the peace than by a new currency.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How will Mr Kohl be judged when his term of office eventually ends? Undoubtedly, as a great politician who kept his footing during turbulent times. Will he also weigh in as one of Europe's great statesmen? The fate of the euro, as much as anything Mr Kohl has done before, will decide that.<br>

<h2>African exodus</h2>
<p>(See <a href="ww1.gif">map</a>)<br>Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled from homes and camps in <b>eastern Zaire </b>amid warnings that many would die of hunger and disease. The Zairean army and local militias are fighting ethnic Tutsis, but Zaire said it was being attacked by troops from Rwanda and Burundi. Both countries denied sending troops across the border or supplying local Tutsi militias.</p>
<p>A former South African police commissioner, Johan van der Merwe, told the <b>truth commission </b>that the order to blow up the South African Council of Churches offices in 1988 had come from P.W. Botha, then president, via the minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok. The commission said it would subpoena the former president if he did not respond to the allegation.</p>
<p>France's <b>President Jacques Chirac </b>paid an effusive visit to Syria and a cross one to Israel, where he objected to security he considered over zealous. In Ramallah he addressed the Palestinian parliament, the first head of state to do so, urging Palestinians to shun violence as they sought a state of their own.</p>
<p>After mediation by an American envoy, the rival <b>Kurdish</b> factions in northern Iraq agreed in principle, though not yet in fact, to a ceasefire.<p> <b>Qatar's ruling family </b>ended its feud, after the government dropped legal action against the deposed emir. The ruler's third son was named heir apparent.</p><br>
<h2>After Lebed</h2>
<p>Boris Yeltsin, Russia's unwell president, appointed as security chief <b>Ivan Rybkin</b>, a former speaker of parliament, replacing Alexander Lebed. Mr Rybkin will also be in charge of peace negotiations with Chechen rebels. Mr Lebed strengthened his alliance with Alexander Korzhakov, the president's former bodyguard.</p>
<p><b>Alexander Rutskoi</b>, who tried to overthrow President Yeltsin in 1993, was elected governor of Kursk in western Russia.</p>
<p>Russia and Ukraine said they were ready to sign a bilateral treaty, despite a vote by the Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament, to halt a share-out of the former Soviet <b>Black Sea Fleet </b>between the two countries. Ukraine has also been smarting over claims from some Russian politicians for a reassertion of Russian sovereignty over Sebastopol, the fleet's home port in the Crimea.</p>
<p>The conservative Homeland Union, a party led by <b>Lithuania</b>'s ex-president Vytautas Landsbergis, won parliamentary elections, avenging Mr Landsbergis's 1992 defeat by former communists.</p>
<p><b>Bosnia's local elections</b> were again postponed because of worries of fraud, mainly by Bosnian Serbs.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>President Clinton promised to open <b>NATO</b> to East European members in 1999. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are thought likeliest to be in the first wave.</p>
<p>The Vatican at last admitted that <b>evolution </b>is "more than just a hypothesis". But, the pope added, it still does not apply to the soul.</p>
<p>About 300,000 Belgians marched in Brussels to support the families of four girls murdered by members of a <b>paedophile ring</b> and to protest against the authorities' handling of the case.</p>
<p><b>Gro Harlem Brundtland</b>, Norway's prime minister for ten of the past 15 years, resigned to give her Labour Party time to prepare for a general election next year. Her successor is expected to be the party leader, Thorbjoern Jagland.</p>
<p><b>Finland</b>'s opposition Centre Party won the country's first elections to the European Parliament. The vote was interpreted as a rebuff to the government's policy of bringing the Finnish currency swiftly into Europe's planned economic and monetary union.</p>
<p><b>German workers </b>took to the streets after talks between <font size=-1>IG</font> Metall, the engineering union, and employers broke down. The protests, against cuts in sick pay, may presage a long hot autumn.</p>
<h2>Japanese mist</h2>
<p>The <b>Japanese election</b> produced no clear victory. The Liberal Democratic Party led by Ryutaro Hashimoto, the prime minister, won 239 seats, 12 short of an overall majority. But its old coalition partners lost seats and the shape of a new government remained unclear.</p>
<p>The <b>Taliban </b>Islamic militia held on to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, amid reports that its harsh rule was alienating the city's people. Anti Taliban forces gained ground in battles outside the capital.</p>
<p><b>Pakistan</b> devalued its currency by 8% against the dollar and announced a budgetary package, aimed at closing the government's fiscal deficit, in an attempt to win the support of the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<h2>Starr gazing</h2>
<p>Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater special prosecutor, delayed the release of a report on the apparent <b>suicide of Vince Foster</b>, a White House aide. Mr Starr had promised not to make any statements or take any actions that might look politically motivated in the run-up to the presidential election. </p>
<p>In <b>Nicaragua</b>'s presidential election, the main right-wing candidate, Arnoldo Aleman, scored an unexpected first round victory with about 49% of the vote, well over the 45% hurdle. The left-winger, Daniel Ortega, president in Sandinist days but now trying to look like a social democrat, took about 38% and claimed fraud.</p>
<p>Some 30 inmates died in a fire, locked<b> </b>in without escape, in one of <b>Venezuela</b>'s<b> </b>famously awful prisons.</p>

<h2>Dial S for sale</h2>
<p>(See <a href="bw1.gif">table</a>)<br>Demand for shares in Germany's state-owned telecoms giant, <b>Deutsche Telekom</b>, surged ahead of the firm's forthcoming public offering of 20% of its equity. The German government said that the shares would cost DM25 30 ($16-20) each, valuing the firm at up to DM78 billion. In a recently established grey market, Telekom shares were changing hands at up to DM39 each.</p>
<p>Energy firms are also on the auctioneer's block. The Italian government fixed a maximum price for shares in the second stage of its partial privatisation of <b>ENI</b>, a state oil giant. It wants to raise at least 5.2 trillion lire ($3.4 billion) by selling another 8.5% of the firm; last November it sold 15% of its equity. Meanwhile, foreign investors fell over one another in a rush to buy American depositary shares in <b>Gazprom</b>, Russia's gas monolith. The placement of 1% of the company's equity suggests that the firm is worth around $37 billion. </p>
<p>British Telecom is at last faced with a formidable rival. <b>Cable and Wireless</b> is set to become Britain's largest cable <font size=-1>TV</font> and communications group<b> </b>when it merges Mercury, its British telephone unit, with three British cable companies that have North American parents. <font size=-1>C&W</font> will have a 52.6% stake in the new group, which will have assets of roughly &#163;3 billion ($4.8 billion).</p>
<p>Britain's telecoms watchdog banned <b>British Telecom </b>and <b>BSkyB </b>from running a joint promotion. It is worried about the competitive implications of a possible future alliance between the two British giants. <font size=-1>BT</font>, which cannot yet get involved in broadcasting under the terms of its licence, may eventually co-operate with the satellite broadcaster in digital <font size=-1>TV</font>.</p>
<p>Spain's state-owned electricity generator, <b>Endesa</b>, is beautifying itself before privatisation with an agreed bid of Pta200 billion ($1.6 billion) for two electricity distributors in which it already holds large stakes. News of the deal and speculation about other likely takeover bids boosted Spanish share prices.</p>
<h2>Potholes</h2>
<p>A federal judge ruled that <b>Volkswagen</b> and its chairman, Ferdinand Piech, must stand trial in America in an industrial-espionage lawsuit brought by General Motors against the German car maker. But <font size=-1>VW</font> still had something to smile about: its net profit soared 56% in the first nine months of the year, to DM1.5 billion ($977m).</p>
<p><b>General Motors</b> reached an agreement with its Canadian unions, ending a damaging three-week strike involving 18,000 workers in North America.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><b>Eurotunnel</b>, the Anglo French operator of the Channel tunnel, plans to cut 657 jobs from its 3,500-strong workforce in order to make FFr264m ($51m) of savings.</p>
<p>Norfolk Southern, an American railway company, offered to buy <b>Conrail</b> for $9 billion, topping an $8.4 billion offer from its rival, <font size=-1>CSX</font>. The three companies dominate the<b> </b>rail<b>-</b> transport business east of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Shares in <b>Digital </b>plummeted after bigger-than-expected losses of $66m in the first quarter of its fiscal year raised questions about the success of the American computer maker's turnaround. <b>IBM</b>, on the other hand, is bouncing back. It reported a $1.3 billion net profit in the third quarter of the year, mainly because its <font size=-1>PC</font> unit had returned to health after losing $538m in the same period last year.</p>
<p>America's <b>AT&T</b> picked 49 year-old John Walter, head of R.R. Donnelley, a printing firm, to be its president and chief operating officer. In 1998 the job of chairman and chief executive will be split, and the plan is for Mr Walter to succeed Robert Allen as the firm's chairman.</p>
Tax officials in Israel raided the offices of News Datacom Research, a unit of <b>News Corp</b>. The officials suspect it of concealing income of $150m. Rupert Murdoch, the head of News Corp, denied any wrongdoing.
<h2>Shaky foundations</h2>
<p>In Japan's <b>largest corporate collapse </b>since the second world war, Nichiei Finance, a lender in Yokohama, filed for bankruptcy, with liabilities of &#165;991.4 billion ($8.8 billion). It is the fourth such institution to collapse this year because of financial problems linked to the slump in Japan's property market at the end of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Most of <b>Japan's securities firms </b>reported an improved first half, partly because of buoyant underwriting business. But the biggest company suffered a setback. Nomura reported a net loss of &#165;337.5 billion ($3 billion), after making a &#165;371 billion provision to bail out one of its subsidiaries. In the same period last year it made a &#165;16.4 billion profit.</p>
<p>Yasuo Hamanaka, <b>the world's leading copper trader </b>until Japan's Sumitomo Corporation sacked him earlier this year, was arrested and charged in Tokyo with falsifying company documents.</p>
<p><b>Correction. </b>In the issue of October 12th, we said that China's holdings of American Treasury securities soared to $12 billion in the first half of this year, putting it behind only Britain and Japan as a foreign creditor. The figures quoted were in fact net purchases, which puts China in seventh place, not third.</p>

<h1>Extra extra large</h1>

<p><b>Is the enduring Helmut Kohl a statesman or just a politician?</b></p>
THERE is something reassuring about a powerful German chancellor who, when he wakes up in the middle of the night, is thinking--by his own admission-- about raiding the refrigerator, not re-arranging the world. Helmut Kohl is a leader who at first looked cloddishly ordinary and has grown extraordinary, all the while retaining a quality of solid averageness that invites popular trust.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On October 31st Mr Kohl will overtake Konrad Adenauer to become post-1945 Germany's longest-serving chancellor. The 14 years-and-one-month he will then have notched up exceeds the entire life-span of the Weimar Republic (1919-33), Germany's ill-starred first exercise in democracy. At summits, the German chancellor is shaking the hands of his third American president, fourth Russian leader and eighth Japanese prime minister. Since Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand's death in January, Mr Kohl has found himself grandly alone, despite chirpy pledges of common purpose from Jacques Chirac, at the head of the march for European political union. Another five years as chancellor--not out of the question, since he is a robust-seeming 66 years old--and he will outstrip Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor who held office in the second Reich for 19 years (without the regrettable necessity of seeking re-election). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a democracy, Mr Kohl's popular durability is the more remarkable. That it has been Germany's democracy that has thrown up such longevity may be a partial explanation: the so-called "German model", by encouraging consensus among big social groups (workers, managers, parties and so forth), puts a premium on stability. But that is also true of Japan, say. Conceivably, Germans may be unusual in the way they respond to good leadership. At any rate, it is striking that, in Mr Kohl, Adenauer, and Willy Brandt, Germany has produced more post-war leaders with a claim to exceptional stature than any other western nation. In America, Truman and Ronald Reagan stand out for their personal impact on the world (Kennedy, perhaps); in France, De Gaulle and (perhaps) Mitterrand; in Britain, Margaret Thatcher.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which raises two questions: How has Mr Kohl achieved the respect in which he is held? And, more important, what judgment should be passed about his achievements in office?<br>
</p><p><b><b>Letting Kohl be Kohl</b></b><br>
The immediate explanation for the respect Mr Kohl commands is that he represents continuity and order after unification, an event that has brought Germans enough upheaval to last a lifetime. Yet that explanation is obviously partial. Mr Kohl had first to earn respect--and there was nothing predetermined about that.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After Mr Kohl lost the general election of 1976, Franz Josef Strauss, the bull-like premier of Bavaria, snorted: "Believe me, Helmut Kohl will never become chancellor. At the age of 90 he'll write his memoirs, 'Forty Years as Chancellor Candidate'." This was no doubt sour grapes from a man who himself lost the 1980 election but the comment also reflected a once-common tendency to dismiss Mr Kohl, a former premier of Rhineland-Palatinate, as a hick with little knowledge of the world who had over-reached himself when he secured the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union (<font size=-1>CDU</font>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His first years as chancellor were inauspicious. He fell into the job in 1982 when the Free Democrats deserted their coalition with Helmut Schmidt's Social Democrats and switched to his <font size=-1>CDU</font>. Critics accused him of insensitive bumbling. Notoriously, he took a flummoxed Ronald Reagan on a visit to a German cemetery where some <font size=-1>SS</font> troops were buried. He likened poor Mikhail Gorbachev to Goebbels. Fellow politicians began to talk of him as a one-term chancellor. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ordinary Germans, however, did not share the politicians' verdict. The fact that they have ensconced him in office suggests that he has made contact at some fundamental level: he has secured the average voter's confidence. He could not be ruffled. Soon he needed to go on slimming cures to combat an outsized appetite, a foible which rather appealed to his countrymen. It even helped that he came from (and has kept a home in) Ludwigshafen, an industrial port on the middle Rhine which strikes everyone as just about the most averagely-German place imaginable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;German voters do not much go in for intellectual leaders and Mr Kohl makes no pretence to be one. He operates by instinct and like another non-intellectual, Ronald Reagan, exploits television with gusto. One of the great achievements of his cosy style is to make Germans feel content with themselves and their country--no small matter for a place with such a past. There is something apt about the choice of Mr Kohl's cardigan (size <font size=-1>XXL</font>) as an item on display in the Museum of History in Bonn.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This popular touch is the first of four features that have helped Mr Kohl consolidate his grip on German power and have forced his fellow politicians to reconsider their initial scepticism. The second is the transformation in his public skills on the world stage. No chancellor, it is often repeated, has learnt more in office. The tactlessness of the early years has all but gone. He has learned to speak the right language about Germany's past, which has helped foster warm relations not only with Poland and Russia but also with Israel and other nations which have most reason to fear Germany.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A third feature that has helped him is a lucky chance: a weak and fractious opposition. In the past four elections, the Social Democrats have run a series of almost sacrificially feeble candidates. In the 1994 election, the <font size=-1>SDP</font> candidate formed a troika with two of his party rivals at the last minute--hardly a sign of confidence. One of them has since staged a takeover as party boss. Mr Kohl has good taste in opponents.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The last feature that has given him such political dominance is his uninhibited approach to the exercise of power. Like Lyndon Johnson, Mr Kohl has the faculty that Germans call <i>Fingerspitzengef<dierisis>uhl</i>, a fingertip feel for politics that enables him to know just where to apply pressure and where to give personal encouragement. His range of personal contacts is immense. And, while he is sometimes accused of being disengaged from policy issues, no one doubts his skills in party management. Like Adenauer, who once claimed he was 75% of the cabinet, Mr Kohl likes to command, using his imposing bulk and indefatigable self-confidence to dominate both his circle of advisers and his party.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike Adenauer, he has few damaging critics. Karl Hugo Pruys, once his spokesman, recently his biographer, notes that he has no intimate friends. He is too consumed by politics for that. Politics, it seems, is his only passion (apart from food). Even opposition leaders confess admiration.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may be good for him but not for his party. More than Adenauer, who founded the <font size=-1>CDU</font>, Mr Kohl embodies the party. He has led it for 23 years and has squashed first his rivals, then anyone who disagreed with him, such as Kurt Biedenkopf (now premier of Saxony). So absolute is his control of the <font size=-1>CDU</font>--at its annual conference in Hanover this week, 95.5% of delegates voted for him as party leader--that he is preventing it going through the process of renewal that could throw up the leader it will eventually need to replace him. He has made the <font size=-1>CDU</font> look like an assembly of yes-men.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The unification chancellor</b></b><br>
So much for the 'how' of Helmut Kohl<b>. </b>The bigger questions concern the 'what': What has he done? What should one make of it?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Germany has changed enormously during his rule, not least in becoming one country instead of two. It has begun the difficult process of reforming its bloated welfare state and adapting its high-cost and specifically German system of doing business to the increasingly American ways of international competition. In diplomatic affairs, Germany has come out of its post war shell. It has gone through the agony of allowing its soldiers to operate outside Germany and is now arming its peacekeepers in the Balkans to let them act as toughly, if need be, as other foreign forces. It feels sufficiently unburdened to press for a permanent seat on the United Nations security council. Of course, Germany has not overcome all its daunting post-war inhibitions: the self-questioning, the embarrassment about looking powerful, remains, often masked by the chancellor's personal self confidence. Yet Germany dominates Europe in a manner it did not when Mr Kohl came to power. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kohl has guided Germany calmly through all these changes, especially unification: it is hard to imagine any country handling an upheaval of that magnitude as smoothly as he, and Germany, did. All the same, there is no Kohlism; there are not even many coherent policies attached to his name. So should he be judged merely as a durable tactician on whose watch unification happened to occur? Or is he a statesman, able to look ahead and guide, even create, events to serve his purpose?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To answer the question, begin by considering Mr Kohl's record in the light of the two chancellors with whom many, perhaps most, Germans would compare him, Adenauer and Brandt. Adenauer's great achievement was to anchor his country securely in the West. To this end, he set unification aside. Stalin is said to have offered him East Germany back in exchange for German neutrality; Adenauer refused. His policies guaranteed closeness to America, a fundamental goal, and brought the famous reconciliation with De Gaulle's France which spurred what has become the European Union.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Brandt's great achievement concerned the eventual goal of unification. Getting there, he reasoned, meant going in the seemingly opposite direction of recognising communist East Germany. To this end, he used his stint as chancellor (1969-74) to advance <i>Ostpolitik</i>, a bold and intricate scheme to restore traditional German links with Eastern Europe and Russia that Hitler and communism had shattered. This helped reassure Russia that the intentions of its historic enemy were not aggressive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kohl's great achievement has been to complete Brandt's aim of unification without compromising Adenauer's alliance with the West. At the outset of his chancellorship, Mr Kohl walked into a bitter east-west row over nuclear missiles. Controversially, he backed <font size=-1>NATO</font> plans to install cruise and Pershing missiles in West Germany. At great risk to his popularity (which was in any case shaky), Mr Kohl chose to emphasise Germany's commitment to the West and to the European Union (then Community) by ignoring the pacifist demands and neutralist temptations present in Germany. These amounted to a "Germany-first" belief that the country should go its own way; after all, supporters of this view asked, wouldn't neutrality relieve Germans of the pressures they bore?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That question returned with a vengeance when the prospect of unification drew near. In his newly-published account of that rousing time ("Helmut Kohl: I Wanted German Unity", Propyl<dierisis>an, DM48), the chancellor relates how he supported his insistence on a unified Germany's westernness with a disarming line in folk wisdom to win over Mr Gorbachev. Having sat the Soviet leader on a wall overlooking a moonlit Rhine in the chancellery gardens in Bonn, Mr Kohl softened him up thus: <br>
<ul><font size=1>Look at that river flowing by, it symbolises history. There is nothing static about it. You can dam this river . . . technically it can be done. But then it will overflow its banks and find another way to reach the sea. So it is with German unity.
</font></ul><br>Soon afterwards, Mr Kohl had that unity, without paying the price of some form of disengagement from the West which the Soviet Union, and some Germans, had in mind. There are many doubts about the economic terms on which unification was achieved but none of the historic nature of the achievement itself. Mr Kohl reconciled unification with westernisation--an act of statesmanship.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Inches short of greatness</b></b><br>
Teddy Roosevelt once said that even Lincoln would have been wasted had he lived during the relative calm of the early 20th century. To be a great president, it is not enough to have great skills and a compelling vision; you also need great occasions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helmut Kohl has been able to measure himself by this yardstick. Unification was perhaps his greatest test but not the only one. Two others stand out: the challenges facing Germany's consensus system and Europe's unfinished business of economic and monetary union (<font size=-1>EMU</font>). All three tests suggest that while the chancellor is indeed capable of rising to the big occasion, he does so in a way that makes him fall short of the highest standards of statesmanship.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kohl's manner of dealing with the great issues is to establish a point of no return, march past it, and let "details" fall into place later. Squabbling over smaller matters, he tells himself, only creates enemies and problems. This helps him make the great leap in the first place. But it also means that he cannot--or does not--think through all the ramifications of the change.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Take unification. Here, the "details" are starting to qualify his achievement. Mr Kohl has been criticised for overruling the Bundesbank and deciding to exchange solid <font size=-1>D</font>-marks for East Germany's meagre Ost-marks at a rate of one-to-one. The reason he did this was to meet popular expectations in the East. But it does not require hindsight to see that this would make East German businesses uncompetitive and increase the cost of modernising the ex-communist east--though few people expected the subsidy cost to rise to its current cumulative sum of over DM900 billion ($580 billion). Mr Kohl might also have freed up the east-German labour market and permitted more exemptions from the "social market" restrictions now hampering growth throughout Germany. Had he done so, the liberalisation now taking place painfully might have begun earlier. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This pattern--taking a bold decision then seeing some of the benefits eroded after the event--can be seen at work in the economic reforms launched this year (see <a href="wb8404.html">page</a>). Having looked brave this autumn when pushing a first batch of welfare cuts through parliament, Mr Kohl is now shrinking from applying them in full. To take a small example: where full pay for sick leave is part of a labour contract, says the chancellor, it must stay--at least until the contract is renegotiated. This is vintage Kohl. Employers and unions are in a fog, but both sides have something to thank him for. He stands, above all, for consensus between government, managers and workers. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That system has proved successful in the past, as have high productivity and German exporting skills. They may no longer be so now, as competitiveness slides, tempting German firms to manufacture outside Germany where wages and other costs are lower, pushing up unemployment. Some people believe the end of "the German model" is nigh, barring an improbably strong economic surge--and even that would merely delay deep reform.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is Mr Kohl the man to push that reform through? The evidence so far is against it: he enjoys power not conflict; he seems deeply committed to the consensus system; his now-abandoned promise to halve unemployment by 2000 had the ring of fantasy. It may be unfair to accuse Mr Kohl of adding to the problem through his concern to avoid conflict and keep winning votes. But it is fair to say that the chancellor, a historian not an economist by training, looks ill at-ease in dealing with economic change. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the "unification chancellor" Mr Kohl's reputation is secure. As an economic reformer, he is likely to go down (unless his zeal is renewed) as a man who took half his chances. But he himself wants to be judged by a European yardstick: as the man who pushed through <font size=-1>EMU</font>--a point of no return--and hence made inevitable some form of closer European Union able to prevent nationalist aggression from returning to the continent.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Chancellor for Europe?</b></b><br>
With <font size=-1>EMU</font> still in the balance, it is obviously too early to make a judgment of Mr Kohl by this yardstick. But suppose <font size=-1>EMU</font> occurs. It would indeed be a triumph for the chancellor, upon whose unwavering support the whole plan has depended during the past uncertain year. But would Mr Kohl's broader, federating aim then be guaranteed? Not necessarily. For one thing, there is a short-run tension (which Mr Kohl has always denied) between the aims of <font size=-1>EMU</font> and <font size=-1>EU</font> expansion: the new members, when they join, will be members of a second class of Europeans who do not use the single currency. This is divisive, rather than inclusive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For another thing, many Europeans, though few Germans, are less worried than Mr Kohl about the great threat of nationalism. That means Germany approaches Europe in a different way from most of its partners, France included. Mr Kohl's federating mission is, in a nutshell, to save Germany from itself. Other members of the European Union may dislike nationalism, but none (except perhaps for Italy) think it necessary to save themselves--or anything else--from the consequences of their own actions. Mr Kohl's project for <font size=-1>EMU</font>-driven integration is shaping up to be, like unification and welfare reform, a great leap forward--followed by years dealing with unforeseen consequences.<br>

<h1>The House in the balance</h1>

<font size=1>FEARRINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA</font><p>
BACK in 1994 Jan Allen threw a party, and the mood of that gathering held the key to the Democrats' defeat in the congressional elections of that year. It was just before polling day, and Ms Allen, a retired <font size=-1>IBM</font> executive and Democratic activist, was dismayed to find her fellow Democrats unmoved by the election. Nearly all of them-- professionals and university professors--assumed a Democratic victory in the local congressional district. Their candidate, David Price, was a clever politics professor with the advantage of incumbency; the Republican challenger, Fred Heineman, was a blunt policeman from New York. And yet, two days later, the unthinkable happened. Mr Heineman was elected, not because the Republican vote had grown much, but because complacent Democrats had not bothered to turn out. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This time the Democrats are determined not to be complacent. On October 21st Ms Allen attended another social gathering, in a genteel housing development called Fearrington Village. The village's barn was decked out with pot plants, and 100 or so well-to-do Democrats stood around eating from plates labelled "Pig Out!". Mr Price, who is trying to win back his seat, greeted everybody assiduously, impressing upon them the need to rally voters. Ms Allen has certainly got the message. She has installed eight new phone lines at her local party office, and rounded up volunteers to call people. Another team of activists stands ready to drive Democrats to voting stations on polling day.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not just the local activists who have cast off their old complacency. In 1994 the party headquarters in Washington gave Mr Price little advice or money, figuring that, as a four-term incumbent, he could fend for himself. This time, however, party <font size=-1>HQ</font> has been more generous; and the trade unions have spent some $1.3m on local television advertisements to help Mr Price's cause. Two years ago it was hard to attack Mr Heineman; he was a political novice, with no record to pick at. Now that he has spent two years in Congress voting with Newt Gingrich, the Democrats pummel him for voting against the environment, against education, against just about everything that makes life worthwhile.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With more enthusiasm, more money, and a more clearly defined opponent, Mr Price seems virtually sure of taking back his district. The question is whether these same forces, operating in dozens of races around America, will be enough to break the Republicans' control of the House. If it is, a host of Gingrichite committee chairmen will be displaced by Democrats. Whereas a Republican House would keep a second term Clinton in the political centre, a Democratic House would pull him to the left. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To win the House, Democrats need a net gain of 19 seats. This sounds feasible: 12 of the 25 elections since the second world war have produced a swing this size or bigger. Many of the 73 Republicans elected for the first time two years ago share Mr Heineman's vulnerability. They won as fresh outsiders; now that they are incumbents, this appeal is gone.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two years ago in Chicago, for example, voters elected Michael Flanagan, an unremarkable 30-year-old who campaigned on such profundities as "I want to see good things happen." This time round, however, Mr Flanagan can no longer pose as an outsider. He has accepted cash from fat-cat backers, including the tobacco lobby. Deprived of his main political asset, he appears merely boring. He lags in the polls.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where they are not dull, Republicans have been made to seem extreme. In part, this is the result of propaganda: the Democrats assail their opponents for "cutting Medicare", even though Republicans suggested only slowing its rate of growth. In other respects, however, the extremist label is warranted. Many Republicans benefited two years ago from the money and votes of groups such as the National Rifle Association; once in office, they have felt obliged to vote for the repeal of the assault-weapons ban. A few candidates go even further. In Texas, for example, Ron Paul denounces tax as theft, and regards government benefits as immoral. His political newsletter is commended by a Canadian neo-Nazi group.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In some cases, Republicans seem in danger of being labelled "extremist" without enjoying the compensating support that extreme politics can bring. The gun lobby and the Christian right are less fired up than they were two years ago, so seem likely to yield fewer votes. They are turned off by Bob Dole's candidacy, not least because he has waffled on their issues. The congressional races do not grab them either. They may adore Newt Gingrich, the radical House speaker; but they are depressed by how far his star has fallen. Other House Republicans have disappointed them in various ways. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This mix of trend and anecdote, raising the possibility of a Democratic House of Representatives, gets some support from pollsters. This week a <i>New York Times</i>/<font size=-1>CBS</font> News poll found that 47% of respondents want the Democrats in charge of Congress, compared with 39% who favour continued Republican control: a month ago, the Democrats' lead was smaller. Several seers reckon that, if Mr Clinton wins by more than a ten-point margin, his coat-tails will carry enough Democrats to victory to tip the House their way. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that the polls are actually ambiguous, and trends and anecdotes can be advanced by both sides. The coat-tail effect is unreliable. In 1988 the Democrats gained three seats despite George Bush's victory in the presidential race; in 1992 Republicans picked up ten seats, despite Mr Clinton's win that year. Moreover, some who say they want a Democratic House change their minds when asked how Mr Clinton's re-election would influence their preference: the <i>New York Times </i>poll found that 48% would prefer a Republican Congress to balance the president, while only 41% wanted a Democratic Congress as well.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Republicans hope that the fear of a Democratic monopoly will give them the advantage in the last days of the House races. They are also hoping that the barrage of trade-union attack ads will backfire for the Democrats. This week, a new Republican advertisement took to the airwaves, showing union bosses plotting to fix the election in a shadowy backroom; "Big labour bosses, big money, big lies, big liberals," the voice-over intones. In places inundated by union dollars, but without strong union membership, such tactics may work. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One such place is North Carolina; and, despite Mr Price's likely victory there, this state demonstrates the limits of Democratic hopes. Until 1994, the state's House delegation consisted of eight Democrats and four Republicans. Since then, it has been the other way around. This year, even Democrats concede that three out of the state's five Republican freshmen will be re elected. Mr Price's seat, and one other, is the most they hope to win back.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other vulnerable seat is held by David Funderburk. The Democrats have pounded him with all their usual tactics, accusing him of wanting to gut Medicare, and linking his name to that of Mr Gingrich at every opportunity. But Mr Funderburk remains undaunted. Being linked to Mr Gingrich will hurt him less, he reckons, than being linked to Mr Clinton will hurt his opponent. Locals agree with what Mr Gingrich says, even if they find him arrogant. But they dislike both Mr Clinton and his views.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That, at least, is the basis for Mr Funderburk's campaigning. He comes from a tobacco district, and a bumper sticker outside one of his rallies proclaims, "More Americans smoke than voted for Bill Clinton." Far from running from the Republican record, Mr Funderburk stands on the back of a farm truck and enjoins his audience to "vote the values of the district". He denounces the Clinton administration for being soft on heroin and cocaine ("the preferred drugs of Hollywood") while plotting restrictions on tobacco farmers. He and his fellow Republicans had tried to limit government, Mr Funderburk continued, but Mr Clinton's veto had obstructed them. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite the president's likely victory, some Republicans still believe that their agenda is more popular. They also believe that deep shifts--the growth of suburbs, the fear of an underclass left behind by the technological revolution--are pushing America their way. If Mr Clinton wins, it will merely reflect his success in moving rightwards. But the House Democrats have been slower to shift towards the centre. Even if they do well this November, their long-term grip on the House may depend on following Mr Clinton--which would amount to a victory for Republicanism, if not for Republicans themselves.<br>

<p><b>The Queen's Speech</b></p>
<h1>Moving ma'am</h1>

JOHN MAJOR is a constitutional conservative. You would think, therefore, that when the prime minister did propose a change, it would be remembered. Not so: on October 23rd, the Queen's Speech, setting out the government's legislative programme, went by without mention of Mr Major's proposal earlier this year that it be shifted from the autumn to May.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The autumn Queen's Speech is an anachronism. The budget used to take place in the spring. In those days it made sense to spread parliamentary business through the year by starting on the non budget legislation in the autumn. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, since 1993, the unified budget, which brings together the government's spending and taxing plans, has taken place in November. The result: an autumn logjam with the budget and new laws competing for time in the Commons. Come spring, there is a hiatus for <font size=-1>MP</font>s while those laws are considered by the House of Lords. Hence Mr Major's sensible proposal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Next year will offer a great opportunity to make the change. Most people now expect the general election to be on May 1st 1997. A new government could announce its legislative plans for a normal one-year session of Parliament in the Queen's Speech just after that election. Otherwise there will be a tiresomely long session of Parliament, running until autumn 1998. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Surprisingly, however, the prime minister's proposal has got nowhere. The usual process of consultation between the parties which precedes such changes has not even been started. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, is said to be concentrating on the general election--a suspicion borne out by the fact that this year's Queen's Speech mostly contained bills designed to emphasise the gap between the main parties rather than any common ground. Ann Taylor, his Labour shadow, has failed to push for change. A good idea could easily be lost.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another reform proposed by Mr Major is, however, taking root. He wants bills to be published in draft before debate to allow expert scrutiny. The queen told the Commons that two bills--on care of the elderly and on national identity cards--will now get that treatment. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour is urging one further reform. It wants to abolish the ludicrous rule by which government bills are deemed lost if they fail to be carried in a single parliamentary session. Instead, unfinished bills could be picked up again in a new session at the stage they had reached when the old session ended--as is already the case with private legislation on behalf of particular companies and interests. Taken together, these proposals, Mr Major's and Labour's, could transform the effectiveness of Parliament in scrutinising legislation, which makes it all the sadder that they are subject to so much foot-dragging.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Dialling Tone</h1>

LABOUR'S telephone campaign to persuade its members to vote on Tony Blair's "New Labour, New Life for Britain" policy document is being ridiculed by the Conservatives. But all the main parties now realise how effective telephone marketing can be, either to get supporters into the polling booths or to solicit donations. Especially after the 1992 general election, in which some say the phone was the secret weapon behind the Tories' surprise win.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Simon Pell, a Labour official who was behind his party's adoption of telephone marketing, later left to form Pell & Bales, a firm which is now being paid &#163;1.10 a call to ring thousands of party members to urge them to vote on the policy document. Although the document was approved by the party's conference, Mr Blair wants a direct vote of support from at least half of the 370,000 members.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour claims that just under 40% have voted so far, not all of whom will have backed Mr Blair's vision of a new Britain. Pell & Bales, with Labour's in house telephone canvassers, aim to reach 40,000 households containing, in all, 100,000 party members by October 31st, the closing date for the vote.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During the 1992 election, Labour and the Liberal Democrats were lulled into false optimism because the Tories did hardly any traditional doorstep canvassing. In fact, local Tory constituency parties had switched tactics, realising that as voters were increasingly reluctant to open their doors to strangers it made more sense to canvass support by phone. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since then, Labour has invested heavily in setting up telephone canvassing operations, both at party headquarters and locally. Michael Cunnington, Labour's head of fund-raising, reckons that donations gathered by phone are worth about &#163;1.7m a year. The Lib Dems are also doing more phone-politicking, but mostly at a local level.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tories seem to have lost the lead they built at the last election. Harvey Thomas, a publicity chief for the Tories from 1985 to 1991, says that after seeing how much money America's Republicans were raising by telephone, he pleaded in vain with his party bosses to set up a similar operation at Conservative Central Office. But local constituency parties refused to let go of their membership lists. Even now, Tory headquarters has no comprehensive list of party members. If it wanted to launch a nationwide telephone campaign like Mr Blair's, it would not know whom to call.<br>

<p><b>The cost of Scotland</b></p>
<h1>Misty</h1>

<font size=1>EDINBURGH</font><p>
SCOTLAND is over-subsidised, think many right-wing Tories. A study published by the Scottish Office on October 21st seems to confirm this. It estimated that in the 1994-95 fiscal year the government spent &#163;30.3 billion in Scotland, whilst the Scots stumped up a mere &#163;22.1 billion in tax, leaving a whopping &#163;8.2 billion gap (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Michael Forsyth, the Scottish secretary, is oddly proud of this for a right-winger, boasting that he spends about 25% more per Scot on things such as education than is spent south of the border. He warns that this Tory generosity will come to an abrupt halt if Labour wins power and a devolved Scottish parliament takes over his budget. Scots would be even worse off were they ever to be governed by the Scottish National Party (<font size=-1>SNP</font>), he threatens.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the <font size=-1>SNP</font> complains that the Scottish Office figures are distorted. The party has a point. Britain as a whole had a huge public sector deficit in 1994-95. Part of the &#163;8.2 billion shortfall between Scotland's public spending and tax revenues--around &#163;4.2 billion of it--is its share of that overall British deficit, not a subsidy from the rest of Britain. Moreover, Scotland should be allocated a share of privatisation revenues-- around &#163;600m, assuming revenues are divided according to population. That would cut Scotland's subsidy from (fiscal deficit with) the rest of Britain to just &#163;3.4 billion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This might still embarrass Labour. Its devolution plans would make this cash transfer from the south crystal clear, leaving the party with some explaining to do. As for the independent Scotland favoured by the <font size=-1>SNP</font>, surely it would be a poorer country than now, as presumably such transfers would stop on independence? No, says the <font size=-1>SNP</font>, arguing that independence would give Scotland control of most tax revenue from Britain's North Sea oil. Maybe. But, as our chart shows, even with 90% of this revenue, Scotland would still be in hock to the rest of Britain to the tune of &#163;2 billion--not including its share of Britain's deficit, which it would have to find a way to pay for if independence arrived. Freedom would not come for free.<br>

<p><b>Same-sex marriages</b></p>
<h1>Jewish family values</h1>

BRITAIN'S politicians are currently gushing with professions of faith in religion and family values. Yet two of Britain's bigger religious groups are struggling to decide what sort of families to value. The Church of England has been in uproar since Anne Atkins, a conservative Anglican, used <font size=-1>BBC</font> radio's "Thought for the Day" slot earlier this month to accuse the church of taking too liberal a line on homosexuality. And similar stirrings are afoot within Britain's Jewish community.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reform Judaism is a branch of the religion that prides itself on its openness, especially in matters sexual. Unlike the various Orthodox strands, it has female rabbis, seats men and women together in synagogues and sees homosexuality as a legitimate form of love. But when one rabbi, Elizabeth Sarah, used a sermon on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish year, to say that she was to officiate at a "commitment ceremony" between two lesbians, all hell broke loose. One rabbi threatened to quit the Reform umbrella organisation; some Orthodox Jews said that Reform had, in the words of one rabbi, shown its "farcical and ugly face". The couple cancelled the ceremony, Rabbi Sarah apologised for the fuss and Reform leaders were muzzled.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reform's peculiar position in Britain makes the mix of sex and religion more than usually combustible. In America, where Reform is the most popular branch of Judaism, Reform rabbis have been blessing same-sex unions for years. But in Britain Reform plays second fiddle to the Orthodox establishment; 13% of the country's 300,000 Jews belong to Reform synagogues while 40% belong to the United Synagogue, the main Orthodox grouping. Partly for that reason, British Reform is more conservative than its American variant. Its rabbis do not marry Jews to non-Jews; they do not acknowledge as Jews children of non-Jewish mothers unless they convert.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This cautious liberalism has served Reform Judaism well. Although synagogue membership is declining overall, Reform is adding members. It dreams of someday supplanting the United Synagogue as British Jewry's dominant religious group.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The uproar over homosexuality has exposed rifts between rabbis who think heterosexual marriage is the only kind Judaism can openly endorse and those who think gay couples deserve some kind of consecration. The controversy has also pitted clergy against laity. In what liberal rabbis regard as unprecedented meddling by a lay body in religious matters, the Council of Reform Synagogues ordered rabbis not to do same-sex ceremonies until the Reform movement decides on the matter.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That will not be easy. Unlike the United Synagogue, Reform has no chief rabbi to lay down the law. A committee of the rabbinical assembly, set up before the controversy broke, had hoped to include same-sex unions in a broader ruling on other sorts of family relationship, including unmarried heterosexual couples. Now it has been bounced into dealing with homosexual unions alone.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reform Jews may yet agree to disagree. Rabbi Rodney Mariner, a member of the committee, says most members oppose letting rabbis officiate at gay unions but may nonetheless free dissenting rabbis to go their own way. Without a solution, Reform rabbis may find themselves presiding over a same-sect schism.<br>

<h1>Launching Deutsche Telekom</h1>

<font size=1>BERLIN</font><p>
<p><b>The sale of Germany's telephone giant will reshape Europe's biggest telecoms market. But will it, as many hope, transform German capitalism too?</b></p><br>
DEUTSCHE TELEKOM attracts superlatives. It is the most ridiculed company in Germany, the biggest phone operator in Europe, and (after Tokyo Power) the world's most indebted commercial entity. It has one of the best high-speed telephone networks in the world, yet it is also renowned for treating many of its subscribers badly. Its partial privatisation, which starts on November 18th, is the largest flotation in Germany's history and the second-biggest anywhere (after that of Japan's <font size=-1>NTT</font>, another telecoms giant).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More than perhaps any other big sale since that of British Telecom in 1984, Deutsche Telekom's privatisation is an attempt to change a country's business culture. At present German capitalism is caught in something of a vicious circle. Germany is unique among big industrial countries in that only about 5% of its population hold shares (in Britain, for instance, the figure is nearer 25%). This is partly a function of history: having lost their savings twice this century in post-war currency reforms, Germans are notably risk-averse. But it also reflects the poor performance of shares in most of Germany's biggest companies, which have offered miserable returns compared with those of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet--and this is where the vicious circle comes in--the poor performance of those companies is also a consequence of the country's lack of an equity culture. Germany's savings are mainly channeled through banks into loans to industry, rather than though mutual funds into shares. As a result, company bosses in Germany are generally under less pressure to produce sparkling results: shareholders, whose own money is at risk if a company does badly, tend to be more demanding.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is changing. The number of foreign investors in German firms is growing quickly and a new breed of German managers such as J<dierisis>urgen Schrempp of Daimler-Benz, a huge conglomerate, have made it clear that shareholder value is now a priority. A recent report by Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, argues that German firms could easily push up their current low return on equity (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>) by between two and three percentage points. A successful sale of 20% of Telekom would give share ownership a big fillip--not least by paving the way for other large sell-offs, such as that of the government's remaining 36% stake in Lufthansa. Rolf Breuer, a director of Deutsche Bank, describes Telekom's privatisation as "the last big chance" to establish an equity culture in Germany.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With so many things depending on a successful sale, Telekom's board this week announced an indicative price range for the 500m new shares the firm is selling of just DM25-30 ($16-20)--some way below the DM35-40 level forecast a year ago. This price should ensure that the launch is a success. But the shares' likely long-term performance is harder to predict.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The need to be wired</b></b><br>
Telekom's new boss, Ron Sommer (who joined the company from Sony last year), has done his best to reform a company that still thinks and behaves far too much like a civil service department. Customers are now treated better. Repairs now sometimes happen on public holidays and there are many more phone boxes, usually in working order. The company has also launched new services, such as T Online, Germany's most popular Internet service provider. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Telekom's new shareholders will inherit an impressive range of assets. It has Germany's second-biggest mobile telephone network and its biggest cable-television network. Thanks in part to the high prices that it charges in its core business, Telekom is also an impressive generator of cash: it earned DM34 billion last year before interest, tax and depreciation. And Mr Sommer has pushed it into Global One, an impressive-looking international alliance, with France T&eacute;l&eacute;com and Sprint, an American long distance carrier.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Telekom also has impressive weaknesses. It has a burdensome debt of DM100 billion, partly because modernising former East Germany's telephone system--a political not a business decision--cost it a cool DM50 billion. Moreover, despite Mr Sommer's best efforts, the company is still overstaffed by world standards, with 184 lines per employee, compared to an average of 275 at America's regional Bell telephone companies (though to be fair, the German firm does more things). Getting rid of unwanted posts-- 30,000 of its 200,000 staff are supposed to leave the firm by 2000-- could cost as much as DM100,000 per employee.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Telekom's domestic fixed-link businesses supplied DM51 billion of its DM66 billion in revenues last year (see <a href="wb2.gif">table</a>). That will not last. On January 1st 1998, telecoms in the <font size=-1>EU</font> must be fully liberalised. Telekom will then have to deal with something new and potentially life-threatening: competition in its bread and-butter business of providing telephone services to households and firms. A local call in Germany is still almost as costly as a coast-to-coast call in America. For long-distance and international services in Germany (as in most other monopoly markets), prices are still extortionate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Already four consortia are marching, in differing degrees of readiness, towards the starting line. One of the most threatening combines <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, America's long-distance champion, with Mannesmann, a German engineering group that has taken only a few years to knock Telekom from the top spot in mobile phones, the only market where it has been exposed to real competition.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The route to profit</b></b><br>
Under Mr Sommer, Telekom should defend its fixed-link business more fiercely. It has already offered price cuts of 40% to business users (provoking protests from its competitors and regulators). It also faces competition from "re-sellers"--companies which buy cheap international capacity and then sell it through call-back services and the like. At least two, Telepassport and <font size=-1>USA</font> Global Link, are planning to launch services for internal German long-distance calls early next year (the latter will invest $100m to install new switches in Germany). Even routed via a neighbouring country, their service will be cheaper than Telekom's peak-time rates. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thanks to the resellers, to new entrants and to the existing networks owned by various other utilities in Germany, there will soon be a surplus of long-distance capacity. But in the local market, any new competitor will still have to use Telekom's lines to connect with customers. In theory, Telekom will be required to let competitors pick and choose which parts of its network they want to lease (the lines, but not the switches which connect them, for example) at a price set by the regulators.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the rules are vague. For instance, it is not clear what constitutes a reasonable ground for Telekom to refuse an interconnection. Worse, the regulator, who is supposed to impose an interconnection agreement if the parties cannot agree on one, has not yet been appointed. (In the meantime, the rules will be enforced by the Federal Ministry for Posts and Telecommunications, which has little experience of regulating a competitive marketplace.) In keeping with their desire to protect Telekom, Germany's politicians seem reluctant to change. "We have people behaving like dinosaurs", complains Stephan Schwarz of <font size=-1>VTM</font>, a lobby group for Telekom's competitors.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the market is unlikely to stay rigged in Telekom's favour for long. One source of salvation for its rivals is likely to be the European Commission, which has already held up Telekom's planned price cuts to its corporate customers. Expect an even tougher response from regulators elsewhere, particularly America. The Federal Communications Commission is already preventing Global One from launching full operations in the United States until Germany treats outsiders fairly. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In other words, even the friendliest treatment by the German government will only delay, rather than cancel, the day of reckoning for Telekom. Indeed, the point must soon come where the political imperative of having cheap communications (which can be achieved only by opening up the telecoms market and encouraging competitors) will matter more in Bonn than protecting the old monopoly. Where will that leave Telekom's new shareholders--not to mention German capitalism?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><b> <b>Got the DTs</b><br></b>A lot of attention (and cash) has been paid to ensure that the current launch is a success. In a DM85m advertising blitz, comedians and other celebrity investment advisers have been singing (literally in some cases) the shares' merits. A disproportionate chunk of the issue will be reserved for German private investors. As Deutsche Telekom will account for nearly 5% of the main Frankfurt share index, almost any fund manager who invests in Germany is going to be needing some shares. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far, so good. Barring regulatory fireworks from Washington or Brussels, or a stockmarket down-turn, most of the 3m Germans who have registered for the shares should buy at least some. "The banks and the government can't let this fail" is a commonly-voiced sentiment. That powerful interests stand behind Deutsche Telekom's success is certainly true. But this does not make it the risk-free investment portrayed in the advertisements.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Its new shareholders will not automatically make Telekom more efficient. The DM15 billion raised by the share sale will help reduce its debt-mountain, but Telekom will still be vulnerable (one investment bank, <font size=-1>BZW</font>, says that the sale is more reminiscent of a leveraged buy-out than a privatisation). Much will depend on Mr Sommer's ability to cut costs. The success of <font size=-1>BT</font> shows the potential, however.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When shares in Volkswagen, a German car maker, were first floated in 1960, they too were attractively priced and packaged in the hope of creating a nation of shareholders. But soon afterwards their price fell, dipping below their flotation price. Small investors panicked and dumped the stock (had they hung on to it for a long time, they would eventually have done well). The Volkswagen experience helped turn an entire generation of German investors against equities.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The chances are that the Telekom sale will be more of a success and help to open up German capitalism. Even so, an unwieldy monopolist, whose future partly depends on the government restraining its competitors, makes an awkward advertisement for a better way of life.<br>

<p><b>Multimedia in Britain</b></p>
<h1>The front line</h1>

MIGHT British Telecom at last face a se rious competitor in its home market? For several years, a number of other firms have been buzzing around <font size=-1>BT</font>. Now they have decided to gang up on it. On October 22nd, Cable and Wireless announced a complicated &#163;5 billion ($8 billion) merger between Mercury Communications, <font size=-1>C&W</font>'s own subsidiary and the company first groomed to challenge <font size=-1>BT</font>, and three cable <font size=-1>TV</font> firms. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The deal is the brainchild of <font size=-1>C&W</font>'s new boss, Dick Brown, who lists its advantages with glee. By connecting Mercury with the three cable firms--Nynex CableComms, Bell Cablemedia and Videotron--<font size=-1>C&W</font> will have the right to lay wires to the door of 6m Britons. Britain's cable companies already offer a telephone service to go with their television; now the three merged companies will be able to carry their calls throughout the country on Mercury's long-distance lines, and deliver them to homes in its regions without paying steep access fees to <font size=-1>BT</font>. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then there are the usual cost savings of merging operations. Together the companies, which will be called something like <font size=-1>C&W</font> Communications, will have a bit more clout in negotiating a price for television programming. And if <font size=-1>C&W</font> can work out a way to bring in Mercury One<font size=-1>2</font>One, a mobile telephone network it half-owns, it could then offer a tempting all-in-one package of services to its customers: television; local, long-distance and mobile telephony; and whatever whizzy interactive services it can pump down its lines, such as high speed Internet access.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the new merger is a product of weakness, not strength. After more than a decade of laying lines, the cable companies have failed to repeat their success in America (see <a href="wb3.gif">chart</a>). They now reach more than a third of British homes. But only a fifth of these actually subscribe to the service; worse, this figure has barely moved over the past six years, even declining a bit of late. By contrast in America, more than 60% of the homes that are hooked up subscribe. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britons, it seems, do not like television as much as couch-bound Americans--or, rather, they do not like the American-style fare that the cable stations offer. They also enjoy better quality broadcast reception than many Americans, which makes cable less necessary. Many of those who do want more <font size=-1>TV</font> are happy to get it from cheap satellite providers, such as <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>. And the marketing tactics of most British cable firms have been lacklustre (a discrete postcard under the door once a year is still considered a hard sell). The one bright spot has been cable's relative success in selling telephone services, which have drawn more customers than television itself. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A telecoms man for most of his career, Mr Brown came to <font size=-1>C&W</font> in July from Ameritech, one of America's seven main regional telephone companies (with a short stint at another firm in between). Ask him about negotiating clout for television programming and he will dismiss it as a detail, but mention local-calling margins and he waxes lyrical about their importance. Alas, he says he cannot reveal just how staggering the merger's savings will be, because a public offering of stock may be in the works. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if the savings are impressive for calls travelling entirely over the lines of the merged firms, few calls will take this route. Combined, the three cable companies have only 500,000 customers, out of more than 27m telephone homes in the country. Most calls will continue to go from a cable customer to a local non-customer; the merger is of little help there. Even the long-distance ones that travel over Mercury's line may save just 15%. Mr Brown admits that the current merger is just a start; expect more cable firms to join later, he hints. That will increase the buzzing; whether <font size=-1>BT</font> will end up being stung is another matter.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Land of the free, home of the Braves</h1>

INVESTMENT bankers may not be able to hit a curve ball, but the average professional baseball player would feel at home on a trading floor: the foul language, the cut-throat competition, the outrageous salaries. Since 1977, when America's ball players gained the freedom to change teams without owners' permission, their salaries have soared: the average major-league player now makes more than $1m a year. Besides enriching the athletes at the owners' expense, however, "free agency" was also supposed to make professional players more mobile and thus make competition among clubs more even. Has it?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The return of the Atlanta Braves to this year's World Series--their fourth appearance in five seasons--suggests that the best teams can still find a way to stay on top. (As <i>The Economist</i> went to press, the series was in progress.) Yet many people contend that the game has become more competitive in recent years: new teams are making the post-season play-offs, divisional races are more exciting, and so forth. So to try to determine whether this is so, Craig Depken, an economist at the University of Texas in Arlington, has tried to marry baseball with economics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economists often gauge the competitiveness of an industry by measuring the extent to which its output is concentrated among a few companies. The most common such measure is a "Herfindahl Hirschman" (<font size=-1>HH</font>) index: to calculate it, take the market shares of all the firms, square them, and add them up. If there are 100 equal-sized firms, the index is 0.01; if there are four equal-sized firms, it will be 0.25. So the higher the number, the more market power is concentrated. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In applying this to baseball, one difficulty is defining what ball players produce. Mr Depken uses two rough measures: strike-outs and home runs. After calculating <font size=-1>HH</font> indices for 1920-93, he found that both home runs and strike outs have indeed been growing less concentrated over time: that is, there is less disparity between the number of home runs hit by good teams and those hit by bad ones.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If free agency has indeed spread the best players more evenly around the league, this trend should have become more marked after 1977. However, this does not appear to be the case. Instead, the fall in concentration can be explained by other factors, such as adding more teams to the league, breaking teams into more divisions and so on.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This makes sense. Most owners of small-city teams complain that their big city rivals have more money than they do, and can therefore afford to buy the best players. Free agency appears simply to have bid up the players' salaries at their employers' expense, without changing the balance of power in the league. A lesson for investment banks?<br>

<html><head><title> Why the Net should grow up</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width="78" height="39" alt="The Economist" border=0></p><h1 align=center> Why the Net should grow up</h1>THE growth of the Internet has been the most astonishing technological phenomenon of the last decade of this century. In 1990 only a few academics had heard of it; now, anything up to 50m people use it. In a year's time, that figure could be 100m--so far, the network's only constant has been that the number of people tapping into it has doubled every 12 months. But up to now, only a handful of companies have made much money from the Internet. If it is to become a commercial success, rather than merely a <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i>, it has to change. Otherwise many of the qualities that brought it popularity will become liabilities.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Increasingly, the Internet is coming under attack, and from many quarters. The telephone companies, whose networks carry much of its traffic, grumble noisily that Internet users clog their wires and bypass their long-distance rates with cheap Internet telephone calls. Frustrated regulators wail that the Internet has become a way to dodge national laws. Users are driven to distraction by the delays, the muddle and the brainless rubbish. Breakdowns of bits of the Net are hardly new, but when they happen these days a lot more people notice--as when America Online crashed in August, leaving 6m subscribers to twiddle their thumbs. Last week a group of American universities, fed up with the Net's sluggish ways, decided to set up Internet II, a new network that will allow its members to swap data more smoothly.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Faced with pile-ups and pollution on the prototype information superhighway, governments will be increasingly tempted to intervene. The Net's early colonisers reply that regulation will slow its growth. But is there any alternative?<br></p><p><b>Did somebody say market?</b><br>The first and most pressing need is for a better way to price the use of the Internet (see <a href="sf0774.html">page</a>). At present, many users pay less than the true cost of carrying their messages over the network. Most pay a one-off monthly fee to the firm that offers them a Net connection; and then home users typically have the additional cost of the local telephone call every time that they log on. This system is an invitation to use the network as intensively as possible, even if it causes problems for others. Thanks to the wonders of the World Wide Web, the multimedia part of the Net, people are using the network to transmit telephone calls, film clips and other capacity-guzzling applications. The upshot is that the Net still resembles a congested city street: because users pay only for their car and its fuel, rather than for the inconvenience their presence on the road imposes on others, they have no incentive to limit the use of their car in order to avoid traffic jams.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congestion is made worse by the absence of a satisfactory way for firms running the Net to charge for carrying each other's traffic. Sticking to the informal style that was characteristic of the Net's early days, they have tended to use a rough-and-ready barter system. That worked when there were just a handful of firms whose own networks formed the Net, but today there are thousands. Some admit that they now carry as much traffic from freeloaders as from their own customers. When they cannot afford to spend enough to keep up with this demand, they become bottlenecks.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To some extent, the market will develop answers for itself. Indeed, to the dismay of the most ardent Internet enthusiasts, companies are increasingly building private Internets either to connect their internal users, or to ensure fast communications with other firms. These private networks will solve other Internet problems: they offer quality-of-service guarantees, and better security against hackers. Geeks will grumble that they risk causing the balkanisation of the Net. Customers will be delighted by the absence of delays.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The subsidy from the telephone network is a different matter, and usually reflects political pressures: governments, keen to see competition when it benefits customers, do not much like measures that drive up the cost of a local call. One of the welcome effects of the Internet will be to make political meddling in telephone prices harder to sustain, because inexpensive telephone calls over the Internet will help to undermine excessive margins on long-distance telephone tariffs. Indeed, the interests of surfers and telephone callers are ultimately identical: where competition thrives and regulation does not suppress it, people will communicate through whichever channel is best for their particular needs.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Governments can leave the market to sort out the way transmission over the Net is priced. Their proper role is to decide how far to try to regulate the material that passes through it. Many people dislike the way the Net is used by law-breakers to bypass national laws on decency, libel, racism, intellectual property, and so on. Because the Internet whisks content around the world, it is harder to police than a national television channel or a newspaper.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Policing, mind you, is not impossible. The government of Myanmar has outlawed the unauthorised possession of networked computers on pain of 15 years in prison. For governments that care a jot for liberty (let alone for the health of their communications-based economies), matters are more complicated. None of the abuses complained of can be stamped out without gross invasion of privacy, any more than people can be prevented from sending racist letters to each other in the ordinary mail or making obscene telephone calls or from pirating home videos. But all can be discouraged more vigorously than most countries have yet done. Governments need to force Internet service providers, many of which will in future be big telephone companies, to take responsibility for what they knowingly carry on their sites. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet will always allow the really determined user access to unpleasant or illegal material. The telephone does the same. The important thing is that governments should not treat the Internet differently from other communications media, merely because it is new. The faster the Net grows up, the easier it will be to follow that rule.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?845683200,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="ld4398.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h2>Kremlin intrigue</h2>
<p>Boris Yeltsin sacked his troublesome national-security adviser, <b>Alexander Lebed</b>, after renewed feuding between Mr Lebed and the interior minister, Anatoly Kulikov. Mr Kulikov had accused Mr Lebed, implausibly, of planning a "creeping coup". Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, apparently sided with Mr Kulikov.</p>
<p>A Kremlin doctor insisted a <b>heart bypass operation</b> on President Boris Yeltsin would go ahead in mid-November.</p>
<p>The British government proposed banning all large-calibre <b>handguns</b> in response to the Dunblane massacre last March, in which a gunman shot dead 16 children and a teacher. If implemented, the rule would be among the toughest in the world.</p>
<p><b>Far-right parties</b> fared well. In Austria's first election to the European Parliament, the Freedom movement did almost as well as the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party. In France, a Communist and a candidate for the far-right National Front trounced the mainstream candidate in the first round of a by-election for a National Assembly seat near Marseilles.</p>
<p><b>Finland</b>, a member of the European Union for 22 months, joined its exchange-rate mechanism. Italy is still striving to re-enter.</p>
<p>A <b>one-day strike </b>in France protesting the government's austerity measures brought flights and trains to a halt and closed schools and public services.</p>
<p>Belgium's highest court removed Jean-Marc Connerotte as the judge presiding over the investigation into a <b>paedophile gang</b>, which has been accused of murdering four girls, after he attended a dinner with the victims' families. Those who saw him as the most energetic investigator in the case were outraged.</p>
<p>Denmark strengthened border controls and suspended the right of <b>biker gangs</b> to assemble, in an effort to control a war between feuding Hell's Angels and Bandidos.</p>
<h2>Kiwi split</h2>
<p>Political parties in <b>New Zealand </b>manoeuvred for power after an inconclusive general election under a new proportional-representation system. Jim Bolger's right-of-centre National Party won 44 seats in the 120-seat parliament. Labour came second with 37 seats.</p>
<p>The Australian government was embarrassed by a <b>political scandal</b> over shares owned by ministers in companies affected by their decisions. Two junior ministers resigned but the new government appeared to weather the crisis.</p>
<p>Opponents of Indonesia's occupation of <b>East Timor </b> were given a boost when two Timorese, Bishop Carlos Belo and Jose Ramos-Horta, a spokesman for the opposition in exile, were awarded the Nobel peace prize.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Representatives of Afghanistan's <b>Taliban </b>militia had peace talks with Abdul Rashid Dostam, controller of the only large area of the country not under Taliban control.</p>
<h2>A second round</h2>
<p>At the second <b>presidential debate </b>in San Diego, Bob Dole, the Republican, attacked Bill Clinton for his ethical lapses at every turn. Mr Clinton smiled through it. Instant polls showed that the audience thought Mr Clinton the winner. </p>
<p>The <font size=-1>FBI</font> said that <b>crime </b>in the United States had fallen to a ten-year low, with the rate of violent crime falling 4% in 1995 from the previous year, and with the murder rate falling by 8%.</p>
<p><b>Argentina</b>'s main opposition parties, the Radicals and Frepaso, held talks that could lead to an alliance in next year's congressional elections. In New York, the former economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, who plans to stand in those elections, publicly accused two past colleagues, the home minister and justice minister, of manipulating judges and state prosecutors. </p>
<p><b>Brazil</b>'s government announced a plan to slim the civil service and public-sector companies, improve tax-collection and increase privatisation sales. Total hoped-for gain next year: $6.4 billion. </p>
<p><b>Mexico</b>'s government, under pressure from the recent <font size=-1>PRI</font>-- ruling-party--congress, abandoned plans to privatise many petrochemical companies.</p>
<p>At least 79 people died in a crush at a <b>football stadium </b> in Guatemala city.</p>
<h2>Algeria refers</h2>
<p>President Zeroual of <b>Algeria</b> announced a referendum to amend the constitution, outlawing religious-based parties, for November 28th. The civil war went on: bomb attacks on markets, air strikes against the Islamist guerrillas. </p>
<p>With at least indirect Iranian assistance, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan swept back into <b>northern Iraq</b>, retaking Sulaymaniyah and other towns from the Kurdish Democratic Party. An American envoy is to try to arrange a truce.</p>
<p>A<b> </b>flurry of visits tried to put pressure on Israel's prime minister, <b>Binyamin Netanyahu</b>. King Hussein of Jordan piloted Yasser Arafat to Jericho, the king's first venture into Palestinian territory. Mr Arafat and Jordan's prime minister visited Egypt's President Mubarak. So did Israel's President Ezer Weizman. Israel's latest plan for Hebron got an angry rejection from Mr Arafat.</p>
<p>In <b>South Africa</b> General Magnus Malan and others accused of an apartheid-days massacre were acquitted.</p>
<p>A ministerial delegation from East African countries to discuss peace talks with <b>Burundi</b>'s Tutsi military leader, Pierre Buyoya, was cancelled after he reversed his decision to talk to Hutu rebels. </p>

<h2>Lift-off</h2>
<p>(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The French government recommended that <b>Thomson</b>, a state-owned electronics giant, should be transferred to the Lagard&egrave;re group, rather than Alcatel Alsthom, a rival French group. Lagard&egrave;re's Matra defence unit will fit neatly with Thomson's missile operations. As part of the deal, which should hasten consolidation in Europe's fragmented defence industry, the government will wipe out FFr11 billion ($2.1 billion) of Thomson's debts. And Lagard&egrave;re will sell the firm's <font size=-1>TV</font>-making arm to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics. </p>
<p>Those who thought demand for microchips was waning should think again. The third quarter net profit of <b>Intel</b>, the world's largest semiconductor company, rose 41%, to $1.3 billion. Its sales rose 23%, reaching a record $5.1 billion.</p>
<p>Two giant <b>Californian power companies </b>agreed to merge. Enova, the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric, and Pacific Enterprises, which owns Southern California Gas, a big producer of natural gas, will together have nearly 6m customers and a market capitalisation of $5.2 billion.</p>
<p>In a British deal that will create the world's largest trade exhibitions organiser, United News & Media won a battle for control of <b>Blenheim </b>by agreeing to pay &#163;593m ($939m) for the conference organiser. A week earlier a Dutch media group, <font size=-1>VNU</font>, had grabbed 15% of Blenheim, prompting United's bid.</p>
<p>Marjorie Scardino, the chief executive of The Economist Group, is to become the new boss of <b>Pearson</b>, a British media conglomerate that is under pressure to improve its performance. Pearson owns 50% of <i>The Economist</i>. </p>
<p><b>Philips</b>, Europe's biggest maker of electronic goods, said it will restructure its management following a profits warning that caused its share price to slide. Cor Boonstra, who took over as president of the Dutch group this month, is renowned for his cost-cutting skills.</p>
 
<p>What, no Big Mac? The first <b>McDonald's in India</b>--and the first beefless one anywhere in the world--opened in Delhi. In deference to India's Hindu population, mutton has replaced beef on the menu. By using all-Indian ingredients, the group hopes to avoid being criticised by opponents of foreign investment in the country.</p>
<h2>Costly crutches</h2>
<p>The thorny issue of <b>state aid </b> to former East Germany is likely to cause further controversy after the German government gave DM880m ($572m) of aid to two shipyards in the east. Another big East German firm, Sket, a heavy-engineering group, began bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>The World Trade Organisation is to set up a panel to look into an American complaint, which is supported by the European Union, that Japan deliberately keeps foreign products out of its <b>photofilm market</b>. But America blocked a request from the <font size=-1>EU</font> for a panel to discuss the United States' Helms-Burton law, which penalises firms doing business with Cuba. America claims that it is a political issue, not one for the <font size=-1>WTO</font>. </p>
<p>The price of <b>oil </b>is soaring. Brent blend rose above $25 a barrel for the first time since the Gulf war. </p>
<p><b>William Vickrey </b>of Columbia University, who only last week shared the Nobel prize for economics with James Mirrlees, died, apparently of a heart attack. He was 82.</p>
<h2>Running bulls</h2>
<p>(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 6,000 for the first time, and other bourses around the world hit <b>record highs </b>too. Among them were London, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Sydney.</p>
<p>All change at troubled Morgan Grenfell Asset Management, the fund-management bit of <b>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</b>, the investment banking arm of Germany's Deutsche Bank. Keith Percy, its chief executive, and three other directors are to leave the firm after an investigation into a unit-trust scandal unearthed serious management flaws. </p>
<p>Italy said that next month it will sell a 60% stake in <b>Banco di Napoli</b>, an ailing state bank that is being purged of its chronic debts.</p>
<h2>A mighty fine line</h2>
<p>Two of America's biggest <b>railways </b>are coming together to create a huge freight company and rail network. <font size=-1>CSX</font>, a transportation company, will pay $8.4 billion for Conrail, leaving only one other serious rival, Norfolk Southern, to the east of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>A federal court suspended a set of rules that determine how much America's <b>regional telephone companies</b> can charge any new competitors for access to their lines. Further legal battles over the issue could delay the start of local competition for as much as a year.</p>
<p>America's<b> big three car makers</b> nearly doubled their profits in the third quarter compared with the same period last year. General Motors beat expectations with a net profit of $1.3 billion; Chrysler declared a record profit of $680m; and Ford clocked up $686m. However, the latter's losses in Europe and South America grew.</p>
<p>Two British airlines, British Airways and Virgin Express, and a French consortium led by Nouvelles Fronti&egrave;res, a travel group and Corsair, a French regional airline, are wooing <b>Air Libert&eacute;</b>. They are all interested in the crippled regional airline's slots at Orly airport in Paris.</p>

<h1 align=center> A tale of two lobbies</h1>


<p><b>Why do two similar countries disagree so profoundly about guns?</b></p>
BRITAIN and America have a great deal in common, but in one way they are about to diverge sharply. America has the laxest gun-control regime in the developed world, and Britain is about to adopt what will be about the toughest. How has this happened?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The immediate cause, of course, was the massacre of 16 schoolchildren and a teacher at Dunblane in Scotland in March this year. The report of the inquiry into the massacre was published on October 16th. It recommended tighter controls on handguns, but the government has gone much further, announcing that it wants to ban most kinds outright. Small-calibre pistols would be allowed, but would have to be locked up at gun clubs, not kept at home. It is estimated that around 80% of the 250,000 handguns held legally in Britain would henceforth be outlawed. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But America has its massacres, too, and they have not had such consequences. Bill Clinton has made some slight headway on gun control by helping to enact one bill banning assault weapons and another imposing a waiting period on those wanting to buy handguns. But, to outsiders, America's gun regime remains astonishingly lax.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Britain, the government's instinct to do nothing much was trampled by public opinion. Even the <i>Sun</i>--the biggest circulation, furthest-right of the gutter tabloids, whose suspicion of government is as ample as the bosoms it puts on display--said "if the Tories fail today  the people will take their revenge." According to a recent opinion poll, Britons favour a ban on handguns by 81% to 15%; Americans oppose such a ban by around 60% to 40%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difference in the gun-control argument in the two countries goes to the heart of the difference in their politics. Americans start from their constitution, and thus from questions about fundamental liberties. Britons, without a constitution to hang their principles on, argue pragmatically. There is much to be said for the American way; but the American passion for liberty means that unimportant freedoms sometimes blow up in their faces. Britons, in contrast, argue on the basis of outcomes, rather than principles. They do not like what the freedom to carry guns has done to America, where the murder rate is ten times higher than in Britain, and 70% of murders are carried out using firearms.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet most Americans, too, would like stricter gun laws. A Gallup poll last year found 62% wanting them tightened up, compared to 12% wanting them looser and 24% saying they should stay the same. The immovable object is the gun lobby. Britain has one too, but it is unlike America's. In Britain, shooting is associated with landowning; joining a good shoot is a big step up the social ladder in the shires. Such people (some of whom are in the cabinet) use shotguns, which have escaped the ban because farmers can reasonably argue that they need them to keep down vermin. Handguns are only good for killing people--which, for Americans who maintain that they need to protect themselves against each other and the government, is the point.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Britain's gun-control lobby has won a victory that its American counterpart dares not dream of. Unfortunately, rather than celebrating, the victors are crying "no compromise" until a no-exceptions ban is announced. Pragmatism can be a virtue; blind emotion is no way to set policy.<br>

Now it may have to change. But how?</b></p>READ about the Internet, and thrill to the notion of a world wired at the speed of light, with all the information anyone could want just a mouse-click away. But actually use the cursed thing, and a more prosaic picture quickly emerges. Delay, break-downs and glacial transmissions are part of everyday Internet life. New users are amazed: surely this tepid data trickle is not the fabled "information superhighway"? Veterans shake their head wearily: the Internet has always been swamped, and as long at it doubles in size each year, it seems likely always to remain so.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True? That question--whether the Internet can grow out of stumbling adolescence and become as delay-free and reliable as the telephone network--ultimately comes down to one of economics. Today's Internet works with a financial model that has hardly changed from the days, a decade ago, when the network was a non-commercial communications link for universities and research labs. Multi-million dollar networks still trade data on the barter principle, or the roughest approximations of real cost. Not surprisingly, these intersections between networks are usually where the traffic backs up (see <a href="sf1.gif">map</a>). <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bypassing these bottlenecks is not as easy as it might seem. The Internet is made up of many networks, operated by many different firms. Customers can pay a fortune for "industrial strength", rather than "student strength" service, but that service only lasts as far as the firm's network reaches. Sooner or later, Web surfers find themselves in some congested backwater, where no amount of money can make a swamped Web server serve: the Internet treats all transmissions alike, whatever their price.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No wonder, then, that more and more users are simply bypassing the public Internet. Companies are setting up private "intranets" within single locations and "extranets" with branches and partners. A group of American research universities plan to build "Internet II", dedicated to academic traffic and free of commercial users, much as the Internet itself was just a few years ago. This month, President Clinton promised to seek $500m over five years to help them.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Building a second Internet (and many smaller rivals) might seem an expensive alternative to simply eliminating the economic failings of the first. But the question of how--or whether--the Internet's economic model should be changed is difficult. One of the reasons the Internet has been able to grow so quickly is that its builder avoided the complex accounting and time-and-distance charging of the telephone networks. Yet now that the Internet is carrying as much traffic as the voice networks over some routes, some charging by use is already taking place (when traffic was not so heavy, the approximations of flat-fee charges and bartering were good enough; now they can be expensive mistakes). <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So which model is best? Or, more fundamentally, what should it cost to communicate? At present, the answer depends on how you do it. Pick up the telephone, and you pay by the mile and the minute. Send a message across the Internet to the same destination (or use special software to make an Internet telephone call) and--even though the message will travel across the same lines--you pay, at most, the price of a local telephone call.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In part the cheapness is because the Internet sends messages more efficiently than local telephone network<b>s</b>: it breaks them down into small digital "packets" that can then be slotted in with other packets travelling over the same network. By contrast, a telephone call requires a whole electronic circuit to itself for the duration of the call. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But in long distance and international transmissions, the technology is similar: both voice and data are sent as a digital stream along fibre-optic cable. Indeed, nearly all of the Internet runs along lines leased from the telephone companies.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both telephone companies and the myriad firms that run the Internet therefore have a similar pattern of costs: their big expense comes in installing switches (or "routers") and providing lines. The cost of carrying one extra item is as near to zero as makes no difference--"too cheap to meter", as some would have it.  <b><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</b> But if the costs of the telephone companies and the Internet are similar, why are their methods of pricing different? The answer is that telecoms charges bear little relation to costs. The telephone industry is regulated nearly everywhere and in most countries prices are set by bureaucrats and commissions; real costs are hidden by a layer of cross subsidies. The Internet, on the other hand, is essentially unregulated.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</b> At present, telephone companies typically make less than half their revenue from fixed charges rather than from the price of each call. Tim Kelly, of the International Telecommunication Union in Geneva, reckons that the share of revenue from connection charges and monthly rentals has risen in the past decade from about 33% to 40%; he expects an increase to around 60% over the next ten years.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The companies are not keen on such "rebalancing", since it usually involves reducing lucrative call charges rather than increasing fixed charges. But without it, they are vulnerable to competition, including competition from the Internet, which can offer rival services far less expensively.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The competition, however, may have its silver lining: the Internet encourages telephone use, and in most countries this is charged by the second for local calls--including the ones, sometimes lasting for hours, made by the net-surfers. Add to that the income from installing extra lines, ordered by a surfer's frustrated relations in their desire to make ordinary telephone calls. Add lastly the prospect that the telephone companies will start offering services in competition with the Internet-- once the Internet has tested the prices consumers are willing to pay.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What seems reasonably certain, however, is that the impact of the Internet and the spreading deregulation of the telecoms industry will bring prices closer to real costs. The telephone companies will have the biggest pricing adjustment to make<b>. </b>But the Internet too may have to change--perhaps by moving closer to the method of the telephone companies, namely a mix of fixed tariffs and ones based on usage. Economists such as Hal Varian, from the University of California at Berkeley, and Jeff Mackie-Mason, of Michigan University, fret that the present structure of Internet pricing does not reflect its "social costs". <br></p><p><b>World Wide Wait</b><br>Those are not, as you might think, the conversation-deadening impact of hours spent surfing, but the congestion that periodically occurs on the network. My Internet video call may hold up your electronic mail, imposing a cost on you that I do not notice. Use-based pricing, they argue, is essential to encourage the rational allocation of scarce transmission capacity.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dangers of congestion have undoubtedly increased in the past year or two, as the Internet has moved from being a government-financed playground for academics to a cornucopia of entertainment, commerce and information. As a result the use of the Internet is growing faster than the number of subscribers: traffic through one of the main connection points has been doubling every six months, says Tony Rutkowski, once head of the Internet Society and now with General Magic, a software firm, while the number of subscribers is doubling only every year.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, the Internet is no longer being used almost exclusively to send text. Instead, thanks partly to the development of the World Wide Web, people can listen to music, make telephone calls and look at film clips. These uses, which are the ones growing most quickly, gobble up far more capacity than text: to send 15 seconds of high quality video munches as much bandwidth as the text of a 700-page book.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A second change means that the costs of congestion are becoming higher. It may not matter if some parts of an electronic letter take a second or two longer than the others to reach their destination. But more and more of the material sent over the Internet needs to arrive immediately to be effective. If some of the bits that make up a video call or a telephone conversation are held up en route, the results are jerky and garbled.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Do these congestion-driven arguments imply the need for new settlement mechanisms? In the case of telephone companies, a system exists so that the company with which a call starts--which bills the caller-- can hand some of the proceeds to the company through which the call ends. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such settlements are a source of endless argument: America's long-distance carriers complain that local telephone companies overcharge them. Moreover, they transfer huge sums of money between countries: in 1994, carriers based in the United States handed over a net $4.3 billion to foreign carriers. Because countries in which telephoning is cheap (such as America) tend to ring countries where calls are dearer, American carriers grumble that they are subsidising the inefficient and uncompetitive. Gradually, therefore, telephone companies are moving towards a "sender-keeps-all" system, where they will charge each other a flat fee for access to a certain amount of transmission capacity, rather than bill each other on the basis of use.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That would bring them increasingly into line with what happens on the Internet, where settlement is rudimentary. There are payments between each of the Internet's hierarchy of links: access providers pay their regional network and regional networks pay the companies that operate the high-capacity long-distance parts, the backbone of the system. But such payments are mostly based on the availability of capacity, not its use: service providers simply agree to carry each other's traffic without totting up precise bills.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This encourages a "hot-potato" approach: Internet access providers hand traffic on as quickly as possible to the carrier taking it to its ultimate destination. That benefits small service providers and irritates big ones, who say they get little reward for the effort of carrying the traffic for most of its journey. In turn, this lessens their incentive to invest in new capacity. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem of settlement is worse for access providers outside America. Led by Singapore Telecom and Australia's Telstra, they complain that they have to pay all the cost of leasing lines between their country and the United States. "The rest of the planet subsidises the United States," argues Barry Greene, who works for Cisco, a maker of routers, but was previously with Singnet, the Internet arm of Singapore Telecom. The high cost of leasing international lines means that upgrading them to ease congestion can cost a non-American company ten times more than in America.<br></p><p><b>Free lunches all round</b><br>Economists, famously sceptical about free lunches, have thought up various ingenious schemes to charge Internet users in ways that more accurately reflect costs. Several versions will appear in a forthcoming tome on Internet Economics, edited by Lee McKnight and Joseph Bailey of <font size=-1>MIT</font>. The main suggestion is to attach to messages some indication of their priority (high for a film clip, low for an e-mail message and so on). Users might pay in advance for high priority traffic; or their payments might vary with the level of congestion. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The means for such fancy solutions will increasingly become available. A new protocol, or standard, called <font size=-1>RSVP</font> will soon allow people to specify the quality of service they want and, in theory, to be billed for it. Asynchronous transfer mode, or <font size=-1>ATM</font>, a technology that breaks the Internet's many sorts of digital signals into packets of a standard size, will allow a reliable quality of service and make it easier to keep accounts, if it ever becomes widely used. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Undoubtedly, charges would have an effect on the way the Internet is used. A study of "Information Infrastructure Convergence and Pricing: The Internet" by the <font size=-1>OECD</font>, published in June, showed that Internet access was far greater in competitive telecommunications markets than in uncompetitive ones. The reason is almost certainly that the average price for leased lines in countries with monopolies was 44% higher than in competitive ones (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>). There was also a close correlation between Internet use and the structure of local call charges: surfing for hours is free or almost free in the United States and Canada, but most <font size=-1>OECD</font> countries charge local callers for the time they spend on the line. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fearful that use-based pricing would be a dampener, many Internet aficionados cross their fingers that the Internet can muddle on with its present, mostly flat-fee structure. After all, the capacity of the Internet's backbone has increased more than 10,000 times in the past decade; and that has been financed by the enormous increase in the number of subscribers. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, various technical solutions have emerged to slow the growth in traffic, such as the practice of "caching": storing material that one person has looked at close to the point of use, so that the next user need not go all the way to the original site to look at it.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Flat-raters point also to the low cost of a flat-rate sender-keeps-all system. After all, for some telecoms companies to bill a customer for a call costs more than to transmit it. Moreover, the present system suits the idiosyncracies of the Internet. Each message may hop across a dozen different carriers. Should each be paid something? And the person who initiates an Internet "conversation" may send out a tiny message and receive a huge one. How should the costs be divided? <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One way or another, as the Internet expands in both content and usage, a change is surely inevitable. Some of the larger telecoms carriers, such as <font size=-1>BT</font>/<font size=-1>MCI</font>, are building parallel global Internets of their own on which customers, for a premium payment, will be guaranteed a more reliable service than the public Internet can now offer. They will, says Barbara Dooley, managing editor of <i>CIXtra</i>, a newsletter, have an incentive to carry customers' traffic for as much of the way as possible, to keep control of the quality of service. Once they carry traffic around the world, they will have little incentive to make settlement payments; they will probably agree to accept a certain volume of traffic from each other free.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And what of the public Internet? Its users will face a choice. If they want to surf for free, they will have to put up with the occasional congestion. This will be partly self regulating: if too many people try to hold video conferences with their children, the quality will become so awful that the youngsters will give up in disgust and congestion will lessen. The wonderful thing about the Internet is that it still reflects what its users want, not what some large telecommunications company believes they ought to have.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?845683200,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="sf0775.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

BOB METCALFE, one of the inventors of computer networking, predicted this spring that the Internet would grind to a halt this year. And as if to prove the point, a few months later America Online and Netcom, two of America's biggest Internet providers, went down for a day each, cutting off more than 6m subscribers. Pundits saw it as an omen of greater blackouts to come. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The geeks who keep the Internet running disagree. After all, most data show that the Internet is actually getting faster. Local failures are inevitable, but the Internet has so far been surprisingly resilient.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Skeptics worry that this cannot last. Not only is the number of users--already an estimated 40m-50m--doubling every year, but because of the increased use of pictures and sound (which use a lot more capacity than simple text), traffic per user is growing even faster (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where this causes congestion is not along the Internet's highways, but at their intersections, where "routers" direct data towards their destination. Here the Internet's health boils down to a conflict between two laws: one coined by Mr Metcalfe himself, and one by a microchip guru, Intel's Gordon Moore.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Metcalfe's law states that the value of a network increases by the square of its users. This means that each new user tends to add more traffic than the one before, because the more people who are on the Internet, the more popular it becomes as a channel of communications. Moore's law is that computer chips double in speed every 18 months--and routers are just specialised computers. Since Internet traffic is growing three times faster, the trends seem set to collide. How can the routers keep up?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three ways. The first is to share the load: network operators can increase the number of routers and connections, like adding more lanes to a highway instead of simply raising its speed limit. The second is to simplify their job, by tagging each data packet with what amounts to a short postal code rather than an entire street address. Finally, tomorrow's routers will be able to distinguish between data types, sending video down fast lanes and e-mail down slow ones. Anyway, there are only so many people in the world: the rush to surf will eventually slow.<br>

<h1>The last living liberal</h1>

<font size=1>ST PAUL, MINNESOTA</font><p>
NOBODY campaigns quite like Paul Wellstone. One moment he waves his arms before a crowd of students, urging them to embrace direct action ("Turn the heat up. Nothing will happen unless you keep pushing."). The next moment he drops to the floor to autograph a Wellstone placard affixed to a cleaner's trolley. Then he bounds into a daycare centre, and shares five minutes of empassioned concern with one of the teachers. Standing amidst a gaggle of toddlers would be photo-opportunity enough for any ordinary man. But Mr Wellstone seizes two children by the hands and marches them out into the autumn sunshine to see his rickety campaign bus. The cameras are practically singing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Wellstone may be about to achieve something quite remarkable. In elections all across America, being "liberal" is supposedly the kiss of death. In Minnesota, however, this firm believer in an activist state is ahead in his race for re-election to the Senate. In elections around the country, attack ads are thought to work. But Republican attacks on Mr Wellstone seem to be backfiring. All across America, too, politics has become a professional domain, ruled over by pollsters, admen and demographers. But Mr Wellstone rebels against this, urging his audiences to "get out there and hold people accountable."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1990, when Mr Wellstone won his first Senate race, many thought him merely lucky. That year, the Minnesota Republicans were divided; a sex scandal had felled their gubernatorial candidate. Rudy Boschwitz, the incumbent senator, was kept from campaigning by a budget row that pinned him down in Washington. When he came home, he made various gaffes. Mr Wellstone's statism did not win, the argument goes; rather, the Republicans imploded.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This year a Wellstone victory would not be so easily dismissed. The Republicans are united; and Mr Boschwitz, who is trying to recapture his old seat, has no distractions from campaigning. On October 14th he lavished a whole day on the sparsely-populated south-west. He hopped between tiny towns in an eight-seater aircraft, spoke from podiums fashioned from hay-bales, and walked down empty shopping streets in search of unsuspecting voters.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Boschwitz is a twinkly-eyed sort, a grandad who runs 100 miles each month, a job-creating entrepreneur who arrived in America 60 years ago with nothing. In short, he is the ideal Republican candidate. His stump speech exudes the optimism that serves his party well. At each stop he celebrates local heroes--a man in a wheelchair who runs a farm, a team of volunteer firemen--and declares that the spirit of ordinary folk can do more to solve America's woes than Mr Wellstone's state activism. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For his televised campaign, Mr Boschwitz has hired Arthur Finkelstein, the ace of Republican air wars. The result is a binge of attack ads, sugared with some humour. In one, a 1960s professor inducts Mr Wellstone into the "liberal hall of fame", to the applause of doped drop-outs holding placards calling for more taxes. In another, a Wellstone cartoon waves a flash-card marked "liberal" up and down with comically inhuman energy. Six years ago, Mr Wellstone had the better television campaign. This time the Boschwitz ads are the more memorable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Faced with this sort of opposition, Mr Wellstone ought to be in trouble. His views are unfashionable, to say the least. He was the only senator facing re-election who voted against welfare reform; he opposed the Gulf war; he wants the rich to pay higher taxes; his campaign bus is plastered with stickers advertising his ties to the dwindling trade unions. Yet Mr Wellstone is doing fine. The latest poll gives him a nine-point lead over Mr Boschwitz.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What to make of this surprise? It may be that Mr Wellstone's views, though out of keeping with America's as a whole, match Minnesota nicely. The state was too far north, its winters too bitterly cold, to attract normal Yankees as they moved west in the 19th century. Instead, Scandinavians and Germans settled its flat land, and they seem to have brought with them social-democratic tendencies. Minnesota's taxes are high, its schools and social services better than average. The state practises an industrial policy of which Europeans would be proud, pouring $840m into Northwest Airlines in 1991 in order to keep its hub in Minneapolis. Minnesotans cheerfully call their state the Sweden of America.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Out on the stump, Mr Wellstone plays up this idea of Minnesotan exceptionalism. "I feel blessed to be a senator from Minnesota," he roars, explaining that the people of the state are too decent to fall for the Republicans' sink-or-swim individualism. The attack ads have backfired, he suggests, because Minnesotans are sensible and nice. Indeed, "Minnesota Nice" is a phenomenon much discussed in the state: people are honest, uncorrupt, and slow to insult anyone; if you dial the wrong number, the person on the end of the line may volunteer to find the right one for you.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In truth, this Nordic niceness--rooted in solid farm communities, celebrated by Garrison Keillor in his stories about Lake Wobegon--is fading. Minnesotans have left the land for suburban homes, and they have succumbed to the same suspicions of welfare cheats and inner-city crime that have spawned Republicans all across America. Apart from Lake Wobegon, Minnesota's best known contribution to culture may be the country's biggest shopping centre. Every year, 40m visitors flock to the Mall of America outside Minneapolis. For many of them, the last contact with the farm values of old is the autumn apple festival in the mall's rotunda.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The old Democratic dominance of Minnesota has faded too, making it hard to pin Mr Wellstone's strength on the state's supposed peculiarities. There is a Republican governor, and in 1994 the Senate race was won by Rod Grams, an unimpressive and exceedingly right-wing newscaster. Besides, many Minnesota Democrats are not "liberal" in the Wellstone sense. The party is strongest of all in the far-northern Mesabi Iron Range, where miners and farmers tend to oppose gun control, legalised abortion and environmental rules--all of which are proud Wellstone causes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, if Mr Wellstone does win, some conventional wisdom will have to be discarded. It will not do to argue that his opponent was weak, or that Minnesota is exceptional. Instead, it will have to be accepted that "liberals" can win, especially if they emphasise Americans' economic insecurities in places where these are strong. Over the past month, Bob Dole has tried to hurt Bill Clinton by branding him with the <font size=-1>L</font>-word. Four years from now, the next Republican presidential candidate may have to try a different strategy.<br>

He pounced on the very first question in Wednesday's presidential debate in San Diego to engage in his latest campaign tactic: attacking the ethics of the Clinton administration. He talked about "scandals almost on a daily basis", about the improper gathering of <font size=-1>FBI</font> files, about possible presidential pardons. Later, he must have baffled millions of Americans by talking about "contributions coming in from Indonesia", an oblique reference to the <i>scandale du jour. </i>Perhaps he would have attacked more had the questions from the audience given him more openings. But the audience was interested in policy matters. And at the end of the debate the instant polls, for what they are worth, declared Mr Clinton the clear winner.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new Dole strategy amounts to an admission of failure, the failure of any other approach to make an impact on what has remained an extraordinarily static race. Mr Dole's inability to sell his 15% tax cut is merely the most conspicuous example. So many moments that were supposed to mark decisive turning-points--the decision to quit the Senate, the choice of Jack Kemp as running mate, the Republican convention, the arrival of federal funds to pay for advertising, the first presidential debate in Hartford--have all come and gone with scarcely a blip in the polls. After countless bumpy trips on the Citizen's Ship and umpteen rallies in front of polite crowds, the excitement level surrounding the Dole campaign still fails to register on the political Richter scale. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Mr Clinton remains what he has been all year: the top dog, sitting pretty. Mr Dole is the hapless underdog, now reduced to growling menacingly and baring his teeth. What has Mr Dole done wrong?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just about everything, it would seem. Certainly, he has not helped his cause by his constant ditherings and changes of tactics. The decision, after a week of public wavering, to attack on the "character issue" is the latest <font size=-1>U</font>-turn among many, stretching back to the primaries. Mr Dole allowed himself to be tugged this way and that over Pat Buchanan's challenge and over the issue of abortion. By coming out against affirmative action he belied his own record on racial policy, and by embracing supply-side economics he jeopardised his hard-earned reputation for fiscal conservatism. All this from a man who touts his "leadership" qualities.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has seemed uncertain how hard to push his tax plan, how vigorously to compete in California, how to express what this election is "all about". If so much indecision was not bad enough, he has too often been painfully inarticulate. Oh yes, and he is also old, falls over and blinks too much. His bid for the White House is widely seen as a close competitor to the 1988 Dukakis effort for the title of the worst presidential campaign of modern times.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton's campaign, by contrast, is one of the best. The president set his course long ago, and has stuck to it. The plan was to avoid a primary challenge, raise lots of money early, use this financial fire-power over the spring and summer to help consolidate a commanding lead over an opponent bumping against his federal spending limits, and then, after the party conventions, run a "holding operation" to stay on top. That is exactly what has happened.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton has also used the office of the presidency to maximum effect, making news and staging made-for-television signing ceremonies. Seemingly prepared for everything, the Clinton campaign's rapid-response effort has even given a new word to the English language: "prebuttal". Remarkably, a White House once notorious for indiscipline has been operating with military efficiency. Reporters have waited in vain for gaffes, flip-flops and snafus. The big exception was the resignation of Dick Morris, the president's strategic guru, over his dalliance with a prostitute. But the bimbo eruption was Mr Morris's, not Mr Clinton's, and by then the Morris strategy had worked its magic. Mr Clinton had neutralised "Republican" issues, from welfare to crime and foreign policy, making him a maddeningly difficult target for Mr Dole to attack. It remained only for Mr Clinton to go out and delight the crowds with his proven brilliance on the campaign trail.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet when all is said and done (which, thank goodness, it very nearly is), the contrasting aptitudes of the two campaigns may be less important than they now seem. More fundamental forces are really deciding the contest. Two forces, to be precise, each working in opposite directions.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One, in Mr Dole's favour, is that the country is broadly in a conservative mood. Mr Clinton (with Mr Morris's help) drew the lesson from the 1994 election. He has positioned himself as a conservative on matters of budgets and values--so successfully that Mr Dole is reduced to accusing him of being a stealth liberal. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other force, this time helping Mr Clinton, is the health of the economy. Incumbent presidents are hard to beat if the economy is growing strongly, as it has been, with low unemployment and little inflation. The national angst over jobs and living standards, much exaggerated by media hype, seems to have abated (even though a recent poll in the <i>Washington Post</i> showed that a large number of Americans believe the unemployment rate to be more than 20%). These are no longer receptive times for a bold new economic plan, such as Mr Dole's 15% tax cut.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole can still hope that the political winds will in the end work in his favour, just as they did (despite his dreadful campaigning) in the primaries. They should at least tighten the race in the final three weeks; Dole people say they are already seeing such movement in states across the country. But luck, in the shape of the economic cycle, strongly favours Mr Clinton. Beyond the excitements over presidential debates, campaigning prowess and strategic decisions, it is these fundamentals that will determine who has the last bark.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br></td></tr></table><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?845683200,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="br7538.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<p><b>Broadcasting</b></p>
<h1>Cheap</h1>

THERE is a good case to be made for privatising Channel 4 television. It is, some say, absurd and illiberal that the state should own three out of four terrestrial television channels. Others maintain that the state should not own television channels at all. Against the privatisers, supporters of Channel 4's current status maintain that its rich diversity would not survive in the commercial world.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, there is also a bad case for privatising Channel 4, and that is the one that the government is currently considering: that the sale could raise money for electoral bribes. Behind that lies an even worse argument: that, by offsetting the proceeds of the proposed sale against its public-spending plans to be published next month, the Tories could plant a time-bomb for a Labour government, which would not sell the channel. John Major is considering the proposal, which is backed by Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, but opposed by Virginia Bottomley, the heritage secretary. Mr Major should have no truck with such specious economic reasoning.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Channel 4 is not subsidised, but estimates of how much it would fetch vary hugely. If, at one extreme, it was given a remit to produce the unpopular minority-interest programmes that constitute much of its present output, it might raise only &#163;200m. Remit-free it might be worth as much as &#163;2 billion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if the government decided now to sell it, this could not pay for tax cuts next year because of the legislative timetable. Some Tory backbenchers, including Nicholas Winterton and Sir Tim Renton, are passionately opposed to a sale on cultural grounds. Even if they were persuaded, the government would find it hard to push through an act of parliament before the general election, which cannot be delayed beyond May. Privatisation is thus unlikely to figure in the Queen's speech on October 23rd which will set out this Parliament's legislative programme. And even if it were legislated straight after the election, the bill would not become law in time to allow a sale in 1997-98.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, Mr Clarke could announce the government's intention to legislate next year as part of his spending plans in his budget on November 26th, with the actual sale scheduled for 1998-99. Under existing public spending rules he would then be entitled to score the proceeds in his plans for 1998-99, allowing him to project lower borrowing in that year--and perhaps lower taxes as a result.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That would pose a problem for Labour, whose heritage spokesman, Jack Cunningham, is passionately against a sale. If Labour won, and the sale was ditched, a Labour government would have to find more revenue or spend less elsewhere. With the outlook for public finances already tight, neither option is attractive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, it is bad economics to use financial receipts from the sale of state assets to pay for current spending or tax cuts. Such receipts do reduce the public sector borrowing requirement but they do not reduce the state's long-term claim on national resources. As for the politics, Mr Clarke's device is transparently sleazy. The government's proper course, if it decides that privatisation is right, would be to leave the sale out of its budget spending plans; to put a proposal for selling Channel 4 in its manifesto; and only if it is re-elected to take account of the proceeds in drawing up its future budgetary plans.<br>

<p><b>Taxation</b></p>
<h1>VAT's the problem</h1>

THIS year's budget will be knocked into shape on October 18th, when Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Treasury officials gather at Dorneywood, the chancellor's country pad. This meeting would be a calmer affair were it not for a huge and mysterious hole in the government's tax revenues. This has resulted in a far bigger public-sector borrowing requirement (<font size=-1>PSBR</font>) than is desirable so far into the economic cycle. New data on October 16th put the <font size=-1>PSBR</font> at &#163;3.4 billion in September, and total borrowing for the first half of this financial year at &#163;16.1 billion--making it extremely difficult for Mr Clarke to cut much off the income-tax rate in the budget on November 26th. What has gone wrong?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Value-added tax (<font size=-1>VAT</font>) is mostly to blame. <font size=-1>VAT</font>, levied on goods and services, contributes almost one-third of total tax revenues, a larger slice than in other big economies (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). Yet in 1995-96, the &#163;43 billion of <font size=-1>VAT</font> collected was a hefty &#163;5 billion less than forecast in the November 1994 budget. That money could have paid for a cut of almost two pence from the basic rate of income tax. Although <font size=-1>VAT</font> revenues are in line with forecasts so far this financial year, that is because these forecasts already assume disappointing <font size=-1>VAT</font> revenues.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not all of 1995-96's missing &#163;5 billion is inexplicable. The 1994 budget assumed much faster <font size=-1>GDP</font> growth than there turned out to be. Had the Treasury plugged into its forecasting model the amount of growth that actually took place, it would have expected to collect some &#163;2 billion less in <font size=-1>VAT</font>, calculates Chris Giles, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group. But nobody has yet worked out what happened to the remaining &#163;3 billion shortfall, says Mr Giles. A working party set up earlier this year is examining the more plausible theories, and will report to the chancellor soon. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One possibility is that consumers have been spending more heavily on "zero rated" goods than the Treasury expected. Britain has a standard rate of <font size=-1>VAT</font> of 17.5%-- above average for developed countries-- but levies a reduced rate of 8% on domestic fuel, and exempts some goods and services, because they are, ostensibly, necessities. This is no small beer: making zero-rated purchases subject to the standard rate of <font size=-1>VAT</font> would have raised around &#163;15 billion in 1995-96. One reason why spending might have been skewed more towards zero-rated purchases is the launch of the National Lottery--but its impact could only have been tiny, and then only if the money spent on tickets would otherwise have gone on <font size=-1>VAT</font>-able buys.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tax avoidance (legal) and evasion (illegal) are likelier culprits. Britain's "<font size=-1>VAT</font> productivity"--the additional revenue raised by each extra percentage point of the tax rate--has fallen steadily since 1989, suggesting that the increase in the rate to 17.5% has encouraged greater effort to cut tax bills.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Kent Matthews, an economist at Cardiff Business School, reckons that increases in the threshold at which firms start to pay the tax have encouraged innovative ways to cut bills, such as hairdressing salons "renting" chairs to individual cutters, who become self-employed workers earning less than the <font size=-1>VAT</font> threshold. He recently analysed <font size=-1>VAT</font> payment in several industries and compared this with estimated potential <font size=-1>VAT</font> revenues, concluding that revenues in the various sectors were between 30% and 100% lower than they should have been. In restaurants and hairdressing, in particular, the gap between actual and potential <font size=-1>VAT</font> was big and, since 1992, growing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The small firms that dominate these sectors may not be the only problem, however. The smallest 70% of traders pay only 10% of total <font size=-1>VAT</font> revenues; 75% of the tax-take is culled from fewer than 2,000 big firms. So for &#163;3 billion to go missing, the chances are that those big firms are up to something. That is less likely to be evasion than honest, above-board tax avoidance. According to a senior Treasury official, the number of <font size=-1>VAT</font> experts employed by accounting firms and big <font size=-1>VAT</font> payers has recently risen sharply.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What can be done? Customs and Excise, which collects <font size=-1>VAT</font>, might try harder, perhaps, although it already has a fearsome reputation. Another option is to extend the coverage of <font size=-1>VAT</font> to zero-rated goods and (<font size=-1>EU</font> rules permitting) lower the rate. Dave, a London builder who helps customers avoid <font size=-1>VAT</font> by working for cash, points out that demand for this service has grown as the <font size=-1>VAT</font> rate has risen, whereas "the lower the rate, the less people will try not to pay it." Take note, Mr Clarke.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>Sterling efforts</h1>

THE pound rose this week to its highest level since 1994. Its trade-weighted exchange-rate (its exchange rate with the currencies of its trading partners, weighted by Britain's trade in each currency) is 6.1% up so far this year. It fell by a similar amount during 1995 (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>). Arguably, sterling's strength is now the only excuse that Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, has left for not raising interest rates--but it is not a good excuse.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recent economic data have confirmed that the economy is growing fast and inflationary pressures increasing. An interest-rate rise is needed. The underlying rate of inflation (which excludes mortgage-interest payments) edged up to an annual rate of 2.9% in September. The government's target is 2.5% or less. The jobless total fell by an unexpectedly large 35,600 in September, to 7.4% of the workforce. Vacancies soared by 16,600, the biggest monthly increase in 16 years. The labour market is as tight as in 1988, a fact reflected in rising wage inflation: underlying average earnings grew by 4% in the year to August.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But sterling's recent strength complicates matters. As the pound rises, the cost of imports falls. In the year to August 1995, when sterling's trade-weighted value was low, import prices rose by 11%. They fell by 0.8% in the 12 months to July of this year. Exchange-rate movements take time to work through. According to Martin Brookes, an economist at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, sterling's fall during 1995 added one percentage point to the inflation rate in the middle of this year. This year's stronger pound should ease inflationary pressures over the coming months.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although it may not do so by enough to overcome the building inflationary pressure elsewhere in the economy, might Mr Clarke use the possibility of a sterling boost to delay an interest-rate rise? It would be a gamble. The likeliest reason for sterling's recent rise is that the financial markets think that British interest rates will soon rise. If they do not, sterling might tumble again, adding to inflation instead of curbing it.<br>

<p><b>Welfare</b></p>
<h1>Fertile Field</h1>

PROMISING not to raise taxes may be a prerequisite to getting elected in the 1990s, but it imposes tiresome constraints on politicians once in office: they can borrow, break promises, or, worst of all, have no extra money to spend on pet projects. Or so it seemed. Now a fourth option is at hand, thanks to Frank Field, a Labour <font size=-1>MP</font> who chairs the House of Commons Select Committee on Social Security: impose new taxes, but call them something else.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Field unveiled this idea--which may not be as daft as it seems--in "How to Pay for the Future: Building a Stakeholders' Welfare", published on October 16th. He aims, commendably, to set out a blueprint for reforming the welfare state in ways that reduce incentives to milk the system and care better for the truly needy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His plans include funding only half of the National Health Service from general taxes. Thus, income tax could be cut--the lower rate from 20% to 5% and the basic rate from 24% to 19%. To pay for the other half of the <font size=-1>NHS</font>, Mr Field would raise the rate of national-insurance contributions by seven percentage points. People would stop paying into the state earnings-related pension scheme (<font size=-1>SERPS</font>), but would be compelled to pay 16% of their income into a non-state pension scheme. Existing <font size=-1>SERPS</font> pensions would still be paid, but the scheme would no longer be able to use fresh contributions to pay them. To raise the cash, Mr Field would issue bonds--ie, borrow it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It would be easy to dismiss this as fiscal casuistry, designed to obscure the true costs of welfare reform. But Mr Field is a serious thinker, much respected, who makes no bones about better welfare costing. He believes that the main reason people dislike paying tax is that they have no sense of ownership over the money once it disappears into the public purse. But call it national insurance or a compulsory pension contribution, and perhaps even give people individual welfare accounts, and they will see where their money goes and how they benefit from it, and so be willing to pay more. If Labour forms the next government, there is a fair chance that Tony Blair, a big fan of Mr Field's ideas, would see how this one works in practice. New Labour, new compulsory contributions?<br>

Perhaps the chance of peace in Northern Ireland boosted passenger and car traffic; but the booming Irish economy is also responsible. Freight and passenger volumes have both doubled over the past ten years (see <a href="br3.gif">map</a>).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Shipping firms have prospered from this swelling trade, and so too have port companies. But part of the ports' rising income has come from <font size=-1>EU</font> subsidies. Since 1989 it has poured more than &#163;100m into developing Irish Sea ports.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main effects of these subsidies, which are intended to improve trading links between countries at the edge of the <font size=-1>EU</font>, are to fatten the companies' profits and to distort competition. Some ports do not qualify for subsidies and have complained to the European Commission that they are facing unfair competition. And although subsidies are not supposed to be spent on ships, some of the subsidised ports also own ferry companies, and some ferry firms own ports.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On either side of the short crossing between Ulster and Scotland, about &#163;80m (including a &#163;53m <font size=-1>EU</font> subsidy) will have been spent at Belfast and Larne by 1999, and about &#163;20m (including a &#163;3m <font size=-1>EU</font> subsidy) at Stranraer and Cairnryan. Some of this is to help ferry firms build terminals for a new breed of high-speed freight and passenger-carrying ships.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stena, a Swedish shipping firm which reckons it carries 64% of Irish Sea passengers, has spent &#163;130m on two huge catamaran ferries each capable of doing 40 knots (74km per hour), twice the speed of conventional ferries. While passengers have poured on to the ships since they began sailings this year, rivals are less happy that Stena owns two of the British ports they sail from--Stranraer and Holyhead--and is getting a subsidy of about 15% towards the &#163;63m cost of terminals for the new ferries at both ports.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The European Commission became aware of these concerns when Stena and two of the other companies sailing from Stranraer and nearby Cairnryan, Sea Containers and <font size=-1>P&O</font>, all sought cash for new terminals. The commission and the Scottish Office gave up trying to work out which bits of the projects were for public benefit and which were for private gain, and simply shared the subsidy out at a lower rate than the companies asked for.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This approach, however, does not deal with the complaint by Sea Containers that Heysham, a Lancashire port it owns, is in an area which does not qualify for <font size=-1>EU</font> regional aid, while rivals like Mersey Docks & Harbour Company (<font size=-1>MDHC</font>) can get <font size=-1>EU</font> money. Since 1988, Sea Containers has spent &#163;10m on Heysham, roughly the same amount that Mersey Docks has received in <font size=-1>EU</font> subsidies.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fortunately for Sea Containers, however, it looks as though its fears that <font size=-1>MDHC</font> could get an unfair advantage may not materialise because of a battle for control of docks on the Mersey. On the Birkenhead side of the river, Merseyside Development Corporation has put together a scheme for a freight terminal with Forth Ports of Edinburgh. Forth Ports says it cannot go ahead without a subsidy. But its bid for <font size=-1>EU</font> money was blocked this year when <font size=-1>MDHC</font> announced it was going to build a &#163;16.5m freight terminal on the Liverpool side without any aid. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, so much Irish Sea freight is now being handled at Liverpool, that it looks as though neither terminal needs a subsidy to be profitable. The Port of Mostyn in North Wales seems to agree: it says its ambitious plan to build a freight terminal can go ahead without an <font size=-1>EU</font> grant.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?845683200,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="br7543.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1>The euro and the dollar: strut your stuff</h1>

<p><b>What will European economic and monetary union mean for the greenback? </b></p><br>
 <br>
THE indecent haste with which governments in the European Union  are pushing towards a single currency may be driven more by politics than by economics; but hordes of studies have at least tried to weigh the costs and benefits of European economic and monetary union (<font size=-1>EMU</font>) to member countries. However, economists have given little attention to what the euro will imply for the rest of the world. In particular, what will it mean for the dollar?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economists split into two camps on this question. One group suggests that replacing the rock-solid <font size=-1>D</font>-mark with a soggy euro will prompt investors to switch into dollars, lifting the greenback against the new European currency. Not only will the European Central Bank lack the inflation-fighting credentials of Germany's Bundesbank, runs the argument, but <font size=-1>EMU</font> will include countries that have fudged the budgetary criteria in the Maastricht treaty on monetary union.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another camp, however, argues that the creation of the euro as a rival to the dollar may encourage central banks and investors to diversify out of dollars, pushing the greenback down. The dollar's share of foreign-exchange reserves has already fallen to 64%, down from 80% in the early 1970s. There is scope for this to fall further: the dollar's weight in world reserves still far exceeds America's in the world economy: the ratio of American <font size=-1>GDP</font> to global output is just over one-fifth.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The effect of <font size=-1>EMU</font> on the dollar largely depends on how both European and non European central banks adjust their reserve holdings. Consider European central banks first. The total foreign-exchange reserves of <font size=-1>EU</font> members currently amount to over $370 billion, far more than those of either America or Japan (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). Add in their holdings of gold (valued at market prices) and the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s reserves are more than double Japan's and nearly quadruple America's. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Central banks hold reserves for two main reasons. First, as a cushion to meet temporary shortages in the foreign currency needed to make payments for trade or to pay interest; and second, as a means of supporting the value of their currencies if the need arises.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After <font size=-1>EMU</font> goes ahead, the need for participating countries to hold reserves will decline on both counts. They will no longer need such big war chests to defend their currencies' positions in Europe's exchange rate mechanism against speculative attacks. And after monetary union, member countries will need to pay for much less of their imports with foreign currency because trade between them will take place in euros. Thus they will need smaller foreign exchange reserves.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If (a very big if) all 15 <font size=-1>EU</font> countries eventually join a single currency, then over 60% of their current foreign trade would be reclassified as "domestic". However, <font size=-1>EMU</font> will also automatically reduce participating countries' reserves, because those that are currently held in other <font size=-1>EU</font> currencies will no longer count as foreign exchange. The <font size=-1>D</font>-marks held by the Bank of France, for instance, will be converted into euros. France's reserves will immediately drop, but there will be no implications for exchange rates.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, European central banks will still be left with excess dollars, which over time they are likely to dump. How so? Using rough estimates of the current composition of the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s foreign reserves, the average ratio of foreign-exchange reserves to imports in the 15 countries will almost double after <font size=-1>EMU</font>; the ratio of total reserves (including gold) will jump from 29% at present to 59%. Not only would that leave Europe's reserves much higher relative to its imports than the equivalent ratio in America, but a hefty 90% of those reserves will be in dollars. It seems almost certain, therefore, that European central banks will dump dollars, both to trim their reserves and to diversify into other currencies, such as the yen and Swiss franc. This will tend to weaken the dollar against the euro.<br>
</p><p><b> <b>Competition for Mr Universe</b></b><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In practice, not all 15 countries will participate in <font size=-1>EMU</font> from day one, so the overhang of dollars will be smaller. Economists at J.P. Morgan, an American bank, assume more realistically that in January 1999 just eight countries join <font size=-1>EMU</font> (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands). With this smaller membership, "foreign" imports do not drop by as much. Even so, reckons the bank, this will leave them with excess dollar reserves of perhaps $70 billion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What about central banks outside the <font size=-1>EU</font>? The creation of a single European currency should boost the euro's attractiveness as an international currency for invoicing trade, as a tool of intervention and as an investment. If the European central bank can establish its inflation-fighting credibility, then for the first time since the end of the second world war the dollar could face a competitor of equal muscle. The <font size=-1>EU</font>'s total <font size=-1>GDP</font> is bigger than America's, and monetary union will help make European capital markets broader and more liquid, and hence more of a match for America's.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On simple diversification grounds, there is a strong case for central banks to hold more euros. For example, Japan's foreign-exchange reserves are thought to be almost entirely composed of dollars, and thus in the long term switching some into euros might seem prudent. As the role of the euro increases, some countries, especially in Eastern Europe, may choose to peg their currencies to it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The euro is also likely to play a bigger role in the invoicing of trade than the current sum of its constituent parts. This is because the currencies of big exporters tend to be used disproportionately in invoicing. For example, almost 50% of world trade is invoiced in dollars, far above America's 13% share of world exports. J.P. Morgan calculates that after <font size=-1>EMU</font> 17% of world exports will originate from the eight European core countries. If, as the bank assumes, the ratio of exports to invoicing is the same for the euro as for the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark, then this implies that 25% of world exports might be invoiced in euros, up from 16% today. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Adding together the three sources of increased demand for euros--European central banks' excess reserves of dollars, diversification by non-European central banks and trade invoicing--J.P. Morgan estimates that the demand for the new European currency could increase (and hence that for dollars will fall) by $600 billion over the next decade.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So contrary to the current popular view of the euro as a "weak" currency, <font size=-1>EMU</font> may actually create a rather strong one. This could be awkward for Europe: it would exacerbate the existing problems of European competitiveness, and so depress output and jobs. Moreover, if the new European central bank initially pursues a super-tight monetary policy to establish its credibility, governments will be forced to offset this with laxer fiscal policy. The consequent policy mix--tight money and loose fiscal policy--will be an exact replay of America's policies in the first half of the 1980s, which caused the dollar to soar. It would be a bitter irony if greater currency stability within Europe resulted in a bigger shift against currencies outside it.<br>

<h1>TECHNOLOGY BRIEF</h1>

<h2>Roboflops</h2>
<p><b>In the final brief of our series asking why some technologies disappoint, we look at the general-purpose robot, which was supposed to be cooking us dinner by now</b></p><br>
THE 1970s have a lot to answer for, but often overlooked amid bell bottoms and disco music is the notion of the do-it-all robot. The decade was a heady time for robotics: a Russian robotic rover wheeled about on the moon, while <font size=-1>R2-D2</font> and <font size=-1>C-3PO</font> nattered charmingly to each other. Robots assembled cars in Detroit and motorcycles in Japan. Industrialists predicted a multi-billion dollar robotics industry within a decade. And the home of 2000, <i>Popular Mechanics</i> confidently predicted, would have a robot butler to go with its personal helicopter.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alas, most of us still sweep our own floors, serve ourselves drinks and cook our own meals. The only wheeled beasts that roam most of our offices are vacuum cleaners. Even in factories, most of the machines that stamp, bend, package and sort are specially built for the job, which means that they are little closer to the vision of an autonomous, programmable robot than, say, a wind-up clock. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where is Robby the Robot, not to speak of the rebellious 'droids of "Westworld"? Still far in the future. The past 20 years or so have been frustrating ones for the robotics business, which has been dogged by technical glitches and sluggish demand for what products it has delivered.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True, the American robotics industry, which almost collapsed in the 1980s, is undergoing something of a renaissance-- some 70,000 robots are now at work in American factories, according to the Robotics Industry Association. But that is still a modest figure. The world leader, Japan, has nearly 400,000 in its factories, though they are still mainly in the automotive and electronics industries, where they started out 30 years ago. Even in Japan, factory workers still outnumber robots by 50 to 1; in America it is 300 to 1.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason for this is that, contrary to the hype that surrounded their creation, robots are rarely a good replacement for humans. Making a machine that, say, moves a bit like a human arm is relatively easy. Teaching it what to do with its mobility is a lot tougher. The hard part of being human is not bending joints, but seeing, thinking and sensing--all things that machines still do poorly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider a modestly skilled factory worker whose job is to slip rubber rings around a rod. First he must pick up a ring from a tray of them. Easy enough for the worker, but a nightmare for a robot. The problem is identifying the ring, which may be at any angle, amongst a mass of other rings all of the same colour.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Throw enough computing power at this image-recognition problem and a robot can crack it, but more slowly than a person. So the factory may be forced to present the rings in a more ordered way: carefully stacked, for instance, or neatly lined up on a tape. This is expensive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once the robot identifies the ring and its orientation, picking it up is easy. But putting it on the rod is not. The worker might place the ring on the end of the rod, then squeeze it and rock it until it slips on. For him, this is simple. But from a robot's perspective, he is engaging in some state-of-the-art "force control" and sensing. Moreover, the worker benefits from a very responsive "feedback loop"--ie, he can feel how hard he is pushing and adjust his squeeze so as not to push too much.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The lack of a sense of touch is a notorious robotic failing. When experts go to a trade fair and see a robot proving its dexterity by washing windows without breaking them, they snicker, knowing that the flexibility of the sponge gives it a big margin of error; the same robot could not put a cream puff in a box without crushing it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are signs of improvement here. The faster a robot's motors and computer are, the faster it can respond to its artificial sense of touch, and the less likely it is to damage what it is touching. But this is still the stuff of doctoral theses, not of household products. Nappy changing will remain a human chore for a while longer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even when a factory robot can perform a task more efficiently than a person, the job of programming it and setting up its workplace can be more trouble than it is worth. The advantage of a general-purpose robot arm is that it can be programmed to do many jobs. The disadvantage is that the programming tends to be a job for highly paid <font size=-1>P</font>h<font size=-1>D</font> engineers, not technicians more used to the simple automation found on most factory floors. Commotion Systems, a new Californian firm, is developing easier ways to program robots using pre-designed software modules. For now, however, the chore of "training" robots is still one of the main reasons that they are not used more.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Outside the factory, a robot's failings are even more glaring. Seen through a machine's eyes, the real world is a baffling jumble of obstacles and unrecognisable shapes. HelpMate Robotics, a Connecticut company founded by Joe Engelberger (who is widely considered to be the founder of modern industrial robotics), makes a robot that can carry drugs, <font size=-1>X</font>-ray films and the like from one part of a hospital to another. But to navigate around even this ordered environment, the machine needs infra-red and ultrasonic sensors, a video camera, gyroscopes and an electronic map. Even then it requires a hospital with automatic doors, and sometimes needs to call for help. Stairs are out of the question, although the robot can be taught to operate a modified lift. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Engelberger's firm thinks that a home robot--not a tin domestic for the average family, but an aide for the elderly and disabled--is now within reach. Food might have to be bar-coded with the refrigerator shelf that it belongs on and its microwaving instructions, but a robot-cooked meal, delivered to the bedside, is already possible. A little dusting--don't forget to clear the shelves first--is probably on the cards, too, along with some light vacuuming and other domestic chores, so long as they are confined to a single floor.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But consider other, less routine jobs and HelpMate's hurdles become clearer. "Fetch my glasses from the bedroom" is a simple request, but obeying it summons up three of the trickiest problems in computer science: voice recognition (which allows the robot to translate sounds into words), natural-language processing (which enables it to translate words into commands) and image recognition. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As with many troubled products, the problem with robotics is not so much with the technology itself, but with the expectations that it has raised. Seduced by the humanoid helpers of Hollywood, people tend to think of robots for typical human jobs, which are often the ones for which they are worst suited.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John Tenney, one of the founders of Commotion Systems, recalls a visit to one spark plug factory, which was considering installing a few robots: "We walked past rows of people doing brain-numbing work, until we got to the part of the factory doing the most complex assembly. They wanted robots there because they had a hard time finding skilled workers. But if it's hard for people, it's even harder for robots. You've got to pick the low-hanging fruit."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This does not mean that robots will continue to disappoint, only that they are still a long way from becoming general-purpose helpers, much less anyone's plastic pal. Rosie, the Jetson's friendly house-cleaning robot, is likely to remain Rosie the plain old Riveter for a while yet.<br>

<table border=6><tr><td><h1>New adventures in hi-fi</h1>

OASIS, the world's newest rock mega group, may be paying homage to the Beatles by putting together an album in the fab four's Abbey Road studio, but the practical business of recording music in the 1990s bears little relation to what went on 30 years ago. The pop hits of the 1960s were mostly created using four track tape recorders. Now, 24-track equipment is the norm, tape has given way to the compact disc, and the combination of synthesisers, optical fibre and the Internet has made it possible to make, record and distribute music at a far higher quality and far lower cost than once seemed likely.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Good Vibrations"*, a book by Mark Cunningham, who is himself a "song writer, musician and producer", describes the effect of technological change on recorded music since the invention of multi-tracking in 1949. His account is sometimes fascinating, sometimes impenetrably technophile. It is interesting that London's top recording studio can accommodate a symphony orchestra and a heavy-rock band in adjacent rooms with no leakage of sound from one to the other; very much less so that one room contains a "72-channel <font size=-1>SSL</font> 8000 <font size=-1>G</font>-plus console incorporating Ultimation and Total Recall automated fader systems".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Technology has transformed how established musicians ply their trade. Sting is one of a growing number who work from home, recording tunes in his dining room and mixing them in what was once a cowshed. Frank Sinatra, in America, recorded duets by telephone with, among others, Bono, who was in Ireland--a technological advance that Oasis's warring Gallagher brothers might find handy should they find Abbey Road's quarters too close for comfort. George Michael now samples his own voice for backing vocals, with himself on synthesiser for instrumentals, dispensing (mostly) with session musicians. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But not everyone is so keen. A Luddite tendency has emerged among mainstream musicians, a sort of "campaign for real rock music": The claim is that new technology kills the raw emotion necessary for <i>bona fide</i> rock'n'roll. Paul Weller, Britain's top male vocalist of the moment, boasts of "playing real instruments" and avoiding "all that digital bollocks". Seeking the "kind of space and environment" once enjoyed by the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, an American rocker, Lenny Kravitz, recently recorded in a 17th-century chateau near Paris, while Les N&eacute;gresses Vertes used a deserted casino.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But technology's greatest boon will be for the thousands of aspiring rock-stars who "for a once-only investment of just a few thousand pounds  make better sounding records than could be produced in a top studio 15 years ago." With the Internet promising to become a viable means of distributing and popularising music, the writing may be on the wall for the big companies which dominate the music business by signing up hopefuls on long contracts and controlling the dissemination of their work.<br>

He is neither great intellect, nor rousing orator. He can be impetuous and sometimes quick of temper. He has failed, twice, to make marriage work. Yet few can doubt that much of the credit for the negotiated collapse of apartheid, and for the building of a new, non-triumphalist nation through racial reconciliation, belongs to Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. In this sense he is far from ordinary, and it is understandable that he should be so revered. The trouble for South Africans now, as they peer anxiously around them at their gathering problems and further, into a post-Mandela future, is that the more both they and the outside world cling to the saint-like figure, the harder they will find it when he goes.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That day is not yet at hand. God willing, Mr Mandela will remain in office till 1999, when he will be 80 and deserving, surely, of a peaceful retirement. But the aura of sainthood is now deflecting attention from some of South Africa's problems (see <a href="sf0760.html">pages</a>). It has also placed Mr Mandela out of reach of criticism, though he is not infallible. He has stood by incompetent lieutenants out of stubborn loyalty, while dismissing another (not incompetent) merely for challenging his authority. He has taken cash for his party from a casino tycoon, who had previously admitted paying the head of an apartheid homeland to secure gambling rights. In any event, fallible or not, Mr Mandela increasingly leaves the day-to-day running of government to others. He must take responsibility for their mistakes.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fortunately, his detachment is not total. He is fit and, as long as he is in ultimate charge, South Africans can be pretty confident that things will not go badly wrong: he has the authority to enforce his will, and on the large issues his will is dependably rooted in honesty and reconciliation. The immediate worry is that a number of apparently minor problems will get worse, and that in time they will add up to something serious. The longer-term worry is that, when the saint departs, he will be followed by someone much less saintlike.<br><b> <br></p><p><b>No easy walk</b></b><br>For those inclined to take a dark view, there is plenty to be concerned about. South Africa is a poor country, with a history of division and violence. Millions of people live in abject poverty with little immediate prospect of a better life: one in three is without even an informal job. Ethnic strains persist. Robbery, murder and every other kind of crime are rife.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To make matters worse, political stability is uncertain. Two of the main parties represent racial groups. The National Party, anchored in Afrikanerdom, has won some mixed-race adherents but little black support. The Inkatha Freedom Party speaks mainly for rural Zulus. They, and the other opposition parties, are hugely outnumbered in Parliament by Mr Mandela's African National Congress, which took 63% of the vote in the 1994 general election. It is hard to envisage the <font size=-1>ANC</font> out of government. Electorally, it has no need to listen to its critics. And it may already be showing, albeit in small ways, the arrogance of unfettered power: an apparent readiness here to tolerate incompetence, an apparent reluctance there to pursue corruption.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Africa, this scene is familiar. It usually turns to intolerance and impoverishment, sometimes to tyranny and bloodshed. Is this to be South Africa's fate?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It need not be. But South Africa's ability to get beyond its first few years of post-apartheid transition, and thereby to secure its post-Mandela democracy, will be made infinitely harder if action is not taken now to strengthen both the spirit of reconciliation and the institutions that must underpin it.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One such is the constitution. The <font size=-1>ANC</font> takes this document seriously; the effort that has already gone into it--and in many ways it is a model of protected freedoms--suggests that this is not a piece of paper to be swept aside lightly, as so many others have been in Africa. That should be reassuring for all minorities, as should the tradition of an independent judiciary. But the new constitution, due to be adopted by Parliament on October 11th, is not accepted by all parties, as, ideally, it should be. In particular, Inkatha wants stronger powers for the provinces and the chiefs. Its readiness to live with the new constitution may have to be bought either by promising to redraft the provincial constitution of KwaZulu-Natal, where the party's power is concentrated, or even by offering a deputy presidency (one of the two is vacant) to Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inkatha's Zulus are one group who need to be accommodated if democracy is to be consolidated. The whites are another. Not all blacks are as forgiving as Mr Mandela. Some still seek vengeance for the crimes of apartheid, others merely want to press harder for black advancement. And no wonder: much power, especially in business, the civil service, the press and the universities, remains in white hands. It needs to be spread. Mr Mandela knows that that cannot happen instantly if peace and prosperity are to be secured. Others in the <font size=-1>ANC</font> need to make it plain that they realise this too.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That applies in particular to Thabo Mbeki, deputy president and Mr Mandela's anointed heir. He is a shrewd politician, and has shown himself ready to compromise with the <font size=-1>ANC</font>'s Zulu critics. But he lacks Mr Mandela's charm and personality, as well as, inevitably, his self-assurance and moral authority. The temptation for him will be to pick a path that does less to calm white fears and more to meet black demands than the route his boss has taken. That would be full of dangers. Plenty of old ghosts still haunt South Africa, as has been shown by the trial of Magnus Malan, a former defence minister, whose trial on charges of murder in the name of apartheid was due to end this week. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whites should, however, be clear that their privileges cannot endure. The aim must be a fair society for all, created by sweeping away the legacies of apartheid as fast as is compatible with nurturing stability and economic growth. Mr Mandela has given the new South Africa a famous start. Honour him for that. Criticise him, if need be, for his errors. But remember, above all, that what he has put in place must be fortified and extended by others if it is not soon to fall apart.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?845078400,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="sf0760.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

The Israeli government wants to renegotiate the accord made by its predecessor. The Palestinians say no. The Americans say keep on talking. Ezer Weizman, Israel's president, put pressure on his own government by inviting Yasser Arafat to lunch and accepting an invitation from Egypt's Hosni Mubarak to visit Cairo.</p><p>Islamist terrorists killed 34 people in southern <b>Algeria</b>, many of them bus passengers who had their throats slit. </p><p>Pro-government candidates did better in <b>Kuwait</b>'s (all male) election than the Islamists who had been the largest single block in the out-going parliament. </p><b>Zaire</b> issued a one-week ultimatum for 200,000 ethnic Tutsis to leave the country. </p><p> <h2>Russia and NATO</h2>Alexander Lebed, Russia's presidential security adviser, who has blown hot and cold on <font size=-1>NATO</font >'s proposed <b>eastward enlargement</b>, said that the organisation should make a pact with Russia before expanding. In any case, Russia should not, he said in Brussels this week, become "hysterical". Back home, Mr Lebed's relations with President Boris Yeltsin, appeared to be worsening.</p><p>After two years of relative peace in <b>Northern Ireland</b>,the Irish Republican Army exploded two big car-bombs in the province's British army headquarters, injuring more than 30 people. John Bruton, the Irish prime minister, accused the < font size=-1>IRA</font> of using the tactics of Nazis. Loyalist politicians made pleas to loyalist terrorists not to retaliate.</p><p><b>Hans Tietmeyer, </b>head of Germany's Bundesbank, criticised would-be members of Europe's proposed currency union for seeking to meet the entry criteria "through a breathless short-term effort with one-off results quickly cobbled together". </p><p><b>Corsican separatists</b>, set off a bomb outside the office of the mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp&eacute;, whose main job is prime minister of France.</p><p><b>Turkey's </b>Islamic prime minister, Necmettin Erbakan, was embarrassed on a visit to Libya when its leader, Muammar Qaddafi, declared that the Kurds deserved a country of their own. Turkish opposition politicians leapt on the affair. </p><p>Belgium's prime minister since 1992, <b>Jean-Luc Dehaene</b>, said he would not try to keep his job when his coalition government's term ends in 1999.</p><p>A drugs-monitoring centre set up by the European Commission two years ago said that between 500,000 and 1m citizens of the <font size=-1>EU</font> take <b>heroin</b>. Up to a fifth of the Union's people aged 18-35 are thought to have taken cannabis.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%><p>Nordic governments are trying to quell a long-running <b>motorbike-gang war</b> after an anti-tank missile was fired into a club in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, killing two people. Sporadic gang violence has also occurred in Sweden, Norway and Finland.</p><p><h2>Vote-catching</p></h2>The main candidates for the American <b>presidency </b>had their first debate, in Connecticut, and it was generally declared a draw. It did no harm to Bill Clinton and did not, as Republicans hoped, ignite the candidacy of Bob Dole. Their running mates, Al Gore (the Democrat) and Jack Kemp (the Republican), held a soporific debate in Florida. Mr Gore won.<p><b>Argentina</b>'s two leading Peronist hopefuls for the 1999 presidential candidacy cast doubt on President Carlos Menem's planned reform of labour law. As unions talked of a strike, he stood firm, angering them further with a decree to let workers choose among rival union-run health plans. These bring the unions clout--and siphoned-off cash, say critics. Next step: private sector competition.</p><p><b>Colombia'sarmy </b>and police said they had captured guerrilla documents outlining plans for widespread attacks in the capital, Bogota.</p><p><b>Brazil'sconstitution </b>bars President Fernando Henrique Cardoso from re-election in 1998. Could it be amended? Haggling over the mayoral run-off in Sao Paulo made it likelier. Their own man having come third in the first round, some pro-Cardoso politicians will back Celso Pitta, the front-runner favoured by the outgoing mayor, Paulo Maluf. He and his party, with many members in Congress, have been hostile to re-election, but are now softening.</p><p><h2>Against Bhutto</p></h2><p>Pressure grew on <b>Benazir Bhutto </b>to step down as Pakistan's prime minister when 40,000 people joined an opposition march in Lahore. The marchers accused the government of corruption. Police broke up the march after a government building was stoned.</p><p>Afghanistan's victorious <b>Taliban fighters </b>pressed northwards, aiming to gain complete control of the country, but met stiff resistance from forces loyal to the ousted government.</p><p><b>Japan's birthrate </b>fell to 1.4 babies per woman last year. If sustained, Japan's population will fall to 55m in 2100, from 125m today, according to a government projection.</p><p>Yao Wenyuan, the sole surviving member of China's <b>Gang of Four</b>,<b> </b>was released from jail after 20 years.

The complex plan would almost halve the company's annual debt-servicing costs, to about &#163;430m, partly through a &#163;1 billion debt-for equity swap that would give its 225 creditor banks a 45.5% stake in the Chunnel operator. The company's bankers and its shareholders must approve the scheme.</p><p>The <b>Dow </b>reached 6,000 in intra-day trading before falling again, pulling other bourses down with it. But Frankfurt hit another high.</p><p><h2>Change of cast</p></h2><b>Sony</b> had another go at tackling the problems of its troubled Sony Pictures Entertainment unit. The Japanese electronics giant named a new team to run its Hollywood business, led by John Calley, currently president of United Artists. To ease transpacific communications, Sony is appointing a Japanese executive to the team for the first time.<p>South Korea's <b>Hyundai Electronics</b> is setting up a &#163;1 billion ($1.6 billion) semiconductor plant in Scotland and creating 1,000 jobs initially, with the prospect of a further &#163;1.4 billion investment in a second chip plant.

A ratio that measures the value of orders booked by North American chip makers to the value of their shipments reached its highest level this year in September.</p><p><h2>Taking credit</p></h2>Britain scrapped tax credits linked to <b>share buybacks </b> and special dividends just in time to scupper a plan by <b>Reuters</b>, a British information and media giant, to repurchase &#163;613m ($959m) of its shares. The government believes closing this tax loophole will add &#163;80m to its coffers in this fiscal year, rising to &#163;400m a year by 1998-99.<p>The <b>Nobel prize for economics</b> was shared by James Mirrlees of Cambridge University, a Scot, and William Vickrey of Columbia University in New York, who becomes the first Canadian to win the prize.

<html><head><title> How wrong is it going?</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><table width=100%><tr><td align=left valign=top><img src="sf.gif" alt="Special feature"><td align=right valign=top><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" alt="The Economist" border=0></td></tr></table><h1>How wrong is it going? </h1><p><b>South Africa's breezy post-apartheid self-confidence has crumbled</b></p>JUST over a year ago, the world was marvelling at South Africans' ability to bury the past, and reach across the racial divide to share the triumph of the rugby world cup. A jubilant President Nelson Mandela, dressed in the once-detested Springbok rugby jersey, seemed to embody the country's new, non-racial spirit. A year later the Springboks have now lost to New Zealand for the first time on South African soil--and the waving of the national flag of the apartheid era at the matches has revived the country's introspective fears over unhealed racial wounds. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is sporting disenchantment the symbol of a wider malaise, and a worrying future? Perhaps so. Take one fortnight in August. Cape Town vigilantes burned a drug baron to death, in full view of television cameras and the police; the justice minister, Dullah Omar, had to move his family out of their Cape Town house in fear of their lives; the German company-secretary of <font size=-1>AEG </font>in South Africa was shot dead in his front drive in Johannesburg by car-hijackers; and the president of the Constitutional Court, Arthur Chaskalson, was held at gun point in his house.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lawlessness is not the only cause of the spreading gloom. Since mid-February, the currency, the  rand, has collapsed (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</A>), losing 23% of its value against the dollar and falling below the level at which it might have been expected to settle after the overvaluation caused by the strong inflows of capital in 1994 and 1995. Had the rand stabilised, regardless of level, its depreciation might have been regarded as an opportunity to boost exports. Instead, the downward slide fosters the worry that the world's currency markets are giving a vote of no confidence in South African economic stability. The finance minister, Trevor Manuel, thanks to inexperience, and the central bank, thanks to low foreign reserves, were able to stem the fall only briefly.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To make matters worse, the African National Congress-led government seems to stumble from one blunder into another. In May, for example, a deputy minister, Bantu Holomisa, alleged that a cabinet member had received a bribe in apartheid days, and that the <font size=-1>ANC</font> had accepted 2m rand (at the time some $600,000) from a casino magnate in return for favours. "Blatant lies," declared the <font size=-1>ANC</font>, only to hear Mr Mandela later admit to having taken the money without telling anyone--though not in exchange for granting any favours. For his pains, the <font size=-1>ANC</font> expelled Mr Holomisa.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Do these dramas amount to a blip, the spasm of a country undergoing a wrenching transition from the tight controls of apartheid to a society of freedom and democracy? Or do they represent the first skid down the slippery African slope, one which has oiled the failure of so many other countries to build a prosperous democracy after winning political liberation? The questions are no longer the products of the old worries--the threat from the white far-right; the risk of Zulu-inspired secession; the danger of reckless public-spending. Certainly those worries remain, but no longer at the forefront of people's concerns. Today, three new anxieties stand out: lawlessness, unemployment and political accountability.<br></p><p><b>New--and uncomfortable</b><br>Behind smoked glass windows, an alien phenomenon has arrived in South Africa's cities: the sex shop. American accessories nestle alongside local ones "made in sizes for the African man". <i>Hustler</i> and <i>Penthouse </i>are on newsagents' shelves. There is even a soft-porn magazine, <i>Loslyf </i>(loose body), in Afrikaans. The end of apartheid ended a system of racial injustice--and lifted the repressive lid of Calvinist culture.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For many whites, the lifting of the old social controls is disconcerting. A decade ago, whites dressed up to go to the theatre or dine out in central Johannesburg; blacks stepped off the pavement for them, and conveniently disappeared home at night. Today, Johannesburg has become a heaving African city, its pavements crowded with hawkers of boiled sweets and witch medicine, from which white businessmen scurry home at the end of the day. Once, both Africa and decadent America could be kept at bay; now the fantasy is over.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As in Russia, the collapse of the authoritarian state in South Africa has unleashed social and political freedoms--and with them controversy and criminality. The reasons are the same: the end of the old order dramatically increased the number of new commercial opportunities but did so at a time when the criminal-justice system (designed for the old regime) had changed comparatively little. Organised crime has filled the resulting gap.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The police at present have records on 481 crime syndicates operating in the country. The opening of post-apartheid South Africa has turned the country into a trans-shipment point for drugs from Latin America and Asia, heading for the European market. Johannesburg's sophisticated banks have become a target for money-launderers. Much of the car-hijacking in Johannesburg is linked to syndicates that run luxury cars north to nearby countries such as Zambia.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not crime <i>per se </i>that grips the imagination but its random and violent nature. The murdered are no longer mainly the victims of political revenge, nor are they mafia-linked. Instead, violent crime touches all. Fully 58% of whites and 41% of blacks named crime as the country's most serious problem in a recent study sponsored by Nedcor, a South African bank. South Africa's murder rate is perhaps six times that of America, maybe five times that of Russia. Last year 19,000 people were murdered--52 each day. This was 4% more than in 1994. Car-hijackings around Johannesburg jumped 12%, to 8,524.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The study also exposed the weakness of the criminal-justice system. For every 450 crimes reported, there are 100 prosecutions, 77 convictions and a mere 36 imprisonments. Such is popular dissatisfaction that when the vigilante gangs burned to death the Cape Town drug baron, they won widespread public support. "I and several friends watched with undisguised admiration," wrote Thami Mazwai, a black writer. Weeks later, an opinion poll suggested 71% of South Africans want to bring back hanging, which was abolished only last year.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By itself, crime probably does not deter foreign investors much: if there is money to be made or a market to conquer, businessmen will go there. But crime puts off tourists. The number of foreign tourists visiting South Africa between January and May grew by only 2% over the same period in 1995, compared with year-on-year growth of 38% over the same period the previous year. Meanwhile, lawlessness feeds the feeling that the government is not in control.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What feeds it still more is the impression that some members of the police are in league with the criminals. In August, the commander of the vehicle-theft branch in Rustenburg, 100 kilometres from Johannesburg, and three other policemen, were charged in court with--guess what?--running a vehicle-theft syndicate. The problem compounds itself: poorly paid policemen who accept bribes to drop charges; excessive bureaucracy; public mistrust; ineffective prosecutors; loose conditions for bail; and overcrowded prisons. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of these problems, however, would be insurmountable if the government were determined enough to grasp them. Part of the solution must be political will. It is a measure of some progress that, for the first time, President Mandela has admitted that crime is "out of control", sending 500 soldiers to help the police in Johannesburg. The government has finally worked out a crime-prevention plan. Some road-blocks are said to have been spotted around Johannesburg. One police station, in the suburb of Rosebank, has even recruited street beggars as informal, unpaid assistants and issued them with fluorescent vests and identity cards. Another has obtained four horses so that policemen can peer over residents' high-perimeter walls.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To improve efficiency, McKinsey & Co, a consulting firm, has helped nine police stations reorganise themselves. At one, it found that only 7% of policemen spent time on "pro-active" (ie, preventive) policing; at another, less than half the vehicles were in service at any time. Reorganisation has now freed twice as many policemen to go on the beat at one station; at another, it cut the backlog in clearing dockets by 10% in the first month. By next May, McKinsey will be working in 100 stations across the country. Perhaps, therefore, South Africa's greatest enemy in its war against crime is its belief that little can be done about it.<br></p><p><b><b>Finding work . . . </b><br></b>Dawn, outside a Johannesburg metal-casting factory in January this year. Two thousand black South Africans are queuing in the street outside, drawn by rumours that the factory has 200 job vacancies. In the scuffle for a place in line, gunshots are fired. Eight people are shot dead. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of all the menaces to South Africa's stability, the most troubling is jobless growth. After a long recession, which ended in 1993, the economy is now growing robustly. Last year, <font size=-1>GDP</font> grew by 3.5% (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</A>); but the number of recorded jobs inched up by just 0.6%. In the formal (ie, taxpaying) sector, the unemployment rate is 20%; add those who scratch a living informally by, say, hawking brushes or weeding gardens, and perhaps a third of the labour force is without work. Unlike in West Africa, where land has not historically been parcelled into a few large commercial farms, the jobless city-dwellers cannot fall back into the safety net of the family's subsistence-farming.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;South Africa's unresponsive labour market is not the result only of strong unions and labour protection. True, there are government-imposed non-wage costs, and it is costly to hire and difficult to fire. So companies look for capital-intensive, not labour-intensive, ways to grow. But the market's stickiness is also a product of apartheid's inferior education for blacks: unskilled black labour is cheap but unproductive; skilled labour is scarce, but costly. In addition, high tariff walls have sheltered manufacturers from competition, allowing skilled wages to rise and isolating South Africa's hierarchical companies from modern management practices. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result is a conundrum the government has yet to resolve. How can it maintain the rights that unions won for workers operating in miserable apartheid conditions, without jeopardising the economy's ability to create new jobs?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the short-run, joblessness will probably worsen. The government promises to bring its budget deficit down from 5.4% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>in 1995-1996, to 4% by 1998. This will mean less spending and the loss of jobs in state firms and organisations. Meanwhile, as import tariffs are loweredto meet international obligations, firms will have to lay off workers to compete.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even foreign investment will not help much. In the two years to May 1996, foreign direct investment amounted to 18 billion rand, according to BusinessMap, a research group. But most has been to buy stakes in existing South African companies, often by firms which divested because of international sanctions in the apartheid days; they are not in greenfield investments creating immediate jobs.</p><p><b> . . . will not be easy</b><br>South Africa is a country of 41m people, fringed by African poverty, with a rigid labour market, an oligopolistic economy and high real interest-rates. Even gold output is declining, as mining the reserves becomes more difficult. Fast growth will not be easy.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet jobless growth is growth nonetheless. Two huge capital projects, to make stainless steel and smelt aluminium, are up and running; exports of coal and high-tech defence products are booming; luxury hotels are rising across the skyline in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Real domestic fixed investment grew by a year-on-year 5.5% in the second quarter of 1996. Privatisation could attract foreign cash and expertise, if the government would only get a move on.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, South Africans are, on average, no longer getting poorer. With annual population growth of just 2.1% and <font size=-1>GDP</font> growing by around 3.5%, <font size=-1>GDP</font> per head is on the rise. Indeed, the economy is in its best shape for years. The government inherited an economy emerging from over three years of recession and 20 years of double digit inflation. Now it has published a fiscally prudent macro-economic policy. Inflation, thoughrising, was still only 7.1% in July. The widening current-account deficit, of 2.3 billion rand in the first quarter of 1996, amounted to just 2% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>; Mexico's, before its currency crisis, was 7%.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike the rest of Africa, South Africa also has a diversified and sophisticated private sector and several home grown multinationals--with enough assets at home to keep a watchful eye on economic housekeeping. The Brenthurst group, an elite from South Africa's old business families, regularly visits Mr Mandela's home.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For all the fears that resentful <font size=-1>ANC</font> socialists would confiscate wealth, the new breed shares the same capitalist aspirations as the old. Though black incomes are barely a sixth of white ones, a black elite is rising on the back of government jobs and the promotion of black business. It is moving into the leafy avenues of formerly white Johannesburg suburbs, such as Kelvin and Sandton, and adopting the outward symbols of prestige--the <font size=-1>BMW</font>, swimming pool, golf handicap and black maid--that so mesmerise status-conscious whites. Most intriguing of all, the unions are becoming capitalists: dozens of them have become part-owners of a stake in Johnnic, an industrial holding company, sold by Anglo American in August to a black consortium.<br></p><p><b>Future imperfect</b><br>When South Africans are at their most despondent, they mutter about Zimbabwe. "Look north," says one black investment banker when asked to imagine South Africa in five years' time, "and temper it a bit." Without the unifying figure and moral integrity of Mr Mandela, who retires in 1999, what is to stop South Africa slipping the way of Zimbabwe: a supposed multiparty democracy ruled as a de facto one-party state, with a government that rides in limousines, periodically clamps down on the press, and blames white ownership of the economy for the country's ills? <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>ANC</font>, which won a handsome 63% of the vote at the 1994 general election, looks unassailable. Though their leaders deny it, political opposition remains ethnically divided: the Inkatha Freedom Party represents chiefly Zulus, the Democratic Party chiefly whites, the Freedom Front chiefly Afrikaners. Even the National Party--once all-white, now vigorously courting the non-white vote--won only 20% of the 1994 vote. At national level, disgruntlement with the <font size=-1>ANC</font> is more likely to translate into apathy than electoral protest. The worry is that the political elite, unburdened by electoral worries, will grow increasingly distant from those who elected it, and arrogant in its use of power.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Problems are appearing. In June, the public protector investigated how the health department had spent 14m rand ($3.2m) on a single musical play designed to promote "<font size=-1>AIDS-</font>awareness". He found that the health minister, Nkosazana Zuma, had misled parliament over the matter. She did not resign. Dr Zuma then declared that a business donor would foot part of the bill--but would not name him. When pressure grew to do so, she announced that the mystery donor had withdrawn his offer. In an uncharacteristic racial swipe, President Mandela accused the "white-owned media" of victimising her.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>ANC</font> might claim in its own defence that it is victim to its own determination to prise open the once-murky workings of government. The National Party, in apartheid days, scarcely felt accountable to anybody; patronage and corruption went on behind impenetrable walls. But the <font size=-1>ANC</font> can hardly be judged by the miserable standards of those who went before when it has declared itself the champion of accountable and open government. Contempt for parliament, suspicion of the press, intolerance of criticism: there is enough to breed disquiet. What will check South Africa's rulers from heading Zimbabwe's way?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the shortrun, the answer probably lies not in opposition parties (though noisy minority parties--and a resentful black constituency, fed up with President Mandela's failure to punish whites--could one day be mobilised from the left). <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead, the safeguard may rest in the new constitution, which protects individuals from abuse by government. Or in the fact that two of the nine provinces--the Western Cape (run by the National Party) and KwaZulu-Natal (run by Inkatha)--are not controlled by the <font size=-1>ANC</font>. Or in the informal organisations--the women's groups, church groups, street committees, parents' associations-- that rail against the government on behalf of ordinary South Africans. Lastly, it rests in a vigilant press, learning fast how to act as a check on government, and in a political leadership which worries about what outsiders think.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"President Mandela's visit to London in July represented the end of a chapter," says Jack Spence, director of studies at Britain's Royal Institute of International Affairs. There was something of a rite of passage in the extraordinary welcome given to him by the British state, a big congratulatory hug for coming of age, and a farewell wave of good luck as South Africa begins a new era. Now, however, the country has to face reality--and start delivering. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;South Africa suffers from schizophrenic foreign perceptions and turbulent domestic mood-swings. The euphoria of the political transition in 1994 inflated expectations. South Africa was hailed as the continent's saviour, a tiger economy for Africa. As sentiment now swings the other way, South Africa is being smudged with the brush of African failure. "If South Africa, with all its problems and opportunities, were geographically located in Latin America or Asia, observers would be far more optimistic about its prospects," says Robert Schrire, of the University of Cape Town. "However unfair and inaccurate, South Africa is viewed through the prisms of the African experiences."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asia-like economic success, or stagnant African disappointment? Mundane reality will surely lie in between.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?845078400,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="am3077.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1>Raining on Dole's parade</h1>

<font size=1>HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT, AND LYNDHURST, NEW JERSEY</font><p>
"WEEEE'VE got the momentum," Bob Dole told New Jersey this week. He arrived there fresh from Sunday's televised debate with Bill Clinton, in buoyant mood for a two-day bus tour. His campaign manager predicted the gap in the polls would shrink to single digits by week's end. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But by Tuesday, the second day of the bus tour, this was what the Dole momentum looked like. The polls had declared Mr Clinton the winner of the debate in Hartford, Connecticut, and the president's lead had even edged up a tad. As Mr Dole's bus-- called Asphalt I, "American Dream Machine"--arrived at Riverside Park in Lyndhurst, north of Newark in New Jersey, the skies were darkening ominously. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The crowd for the morning rally was thin, perhaps 300 people (including a few holding "Keep Abortion Legal" signs), leaving embarrassingly large patches of green grass between the television cameras and the podium. The musical introduction for Mr Dole was bungled, the candidate's speech was lacklustre. Dick Zimmer, the Republican senatorial candidate, who might be expected to attach himself like glue to Mr Dole if he reckoned it would help his own chances, was notable by his absence. Worse, a <font size=-1>TV</font> appearance the next day on "Oprah", an ideal forum for appealing to women voters, had fallen through.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By the time the "American Dream Machine" arrived at its next stop, Morristown, rain was falling. Although the crowd was bigger and Mr Dole did a brave job of speaking in the wet (proposing a "tax credit for rain"), it was no fun. The two open-air rallies and a fundraising meeting scheduled for the rest of the day were cancelled, and Mr Dole retreated to the "Citizen's Ship" to fly back to Washington.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dole momentum is proving hard to achieve. It was supposed to happen when he left the Senate, then at the Republican convention, and now with the two presidential debates. With less than a month to polling day, time is running out. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fairness, Mr Dole seemed genuinely pleased with his performance in Sunday's debate. He had held his own with the man his campaign had dubbed the greatest debater since Demosthenes. In New Jersey, he was greeted on his first day by blissful sunshine and respectable if not overflowing crowds. He told them Mr Clinton was a "stealth liberal" and assured them they could trust Bob Dole to keep his word, including his promise of a 15% tax cut--indeed, as president he would come to New Jersey to sign the tax-cutting legislation. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New Jersey is one of the "battleground" states Mr Dole must carry to win the election. He trails there by 7-14 points in the latest polls, but is heartened by the example of New Jersey's governor, Christine Whitman, who accompanied him on the bus tour. Three years ago Mrs Whitman, who also campaigned on a platform of tax cuts, was 22 points behind at this stage of the race for governor, and went on to win.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Mr Dole is to pull off a similar feat, he needs to change the dynamics of the contest. He failed to do that in the 90-minute Hartford debate. True, he succeeded in being warm and witty, a far cry from the uncaring extremist portrayed in Democratic advertisements. Most people watching liked him more at the end of the debate than at the beginning.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But that is not enough. Mr Dole was not terribly good at conveying his ideas for the future. And in order to avoid appearing mean, he passed up the opportunity-- served up on a platter by the debate's moderator, Jim Lehrer--to attack Mr Clinton's character. Mr Dole reckoned this was "an invitation to nowhere", and stuck to policy issues. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is, policy issues suit Mr Clinton fine. The president could reel off his achievements over the past four years, especially the impressive figures on jobs, growth and deficit-reduction. He could list umpteen policy ideas designed to relate to voters' everyday concerns, from more cops on the streets to <font size=-1>V</font>-chips in televisions and tax credits for education. And of course he could repeat his favourite campaign metaphor of bridge-building to the 21st century.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was not exactly a glittering performance, but it was sufficient to keep the race looking much as it did beforehand, which is to say handsomely favouring Mr Clinton. Hence the almost taunting confidence with which Mr Clinton set off from Hartford to pick up endorsements from corporate America and to travel into what used to be the staunch Republican territory of New Hampshire, where he has a 21-point lead in the polls. If there was any change in momentum, it was not evident by mid-week.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What does Mr Dole try next? Another bus tour would take him this week to another battleground state, Ohio. He was due to be joined there by Colin Powell, amid speculation that he might announce some of the names voters could expect to see in a Dole administration. Then he heads for California in preparation for the second (and last) presidential debate, in San Diego on October 16th.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tough decisions are crowding in. How should he allocate its resources in the final weeks of the campaign? Should he abandon expensive California in order to concentrate on states where he has a more plausible chance of winning? Above all, if everything else fails to produce the magical momentum, should he change tactics and get personal?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Dole campaign this week launched a new advertisement, airing on Christian radio stations, which talks of a "moral crisis" in the White House. In Lyndhurst on Tuesday Mr Dole was preceded on the podium by Michael Chertoff, the former Senate Whitewater counsel. "Get aggressive, Mr Dole, in the next debate," was the advice shouted by one supporter at the end of the rally. "Less foreign policy, more character." America's eyes will now turn to San Diego to see if he takes that advice. <br>

<h1>Kemp gored</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
AMERICAN life is plagued by electronic voices on the telephone, which forward calls and recite timetables in a relentlessly efficient and tedious way. Al Gore is one of those voices with a pretty face. At the vice-presidential debate on October 9th, he methodically defeated Jack Kemp, his Republican opponent. He was better briefed, stuck more closely to the questions, and attacked deftly. He was also dull beyond belief.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defeating Mr Kemp, mind you, was not especially difficult. Mr Kemp made a fool of himself on foreign policy, waffling on Haiti, and eccentrically blaming the Clinton administration for causing the devaluation of Mexico's peso in 1994-95. Mr Kemp was also embarrassing on his supposed speciality, the economy. At one point he blurted out that the current long-run growth rate of 2.5% could be doubled, an outrageous claim. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kemp was better at pleading the cause of inner cities. But Mr Gore can also do that (with statistics). Mr Kemp called for enterprise zones for poor urban areas. Mr Gore boasted about the empowerment zones that the Clinton administration has set up. Your correspondent had begun watching the debate with three eager friends. At about this point, all three wandered off.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However boring, the debate did reveal something about the last weeks of this campaign. Mr Kemp was invited by the moderator to attack President Clinton's character. He refused to do so, suggesting that the Dole team remains unwilling to exploit its greatest potential advantage. Instead, Mr Kemp offered a mix of nutty criticisms (as on Mexico) and artificial disagreements (as on inner-city policy). It is hard to see how either can dent the Clinton-Gore lead. Ghetto dwellers are not about to vote Republican, no matter what Mr Kemp may say.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The debate also shed some light on the next presidential campaign, in 2000. Mr Gore was already the front-runner for the Democratic nomination; he is even more so now. Unless a man of equal competence but greater passion emerges, it will be hard to topple him. But Mr Kemp has seen his stock slip a bit.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ed Rollins, who chaired Mr Kemp's disastrous presidential bid in 1988, says of his friend: "He was impossible to discipline and simply wouldn't listen." The lack of discipline came out on Wednesday. Kemp 2000 is a poor bet.<br>

<p><b>Campaign issues: Opinion polls</b></p>
<h1>Some margin for error</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
IMAGINE the impossible: an American presidential election without opinion polls. It would be much more fun. There would be real tension about the outcome. As it is, polls have been the driving force of this campaign, shaping the candidates' messages and determining the dynamics of the race. Thanks to the polls, Bill Clinton has been able to cultivate an aura of inevitability. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet polls can mislead. A salutory lesson comes from Britain's experience in 1992. The major eve-of-election polls showed Labour just ahead, but John Major's Conservatives confounded everyone, winning by eight points. This was the British pollsters' most spectacular error ever, and it sent them into a painful post-election analysis to work out what went wrong. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They concluded that it was a mixture of things. There was a last-minute swing. There were problems with the method used to obtain a representative sample of the electorate. And there was a so-called "spiral of silence": many people, too embarrassed to admit that they would vote Conservative, claimed to be undecided or refused to answer questions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Could distortions similar to those in Britain be affecting American polls this time? Some of the polls certainly raise eyebrows. In the space of five days late last month, the <font size=-1>CNN</font>/<i>USA Today</i>/Gallup tracking poll (a rolling sample taken over three nights) showed Mr Clinton's lead over Bob Dole moving from ten points to 25. It is hard to believe that voter opinion is really that volatile.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The odd rogue result is not on its own terribly significant. More to the point, the American practice of using computerised telephone banks to select a random sample of voters avoids the British pollsters' problematic quest for sociologically representative "quotas". But it raises other worries. John Zogby, whose tracking polls, in contrast to others, now show Mr Clinton's lead in single digits, and who uses a slightly different sampling method, reckons other polls "are talking to too many Democrats". The list of potential pitfalls suggests that the polls' margin of error may be greater than is generally acknowledged.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, there is the question of the non response rate--"the dirty little secret of the profession", says Karlyn Bowman, a poll watcher at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think-tank. In face-to face interviews, some 20% of people may refuse to answer questions. But in telephone polls, when people are often either not at home or choose to hang up, the non response rate is much higher (typically at least 50%). Diligent pollsters will repeatedly try to call back; but the non-response problem may be getting worse, as Americans lead ever-busier lives and do not hesitate to slam the phone down on what they assume are just more telemarketing calls.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pollsters rarely reveal the non-response rate. Yet it could be that Dole supporters are hanging up in greater numbers than Clinton-backers. If it is uncool to admit to being a Dole voter, a "spiral of silence" could be depressing Mr Dole's score in the polls.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The treatment of "undecided" respondents--say, 7%--probably also exaggerates Mr Dole's troubles. Two-thirds of the undecideds typically break for the challenger. This is not reflected in most polls, nor do published polls usually reveal the intensity of a candidate's support. Many respondents say they are leaning towards one side or the other, but may still change their minds. Add together the undecideds and the leaners in the presidential contest, and as much as 40% of the vote may still be up for grabs.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then there is the matter of turnout, a bigger complication for American pollsters than for British ones. The poor and members of ethnic minorities are most likely to support Mr Clinton, but they are least likely to vote. That explains why Mr Clinton's lead is greater among registered voters (16 points in a recent Pew poll) than among "likely voters" (12 points). The better pollsters ask a series of careful questions in an effort to establish whether a respondent is likely to vote, but this is not an exact science, and this year interest in the election seems to be low. In any case, not all pollsters are as scrupulous as they should be about their methods.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So is there hope yet for Mr Dole, who tells every audience not to believe the polls? Any systematic bias in the polls so far might open the possibility of a bigger-than-usual late swing, even of an upset victory. More than the presidency is at stake. If the presidential race is in fact closer than the polls suggest, then the Republicans' chances of retaining control of Congress are that much greater.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The size and persistence of Mr Clinton's lead argues against a surprise on November 5th. Moreover, the surveys of the major polling organisations that are not corner cutters all show essentially the same thing: a solid Clinton lead, larger than anything that has been reversed at this late stage since polling began. "Our track record is pretty good," notes Frank Newport of Gallup. True, but so was that of the British pollsters before 1992. <br>

<p><b>Cash to MPs</b></p>
<h1>Cleaning house</h1>

UNDER the 1689 Bill of Rights, <font size=-1>MP</font>s cannot be questioned or prosecuted for any of their actions at Westminster. As long ago as 1975, a Royal Commission headed by Lord Justice Salmon recommended that the Bill of Rights be amended to make the bribery of an <font size=-1>MP</font> a criminal offence. If the commission's recommendation had been enacted instead of being ignored by successive governments, Neil Hamilton, a former junior trade minister, and Mohamed Al Fayed, the owner of Harrods, the two key figures at the centre of the cash-for-questions scandal, could well be facing a criminal prosecution rather than a parliamentary inquiry.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Al Fayed claims that he paid Mr Hamilton, Conservative <font size=-1>MP</font> for Tatton, &#163;28,000 to ask 17 parliamentary questions on his behalf after being advised by Ian Greer, a lobbyist, that <font size=-1>MP</font>s were hired in the same way as taxis. Mr Hamilton acknowledges receiving &#163;10,000 in "commission fees" from Mr Greer. He also admits running up a bill of more than &#163;4,000 at the Ritz hotel in Paris as a guest of Mr Al Fayed. But he denies that these payments, neither of which was declared to Parliament, were linked to his repeated parliamentary representations on behalf of Mr Al Fayed. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is this ugly brew of bitterly contested allegations which Sir Gordon Downey, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, has now been asked to investigate. John Major, who has called for a rapid inquiry, said the charges were "poisoning British politics". That undoubtedly is correct. But a hurried inquiry held in private by a part-time commissioner, who has no powers to require witnesses to attend or documents to be produced, and who can report only to a Tory-dominated parliamentary committee, is unlikely to restore public confidence. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Major has so far rejected demands for a wider inquiry, but he may have to reconsider this stance when Parliament reassembles later this month. Mr Blair, the Labour leader, and Mr Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, have joined forces in calling for an independent judicial inquiry. If this demand is ignored, both opposition parties are considering tabling a motion of no confidence. Such a motion could put Mr Major, with his majority of only one in the House of Commons, in an awkward spot, for it may be the one motion which could force all the opposition parties, including the Ulster Unionists, to vote against his government.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Quite apart from parliamentary pressures, there is a strong case for a judicial inquiry held under the 1921 Tribunals of Inquiry Act. The disclosure that David Willetts, at the time a government whip and now a junior minister, sought to delay an earlier parliamentary probe into Neil Hamilton's conduct by lobbying Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith, the committee's Tory chairman, has done nothing to bolster confidence in the Commons' impartiality. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover there is a need to investigate more than just Mr Hamilton. In the thousands of pages of documents connected to the case, there is evidence that Mr Greer paid undeclared commissions not just to Mr Hamilton but to other members of the Commons Trade and Industry Committee. Sir Michael Grylls, the committee's chairman, received such payments from 1985, although he declared this interest to Parliament only in 1990. Tim Smith, the committee's secretary, resigned as a junior minister in 1994 after charges that he had received thousands of pounds in cash directly from Mr Al Fayed in return for asking parliamentary questions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The need for an independent inquiry is further reinforced by the political nature of many of Mr Al Fayed's charges. He claims that he handed &#163;250,000 to the Conservative Party before the 1987 election and that since then he has given, through Mr Greer, campaign donations to 24 <font size=-1>MP</font>s, including two Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s and one Liberal Democrat. Mr Greer, for his part, claims to have raised more than &#163;750,000 for Tory candidates. The one thing the two men now appear to have in common is their resentment at receiving so little in return.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those caught up in this affair will, no doubt, claim they are victims of a changing political culture. If the government had acted on the recommendations of the Salmon Commission to make bribery of an <font size=-1>MP</font> a criminal offence--and to define precisely what bribery is--that excuse would not be available. But it is, at best, a poor defence. As the Royal Commission noted: "Membership of Parliament is a great honour and carries with it a special duty to maintain the highest standards of probity." Few of those involved in this wretched affair seem to have lived up to the "highest standards of probity".<br>

<p><b>Employment</b></p>
<h1>Makework</h1>

SINCE you cannot hear a hyphen, it was unclear whether Peter Lilley, the social security minister, was appealing in his conference speech this week in Bournemouth to the "hard-working classes" or the "hard working-classes". Both, probably; for this is the latest term for Essex man, Sierra man, the <font size=-1>C2</font>s whom the Tories fear they are losing to Labour. The swathe of employment and social-security measures announced or implemented this week is intended to persuade these people that the Tories are against dole-scroungers while Labour is in favour of them. On closer inspection, however, they reveal more similarities than differences. The changes fall into three broad categories:<br>
<li> <b><font size=-1> Cuttingcosts. </font> </b>The new Jobseeker's Allowance, introduced by the government on October 7th, cuts the period of time for which the newly-unemployed get unconditional benefits from a year to six months. At the end of six months, those who have more than &#163;4,000 in savings, or whose partner is working, will get no more benefits.<br></li>
<li><b><font size=-1> Fighting fraud. </font></b> The government is planning a bill that will allow different bits of government to swap more information; so the Benefits Agency will be able to check whether a claimant is also paying income tax or <font size=-1>VAT</font>--ie, also gainfully employed. A fraud inspectorate will be set up to tighten the administration of housing benefit, which the government calculates is costing it &#163;1 billion in fraudulent claims a year out of an &#163;11 billion budget. And the Benefits Agency will be given powers to impose fines for false claims: at present, because of the costs of prosecution, the government prosecutes in less than 10% of cases of suspected fraud.<br></li>
<li><b><font size=-1> Getting people into jobs. </font></b> Mr Lilley also used his speech to announce that private companies will be invited to tender for contracts to get people back to work, and will be paid by results. This follows the model of America Works, a company that provides such a service in several American states. And earlier in the week, the prime mininster announced an extension of Project Work, a workfare scheme which has been tried out in Hull and in Kent. Launched in April, it has so far covered 7,000 people; it will now be extended to cover 50,000.<br>
</li>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Project Work neatly illustrates the degree of consensus between the two main parties on the direction that future welfare reform should take. Workfare--no work, no benefits--is designed to do three things: to eliminate from the unemployment register those who are working on the black; to prevent the lazy from sitting on their backsides at the taxpayer's expense; and to reconnect the long-term unemployed with the world of work.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Project Work caters to people who have been out of work for more than two years. During the first 13 weeks, which are voluntary, it offers them help with looking for a job: the unemployed person gets a fortnightly session with an adviser, who will help with applications and phone employers. The next 13 weeks are compulsory: 18 hours of work a week with a voluntary organisation. Those who refuse to do it lose their benefits. The scheme runs from April 1996 to July 1997.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The scheme is not perfect. Richard Layard, an economist at the London School of Economics who has written extensively on the subject, reckons that a workfare scheme has a better chance of succeeding if it gets people before they have been out of work for so long; and he doubts that the compulsory period is long enough. "It doesn't seem at all serious." In any case, although pilot schemes are an excellent idea, extending them before they are finished or evaluated because you need something to announce at a party conference is not.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Early figures suggest that Project Work may be doing its stuff. According to Sandy Tulloch, district manager in Hull for the Employment Service, only 40% of those on the scheme wanted the initial 13 weeks' help in looking for work. Of the 2,100 people who have been through the project, only 182 found jobs. However, 475 have come off the register altogether. Presumably they had pressing engagements elsewhere. At that rate, the scheme should easily repay the &#163;6m it will cost for the 4,500 people who will go through it in Hull.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This tough-minded approach to welfare may well prove effective. Yet the Tories cannot claim sole ownership. Labour, after all, is offering a more expensive version of the same thing: unemployed people under 25, Labour has promised, will be offered a job or more education, and if they refuse, they will lose their benefits. Hard for the non-working classes; but appealing to the hard-working classes.<br>

<h1>Nursery lessons</h1>

A SPATE of press reports has claimed that the government's pilot scheme for nursery vouchers is in deep trouble. But these partly reflect the wishful thinking of the opponents of vouchers. When Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, sang the praises of vouchers at the Tory conference on October 10th, she seemed to have overcome her earlier doubts about them. Evidence from three of the four councils piloting vouchers contradicts a leaked memo from Westminster council, the fourth, which says they are a bureaucratic nightmare and are unlikely to create new nursery places.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Admittedly there have been some hitches. Kensington and Chelsea council says the system for distributing the vouchers, worth &#163;1,100 a year for each four-year-old, needs to be simplified, and that more effort must be made to explain the scheme to parents. It is also worried about the variation in standards between some private nursery providers. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But these problems are far from insurmountable, and Kensington also says there is "little doubt that the private sector will be interested in developing nursery provision, in part at least as a result of the voucher scheme." The other two pilot schemes--in London's Wandsworth and in Norfolk--have experienced no serious administrative problems, and both seem to have encouraged private and voluntary groups to create new places.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However they fare, the voucher experiments will be terminated prematurely next spring. If the Tories win the next election, they have promised to introduce vouchers nationwide whether or not their faults have been ironed out. More likely, Labour will win and scrap the voucher experiments without bothering to find out whether or not vouchers can create extra nursery places, at little extra public expense.<br>

<p><b>Civil Service</b></p>
<h1>After Butler</h1>

WITHIN months of taking office, the incoming British government will appoint the country's most powerful non elected official. Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, retires at the end of 1997, giving him just time to initiate a new government into the mysteries of office--and to allow it to appoint his successor.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since discretion is essential to the job, none of the probable candidates is conducting anything so crude as a campaign. But insiders have noted that <b>Hayden Phillips</b>, the 53-year-old permanent secretary of the Department of National Heritage and a former Brussels <i>chef de cabinet</i> to Roy Jenkins, has been putting himself about a bit. Lord Jenkins's enthusiasm is not echoed widely in Whitehall.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A lively choice would be<b> Richard Mottram</b>, 50, permanent secretary at defence, who previously ran the Office of Public Service and Science under Sir Robin. Mr Mottram has a more speculative mind than most mandarins, with an engaging ability to skirt close to indiscretion without ever crossing the line and actually saying anything indiscreet. He has in the past denied that he wants the job. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lively too would be <b>Richard Wilson</b>, 54, the permanent secretary at the Home Office. Mr Wilson was highly regarded as a hands-on manager in his previous job as permanent secretary at the Department of the Environment, but some Whitehall insiders question whether he could not have done better in the admittedly difficult task of handling Michael Howard, a populist home secretary. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A less extrovert choice, but perhaps Whitehall's favourite, would be <b>Andrew Turnbull</b>, 51, a former private secretary to Margaret Thatcher. Mr Turnbull, who succeeded Mr Wilson at environment, is reckoned both to have a good brain and to be a good manager. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, there is a further possibility: that Sir Robin will not have a successor at all. Labour is considering splitting his job so that there is one cabinet secretary and a separate head of the civil service. Sir Robin is resisting this, believing that his role as the prime minister's adviser has given him the clout needed to manage the powerful and relatively autonomous permanent secretaries who run individual government departments. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However if Labour wins and Sir Robin fails to persuade it of his view, a new candidate might come into the picture for the cabinet secretaryship. <b>Sir John Kerr</b>, 54, is Britain's ambassador in Washington. Aside from a spell in the Treasury, part of it as private secretary to Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe, his career has mostly been in the Foreign Office, leaving him short of experience in the home civil service. This might spark something of a revolt if he were appointed to run it. But Sir John is a legendary operator with a quicksilver intelligence and the stamina of an ox--just the qualities which a new government might appreciate in a cabinet secretary.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This would open the door for <b>Michael Bichard</b>, 49,<b> </b>the permanent secretary at the Department for Education and Employment, a rare example of a senior civil servant who really is enthusiastic about management, to take on the other half of the job as head of the home civil service.<br>

CONSERVATIVE support in local by elections has risen to its highest level for four years. The latest in <i>The Economist</i>'s regular survey of such results shows the Tories won 34% of the vote in wards fought by all three main parties betwen July and September (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>), only four percentage points behind Labour. They have not performed this well since 1992--the year in which they won the last general election. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main cause of the change is not Labour weakness. Labour's share of the vote, although down by three percentage points from the third quarter of 1995, is actually 2.5 points up on the first half of this year. Rather, the Tory recovery is due to a weaker performance by the Liberal Democrats. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Lib Dem share of the vote, at 24%, is six percentage points lower than in the third quarter of 1995. In the same quarter three years ago, they were polling more votes in local government elections than either of the other big parties. However, they still do much better in local elections than nationally. Their local vote is almost double their national opinion-poll ratings.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With the general election now no more than seven months away, how does the Tory showing compare with those in the run-up to their last three successful general election campaigns? The good news for the Tories is that they are doing as well or better in local contests than they did before previous general elections. In the third quarter of 1982, they also polled 34% of the vote, but won easily in 1983; in the third quarter of 1986, 31% of the vote, before winning in 1987; and in the third quarter of 1991, 34% of the vote before winning in 1992. However, there is bad news for them too: Labour is running an average of 6% higher in local contests than it was in the corresponding period before its three defeats.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour has claimed some strong local by-election performances in recent weeks, at the expense of the Lib Dems. Moreover, an <font size=-1>NOP</font> poll in the <i>Sunday Times </i>gave it a 23% lead over the Tories, up four percentage points, reflecting its successful conference and new allegations of Tory sleaze.<br>

<p><b>Home shopping</b></p>
<h1>Home alone?</h1>

<font size=1>LONDON AND NEW YORK</font><p>
<p><b>Persuading American consumers to shop from home may depend more on traditional retailing skills than thrilling technology</b></p><br>
THE idea of doing your shopping from home, rather than visiting a store, spans over a century of American commerce. In 1893 Sears, Roebuck mailed out the first edition of its catalogue, from which the country's farmers were able to kit themselves out with everything from guns to Sunday-best suits. Pioneers could even find themselves a wife in a catalogue. Yet the idea still has a futuristic feel to it: the 21st-century couple lounging on their shiny bubble chairs and dictating orders to a sonorously deferential computer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite all the hype about multimedia, old-fashioned catalogues still dominate the home shopping industry. They clocked up sales of almost $70 billion in America in 1995, according to the Direct Marketing Association (<font size=-1>DMA</font>), an industry group. Of that, some $43 billion was spent by consumers, the rest by businesses. In contrast, sales through infomercials or direct-response ads on television totalled $4.5 billion, $2.6 billion of which came from dedicated home-shopping channels. Sales of goods over the Internet and other on-line services were worth a mere $518m, estimates Forrester Research, a consultancy in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Catalogue shopping has been on a roll for the past decade and a half. The number of catalogues mailed in America rose from 8.7 billion in 1983 to 13.2 billion last year. The <font size=-1>DMA</font> forecasts that the industry's revenue will continue to grow at almost 7% a year for the rest of the decade, as it has since 1990. This growth is mostly driven by a large group of people spending increasing amounts on mail-order goods, rather than more people starting to buy them--59% of adult Americans already order from catalogues, and three-quarters of them spend more than $100 a year. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clothing remains the most popular item sold through catalogues, followed closely by home furnishings. Computers and the software for them are also a big chunk of the business. Five of the top ten catalogue groups ranked by revenues are computer sellers (see <a href="wb1.gif">table</a>). The biggest general catalogue retailer, J.C. Penney, which also has a chain of department stores, depends mostly on clothing and furnishings.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are hitches. Last year, for example, the two main expenses of the catalogue business--postal charges and the cost of paper--both increased at the same time. But catalogue shopping still seems to have a number of things in its favour:<br>
<font size=-1></font> Various social changes, such as more women in work and greater worries about violence on the streets, have boosted home shopping.<br>
<font size=-1></font> State tax regulations mean that goods bought from a company in another state do not incur sales tax.<br>
<font size=-1></font> New computer technology allows retailers to target their customers with more precision, sorting through databases of names and addresses to work out who is likely to want, say, golf clubs and who would prefer china figurines.<br>
<font size=-1></font> As more companies shed central purchasing teams in bouts of downsizing, leaving individual departments to buy their own supplies independently, time strapped managers are increasingly turning to catalogues. As a result, sales to businesses are growing rapidly; the <font size=-1>DMA</font> predicts that they will represent 39% of all catalogue sales in 2001.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In theory, all of these advantages should particularly benefit more modern forms of home shopping. But the <font size=-1>TV</font>-based version seems stuck in something of a rut. Sales of Home Shopping Network (<font size=-1>HSN</font>), one of America's two leading networks, have been stuck at a little over $1 billion a year for the past five years. Those of <font size=-1>QVC</font>, its big rival, have risen from $1.2 billion in 1993 to $1.5 billion in 1995.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of the pressure is now on <font size=-1>HSN</font>, which reported an operating loss in 1995 of $80m. Its owner, Barry Diller, a Hollywood mogul who used to run <font size=-1>QVC</font>, has restructured the company: in the past year about 300 jobs have gone from <font size=-1>HSN</font>'s headquarters in St Petersburg, Florida, where 1,800 telephonists and a large computer system can answer up to 50,000 calls an hour. Mr Diller has also brought in a new chief executive, James Held, who has ditched many of <font size=-1>HSN</font>'s clothing lines and focused the network around jewellery and cosmetics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This reflects <font size=-1>TV</font> shopping's narrow audience. Some 85% of the shoppers are women, and the most popular category of goods is jewellery, which accounts for nearly 40% of the business. Other items include clothes, cosmetics and complicated fitness machines that are demonstrated by lots of healthy-looking presenters.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One reason that <font size=-1>TV</font> shopping has not prospered more is that, in a sense, it is a step backward from catalogues. The format-- goods paraded past the camera one after another--favours impulse buying rather than a search for something particular; it also attracts people with enough time on their hands to sit watching until something appealing flickers by. The average length of time spent watching <font size=-1>QVC</font> before the first purchase is made is 36 hours. The network tried to move up market in 1994 with <font size=-1>Q</font>2, a second channel that sold more expensive goods, but its failure to catch on with yuppies led the firm to recast <font size=-1>Q</font>2 simply as a "best of <font size=-1>QVC</font>" channel, showing repeats of successes from the main channel.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The thought of avoiding <font size=-1>TV</font> shopping's defects is what makes on-line shopping so exciting to people such as Mr Diller. Computers let customers navigate their way to the goods that they want when they want them. And their users certainly do not resemble stereotypical <font size=-1>TV</font> shoppers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present, the biggest part of the on line market (around 25-30% of it) is made up of computer goods--hardware, software and books about them. Travel (20-25%) is the next biggest category. Forrester predicts that this mixture will stay much the same over the next four years, although the value of goods and services sold will grow to $6.6 billion by 2000. Other forecasters think the figure could be ten times this amount.<br>
<b> </b><br>
</p><p><b>The search for net profits</b><br>
Both <font size=-1>QVC</font> and <font size=-1>HSN</font> have started on-line enterprises--i<font size=-1>QVC</font> and the Internet Shopping Network (<font size=-1>ISN</font>) respectively. <font size=-1>ISN</font> is selling about $1m-worth of goods a month, vying with Amazon.com, a bookshop based in Washington state, and others as the most popular on-line merchant. At the moment <font size=-1>ISN</font> sells only computer goods, but Mr Diller intends to change that. Interactive searching, he argues, is worthwhile only if there is a wide range of goods to forage through. Amazon lists over 1m titles, more than any of its rivals, on-line or off. For its part, i<font size=-1>QVC</font> outdoes its television parent in the breadth of its stock, offering everything from power tools to pyjamas.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If offering a broader range of goods than your rivals is one big competitive advantage in on-line shopping, another is excellence in what traditional retailers like to call "supply-chain management". Taking an order on-line will be easier--customers will do most of the data-entry work that firms' telephone operators currently have to do with catalogue or <font size=-1>TV</font>-sales. But the warehousing and delivery of these goods will be fiendishly complex to organise.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Diller argues that this favours firms with experience in <font size=-1>TV</font> home-shopping: fulfilling orders fast and accurately is what <font size=-1>HSN</font> and <font size=-1>QVC</font> are geared up to do. But there is an important difference. The <font size=-1>TV</font>-shopping channels can broadly control the time when products are sold (most sales happen either while or soon after the infomercial is shown): this means that they can buy job lots of goods. With interactivity, orders may flow in over a much longer period. Rather than stock their warehouses with small runs of countless products, <font size=-1>ISN</font> and i<font size=-1>QVC</font> may be wiser to relay some orders directly to the manufacturer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Amazon is an excellent example of why, even on the Internet, the intermediary still has a role. It distributes books for some 20,000 publishers, and guarantees its customers that it can deliver any book in print in the United States: 18 of its 106 staff deal with rare books (nearly a third are in warehousing and distribution). It keeps minimal stocks, at most a two-day supply of its 500 bestsellers in its warehouse; the rest it orders from publishers on demand. Some publishers say privately that they prefer selling through Amazon than through their own direct-sales operations. Unlike its slightly stale televisual rivals, Amazon offers interviews with authors. In short, it tries to make buying books easier for both consumers and manufacturers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A century ago, Richard Sears, a station telegrapher, used his country's new railways to distribute goods and build up his business. But Sears, Roebuck's strength was its range of merchandise and a solid reputation for quality, bolstered by generous guarantees. Even in today's on-line world, that is still a winning formula.<br>

<h1>Of spandex and software </h1>

<p><b>WordPerfect was once the proudest name in software. Now it is owned by one of the most shameless. And a good thing too</b></p> 
IT IS hard to believe that Michael Cowpland, Ottawa's most notorious challenger to taste and decorum, could really be a rival to Microsoft's Bill Gates. Mr Cowpland and his wife, Marilyn, drive matching Porsches, his blue, hers pink. Mrs Cowpland recently adorned the cover of a local magazine in a red spandex Santa suit (and sells far more risqu&eacute; stuff in her clothing store). Their massive glass-and-steel mansion, a smaller replica of Mr Cowpland's corporate headquarters, boasts two racquet courts as well as a ten-car garage, and has outraged neighbours in their otherwise staid suburb. Far from living and breathing software, Mr Cowpland prefers martial arts and tennis: he even schedules meetings around tennis championships.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His business methods are unorthodox too. The name of his first company, Mitel, now a large Canadian telecoms-equipment maker, originally stood for "Mike and Terry's Lawnmowers". Mr Cowpland and his partner had intended to make remote-controlled lawnmowers, but switched to electronics in the early 1970s. After he sold his share in Mitel in 1984, he started his current firm, Corel. It now leads the design-and-graphics software business. Corel's trademarks are garish ads (invariably embellished with rainbow-striped balloons), lots of different versions of its software and cheap package deals.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Corel has not yet managed to turn its market share into substantial profits (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart</a>). The average, boring software mogul would spend the next year or so sorting this out, all the time praising the Lord for having discovered at least one part of the industry that is Microsoft-free. Mr Cowpland, however, is neither average nor boring.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In January, Corel bought WordPerfect, the firm that introduced word processing to the world but then let Microsoft Word grab the market. Mr Cowpland paid just $11m in cash and $100m in shares, along with some royalty fees, to Novell, which had paid $800m for WordPerfect in 1994. Considering that WordPerfect, even in its current distressed state, still sells about $300m worth of software a year, its new owner could probably turn a profit by simply letting the franchise tick over. Instead Mr Cowpland is rejigging WordPerfect to challenge Microsoft in its most profitable business, the market for office "suites"--typically, a word-processor, spreadsheet, database and graphics program that work together.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present this market is dominated by Microsoft's Office package. Ray Noorda, Novell's Microsoft-hating boss, had hoped that WordPerfect would be the torpedo to sink Mr Gates; instead it very nearly sank Novell. Mr Cowpland reckons that he can do better, thanks to two innovations. The first involves launching a new version of WordPerfect using all of Corel's hard-sell marketing tactics. That means bundling more software with the core word-processor and spreadsheet and pricing the product absurdly low. Although the list price is $260, anyone who claims he is swapping to it from a competing program need pay only $99. For corporate customers, the deal is even better: $895 for a version that can serve dozens of individual users. Microsoft, by comparison, charges about $200 per user for its suite.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Cowpland's most daring move is a technical one. Corel is feverishly working on a version of the WordPerfect suite in Java, the Internet's hot new programming language. The advantage of Java is that it can run on any sort of computer, not just those running Microsoft's operating systems. A Java WordPerfect could run on the new wave of cheap "network computers", as well as on personal digital assistants (one of which Corel will be releasing itself next year) and other non-<font size=-1>PC</font> devices.<br>
</p><p><b>Back to the future</b><br>There is a bit of historical neatness to this: WordPerfect first made its name in the early days of personal computing by releasing a version for practically every sort of computer available, no matter how obscure. Rewriting the code for the particulars of each machine made releasing updated versions a logistical nightmare (the firm's headquarters was practically a museum of strange computers and obscure printers, all of which had to be supported). Now Java offers an opportunity to gain the same advantage without rewriting: the same software should run on any machine.<br></b>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Corel releases the first test versions of the Java WordPerfect suite on November 1st. There are plenty of technical hurdles to leap. But it is hard not to admire Mr Cowpland's courage. When Mr Noorda first rode WordPerfect into battle with Microsoft, Novell was one of the richest firms in the industry and dominated the networking sector that would soon emerge as the core of the Internet. Just two years later, it was losing money as a result of its WordPerfect wounds.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same could happen to Mr Cowpland, whose financial cushion is even thinner. But many in the industry are rooting for him all the same. Microsoft, like all firms, needs competition, but since it took over in office suites it has had far too little. Java could change that. Mr Cowpland, his tennis outfit doubtless adorned with Corel balloons, deserves to take at least a set off Mr Gates.<br>

<h1>TECHNOLOGY BRIEF</h1>

<h2>Still a virtual reality</h2>
<p><b>Our third brief on the pitfalls facing new technologies looks at virtual reality and asks why it has not yet made dreams come true</b></p><br>
LOTS of new technologies promise to transform lives. Virtual reality (<font size=-1>VR</font>) is one--if the hype is to be believed. With the goggles, the gloves and the necessary gigabytes on a computer, it will be possible to create new worlds and fill them with beautiful people (or ugly ones--the choice is yours). It will require no more than slightly faster computers and slightly better gadgets for plugging people into them. The rise of <font size=-1>VR</font> is as inevitable as technological progress itself. Or so it was said.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In recent years, <font size=-1>VR</font>, which first emerged in the 1960s, has become a catch-all term for any computerised, interactive, real time, 3-<font size=-1>D</font> simulacrum, whether viewed on a stereoscopic headset or a single screen. Originally, however, it simply referred to what is now known as "immersive" virtual reality (<font size=-1>IVR</font>), in which users wear special headgear attached to a computer that gives them the impression of being in another environment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was no shortage of potential uses for <font size=-1>IVR</font>. It would enable designers to build and test a prototype aircraft without touching a screwdriver. Surgeons would be able to operate from afar. Soldiers would be able to control robotic tanks and aircraft. And, of course, there would be mind-boggling new games.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It would be astonishing if <font size=-1>IVR</font> had lived up to such great expectations. But even by more modest standards, it has been a disappointment. The global market for <font size=-1>VR</font> equipment-- immersive and otherwise--was only about $200m in 1995. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Technologies that replace existing ones must convince customers that they are better. Those that have no precursor must convince people that they are any good at all. <font size=-1>IVR</font> has been unable to do this for two main reasons.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, for many of its proposed uses, wearing a headset has no particular advantage over simply looking at a screen. Engineers can now design an entire aeroplane on computer, and then use <font size=-1>IVR</font> to simulate its manufacture and test its performance. But for most of this process, an immersed view is no more informative than a 3-<font size=-1>D</font> picture on a screen. Only when they need a pilot's-eye view--for example, to check that all the instruments are accessible--might they slip on the headgear. Even then, they may often prefer to have the computer draw a stick figure on the screen and calculate what is within its reach.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same holds true for all computerised design: <font size=-1>IVR</font> and the fancy headset that goes with it are generally unnecessary. In many laboratories the headsets mostly sit idle, reserved for impressing visitors. (Some retailers cash in on this novelty value by using <font size=-1>IVR</font> to show customers the inside of a new house or car.) <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the technology could still be useful for creating environments in which to learn skills-- such as surgery or flying--or to do things--such as playing games--that would be expensive, dangerous, or even impossible in real life. Yet even here <font size=-1>IVR</font> is unable to make good its promises. The reason? The technology is still terrible. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The assumptions were only half right. Computers have got faster, but the peripherals have not kept pace.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The basic piece of <font size=-1>IVR</font> kit, dating back to the 1960s, is a bulky headset with a tiny screen for each eye. Usually, each screen shows a slightly different image, giving the illusion of 3-<font size=-1>D</font>. Attached wires or sensors track the wearer's head movements. From this, a computer providing the images works out what the user is looking at in the virtual scene, and draws it. For a deeper sense of immersion users may bedeck themselves with electronic pointers, earphones, gloves that monitor the shape of their hands, "haptic" devices that give the sensation of touching things, and even smell-emitters.<br>
<p><b><b>A distinct lack of vision</b><br>
</b>The point of being thus festooned is not to fool the wearer into thinking that he is somewhere real. The degree of immersion required depends on the application. Almost all these gizmos are still punishingly expensive and are mainly found in research laboratories. But for many uses--especially games, potentially the biggest single market-- just a headset should do, at least to start with.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But even the headsets turn customers off. Computers are still not powerful enough to eliminate "transport lag", the delay between moving your head and the image catching up. The field of view is narrow, typically just 10-20&#176; wide in games headsets, as against almost 180&#176; in real life. The depth of field feels wrong: whereas in real life looking at an object nearby causes objects in the distance to be out of focus, in <font size=-1>IVR</font> objects at all distances stay sharply defined. Finally, what the eye perceives-- such as motion--is not in synch with what the rest of the body feels. All this can lead to dizziness and disorientation, both during and after the experience.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Better systems do appear when uses are found for them. For example, at the Stanford Research Institute, animal trials of a "telesurgery" system are in progress. Video cameras in the operating theatre send stereoscopic images to the surgeon; robot arms give tactile feedback while replicating his actions. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that such systems are developed mostly by those, including universities and the military, who need sophisticated equipment that the mass market neither requires nor can afford. This, says Myron Krueger, a <font size=-1>VR</font> pioneer and the boss of Artificial Reality, a research company in Connecticut, may be why commercial <font size=-1>IVR</font> applications, and games in particular, have disappointed. Companies have yet to produce systems that are good enough and cheap enough for a broad audience, partly because they have yet to be convinced that the demand is there.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Virtuality, a British company that is the leading maker of <font size=-1>IVR</font> games, thinks it is. It has developed a $350 headset for home use that is about to be launched in Japan. This one has a wider field of view than its rivals (although the set will be monoscopic and will not track head movements). Virtuality hopes to do better than either Sega or Nintendo, two Japanese games makers that have launched unsuccessful <font size=-1>IVR</font> games products, or America's Hasbro, which last year wrote off tens of millions of dollars on a similar venture. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, even good headgear may not suffice. Stephen Ellis, a <font size=-1>VR</font> researcher at <font size=-1>NASA</font>, argues that, aside from games, <font size=-1>IVR</font> still lacks a "killer application"-- something to make it invaluable to the masses, not just specialists. It has been tried out for many things, from letting supermarket managers fiddle with new shop layouts to training people to overcome their phobias with huge images of spiders, but there is still no general-purpose use.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some hope the Internet will create one. <font size=-1>VRML</font>, a programming language developed for the Net, allows 3-<font size=-1>D</font> scenes to be put on Web sites easily. This might create the demand for a home <font size=-1>IVR</font> system. Satisfying it will simply require slightly faster computers and slightly better gadgets for plugging people into them . . .<br>

<h1 align=center>Can Israel rekindle peace?</h1>


WITH Israel and the Palestinians sliding into war, a restraining hand was vital. Bill Clinton offered it, and for that the world should be glad. But the relief may be short lived. Though the summons to Washington got Binyamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat talking to each other, nothing was resolved. The two will meet again, to talk again (see <a href="ir5984.html">page</a>). But it will be no more than a brief truce unless Israel's new government can be persuaded to acknowledge the underlying deal done by its predecessor: the return of occupied land in exchange for peace.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both Israelis and Palestinians were responsible for the violence that cost 58 Palestinians and 15 Israelis their lives last week. Yet outsiders-- friendly countries in Europe and Asia straightaway, America probably not until the bonds of the presidential election are loosened--need to concentrate their persuasion on the Israelis because it is they, since their change of government in May, who have virtually blown out the flame of peace. And it is they alone who can now relight it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Netanyahu rejects this. He went into the Washington talks in a bluster of indignation, demanding an assurance that Palestinian security forces would never again fire at their Israeli counterparts. It was terrible, indeed, that the distrust should have come to that. Law and order in the territories depend on the Israeli and Palestinian forces co-operating, not shooting at each other. Tensions snapped as Israeli soldiers fired at stone-throwing protesters across the checkpoints that divide Israel from autonomous Palestinian zones. The Palestinian police joined in. It should not have happened. It should not happen again. But frustration often begets violence. After nearly four months of Mr Netanyahu's prime ministership, many Palestinians had come to believe that the prospects for peace were so poor that they had little to lose by breaking the rules. They probably still do.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With difficulty, the immediate crisis is being sorted out, including the wretched tunnel whose opening set off the Palestinian protests--a trivial issue that has developed into a symbol of Israeli arrogance toward Muslim and Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem. But Israel still has to make up its mind on a much more fundamental matter. What should it do about the Oslo peace process, signed to general acclaim three years ago, but virtually halted by Mr Netanyahu?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Israel has four broad choices, of which one is probably untenable. That is its current policy of paying lip service to the peace process, expecting peace on the ground but acting provocatively. Mr Netanyahu's belief, repeated before and after his election, that the Palestinians are realists who will adjust to new firmness and to new limits is simply not true. Or rather it is not true that they will adjust peaceably--especially when they see changes to the status quo that are designed to destroy for ever their grander aspirations.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A second choice would be to seek to impose peace through force. Mr Netanyahu has threatened as much: he has declared himself ready to disarm the Palestinian police, thus enabling his government to continue on its current path without armed resistance. But that could not be attempted without entering Palestinian cities with maximum force, or without putting all the territories, Gaza included, back under military occupation. The bloodshed would be horrific, and the future black, without a trace of the security that Mr Netanyahu has promised his people.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A third, less bloody, choice would be to try to redefine the peace process by agreement. Mr Netanyahu hates the course set at Oslo. His interpretation of a permanent settlement for the Palestinians--including their status, the future of Jerusalem, the position of Jewish settlers--has nothing in common with Mr Arafat's. Maybe it makes no sense to embark, merely for the sake of talking, on the final negotiations that were officially launched in May, when Israel was still ruled by the Labour government of Shimon Peres. They would get nowhere. Better perhaps for Israel to reach a tacit understanding with the Palestinians to implement the interim accords but put longer-term matters on hold. The Palestinians would consolidate what they have--and go back to waiting.<br>
<b><br>
</p><p><b>Best to be bold</b></b><br>
One difficulty is that the Palestinians' patience might not prove infinite. Another is that, for this option to work, Mr Netanyahu would have to honour his promise to carry out the commitments made by Mr Peres. That does not mean, as he suggests, renegotiating terms that have already been laboriously negotiated; it means implementing them with minor modifications. It also means, and this is even harder for Mr Netanyahu's men, that Israel should not pre-empt a final settlement by turning the West Bank into a network of roads and the outskirts of East Jerusalem into vast Jewish suburbs. To do that would merely turn this option into a variant of the untenable present course.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fourth and boldest choice for Mr Netanyahu would be to confound both his friends and his enemies. He could avoid the obstacles of an interim accord, all of them immensely difficult for a rightist-religious coalition, by leaping swiftly ahead to the big one: a final settlement. In doing this, he would be following a line of precedents. Hardline governments, from time to time, have pulled off coups that had eluded their more liberal predecessors: Menachem Begin made peace with Egypt, Richard Nixon opened the road to China. Now, if he is up to it, it could be Mr Netanyahu's turn.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the aim would not, with the taste of violence still on the tongue, be to seek some sort of cosy peace. The key word, these days, is "separation". This is an admission of defeat, perhaps. Yet, for the security of both, the Israeli and Palestinian peoples may need to hold themselves separate. This has been done, often enough, on a temporary basis by not allowing Palestinians into Israel. A permanent way of achieving much the same result would be to allow the Palestinians their own state, and draw a firm frontier between it and Israel.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Without ever publicly saying so, Israel's Labour government was coming to see a separate Palestinian state as the most feasible answer to the problem of co-existence. A map had been secretly drawn, clustering most of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank in a new, safely Israeli, bulge of the old green line--an adjustment that would cause endurable pain to both sides. It was a good compromise, but Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Peres were both too cautious to back it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A chance for Mr Netanyahu to show up his predecessors' lack of courage? Why not? If the candle of peace is not soon relit, the next spark will set off a conflagration, perhaps extending far into the Arab world. None of the ways forward is safe--and standing still could be the most dangerous of all. Given the choices, the boldest step could be the safest.<br>

<h2>By Kabul ford</h2>
<p><b>Taliban forces </b>occupied Kabul, the Afghan capital, executed a former communist president, Najibullah, and imposed strict Islamic law. They prepared to attack the Panjshir valley, stronghold of Ahmad Shah Masoud, the military chief of the country's ousted government.</p>
<p>In response, Russia called for a summit of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States to discuss <b>Afghanistan</b>, amid fears that the taking of Kabul could strengthen the hand of Islamic rebels in neighbouring Tajikistan. Alexander Lebed, Russia's national security adviser, said Russia should help the Afghan government, driven out by the Taliban.</p>
<p><b>Kashmir</b>'s National Conference party, which wants the state to remain part of India, swept to victory in the first local elections since a separatist revolt broke out in 1990. </p>
<p>Myanmar's military government blockaded the home of <b>Aung San Suu Kyi </b>after she called a meeting of her National League for Democracy. Soldiers detained more than 500 of her supporters, later releasing 163.</p>
<p>New Zealand apologised to a <b>Maori tribe </b>for occupying its land 131 years ago and hanging its chief. The government agreed to pay NZ$40m ($27.6m) in compensation.</p>
<h2>Bleak talks</h2>
<p>After being summoned for two days of<b> crisis talks</b> on the Middle East as Bill Clinton's guests at the White House,<b> </b>Binyamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat could agree on nothing, except to continue negotiating when they returned home. Jordan's King Hussein was in attendance but Egypt's President Mubarak declined, reflecting the Arab belief that Mr Clinton was not prepared to exert real pressure on Israel to save the peace process.</p>
<p><b>Palestinians</b> in the West Bank and Gaza remained under strict "internal closure", unable to leave their neighbourhoods. Israeli tanks ringed their cities, and the army threatened to shoot anyone coming near checkpoints. A Palestinian demonstrator was killed near Hebron.</p>
<p>Commonwealth ministers abandoned talk of sanctions against <b>Nigeria</b>, agreeing to send a fact-finding mission-- and even that without guarantees, demanded earlier, that it would be able to meet opposition groups.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<h2>Petty cash</h2>
<p>Before Congress adjourned for <b>serious campaigning</b>, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed a $400 billion budget, ensuring that the American government could continue to operate while its representatives were on the road.</p>
<p>Congress also sent Bill Clinton a bill to strengthen <b>the border patrol </b>and to increase criminal penalties against smuggling aliens and document fraud. The Republicans wanted much tougher legislation that would have prevented illegal aliens receiving benefits. </p>
<p>Governor Pete Wilson of California signed a bill, the first of its kind, barring the state government from buying goods made in <b>labour camps</b>.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court agreed to decide the constitutionality of state laws that stop doctors assisting terminally ill people to commit <b>suicide</b>.</p>
<p><b>Colombia</b> saw more clashes between guerrillas and army. Six government men died in one day.</p>
<h2>Converging</h2>
<p>Several members of the European Union presented budgets designed to make them fit for <b>economic and monetary union</b>. Italy shocked financial markets by doubling its planned savings for next year, giving the country an outside chance of qualifying for <font size=-1>EMU</font> in 1999. Spain and Belgium unveiled tough fiscal programmes as well.</p>
<p>France's prime minister, Alain Jupp<e-acute>, won a <b>vote of confidence</b> in parliament, despite recent sniping from members of his own party. Mr Jupp<e-acute> defended his austere 1997 budget plan and promised action to reduce rising unemployment. Teachers staged a 24-hour strike against the budget.</p>
<p>Annual <b>inflation</b> in the European Union fell to a record low of 2.3% in August. Sweden's inflation rate of 0.3% was Europe's lowest; Greece's 8.5% rate was the highest. In all, nine of the 15 members had inflation rates below 2%.</p>
<p>The <font size=-1>UN</font> Security Council voted formally to end economic sanctions against <b>Serbia </b>after western observers approved the results of Bosnia's election. But Serbia is still excluded from the <font size=-1>UN</font> and international financial institutions like the World Bank.</p>

<h2>Bull run</h2>
<p>(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>American shares </b>powered upwards, taking the Dow Jones through 5,900 for the first time. The dollar squeaked above &#165;112 to a 32 month high, helped by weak Japanese production figures and a boost from housing starts in America. Bullishness invaded European markets too, with record highs in London--the <font size=-1>FTSE100</font> rising above 4,000--and several other markets. America's Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, speaking at the World Bank meeting in Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>, said the world economic outlook was the best in a "long, long time".</p>
<p>The European Union--supported by Canada--is to seek a ruling from the World Trade Organisation over whether America's recent <b>anti-Cuba legislation</b> violates international trade law.</p>
<p>Gold shares were pummelled after <b>gold</b> dropped through $380 an ounce, to stand about 9% down on its February high for the year.</p>
<h2>Downhill</h2>
<p>Shares in <b>Olivetti</b> fell after the Italian technology group admitted its net debt nearly doubled in only two months to almost 2.4 trillion lire ($1.6 billion) at the end of August and after a critical internal auditors' report. The loss making group has been spiralling downwards since the departure of Carlo De Benedetti as chairman some weeks ago, followed by more top executives amid accusations of false corporate reporting.</p>
<p>Germany's engineering union, <font size=-1>IG</font> Metall, promised a showdown if companies such as <b>Daimler-Benz</b>, which last week quickly took advantage of new rules to cut sick pay, pressed ahead with plans to renegotiate fringe benefits. Workers have been holding lightning strikes and stoppages in protest.</p>
<p><b>Eurotunnel</b> and its creditor banks at last reached agreement in principle on restructuring the Channel tunnel operator's &#163;8.8 billion ($13.8 billion) debt, repayment of which was suspended a year ago. Eurotunnel shares were themselves suspended as these negotiations were going on. <font size=-1>P&O</font> and Stena Lines are merging their Dover Straits ferry operations to compete with the tunnel.</p>
<p>Sweden's Autoliv, Europe's biggest maker of <b>airbags </b>and seatbelts, is to merge with a rival unit owned by America's Morton International to form a new company, with sales of around $3 billion, in control of 40% of the airbag market across America, Japan and Europe. No price was given. Morton will be left with its specialty-chemicals and salt business.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Koninklijke <font size=-1>PTT</font> Nederland, a Dutch post and telecoms group, launched a $1.6 billion bid for Australian-based <b>TNT</b>, a worldwide courier service that recommended the offer to its shareholders. Combined, the new outfit would have annual revenues of over A$6 billion ($4.7 billion) and operate in 200 countries. </p>
<p>(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Wayne Huizenga's ambitious plans to merge his fast-growing Republic Industries with <b>ADT</b>, America's biggest electronic-security business, with car-auction operations on the side, finally came unstuck. Investors took a dim view of the $4.4 billion all-share deal when it was announced on July 1st; Republic's shares took a battering then and began recovering only when investors felt the deal could founder.</p>
<p>A planned international offering of depositary receipts in <b>Gazprom</b>, Russia's biggest firm and the world's biggest gas producer, was overshadowed at home by a row over unpaid taxes. Faced with a government claim for an estimated $2.8 billion, Gazprom said that it was being unfairly targeted. The government announced it had drawn up a list of Russia's biggest tax debtors and was pursuing them all. </p>
<p><b>House of Fraser</b>, a British department-store chain, announced a deeper pre-tax loss of &#163;13.6m ($20.8m) in the first half, including a &#163;4.9m charge on the disposal of one of its stores, compared with a &#163;4.3m loss for the same period last year. The group said it will close up to ten of its 50 stores, centralise its distribution system and revive its women's wear sales, a restructuring that could cost as much as &#163;50m.</p>
<h2>Exchange changes</h2>
<p>After nine months of consultation with its members, the <b>London Stock Exchange </b> published a manifesto for change. The document maps out a move towards automated order-driven trading, which will replace a more costly quote-driven system, reliant on privileged market makers.</p>
<p>All change in <b>British insurance</b>. Norwich Union said it would convert from a mutually owned company to a publicly quoted one. And the Prudential Corporation, another life insurer, launched a branchless bank.</p>
<p>(See <a href="bw3.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>Global bond issues</b> have soared so far this year to a record $509 billion, already outstripping a full-year total of $465 billion for 1995, with the top ten bookrunners taking half the business. Two Japanese houses, Nomura and Daiwa, slid out of the top ten.</p>
<p>As much as a third of British bookmakers' &#163;100m ($156m) annual profits may have been wiped out, and one issued a profits warning, after one jockey, Frankie Dettori, swept the board to ride <b>all seven winners </b>at a race meeting at Ascot.</p>

<h1>Economists for Clinton</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC </font><p>
IT IS a sad reflection of the state of the presidential campaign that Bob Dole, a man not known for telegenic brilliance, is counting on a sparkling performance in Sunday's debate to revive his fortunes. Worse, judging by the results of a poll (see <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>) by <i>The Economist</i>, Mr Dole has already lost one of the groups whose approval he most craves: economists. We randomly selected 60 macroeconomists at America's top 15 universities (around half the total number). Almost 70% responded to our survey. By a margin of almost three to one, the academics reckon that a second Clinton term would be better for America's economy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given how much Mr Dole touts the academic respectability of his economic plan, these results are surprising. In a new newspaper advertisement, the Dole plan is lauded by Nobel laureates and endorsed by over 100 economists. "This is an excellent economic programme," writes Milton Friedman. "The Dole Economic Growth Plan is much superior to the Clinton do nothing alternative," says James Buchanan, another Nobel laureate. Eminent supporters perhaps, but it seems that many of their colleagues disagree. The general verdict seems to be satisfaction at the first Clinton administration and scepticism about Mr Dole's economic promises. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, we asked our boffins to grade Mr Clinton's economic record, much as they would evaluate a student's performance. Just under 30% of the academics award Mr Clinton an <font size=-1>A</font>; 51% give him a <font size=-1>B</font>. Only one judges that Mr Clinton has flunked on the economy, and gives him an <font size=-1>E</font>. Pollsters often put Mr Clinton's double-digit lead in the opinion polls down to a well-performing economy. The experts' verdict seems to bear out what ordinary Americans feel.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately for Mr Dole, our economists are distinctly unimpressed with the centrepiece of his economic platform--big tax cuts. Only 22% support his ambitious tax plan, while 46% prefer Mr Clinton's modest tax-tinkering proposals (and a hefty 32% do not like either). "Both  are bad, but Clinton's is less irresponsible," is a typical view. Those who approve of the Dole plan are at least entertainingly honest about the reason for their support: "I helped prepare it," was one comment; "I will pay less taxes," was another. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overall, however, few think that Mr Dole's numbers add up. Only one in five professors reckons Mr Dole will be able to recoup as much of the cost of tax cuts through higher revenue as he hopes, and even fewer accept his claims about cutting taxes and balancing the budget by 2002 without further restraint on Medicare and defence spending. Mr Dole's belief that this achievement is just a matter of "presidential will" cuts little ice with the experts.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A surprising slice of economists (49%) even takes issue with Mr Dole's basic assumption--that growth should be America's top economic-policy priority. For many, questions of income distribution and poverty are higher on the agenda. Others have more esoteric priorities: one professor thinks that legalising drugs should be one of America's top economic concerns. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The academics are equally wary of Republican claims that America's economic growth rate can, in fact, be dramatically boosted. In our poll, only 5% think that America's trend rate of non-inflationary growth could realistically be raised above 3% a year. Around one-third reckon it could be bumped up to between 2.6% and 3%. But most (almost 60%) say an economy growing at 2.5% or less is the most realistic target.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We asked our experts to grade various policies according to their growth-enhancing potential. Again, the idea of tax cuts fares poorly. Only a small minority of our economists (12%) believe that a cut in marginal tax rates--with corresponding spending cuts--would have a major impact on growth. A larger group (41%) think it might have a minor impact, but 34% reckon such cuts would have a negligible effect. Were the tax cuts not accompanied by spending cuts, almost half the professors think the impact on growth would be harmful. Only one policy option is even less popular: looser monetary policy. Six out of ten economists reckon that this would be harmful for long-term growth.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ironically, perhaps, some of Mr Dole's other proposals find strong support among the boffins. More than four out of five think that education reform would give a major (51%) or minor (34%) boost to growth rates. In fact, when asked to give their top three priorities for raising growth rates, over 70% of the academics mention education. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One in four believes a lighter regulatory burden would make a big difference to growth rates; almost 50% say it would provide a small boost. And more than eight out of ten reckon that tax reform towards consumption taxes could help growth (24% predict the effect would be big; 61% say it would be minor). All told, 63% of the economists support fundamental tax reform, with the flat tax emerging as the most popular option. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite this strong support for radical tax changes, America's top economists seem an unradical lot. When asked which party combination between the White House and Congress they would prefer for the next four years, over 50% want divided government: ie, a Democratic president and at least one chamber of Congress held by Republicans. Only one in four would like to see Democrats in charge on the Hill and in the White House; even fewer (17%) want Republicans running both places. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not only do few top economists want Mr Dole in the White House; even fewer seem prepared to help him if he ever gets there. Only 5% of our respondents admit they would take a job in a Dole administration. One-third would accept a job in a Clinton administration, and almost 60% say they would turn down any offer. Too high-minded for the hurly-burly of Washington? Or not to be taken too seriously?<br>

<h2>Trends of the week</h2><b>Hotspot:</b> The Middle East. Mr Clinton convenes a Washington summit to salvage the peace process, to accusations of "photo-op foreign policy" from Bob Dole.<br>
<p align=center>***</p>
<b>Sunspot: </b>Bal Harbour. Mr Dole retreats to his Florida condo to prepare for the presidential debate on October 6th. "Late Show" host David Letterman quips: "He wants to be tanned and well-rested for his concession speech."<br>
<p align=center>***</p>
<b>Blind spots:</b> Barely half of those asked in one poll know that Mr Dole has a disability. Another poll reveals that one in four voters do not know that Ross Perot is running at all, and nearly four out of ten cannot name Jack Kemp as Mr Dole's running mate.<br>
<p align=center>***</p>
<b>Ignored spots:</b> The 17 states where neither Mr Dole nor Mr Clinton delivered a major speech or advertised significantly in September, according to the Annenberg School for Communication. The states: Alabama, Alaska, the Carolinas, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Oklahoma, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, Vermont and Wyoming.<br>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>

<b>Verdict: </b>A federal judge rejects Mr Perot's effort to force his way into the presidential debates, but gives the right to appeal against the verdict before the first debate, in Hartford on Sunday.<br>
<p align=center>***</p>
<b>Promise: </b>Campaigning in California, Mr Kemp pledges not merely to halve capital gains tax, as promised in the Dole plan, but to eliminate it by the end of the century.<br>

<b>Counter-barb:</b> Mr Dole on Mr Clinton in Kirtland, Ohio: "Would you buy a used election promise from this man?"<br>

<b>Rush: </b>To leave Washington. The 104th Congress wraps up its (less-than-revolutionary) business, and lawmakers dash home to campaign to be in the 105th. <br>
<p align=center>***</p>
<b>Tip: </b>Watch how the New York Yankees perform in the baseball play-offs. Since 1945, they have appeared in five election year World Series. When they lose (1960, 1964, 1976), a Democrat wins the White House; when they win (1952, 1956), the Republican triumphs.<br>

<h1>Israelis divided</h1>

<font size=1>JERUSALEM </font><p>
LAST week's bloodshed has hardened Israelis in their polarised beliefs. Peace Now, a grassroots movement, staged a large anti-government demonstration in Tel Aviv on October 1st. But pro-government demonstrators too were filling the streets. Their red and blue banners, "Be Strong and of Good Courage", greet motorists driving from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Early polls show a we-told-you-so reaction from both sides of the divide. The right, whose slogan two years ago was, "Don't give them  guns", feel vindicated. On the left, politicians and demonstrators are demanding an inquiry into Mr Netanyahu's decision to open the tunnel--a demand fuelled by the continuing efforts of the defence minister, the army senior command and the Shin Bet security service to distance themselves from the timing of that decision.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In Washington, Mr Netanyahu confounded the politicians plotting his downfall. At the height of last week's violence, he blustered in public, but seemed at a loss for what to do. Mutterings began to be heard even within his own camp about his fitness for the job. Some Likud old-timers have always regarded the 46-year-old, American educated Mr Netanyahu as an<i> arriviste</i> lightweight and (with hindsight) see his decision to open the tunnel as a product of inexperience and brashness.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In former times, a groundswell would have developed to replace Mr Netanyahu with another Likud figure. But under the reformed Israeli constitution, a prime minister is directly elected and hard to shift. And Mr Netanyahu's firmness in Washington has, at least for now, silenced his critics. The jubilant right, across its spectrum, has hailed him as a hero.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The left is close to despair, its one hope for peace being that a re-elected Mr Clinton will apply the pressure he dare not apply now. The crisis had ignited the Labour opposition's hope of being invited to join a government of national unity. With that in mind, diehard supporters of Shimon Peres gathered on October 2nd to demand that he stay on indefinitely as leader of the Labour Party. Under its rules, the party must vote for a new leader within 14 months of an electoral defeat. Mr Peres, 73, has said he will not stand again, and half-a-dozen candidates, headed by Ehud Barak, a former foreign minister and army chief of staff, would be happy to succeed him. But with the peace process on the verge of dying, said his supporters, Labour must not jettison the man who largely brought it into being and may yet be called on to revive it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One man could force Mr Netanyahu to broaden his government: Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual mentor of the Sephardic-religious party, Shas, which, with ten seats, is a pivotal coalition ally. On September 29th, both Mr Peres and Mr Netanyahu made (separate) Feast of Tabernacles calls on him. He merely requested the rivals to "consult", which they dutifully did.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the occupied territories, the settlers are now rejoicing. And the army is poised to deal the Palestinians devastating punishment. Senior officers say they have been ordered to use all the firepower they need to crush any renewed assaults on military checkpoints or other targets by Palestinian civilians or policemen. The army is smarting, particularly, over an episode on September 26th, when six soldiers were killed in a fight at a Jewish holy site in Nablus. Next time, says the army, we go in with tanks, barrels blazing if necessary. The tanks are already in position.<br>

<h1>Under threat</h1>

<font size=1>RAMALLAH </font><p>
IT WAS the worst violence in the occupied territories since 1967: 73 people killed, 58 of them Palestinian, and 1,500 injured. Palestinians hope that last week's fighting will convince everybody that the Oslo peace process cannot endure under the terms dictated by Israel's hardline prime minister. But they fear the worst, and the news from Washington confirmed their gloom: the peace process is "on the verge of collapse", said the mayor of Hebron. In Jerusalem Faisal Husseini, the <font size=-1>PLO</font>'s top man there, said he "was never as pessimistic as today".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Israelis, in their fashion, seem to agree. After last week's fighting, they slapped an "internal closure" on the West Bank and Gaza. Some 2m Palestinians are immobilised, within their local "autonomous areas", with Israeli tanks ringing the main cities and helicopter gunships at the ready. Even the sick are barred from moving from their homes in one area to hospitals in another. Under orders from Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian police are keeping people away from Israeli army checkpoints. Wisely: the army has said it will shoot on sight any Palestinian who comes near its soldiers. Already, on October 2nd, one demonstrator near Hebron was shot dead and others wounded.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ominously, the army has suspended all joint patrols with the Palestinian police, pending a "thorough investigation" into the breakdown of security co-ordination which led to gun battles between the two forces. Palestinians can guess what this means. The Oslo process is predicated on co-operation between the two forces. If this is abandoned, so too is Oslo. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Were the gun battles the result of a calculated gamble by Mr Arafat to force Mr Netanyahu's hand and get the process moving again? So the Israeli government says. Palestinians believe that once their demonstrations were met by Israeli army gunfire--and that was the sequence of events in Ramallah and Gaza last week--the Palestinian police were bound to fire back.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Mr Arafat certainly decided to raise the stakes, after Mr Netanyahu authorised a new exit from the tunnel in Jerusalem's Old City. A month earlier he had a poor response when he called on Palestinians to converge on Jerusalem in protest at Israel's decision to demolish a centre for disabled Palestinians and build 900 new homes for Jewish settlers. His people muttered darkly that Mr Arafat was losing support.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The tunnel business gave him a chance to regain it. He called on Palestinians to resist Israel's "Judaisation of Jerusalem". He did not spell out how they should resist. But after nearly 30 years of occupation, and seven of <i>intifada</i>--the popular uprising that began in 1987--he did not need to.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difference now is the presence of some 40,000 Palestinian policemen, with weapons, albeit only light ones. In East Jerusalem--from where they are excluded-- the protests were all-civilian, though even so three Palestinians were killed after demonstrations outside al-Aqsa mosque. But in the Palestinian areas of the West Bank and Gaza,<i> intifada</i> rules no longer apply. Last week the incendiary mix of the Israeli army, the Palestinian police and stone-throwing civilians exploded. The policemen's controllers in the Palestinian Authority (<font size=-1>PA</font>) admit that they lost control. So, therefore, did Mr Arafat.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He did, however, recover it. By the weekend, Gaza was quiet, and Bethlehem and Ramallah under control. In Nablus, where the Israeli army lost six soldiers after trying to protect the besieged, Israeli-controlled, religious site known as Joseph's Tomb, the Palestinian police imposed a curfew on their own people.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Israeli government is demanding that the <font size=-1>PA</font> dismiss and prosecute those policemen--some 200 of them, says the Israeli army--who shot at Israeli soldiers. This will not happen. In Washington, Mr Arafat committed himself to a general end to violence. But he is not going to condemn members of his security forces for defending their own people. To do so would further undermine his leadership. It would also risk fracturing his security forces, on which he depends.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And Oslo? "The peace process is already dead, and has been since Mr Netanyahu was elected," says Marwan Barghouti, Fatah's leader in the West Bank. "Our protests are aimed at restoring it to life." Should the resuscitation fail, Mr Barghouti is clear what comes next. "War," he says.<br>

<p><b>Conservative Party 2</b></p>
<h1>A right lot </h1>

WIN or lose, the Conservative Party seems sure to lurch to the right after the general election, a special <i>Economist </i> survey of prospective parliamentary candidates suggests. Moreover, supposing the party is defeated and John Major resigns, the survey also indicates that the intake of new <font size=-1>MP</font>s will boost John Redwood's chances of becoming the Tory leader.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The survey was conducted between July and September among prospective Tory candidates in 75 seats where the present Tory <font size=-1>MP</font> had indicated an intention to stand down--ie, seats where prospective Tory candidates have the best chance of entering Parliament. Of these candidates, 46, or 61% of the total, sent usable replies. We also surveyed all the retiring Tory <font size=-1>MP</font>s in the same constituencies, asking them the same set of questions. Of these, 40% replied.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We tested opinion in three spheres of policy. Naturally, one was Europe, where we sought to measure Euroscepticism and attitudes towards a single European currency. Another was social liberalism, where our chosen indicator was their attitude to the death penalty. Another was economic wetness or dryness, where we asked whether they would favour tax cuts even if they meant spending less on health, education and social benefits. We also asked how they would vote in a post-election leadership contest.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The prospective candidates turn out to be a formidably right-wing lot. On Europe first, we asked them to rank themselves on a scale of one to five, one being the most pro European and five the most anti-European. Their score averaged 4.1: strongly sceptical. By comparison, among the retiring <font size=-1>MP</font>s, the average answer was 3.2. Not a single prospective candidate gave a pro-European answer of one or two. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Again, among the 46 Conservative candidates who replied, not one favoured a single currency. Indeed most of them were very hostile to the idea. By contrast, although some retiring <font size=-1>MP</font>s who replied were for a single currency and others against it, they fall on average roughly in the middle of the five-point scale.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although there is no chance of Parliament restoring the death penalty, the prospective candidates favour it, by a three-to one majority. By contrast, retiring Tory <font size=-1>MP</font>s are evenly divided. Moreover, two-thirds of candidates want tax cuts even at the expense of spending cuts. Only a quarter of retiring <font size=-1>MP</font>s felt that way.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for a future leadership contest, most of our respondents, among both retiring <font size=-1>MP</font>s and new candidates, kept their counsel. In both groups a dozen or so possible candidates have some support. But among the prospective candidates, the name of John Redwood is the most often cited (by eight), while several others back the alternative right-wing contenders, Michael Howard and Michael Portillo. Four retiring <font size=-1>MP</font>s cited Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, as their preferred candidate for leader. He was not mentioned by a single prospective candidate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few warnings should be attached to these findings. First, the sample among retiring <font size=-1>MP</font>s was small, and may have a left wing bias since <font size=-1>MP</font>s who are fed up with the rightward drift of the Conservative Party may have been the most likely to take the opportunity of our survey to register their protest. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, we do not know how many of these candidates will actually make it into Parliament. If there is a strong anti-Tory swing at the next general election, many may lose the seats they are fighting. Finally, Westminster has a famously cooling effect on firebrands. Once they get there, many candidates may moderate their views. Labour's ranks in the Commons are full of <font size=-1>MP</font>s who today follow Tony Blair but who once followed Tony Benn.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, on the eve of the Tory party conference, our survey will give valuable ammunition to the Labour Party. The Tories have campaigned on the slogan: "New Labour, New Danger." On this evidence, Labour could respond "New Tory, New Danger" with more justification.<br>

<p><b>Conservative Party 3</b></p>
<h1>A forgiving lot </h1>

SHOULD John Major lose the general election, the favourite choice of Tory voters for the next leader is . . . John Major. More than a quarter of Tory voters want him to stay (see <a href="br1.gif">table</a>). He leads Michael Heseltine, preferred by 16%, with Margaret Thatcher the surprising third choice.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ostensibly, the Tory party conference, which opens in Bournemouth on October 8th, is about winning the election. But the succession to Mr Major is top of the real agenda. <i>The Economist</i> commissioned <font size=-1>MORI</font> to conduct an opinion poll to see whom voters wanted for the job. The firm interviewed 1,800 voters between September 20th and September 23rd.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Arguably, although Mr Major came top of the poll among Tory voters, after a defeat the party should be looking for the candidate with most appeal to voters generally. Here Mr Heseltine came top, though with only 16% of the vote. Mr Major was the second choice, with Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and John Redwood, the leading Eurosceptic, next.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conservatives are famously loyal to their leaders--at least until they decide to ditch them. This is borne out not only by Mr Major's strongish showing, but by that of Lady Thatcher, six years after she was deposed by her own <font size=-1>MP</font>s. But the poll also shows that candidates on the left of the party, such as Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke, run strongest. This is partly because they have held senior government jobs for longer than their rivals, and are therefore better known.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the two most right-wing and Eurosceptical of the candidates are also favoured by many voters. Mr Redwood, in particular, features remarkably well for a man whose highest office was Welsh secretary. In contrast, the most regularly cited compromise candidates do badly. Messrs Dorrell, Lang and Rifkind manage between them the support of only 3% of Tory voters and 4% of the general public. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, the next leader is not chosen by the public but by Tory <font size=-1>MP</font>s. The compromise candidates remain relatively unknown by the public, although clearly this would change rapidly for any one of them who got the job. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, voters in general and Tory voters in particular seem to want any new leader to come from candidates on the extremes of the Tory party rather than those at its centre. After a defeat, therefore, and on current showings, Conservative <font size=-1>MP</font>s might have to choose between a candidate with voter appeal and a candidate able to reunite their party. Perhaps the idea of keeping Mr Major on is not such a bad one after all.<br>

<p><b>Oxbridge</b></p>
<h1>Learning to earn </h1>

THE squeeze in government funding is beginning to hurt even Britain's richest universities. On October 1st, when Alec Broers became Cambridge's new vice-chancellor, he said his university would be in deficit within four years unless it found new sources of income. Some old fogeys may grumble at having to "dirty their hands with commerce", but Cambridge and its arch-rival Oxford are realising that the only way to pay for world-class laboratories and researchers is to exploit the fruits of their work more energetically.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The appointment of Mr Broers is a sign of such changing attitudes. Unlike his predecessors, he has spent much of his career in industry: for 20 years, he worked for <font size=-1>IBM</font>, an American computer giant. He promises that in seeking to boost the university's private income, he will consider "any reasonable proposal", such as letting firms set up their own laboratories within the university, or creating joint ventures in which the university holds a stake.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although Cambridge has already had a fair amount of success in fostering a cluster of growing high-tech firms in its science parks, Mr Broers wants his researchers to think big, and to model themselves on Hewlett-Packard--once a small firm sheltering in the shadow of California's Stanford University, now a giant multinational with annual sales of $30 billion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oxford has lagged behind Cambridge in creating spin-off companies. Now it is starting to catch up. Oxford Science Park is expanding rapidly, and Brian Richards, an entrepreneur who has founded a string of biotechnology firms, has been recruited to oversee a more ambitious strategy at Isis Innovation, a company set up to market the university's intellectual-property rights.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last month Sharp, a Japanese electronics firm, opened a &#163;5m extension to its laboratory in the science park. A second building was also opened, to provide larger premises for five of the park's other fast growing firms. Further building work is about to start. The park now has a waiting list of would-be technology entrepreneurs queueing to get in.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Paul Drayson, managing director of Oxford BioSciences, a firm spun out of the university's medical-engineering unit, is convinced that Oxford is about to witness an explosion of innovation in disciplines such as his. He is urging the science park's managers to accelerate the park's expansion so that the university's keen young researchers do not take their ideas elsewhere.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Encouraging such entrepreneurship, while making sure that the university gets its share of the proceeds, is Isis Innovation's primary task. Up to now, it has tried to sell most of the university's good ideas to big firms. Mr Richards is planning a more adventurous strategy: he wants researchers to set up more companies to exploit their own ideas commercially, with the university as a shareholder. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Isis Innovation has been hampered by hostility from a few academics who see it as a sort of Frankenstein's monster in their midst and who abhor the very idea of the university getting into bed with industry. Mr Richards admits that overcoming such opposition is one of his main challenges, and that this will limit the amount of money that the university will allow him to spend on fostering high-tech spin-offs. But fortunately, claims Mr Richards, such old fashioned attitudes are waning. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It will be years before Oxford and Cambridge earn anything like as much from their private-sector spin-offs as the &#163;180m a year of government research funding they now share. But the potential exists: Oxford Science Park's star performer is Oxford Molecular, which makes software for drug design and now has a stockmarket value of &#163;196m--which means that the university's 6% shareholding is worth almost &#163;12m.<br>

<p><b>Airline alliances</b></p>
<h1>Too cosy </h1>

FEW industrial battles are fought for higher stakes than competition for airline slots. Ian Lang, the secretary of state for trade and industry, is coming under increasing pressure from his cabinet colleagues to nod through the proposed alliance between British Airways (<font size=-1>BA</font>) and American Airlines, two of the world's biggest airlines, without insisting on strict conditions that would reduce their dominance of transatlantic routes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to authoritative sources in Whitehall, Mr Lang was advised this week by John Bridgeman, the director-general of the Office of Fair Trading (<font size=-1>OFT</font>), that the alliance should be approved without a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The <font size=-1>OFT</font> originally took a hawkish stance, insisting that the two airlines should hand over to competitors up to a quarter of the landing and take-off slots they control at Heathrow. <font size=-1>BA</font> alone has 38% of the slots out of London. The combined share with American Airlines and other airlines with which both firms are allied would be nearly 50%. Only a significant divestment of slots, the <font size=-1>OFT</font> first concluded, could reduce the competitive advantage that <font size=-1>BA</font> and American Airlines would gain from their alliance.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, it appears that the <font size=-1>OFT</font> has considerably diluted these conditions after hearing the two airlines' arguments. The <font size=-1>OFT</font> is now maintaining that <font size=-1>BA</font>'s deal with American is not seriously anti-competitive when it is viewed in the wider European context, where the two airlines control less than a quarter of transatlantic traffic.<b></b><br>
 Mr Lang ought to view the <font size=-1>OFT</font>'s revised recommendations with scepticism. <font size=-1>BA</font> and American Airlines plan to co-ordinate their schedules, combine frequent-flier programmes and share revenues from transatlantic flights. They already control nearly 70% of the flights on the busy London-New York route. No wonder rival airlines such as United and Virgin cry foul. Robert Ayling, <font size=-1>BA</font>'s chief executive, replies that several European and American airlines already have similar code-sharing deals. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Lang's dilemma is complicated by the fact that British-American negotiations on an "open skies" agreement to relax restrictions on foreign airlines operating in the two countries will remain stalled unless the deal goes through. <font size=-1>BA</font> will drop its opposition to greater access for airlines from the United States only if the alliance is approved. American Airlines, for its part, has threatened to walk away from the deal unless it is quickly approved.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Lang should ignore both threat and promise and concentrate on the core of the problem: the need to free up capacity. The excess demand for landing rights at Heathrow is so great that it reinforces the dominance of the airlines that control the peak-hour slots. Unless more landing rights are made available to new entrants, the freer competition of any "open skies" agreement will remain illusory. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Landing charges at Heathrow, one of the most congested airports in the world, are already among the cheapest anywhere. Incredibly, they are about to fall still further while charges at the nearly empty Stansted on the other side of London are about to rise. The chief beneficiaries of this dotty pricing policy are foreign airlines. Low charges are not passed on to passengers as reduced fares because Heathrow's capacity constraints restrict competition.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Landing charges are not, however, the crux of the problem. Industry insiders reckon Heathrow is so popular that the charges could probably be trebled without affecting demand. The ideal solution would be to auction slots to the highest bidder. This would raise the cost of using Heathrow, making Stansted--where demand for slots would initially be far less-- much more attractive. But the rights of airlines to routes acquired over the years cannot just be brushed aside.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more practical approach was outlined in a report published by the House of Commons' Transport Committee earlier this year. It proposed that landing charges at Heathrow should be increased and the additional revenues allocated to an environmental fund. A better balance between the interests of airlines, of people who live near busy airports and of taxpayers could be achieved if increased landing charges, reflecting Heathrow's environmental costs, were combined with the regular auction of any newly available slots created through expansion of the airport or through the withdrawal from Heathrow of any airline. These are the issues which Mr Lang and the government should be tackling, rather than paving the way for a further concentration of commercial power in the hands of <font size=-1>BA</font> and American Airlines.<br>

<p><b>Air pollution</b></p>
<h1>Electric Jersey </h1>

THINK of cars and the island of Jersey in the English Channel, and it conjures up an image of the <font size=-1>TV</font> detective Bergerac sleuthing around the bailiwick in his 1940s Triumph <font size=-1>TR1</font> roadster. Now Jersey is turning its back on such romantic but smoky old clunkers. If Jim Bergerac were to come back in a new series, he might be at the wheel of an electric car. From next April visitors to the island will be able to hire electric cars from their hotel for the same price as a petrol-driven Ford Escort. Jersey's experiment, the brainchild of Nigel Philpott, the island's director of tourism, will be the most extensive test of private electric vehicles in the British Isles (not counting golf carts and milk floats). If the trial works, Mr Philpott would like to persuade all hire cars to go electric. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Islanders are worried that more petrol cars crawling over their leafy lanes will destroy Jersey's charm with a combination of noise and air pollution. The island has 724 inhabitants per square kilometre, three times more than Britain and twice continental Europe's most densely-populated country, the Netherlands. Jersey also has a lot of cars: 77,000 (including lorries and buses), or 663 vehicles per square kilometre, almost as many vehicles as people. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of these are hired cars used by tourists. So Mr Philpott has roped in the local electricity company, some hotels and a local car-hire company to set up a system whereby selected hotels will have reserved parking spots for electric cars which visitors can book in advance. Since the island is small, a range of around 70 miles is no problem. Jersey Electric, the local utility, has staged trials with electric Peugeots and Citro<e-dierisis>ns. But it looks as if Toyota will win the contract to supply vehicles for Mr Philpott's much bigger experiment.<br>

<p><b>Dell Computer</b></p>
<h1>Selling PCs like bananas </h1>

MAKING personal computers used to be a war of engineers, each seeking a cleverer way to solder circuit boards. Now often it is the accountants who rule the battlefield. With <font size=-1>PC</font> manufacturing largely reduced to snapping together pre-assembled parts, the distance between market winner and loser is measured more often in inventory turns and stock management than megahertz and kilobytes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That helps explain why Dell Computer is now the darling of Wall Street. Since January, the <font size=-1>PC</font> maker's share price has risen by more than 250%. Its profits in the latest quarter were up nearly 60% over a year earlier. Although the company claims the usual advantages for its technology and management, Dell's success really boils down to one thing: while most <font size=-1>PC</font> makers sell through shops, resellers, and systems integrators, Dell sells directly to customers, mostly by telephone. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The advantage of direct sales is more than eliminating the middleman's mark up. It can also eliminate the two months or more of delay in which a <font size=-1>PC</font> typically languishes in warehouses and on store shelves waiting to be sold. This is more important than it might seem: when it comes to inventory, <font size=-1>PC</font>s are like ripe fruit not bent metal. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;About 80% of the cost of a <font size=-1>PC</font> is made up of components, such as the processor chip, that fall in price by an average of 30% a year. Each day those parts sit on the shelf, they become a worse deal. In the best of times, too much inventory leaves a <font size=-1>PC</font> maker with machines that are priced higher than speedier competitors. At the worst of times, when a manufacturer is caught on the cusp of a big change in technology--such as the transition from the <font size=-1>486</font> chip to the Pentium--it can be left with millions of dollars of out-of-date <font size=-1>PC</font>s. It then either has to compensate stores to unload the white elephants at a loss, or ship them to the developing world to sell on the cheap. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Direct sales also help Dell around one of the trickiest bits of the industry: forecasting. Because some 500,000 customers call Dell's operators each week, it can gauge trends in demand more quickly--and so plan more effectively--than firms that get their data indirectly from stores.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The combination of these two advantages allows Dell to run one of the tightest manufacturing operations in the industry. It turns over its inventory every 14 days on average, compared to about 50 days for Compaq, the best of the indirect <font size=-1>PC</font> makers. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, says this alone gives Dell a 3% cost advantage over Compaq, and twice that over more typical indirect makers, whose inventory is often 100 days (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lower costs allow Dell to charge lower prices, which is largely why customers are willing to take a chance on buying a <font size=-1>PC</font> unseen. Throughout 1995 and 1996 Dell has been growing at nearly 50% a year in a market growing by just 20%. This has pushed its share of the market up to nearly 4%, making it the world's fifth-largest <font size=-1>PC</font> maker in a fragmented business, where even the leader, Compaq, has less than 10%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Dell's success this year also owes a lot to one event that is unlikely to recur. The price of memory chips, which make up about 20% of the cost of a <font size=-1>PC</font>, has plummeted by more than two-thirds since January. That has meant that by the time many of its indirect competitors' <font size=-1>PC</font>s arrived at their customer's door, the memory chips in them were worth half what they paid for them. Dell's, which had been received just two weeks before the customer got them, had lost only a few percent of their value. Goldman Sachs reckons that this pushed Dell's cost advantage up to more than 8%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dell is not the only direct <font size=-1>PC</font> vendor: its biggest competitor in this market, Gateway 2000, is also booming, although it has focused more on consumers while Dell sells mostly to businesses. Direct <font size=-1>PC</font> sales have gone in and out of fashion for more than a decade, rarely rising above a market niche. Big corporate customers generally want some local intermediary who is within reach when things go wrong, while individual consumers usually prefer to touch a <font size=-1>PC</font> before they buy it. The fastest-growing <font size=-1>PC</font> market, the home, has traditionally been a retail stronghold.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, this was nearly Dell's undoing. In the early 1990s, concerned that by sticking to direct sales it would miss out on the biggest market, it dived into retail sales. It soon discovered that the market punishes companies that try to have it both ways. The moment Dell offered a new computer model through its direct channel, the older computers still on shop shelves immediately lost a big chunk of their value, forcing Dell to compensate retailers. It pulled out of the retail market in 1994, and has been rewarded with record profits ever since. "Every time we steer away from the direct model, we get a cold shower," says Tom Meredith, Dell's chief financial officer. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same "channel conflict", Mr Meredith reckons, will keep the biggest indirect <font size=-1>PC</font> makers out of Dell's niche. And the rise of Internet commerce--an even more efficient form of direct selling--should help the niche grow. The direct route may never be the biggest slice of the <font size=-1>PC</font> pie, but Dell's accountants are keen to keep it the most profitable.<br>

<p><b>Satellite television in Japan</b></p>
<h1>Reaching for the stars</h1>

<font size=1>TOKYO</font><p>
<p><b>Digital satellite television has been a huge hit in the United States, but a disappointment in its brief life in Germany. Which will it be in Japan?</b></p>
WITHIN 18 months of its launch in America, digital satellite <font size=-1>TV</font> had scooped up 3m subscribers. In Germany, by contrast, subscriptions to the Kirch group's new service appear to be well below expectations (see <a href="wb8375.html">page</a>). Now it is the turn of Japan. The country's first digital television service, Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>! (<i>sic</i>, in more ways than one), started commercial broadcasting on October 1st. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The good news for the companies betting that the Japanese are willing to pay well for more television is that the Japanese are ardent televiewers, spending an average of 4.25 hours a day glued to the box. On the other hand, they appear to have little taste for foreign programmes, and already have more channels to choose between than most Europeans. They also have, in <font size=-1>NHK</font>, a politically powerful public broadcaster which has usually topped the ratings. And past experience with commercial satellite broadcasting has been bleak: the main analogue venture, <font size=-1>WOWOW</font>, racked up debts faster than subscribers at first. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nonetheless, a few moments' channel surfing suggests plenty of scope for improvement. Japanese broadcasters and cable companies have grown fat by serving up a mushy diet of chat shows, panel games and soap operas. Since Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>! began its free trial period on June 30th, Japan's media bosses have begun to fear that they may not be calling the shots for much longer. Industry watchers believe the parents of Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>!--four Japanese trading houses (Itochu, Nissho Iwai, Mitsui and Sumitomo) and Japan Satellite Systems (<font size=-1>JSAT</font>), a satellite operator--will easily sign up the 300,000 subscribers they want by next March, and may have 2m within five years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even as it starts to charge, Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>! may strike subscribers as a bargain. For around &#165;2,900 ($26) a month, viewers get 57 channels of pin-sharp television and 103 channels of radio with <font size=-1>CD</font>-like sound. The snag is that subscribers will also have to pay &#165;50,000 or more for yet another set-top box and satellite dish to receive Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>!'s compressed signal. At present, the 9.4m subscribers to Japan's three competing analogue satellite services need a different brand of set-top box and costly antennae for each one. Will they invest in a fourth?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason they may is that, to the dismay of Japanese television executives, the digital newcomers have begun to rally around a single standard. Come next summer, viewers who have bought receiving equipment for Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>! will also be able to tune in to <font size=-1>J</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, a 100-channel digital satellite-television service being developed jointly by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Softbank, a Japanese software and media conglomerate. Mr Murdoch has shrewdly chosen to use the big new <font size=-1>JCSAT-3</font> satellite owned by <font size=-1>JSAT</font>, one of Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>!'s parents. As a result, subscribers to both satellite services will be able to use the same set-top box and miniature dish.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other digital broadcasters are expected to follow suit--or, at least, to make their services as compatible as possible. Direc<font size=-1>TV</font>, a digital satellite-<font size=-1>TV</font> operator owned by General Motors' Hughes Electronics in Los Angeles, is planning to launch a 100-channel service in Japan later next year. The American aerospace firm has teamed up with Culture Convenience Club, Japan's largest video-rental chain. Direc<font size=-1>TV</font>--like <font size=-1>J</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>--may decide to use the same family of Hughes-built satellites adopted by Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>!. With one small dish on the roof, one decoder box on the television set and one remote control in the hand, the Japanese could be surfing hundreds of television channels within a year or two. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To flourish, the new satellite broadcasters need to see off competition from the cable industry. With typically no more than 150,000 subscribers apiece, most of Japan's cable systems operators are more threatened than threatening, and ripe for consolidation. A greater threat may be the handful of big operators. Jupiter Telecommunications, the biggest, is a joint venture between Sumitomo and Tele-Communications Inc, America's largest cable operator. Set up in March 1995, Jupiter already has the franchise for accessing some 2.5m homes in western Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka. Its state-of-the-art networks will carry telephone messages as well as data and television programmes. It is developing four new television channels--movies, golf, shopping and documentaries--for this year and six more for 1997. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Japan's commercial networks--<font size=-1>TBS</font>, <font size=-1>NTV</font>, Fuji and <font size=-1>TV</font> Asahi--are in a much stronger position. Their audiences remain vast; and they still have an arm-lock on national advertising revenues. But they now face the prospect of having to invest heavily in digital broadcasting. In 1994 some government officials wanted to bring forward the date at which all the country's <font size=-1>TV</font> would be broadcast digitally from 2010 to 1999-- only to have their plan shredded by <font size=-1>NHK</font>, which had sunk billions in developing an analogue form of high-definition <font size=-1>TV</font>. Now even <font size=-1>NHK</font> is expected to go digital soon.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The question is: what will viewers pay for? Although American soaps, baseball and golf shows will be plentiful, the Japanese will mainly want home-grown fare. That gives tremendous power to the companies that produce programmes, such as Japan Image Corporation, a consortium of 50 small production companies that has been signed up by Perfec<font size=-1>TV</font>! to provide shows for four of its forthcoming 70 channels. By 2000 <font size=-1>JIC</font> expects to supply a dozen channels-worth of content. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With up to 500 Japanese-language channels to feed, such production houses will bring Japan's most talented young producers streaming out of the television studios to seek their fortune. But only if the programmes they provide for the digital satellite services are at least as good as those from analogue broadcasters will digital television in Japan copy America's blast off, rather than Germany's sluggish start.<br>

<font size=1>BERLIN </font><p>
BEHIND a pillar in Berlin's leading electronics store is an expensive black box, for decoding the signal from digital satellite television. The salesman does not recommend it: bad value for money, he says. That is glum news for Leo Kirch, a media magnate. His Kirch group launched a digital pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> venture, <font size=-1>DF1</font>, in late July. It will succeed only if people can be persuaded to stump up DM880 ($576) for the box, plus a further DM20 a month subscription charge.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The signs so far are discouraging. <font size=-1>DF1</font> needs 1m subscribers to break even, and hopes to sign up 200,000 customers by Christmas. Since its launch, barely 10,000 have signed. The programmes (15 channels, plus, for an extra charge, pay-per view films) are not wildly different in either quality or quantity from those already available to German viewers who, on a typical weekend, can choose from 145 feature films and several hours of live football, all for free. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But trying to beat Mr Kirch on content is unwise. He has deals with all the main American studios apart from Rupert Murdoch's Fox, where one is expected soon, and controls the two best sets of sports rights--to the main German soccer league and the World Cup. He also has the financial backing of <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, Mr Murdoch's successful British pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> business, which has a 49% stake in <font size=-1>DF</font>1.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kirch's main problem will be to get his content to the viewers. His decoders are expensive and have been poorly marketed--probably because they were brought to market hurriedly. Besides, <font size=-1>DF</font>1 is currently available only on satellite. To sell <font size=-1>DF</font>1 to Germany's 16m cabled households requires the co-operation of Deutsche Telekom, the world's biggest cable operator. Until recently, Deutsche Telekom was competing against Mr Kirch in alliance with Bertelsmann, Germany's largest publishing house. Now it plans its own move into pay-<font size=-1>TV</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for Bertelsmann, it has pulled out of German digital pay-<font size=-1>TV</font>, complaining-- belatedly--that it is expensive and unprofitable. That may be sour grapes, although similar noises are coming from other parts of the Kirch empire. Pro7, a brash television channel run by Mr Kirch's son, recently said that it was pulling out of a planned pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> venture. "The biggest miscalculation we have seen," said one manager. It will concentrate on business programming instead. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the Berlin electronics shop the salesman sings the praises of the existing pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> channel, Premiere. This uses analogue technology. But after several years it is still not in operating profit. <font size=-1>DF</font>1 may have a similarly sluggish take-off. The clearest prospects for pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> are in servicing distinct markets: football, pornography, minority languages, films and--possibly--financial information. People will not pay much for something while they can watch it elsewhere for nothing.<br>

<h1>TECHNOLOGY BRIEF</h1>

<h2> </h2>
A word is worth 1,000 pictures<br>
 
<p><b>The second in our series of articles on why some new technologies fly and others flop looks at the wretched saga of the videophone, and asks whether the personal computer will come to its rescue</b></p><br>
HOW can you improve on the telephone? Since Alexander Graham Bell first ordered his assistant to "come here" 120 years ago, calls have become clearer, automatic switches have brought direct dialling, and digital ones have delivered nifty features such as conference calls and voice mail. Telephones have proliferated (the International Telecommunications Union estimates there are over 800m of them); and most recently they have become portable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But time and again, one enhancement has been rejected: the addition of pictures, either still or moving. Videophones, as they are known, were such techno-turkeys that telephone companies have at last stopped selling them altogether. One sign of their failure is that few consumers ever realised that they were on offer.<br>
Adding pictures to voice calls seems an obvious step--adding images to radio signals created television, and with it a huge new industry. But telephones have so far remained stubbornly photo-free. "Picturephone", developed at <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s Bell Labs, now part of Lucent Technologies, was first demonstrated in 1964. At the time, other telephone companies talked of public videophone booths in major cities. Three decades later, videophones are still a rarity.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first consumer devices to sell in any number appeared in Japan in 1988. They were a fiasco. Rather than adding an extra dimension to conversations, the gadgets detracted. Whenever callers wanted to send an image of themselves, they had to interrupt their telephone calls for six seconds for a blotchy, black-and white picture to be transmitted. Only 250,000 of the phones were sold, mostly in pairs to men who worked away from their families.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These gizmos were followed four years later by <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s VideoPhone 2500. Instead of still, black-and-white images, VideoPhone 2500 could send colour images that were updated a few times a second, although the screen, at five square inches, was hardly lavish. Like the Japanese device, VideoPhone 2500 flopped. Sales did not even reach 100,000 before the prices were slashed (they started off at $1,500). In the end, <font size=-1>AT&T</font> started to give the phones away.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Unwanted</b></b><br>

Certainly, videophones have been too expensive and their pictures too poor; cheaper phones and better images would undoubtedly have helped. But ultimately, they may have failed for a more basic reason: people just do not seem to want them. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Experience suggests that consumers will put up with high prices and low quality if they want the service on offer. There was great demand for crackly international phone calls (featuring bellowed exchanges of "Can you hear me?") even when they were ferociously expensive. The earliest mobile phones won fans despite their bulk and poor voice quality because people wanted to make telephone calls on the move. Because the demand was there, the technology improved rapidly: the price and quality of long-distance calls and mobile phones have improved as the market has expanded. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Videophones have never benefited from this virtuous circle. According to Tim Midwinter of <font size=-1>BT</font>'s Martlesham Heath research laboratories, the trouble is that when people make calls, they mostly want to talk. Ordinary telephones have been allowing this adequately for more than a century. Adding video, particularly when it is a jerky picture on a small screen, matters much less. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Videophones seem also to have suffered from another drawback. People make phone calls in any state of dress, or undress; while dirty or clean; and, perhaps most importantly, argues David Farber, a telephone expert at the University of Pennsylvania, while they are doing other things at the same time. Anecdotal evidence suggests that for many conversations, videophones would be more curse than blessing. Even <font size=-1>AT&T</font> executives were not immune: testing videophones in the 1960s, some would claim their systems were broken to avoid having to smarten up for each call.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A final defect of the videophone, compared, say, to the mobile one, is that it requires two to tango. If you are the only person you know who has one, who will you call? The same logic applied to the fax in its infancy--but lots of people saw they could benefit from having one. This has not been so for videophones. The model user became the grandmother who missed her grandchildren and had enough money to buy a pair. This market turned out to be tiny: <font size=-1>BT</font> sold only 10,000 of its domestic videophones between 1993 and 1995. Worse, if you bought a videophone from <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, but your granny in Scotland had one from <font size=-1>BT</font>, you would not be able to swap images with her.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So will the videophone always flop? Maybe not. Prearranged video conferences are becoming increasingly popular within companies, especially if they are seen as a way to cut down on overseas travel. A one hour video call between London and New York costs less than $150, and Dataquest, a research firm, estimates that more than 1m videoconferencing units will have been shipped by 1999. But these are usually large bits of specialist equipment that sit in the boardroom--hardly the omnipresent, friendly telephone handset.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The technology for one-to one video calls is, however, starting to show other promising signs of life. International standards for video telephony have been developed, ensuring that devices bought from one maker will work with those from another. And the complex gadgetry needed to squeeze and transmit video images down a telephone line is becoming ubiquitous. In the early 1990s, videophone makers had to cram clever chips and tiny screens into handsets. Today, the modern personal computer can become a videophone of sorts merely by adding a $200 digital camera and software (now standard) to compress and transmit the images. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may turn out to be a vital change. The <font size=-1>PC</font> is not yet as compact as a telephone but it has become as familiar and unexceptional as one. And sales of multimedia <font size=-1>PC</font>s, almost perfect for video calls, will reach around 35m this year. In addition, <font size=-1>PC</font>s become cheaper and more powerful every year, so the quality of picture calls goes up as the price of the equipment comes down.<br>
<b> </b> Better still, Intel, the world's leading supplier of <font size=-1>PC</font> chips, is showing new interest in video telephony. From this Christmas, adding a special camera to an Intel-based <font size=-1>PC</font> will be enough to turn it into a videophone that can work over telephone networks and the Internet alike. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There will still be limitations. Ordinary phone lines are not best suited to carrying video images and the high-capacity connections of the future are still, well, in the future for most telephone subscribers. The <font size=-1>PC</font> with camera attached is anyway a far cry from the compact, dedicated videophone the telephone companies once hoped to turn into a mass-market product.<br>

<h1>The trouble with men</h1>

IT MAY be a man's world now, but "Tomorrow belongs to women" (to borrow the title of a book by Jack Lang, a French politician and sex symbol). No wonder.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apart from being more violent, more prone to disease, more likely to succumb to drugs, bad diet or suicide--more socially undesirable from almost every point of view, in fact--men, it seems, are also slightly more stupid than women. At any rate, boys are doing less well than girls at school. And since, with each passing year, more brainy word-processing consultants and nursery-school teachers get new jobs while more brawny coal miners and machine-tool operators lose theirs, it seems inevitable that women with their graduate certificates and mothering instincts will soon be doing ever more of the world's work, while men lag further behind. A woman's work is never done; a man is drunk from sun to sun.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Well, does that matter? Biologists might answer: not much. To them, men are useful largely for one thing: supplying genetic products to mothers. Providing half a baby's genes stirs up the gene pool and outwits the bacteria and viruses that prey on the species. Also from a biologist's point of view, a lot of aggressive male behaviour is so much genetic advertising. Having men lock antlers, brag about football and indulge in dangerous virility rituals enables women, in some mysterious way, to pick the best genes to hand on.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But nature's methods seem extremely crude. Why not be a tad more scientific? The next generation does not need the current crop of men to be carrying around their sperm all the time. A clean, well-run sperm bank, regularly topped up, would be just as good--and would dispense with men's unfortunate social side-effects. Sperm banks could provide a wide range of gene services, offering, say, high intelligence, predeliction to be a surgeon, blue eyes, long legs and so forth. In America, they already provide a splendid array of choices (and offer insurance in case sperm counts fall even further).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, in terms of cultural evolution, men may well have done their job: they have pretty much set up modern civilisations and technologies; they may not be needed to keep them going. Knowledge-based societies, with their stress on brain not brawn, may be safer in women's hands.<br>
</p><p><b>Testosterone and its antidotes</b><br>
Back to real life. Men have not been humanely phased out. They still have more jobs than women and, on average, earn higher salaries. In the middle and upper income brackets, men are adjusting--albeit slowly--to women's growing economic power. But down at the bottom of the ladder, where men are men and women change the nappies (but also have the jobs), there are troubles of an entirely different order.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here whole communities are caught in a deadly vice. As the article on <a href="sf0752.html">page</a> argues, in areas which used to depend on heavy industry, changes in the nature of work have laid waste the traditional sources of unskilled male employment. Men who used to work in the collieries or shipyards have proved unable (or, which is almost the same thing, unwilling) to do the "women's work" springing up in the industrial ruins. As their jobs have declined, so have their prospects of marriage, for who wants to link their lot with a jobless deadbeat? And as work and marriage have declined together, so everyone has suffered, for these two, since time immemorial, have been the twin responsibilities that have persuaded men to stay with women and children, obey the law and behave as social animals. For women, work and family are often competing spheres; for men, they are linked. When the link is broken, some men, in some places, become loose molecules: uneducated, unskilled, unmarried and unemployed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps this will change. Perhaps men will begin to compete more vigorously for "women's work". Perhaps they will find jobs, and, having got them, marry and look after children again. But the evidence so far is against it. At best, men will change their ways reluctantly and more slowly than the quickening pace of economic change. Meanwhile, the blue collar problem will grow.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Men learn social behaviour through work and marriage, rather than grasp it by instinct. Nothing can be done to change that. Nothing should be done to turn the clock back-- by, for example, discriminating against women at work or keeping open economically pointless factories (which would amount to the same thing, since that would penalise the new jobs women do). As the survey argues, the engines of economic change--information technology and globalisation--are, contrary to rumour, benefiting the vast majority of humanity: not just women in the West but millions of men and women everywhere.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So such remedies as are possible must concentrate on the places where the social problems are worst: the inner cities. One reason that boys are falling behind girls at urban primary and secondary schools is that too few male teachers are around for boys to look up to and model their behaviour upon. Attracting more male teachers would help close the gap in educational attainment and improve boys' job prospects. More can and should be done to improve the skills of young men: it is especially worth concentrating on their schooling and vocational education, even though men often pooh pooh such things. And a lot can be done to alleviate the social evils of areas where employment and marriage rates are lowest. While the source of the trouble may be unemployment, much of the damage that flows from this is connected to the easy availability of guns and drugs. Here, more efficient restrictions are needed, which means, for drugs, decriminalisation and control.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a list may seem a piecemeal and partial response to "the trouble with men". Granted, it is only a start. But with all great social changes, there comes a stage, before comprehensive policies can be agreed upon, when what is needed is to recognise that a problem exists and accept that it cannot be left to fester. With men in the ghettos, that stage has arrived.<br>

<center><table width=65%><tr valign=top><td valign=top width=30%>
<h2>No light</h2>
Israel's decision to open an<b> ancient tunnel</b> close to the Muslim holy places in Jerusalem led to the worst violence since the start of the Oslo peace process. Clashes broke out throughout the Palestinian territories. In Ramallah, after Israeli soldiers approached the autonomous zone, Palestinian policemen fired back. Several dozen Palestinians were reported killed and hundreds wounded; at least five Israelis were killed. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, cut short his visit to Europe.<br><br>
The <font size=-1>UN</font>-created tribunal to try Rwandans<b> accused of genocide</b> met in Arusha, Tanzania. Of the 21 Rwandans so far indicted, only three are in custody in Arusha. The court decided to postpone the trial of one of them, who is ill, until next March. <br>
<h2>Kabul threatened</h2>
The <b>Afghan government </b>of President Rabbani was fighting for survival as the Taliban, a rebel militia believed to be supported by Pakistan, reached the outskirts of the capital, Kabul. During the past month the Taliban has taken control of much of eastern Afghanistan.<br><br>
<b>Japan </b>will probably have a general election on October 20th, in which the Liberal Democrats, who lost power in 1993 after ruling for nearly 40 years, are expected to regain their grip.<br><br>
Banharn Silpa-archa resigned as <b>Thailand's prime minister </b>after he had lost the support of his six-party coalition government.<br><br>
<b>Indonesia </b>ordered Megawati Sukarnoputri, a critic of the government, to close her political office in Jakarta, arousing fears that the authorities will tolerate no organised opposition.<br><br>
<b>Murtaza Bhutto</b>,<b> </b>brother of the Pakistani prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, was shot dead by police. Mr Bhutto had campaigned to oust his sister.<br>
<h2>Leaderless Russia</h2>
It was disclosed that <b>Boris Yeltsin</b>,<b> </b>Russia's increasingly invisible president, suffered a heart attack--his third in a year--between the first and second rounds of the election this summer. Doctors will operate in six to eight weeks.<br><br>
Critics challenged the validity of this month's <b>Bosnian election</b>, claiming the number of votes exceeded the number of eligible voters. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which ran the election, delayed certifying the results but declared a Muslim, Alija Izetbegovic, president. All this could delay municipal elections due in November.<br>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
European finance ministers narrowed their differences over a <b>stability pact</b>, a German proposal to keep members of <font size=-1>EMU</font> from running excessive budget deficits. The ministers also agreed that countries outside <font size=-1>EMU</font> could join a new exchange-rate mechanism, called <font size=-1>ERM</font>-<font size=-1>2</font>, in which their currencies would be allowed to fluctuate by 15% against the euro, the future European currency.<br><br>
<b>Armenia</b>'s<b> </b>incumbent president, Levon Ter-Petrossian, was re-elected with more than 50% of the vote in a four-candidate contest. The main opposition group said it was a fraud and as thousands of Armenians protested, light tanks and troops were sent into the capital, Yerevan.<br><br>
British police seized ten tonnes of explosives, killed one suspected member of the <font size=-1>IRA</font> and arrested five others in a series of raids in and near London. Police said the <font size=-1>IRA</font> had been on the verge of launching a series of <b>terrorist attacks </b>in the city.<br><br>
<b>Malta</b>'s prime minister, Eddie Fenech Adami, called a general election on October 26th, ten months earlier than necessary.<br><br>
France's prime minister, Alain Jupp<e-acute>, called for a <b>vote of confidence </b>in parliament on October 2nd.<br><br>
<b>Greece</b>'s ruling Socialist party, Pasok, led by Costas Simitis, won the general election, beating the conservative New Democracy party. Mr Simitis is expected to continue policies favouring the <font size=-1>EU</font> and budgetary rigour. <br>
<h2>The wedded state</h2>
A report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation claims that Hillary Clinton drafted a property document that was used by an Arkansas savings and loan to <b>deceive federal regulators </b>in 1986. In a television interview, Bill Clinton accused the Whitewater special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, of being "obviously" out to get him. <br><br>
John F. Kennedy junior, America's <b>"most eligible bachelor"</b>,<b> </b>married Carolyn Bessette at a secret ceremony off the coast of Georgia. Reporters from the <i>National Inquirer</i> were repelled.<br><br>
The first <b>presidential debate </b> was set for October 6th in Hartford, Connecticut. Ross Perot, founder of the Reform Party, filed suit in federal court to be allowed to join in. <br><br>
At the congress of <b>Mexico</b>'s ruling party, the <font size=-1>PRI</font>, activists denounced the rule of free market "technocrats" and voted against their policies, notably petrochemicals privatisation. They also voted that future <font size=-1>PRI</font> presidential candidates must already have held elective office, as few have. The leadership, taken by surprise by this outbreak of free speech, tried to sweep it all under the carpet. <br><br>
<b>Argentina'strade unions </b> launched a 36-hour general strike against the government's tough economic policies and unemployment.<br>

<h2>Steady as you go</h2>

The Federal Reserve held <b>American interest rates</b> steady.<b> </b>With mixed signals from the economy--unemployment at a seven-year low and fattening wages, but signs of slowing growth in the second half of the year--the deciding factor may have been timing. The closing weeks of a presidential campaign are an awkward time for the Fed to act. Consumer confidence ticked up slightly in September, to a six-year high.<br><br>
(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The International Monetary Fund said <b>growth in Japan</b> would reach 3.5% this year after a long recession, the fastest among the Group of Seven rich countries and well above the Fund's forecast in May. Growth elsewhere in Asia is expected to slow to 8% this year and 7.5% next.<br>
<h2>Sinking fund</h2>
The European Commission approved FFr3.9 billion ($762m) of emergency aid for <b>Cr<e-acute>dit Lyonnais</b>, adding another chunk of French taxpayers' cash to a rescue plan for the state-owned bank that is already costing up to FFr45 billion. The commission gave warning that another bail-out will amount to a "considerable figure" and insisted that any plan would need to include "real and substantive" divestments. The bank delayed issuing its interim results for a week after the commission's ruling.<br><br>
<b>Bulgaria's central bank </b> nearly trebled its key interest rate to 300% and placed nine state and private banks under supervision in an attempt to shore up a crippled financial system and prevent another default on foreign debt. Lyubomir Filipov, governor of the central bank, said he would resign if the latest measures to stabilise the lev failed to work.<br><br>
A war of words intensified between the central banks of Britain and Germany. A Bundesbank official said <font size=-1>EU</font> members that did not join the <b>single currency</b> should not have unrestricted access to <font size=-1>TARGET</font>, the proposed new payments system. A week earlier, the governor of the Bank of England had said there should be no discrimination.<br><br>
Britain's <font size=-1>BT</font> has taken a 25% stake in <font size=-1>CEGETEL</font>, a <b>new telecoms group</b> set up by France's Compagnie G<e-acute>n<e-acute>rale des Eaux. The aim is to compete with France T<e-acute>l<e-acute>com.<br><br>
The Austrian government rejected a bid for <b>Creditanstalt </b> from a consortium of Austrian, Italian and German banks in yet another setback in its long-drawn-out saga to privatise the bank. First Austrian, a savings bank, then announced that it will form a group to make a bid.<br><br>
Japan's coalition government promised a half-hearted reform of its powerful <b>finance ministry</b>, with inspection and supervision to be hived off to an independent agency.<br>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Taking the lead of Daimler Benz, German firms scrambled to <b>cut sick pay </b>for workers to 80% of normal salaries after a bill was passed that allows the change from October 1st. Unions protested that the change should apply to future contracts, not present ones.<br>
<h2>Bad line</h2>
<b>AT&T's share price</b> was battered after the American telecoms giant gave a warning that profits in the third quarter could fall short of market expectations by up to 10%, with a further slide to come in 1997 as its core long distance telephone business feels the effects of tougher competition.<br><br>
Coca-Cola is catapulting its <b>Minute Maid </b>orange juice out of its traditional North American base and into Europe and Latin America with the formation of a 50-50 joint venture with Groupe Danone. The French foods group will produce and distribute the chilled juice outside North America. The aim is to be selling the stuff in 50 countries by 2000.<br><br>
(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>As multinationals multiply, <b>foreign direct investment</b> grows, with mergers and acquisitions accounting for the bulk of activity. Total outflows worldwide rose to $318 billion in 1995, some 40% up on 1994. Inflows to developed countries rose by 53% but to developing countries only by 15%. Five countries, America, Japan, Britain, Germany and France, accounted for two-thirds of outflows; ten countries received two-thirds of total inflows, with America top of both lists.<br><br>
Two regional American oil refiners are to merge as a defence against hostile takeovers. <b>Diamond Shamrock </b> and <b>Ultramar </b>together will form the fourth-largest independent refiner, with a large network of retail outlets and revenue of $8 billion.<br><br>
<b>Lachlan Murdoch</b>, 24-year old son of Rupert, continued his meteoric rise to take on the job of managing director of News Ltd, News Corp's Australian unit. He replaces Ken Cowley, who remains as executive chairman.<br><br>
<b>Hilton Hotels</b> agreed to buy out most of the remaining interests in four more big hotels held by Prudential Insurance Co of America, at a cost of $267m. Prudential has apparently been critical of Hilton's management; Hilton itself has been switching back from franchising its name to buying, as profits in the hotel business perk up.<br><br>
The Dow reflected the market's approval of a deal that would create the world's second-largest <b>satellite network</b> when<b> </b>Hughes Electronics, a General Motors unit, agreed to buy PanAmSat, valuing the four-satellite operator at $3 billion. Share prices rose.<br>

<h1>How Labour could lose</h1>

NOTHING is ever certain in politics. But few things in British politics now look more likely than that Tony Blair's "New Labour" will win the next election. Labour will begin its party conference on September 30th further ahead in the opinion polls than any British opposition party has ever been at this stage. Indeed, Labour's poll lead has remained so large for so long that pollsters are questioning their own methods, and trying to adjust for the fact that people seem ashamed to admit to supporting the Tories (see <a href="br7495.html">page</a>). But even after adjustments--and a dose of scepticism born of the polls' failure to predict the Tory victory in 1992--Labour seems far ahead. Local elections, by-elections and what voters tell canvassers of every party all point to the same conclusion as the polls: after 17 years of Conservative government, the mood favours a change. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, Labour could still lose--and it could do so without a scandal or Mr Blair falling under the proverbial bus. If you find this difficult to swallow, suspend your disbelief for a moment, and come along on an imaginary journey.<br>
</p><p><b>Tony Blair's worst nightmare</b><br>
Imagine first that the economy continues to grow, that inflation remains low and that rising house prices, more cash in consumers' pockets and declining unemployment produce the "feel-good" factor for which the Tories have been praying for so long. And then imagine that the Tories manage to stop squabbling and rally round Mr Major's "wait and see" policy on <font size=-1>EMU</font>--which is, by the way, also Labour's policy. Finally, imagine that, with its poll lead shrinking, its policies subjected to withering scrutiny month after month and with many in its ranks deeply unhappy about Mr Blair's junking of so much of "old" Labour, the party begins to stumble. Internal squabbles escalate. Labour's leaders, fearing that their victory is slipping away, begin to flounder. By next spring, the race is close. And, in a repeat of 1992, floating voters reluctantly decide that they would be safer with the sorry lot of devils they know than the sorry lot of devils they don't. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, some elements of this future are more likely than others. It is quite probable that economic growth and low inflation will finally produce the long-awaited "feel good" factor and that voters will at last begin to give the Tories some of the credit for this. It is less probable that the Tories will stop fighting over <font size=-1>EMU</font>, especially after their most recent outburst of hostilities over the past two weeks. But a truce on <font size=-1>EMU</font> cannot be ruled out. Facing an election, the Tories could yet come to their senses.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The final ingredient in this scenario--Labour blundering and squabbling its way to defeat--may at first appear the least likely. Mr Blair, after all, has shown himself to be the strongest leader in the party's history. Who can deny with what zeal, and skill, he has set about smashing left-wing shibboleths or squashing internal opposition Would his party opponents really rock the boat if they faced the political armageddon of a fifth straight defeat? <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Believe it or not, they might. Mr Blair's party opponents have already made it abundantly clear that they are unhappy with his leadership. More damaging are rumblings of discontent from Mr Blair's own front bench. John Prescott, the party's deputy leader, relishes every opportunity to describe himself as a "socialist", in implicit but oh-so-obvious contrast with you know-who. Robin Cook, the shadow foreign secretary, can barely disguise his impatience with the enthusiasm for <font size=-1>EMU</font>, low taxes and fiscal prudence of Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor and Mr Blair's closest ally. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If internal discontent not only grows, but is accompanied by signs of incompetence from Labour's leaders, the threat to the party's electoral prospects could become genuine. And incompetence is what, surprisingly, Labour's leaders have begun to display as the party's policies come under closer scrutiny. Over the past month they have made unforced bungles on two of the trickiest issues facing the party: Scottish devolution, and relations with the trade unions, putting forward and then abruptly withdrawing proposals on both topics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the months of campaigning pass, such scrutiny will grow, and it could provoke more blunders. The reason is simple. Mr Blair has been sending two messages to the electorate which fit together awkwardly: that a change of government is urgently needed, but that electing New Labour will not involve so much change as to be risky. This is best summed up by that delicious oxymoron which Mr Blair uses to describe New Labour: "a party of the radical centre". <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour's policies betray this contradiction. With the important exception of constitutional reform--the details of which Labour still seems confused about--the party's policies sound bold, but on closer examination are either so vague as to mean little, or are basically the Tories' policies with the sharpest (and thus, arguably, the most effective) edges shaved off. Despite all Mr Blair's rhetoric of radicalism, such policy conservatism sums up rather well what he is offering the voters: continuity, but with a set of fresh, vigorous new faces at the helm, speaking in softer tones.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may appeal to enough uncommitted voters to give Labour its expected victory, even if the economy is growing and the Tories unite. But this means that the competence of Labour's leaders and the unity of their party are likely to become the key issues in many voters' minds. Voters may not expect an opposition party's policies to be worked out in complete detail. They may accept that Labour, like the Tories, will always have dissidents. But if voters come to believe that Labour's untested leadership is not united or skilful enough to take tough decisions in government, or that Mr Blair is in fact an isolated figure leading a disgruntled party (see <a href="br7505.html">page</a>), then his pitch from the "radical centre" will fail. The next election looks like being the first in living memory which is the opposition's, not the government's, to lose. But lose it Labour still could.<br>

<h1>Tomorrow's second sex</h1>

<p><b>The signs are everywhere in America and Europe: more women at work; girls doing better in school; debate about "feminisation" in America's politics; its "million-man march" last year. This article summarises the evidence of a growing social problem: uneducated, unmarried, unemployed men</b></p><br>
THESE four pages nail the following arguments to the door of debate:<br>
<ul><li>that boys are doing worse than girls at every age in school, except university where girls are narrowing the gap;
<li>that women dominate the jobs that are growing, while men (especially those with the least education) are trapped in jobs that are declining;
<li>that, for some reason, men are not even trying to do "women's work";
<li>that there is a loose connection between work and marriage: joblessness reduces the attractiveness of men as marriage partners;
<li>that men do not necessarily adopt "social behaviour" (obeying the law; looking after women and children) if left to themselves; rather, they seem to learn it through some combination of work and marriage (this is a matter of anthropological observation rather than statistical proof); 
<li>and hence, putting these claims together, that men pose a growing problem. They are failing at school, at work and in families. Their failure shows up in crime and unemployment figures. The problem seems to be related in some way to male behaviour and instincts. It is more than merely a matter of economic adjustment. And (considering the growth in "knowledge-based" employment) it is likely to get worse (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>).</ul>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem is already far worse in some areas than others. Over the past 30 years, professional men have been less badly affected by economic change than their unskilled brethren. And (to the limited extent they want to) some have added so-called "New Man" attitudes to their traditional breadwinning role. They have adjusted reasonably well to social and economic change. But unskilled men have lost on both counts. Traditional family values-- husband winning the bread, wife watching the bairns--tend to be strongest (at least in theory) at the poorer end of the labour market. But American working-class men are increasingly unable (or unwilling) to support families; in Europe, high unemployment has fallen on such men disproportionately. And because providing for a family has been central to men's social role, finding a substitute for steady work will be an immensely hard--conceivably an impossible--task.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Trouble in class</b></b><br>
The trouble with men appears early: at school. Though men take up half or more university places in most countries (America is an exception), at primary and secondary school girls are increasingly outperforming boys. In England and Wales, for example, girls score higher than boys in tests conducted at seven, nine, eleven and-- which is less often realised--at five. In America, boys are much more likely than girls to be held back a grade and twice as likely to drop out of high school.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both the reasons for this discrepancy and its true extent are hotly debated. In some subjects at some ages boys still do better than girls (for example, mathematics at 16). Traditionally, boys have done less well than girls before puberty but used to catch up afterwards. What is new now is that boys are no longer catching up. English and Welsh 16-year-olds take a series of tests known as <font size=-1>GCSE</font>s. A standard measurement is the percentage of children who achieve grades <font size=-1>A</font>, <font size=-1>B</font>, or <font size=-1>C</font> in five or more subjects; 48.1% of girls achieve this, compared with 39% of boys. In some of Britain's poorer areas, the disparity is greater. In Hackney, a poor part of east London, for example, a mere 14.9% of boys reached this standard, compared with 30.2% of girls.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The pattern is repeated all over Europe. In 1995, in the European Union, 124 girls got general leaving certificates to every 100 boys. The boys' narrow lead in vocational certificates--they took 5% more--does not close the gap. Girls also tend to stay in school longer: Austria and Switzerland apart, in every West-European country, more girls than boys stay on in education beyond school-leaving age (though the boys who do stay are slightly more likely to go to university, taking 51% of places).<br>
</p><p><b><b>Trouble at work</b></b><br>
Because jobs are increasingly "knowledge based", this disparity in educational attainment is bound to be reflected in employment once today's schoolchildren become adults. This does not necessarily mean that girls have better job prospects than boys; other factors, including sex discrimination at work, may intervene. But it does mean that girls are improving their job prospects relative to boys. Moreover, the job market is already moving the girls' way.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Between 1980 and 1992, women accounted for three-fifths of the increase in the American workforce and two-thirds of the increase in the European one. Between 1990 and 1993, in ten of the then 12 <font size=-1>EU </font> members, women's share of unemployment fell. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the problem for men is not just that women are taking more jobs; it is that a significant proportion of men are dropping out of the job market altogether as women enter it. In the 1960s, almost all men worked and less than half of women. Not so now. The percentage of working-age men in the <font size=-1>EU</font> outside the labour force rose from just 8% in 1968 to 22% in 1993. For women, the trend was reversed, falling from 58% to 44% over the same period. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In America, the pattern is slightly different: while women's labour-force participation has risen from 43% in 1970 to about 60% now, men's has dropped relatively little from 80% to 75% (though there is an important exception: male high-school drop outs--those completing fewer than 12 years of school; in 1970, 86% were either working or looking for work; by 1993, only 72% were). If its employment trends continue, America will be employing nearly as many women as men by 2005.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overall, then, the picture in the West is as follows: the labour market is increasingly friendly to women (though men still make more money and are more likely to be in work); but there are growing numbers of men outside the labour market in a way that women have been accustomed to but men are not.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The future for men looks bleaker, even if you disregard what is going on in schools. Western occupational surveys show that for the foreseeable future new job-growth will be in work typically done by women. America's Bureau of Labour, for example, forecasts that the five fastest-growing kinds of work between now and 2002 will be residential care, computer and data processing, health services, child care, and business services. Women dominate all these activities: their share of employment in them is respectively: 79%, 68%, 70%, 70% and 51%. In contrast, the five sectors declining fastest will be footwear, ammunition making, shipbuilding, leather-working and photographic supplies. They are man's work. Men account for at least two-thirds of the workforce in all the categories.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are numerous explanations for female success in growing businesses: women tend to be better educated; they stay in jobs longer (especially women with children); low-paid jobs are growing quickly and women are readier to accept them than men, who still see themselves as a family's breadwinner; women tend to have the social skills needed for jobs in services (though whether because of nature or nurture is disputed).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For men, the obvious response to such economic shifts would be to move into the bits of the economy which are expanding. But they are not doing this. Social theorists may like to claim that concepts like "men's work" or "women's work" are outmoded. The choices people make in the labour force tell a different story. Even in Nordic countries, which have made sexual neutrality a principle of national policy, sex segregation is the norm. Local government, state-run day-care centres, schools and social services are run by women. Men weld cars and take out the rubbish. The pattern is unchanging. In America's "administrative services" (ie, office work) men accounted for only 19.8% of the workforce in 1985 and 20.5% in 1995. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why should this be? Part of the explanation no doubt lies in the advantages that women have in the workforce--especially their willingness to accept lower-paid jobs. But there seems to be more to it than that. Men continue to spurn even well-paid work that is dominated by women. Less than 5% of America's registered nurses, for example, are men, though the average starting salary of a registered nurse is a comfortable $30,000-35,000. Women account for 96% of America's licensed practical nurses, a responsible but not especially highly skilled job that pays a full-time worker about $23,000. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The picture is similar in Europe. In Britain, the proportion of men in nursing, 11.6%, has budged little since 1984, when it was 10.2%. As the <font size=-1>EU</font> noted in a report on "Occupational Segregation of Women and Men in the European Community", male manual workers are "willing to undertake low-paid and low-skilled jobs provided they are not feminised." In Spain, the share of male office clerks has dropped by a third since 1980--even though this has been a fast-growing field at a time of high unemployment; women, meanwhile, have withdrawn from the textile and footwear industries. In these areas, job separation seems to have increased.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Blue-collar blues</b></b><br>
So women are catching up with men for economic reasons ("women's jobs" are growing faster than men's) and social ones (men won't do "women's work"). Both reasons hit unskilled and ill-educated men disproportionately hard.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jobs that require some tertiary education or training are growing faster than those that require no qualifications. In America's ten largest cities, the number of jobs requiring less than a high-school education has fallen by half since 1970; two thirds of new jobs created in America since 1989 have been professional and managerial. Germany's Ministry of Labour estimates that by 2010, only 10% of German jobs will be appropriate for unskilled workers. In 1976, the proportion was 35%. In 1970, there were more blue-collar workers than white-collar ones in more than half the <font size=-1>OECD</font> countries; by 1990, that was true only in Spain. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In principle, unskilled men could accept these changes and kiss their wives goodbye on the doorstep as the little woman goes off to work at the nursing home. In reality, that is not happening. Despite huge social change during the past 30 years, traditional sexual attitudes retain a stubborn hold. A survey for the <font size=-1>EU</font> found that more than two-thirds of Europeans (ranging from 85% in Germany to 60% in Denmark) thought it better for the mother of a young child to stay at home than the father. Mothers, said this survey, should take care of nappies, clothes and food; fathers are for money, sport and punishment.<br>
<b><br>
</p><p><b>Trouble at home</b></b><br>
Among the poor, this combination of traditional sexual attitudes and male unemployment has been deadly to two groups: men in general in high unemployment areas and, especially, young unemployed men there. The reason is that the combination has set off a spiral of harmful and sometimes uncontrollable consequences which is tearing the web that ties together work, family and law-abiding behaviour.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider for a moment a neighbourhood in which most working-age women are not in paid jobs. This may conjure up a picture of tidy homes, children at play and gossip. Now think of a neighbourhood in which most men are jobless. The picture is more sinister. Areas of male idleness are considered, and often are, places of deterioration, disorder and danger. Non-working women are mothers; non-working men, a blight.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Men tend to commit most crimes. In America, they commit 81% of all crime and 87% of violent crime. Adolescent boys are the most volatile and violent of all. Those under 24 are responsible for half of America's violent crime; those under 18 commit a quarter. The figures for most western countries are comparable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now ask yourself what restrains such behaviour? The short answer is: a two-parent home. Without belabouring the complexity of family policies, two-parent families are demonstrably better at raising trouble-free children than one-parent ones. Fatherless boys commit more crimes than those with father at home; a study of repeat juvenile offenders by the Los Angeles Probation Department found that they were much more likely to come from one-parent backgrounds than either the average child or than juvenile criminals who offended once only (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Having a man in the house (preferably the biological father) is, it seems, more important than any other single factor. William Galston and Elaine Kamarck, two social scientists who worked in the Clinton administration, argue that the connection between crime and having a father at home "is so strong that  erases the relationship between race and crime and between low income and crime." That is why it is a worry that, in America in 1991, just 50.8% of children lived in traditional nuclear families (families where both parents were present and the children were the biological offspring of both parents). Among Hispanics, the figure was 38%; among blacks, 27%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But family is not the end of the matter. Work also plays a part, both in its own right and as a means of keeping men tied to families. In 1949, Margaret Mead, an eminent anthropologist, argued that <ul>In every known human society, everywhere in the world, the young male learns that when hegrows up, one of the things which he must do in order to be a full member of society is to provide food for some female and her young . . . Everyknown human society rests firmly on the learned nurturing behaviour of men.</ul><br>
When men find it impossible to provide, they also seem to find it difficult to learn the nurturing bits. They may retreat into fundamentalist masculinity--the world of gangs which provide for their members a kind of rule-based behaviour that boys do not get elsewhere. For everyone else (and, in the long run, for boys too), the effects of failing to learn nurturing are universally bad.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For an extreme example of this dynamic, take the studies by William Julius Wilson of mass male joblessness in American inner cities(<a href="#foot">*</a>). Here, for the first time in the West, most men are not working and women are the breadwinners (partly because they are working more than ever and partly because welfare cheques go to them). Mr Wilson argues that joblessness, especially among young men, not poverty is a prime cause of the disintegration of inner cities: "high rates of neighbourhood poverty are less likely to trigger problems of social organisation if the residents are working." Mass unemployment, he claims, destroys the institutions that enforce social behaviour--small firms, clubs, informal networks and, above all, the family.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Wilson demonstrates that, for men, employment is strongly linked to marriage and fatherhood; for a woman, children and work are separate (often competing) worlds. Men who cannot support a family are much less likely to form one; their attractiveness as a marriage partner sags. Among the inner-city blacks in Chicago whom he studied, almost 60% of those aged 18-44 have never been married and marriage rates are even lower among jobless black fathers than among employed black fathers. And this is true in America as a whole. Black men born in the early 1940s, who came of age during an era of full employment, were more than twice as likely to marry as those born since the late 1950s, who joined the workforce at a time when blue-collar jobs were falling. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, in the language of social science, "The uncertainties in the labour market are carrying over into uncertainties in the marriage market," as John Ermisch of Britain's Economic and Social Research Centre puts it. Work, it seems, helps determine other aspects of men's lives.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Obviously, the impact upon a neighbourhood of large numbers of jobless single men is influenced by other factors, especially the prevalence of sophisticated deadly weapons. Europe has nothing like Chicago's South Side, the so-called "black belt" that is Mr Wilson's particular area of study. Compared with the South Side, drug use is lower in European cities; gun ownership is much lower; crime is lower; fear of crime is lower. The living standards of the poorest are generally higher. Schools do not have metal detectors.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All the same, if male joblessness is the crucial factor in neighbourhood decline (as Mr Wilson claims), then Europe faces similar problems, though they may be bottled up. Not only is average unemployment more than twice as high as in America, but a jobless European stays that way longer. Of Europe's 19m unemployed, more than half have been out of work for a year or more, compared with about 10% of Americans. And young people make up a disproportionate share of Europe's unemployed (except in Germany) and take even longer to get a job. In France, unemployment among under 25-year-olds is 27%, compared with a national average of 12.5%. More than 60% of European youths who are long-term unemployed have never had work; 40% will take two years or more to find their first job. You do not need a sociology degree to worry about the effects of so many young men with nothing to do.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The Japanese solution? No, thanks</b></b><br>
There is one rich country that does not have these problems; where just 1% of children are born to single mothers; where crime is low; where marriage rates are relatively high--and where the labour market is rigged in favour of men. This is Japan. In any recession, the "office flowers" are made redundant first. Women are expected to give up jobs on marriage. In the professions, there is not so much a glass ceiling as a concrete one: hard to miss, painful to hit.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that the West is unlikely to copy such a system, which is showing cracks in Japan, too. Just because men--or some of them--are struggling in work and at home, women are not about to stride back to the past, accepting the kitchen and nursery as their allotted spheres.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is all to the good. But there has been a loser in women's march to something closer to equality and that is the man in the blue-collar uniform. Many of the gains that the West has made through enhancing the economic position of women will be tarnished if the male labourer is pushed to the margins. Once known as the salt of the earth, at the moment his troubles are making countries lose their savour.<br>

<h1>The jam-and-Perrier budget</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
IN A strange and marvellous way, the hypocrisy of this election season is unlike any that has come before it. In the past, politicians swore to run the economy responsibly, while at the same time promising programmes that would explode the deficit and multiply red tape. This time the opposite is happening: both President Clinton and the Republicans in Congress trumpet government handouts, while at the same time pursuing policies that will protect the budget and curb regulation. The old kind of hypocrisy was like that of an upright, war era American, who denounced all vice and sinfulness while committing adultery on the quiet. The new kind of hypocrisy is like that of a casual, computer-era American, who pretends to love drugs and sexual licence while drinking mineral water and working round the clock.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over the past week, congressional Republicans have been caving in to Bill Clinton's spending demands, apparently jeopardising their promise to balance the budget by 2002. They have bowed to the president's zeal for regulation, barely criticising his decree that a huge swathe of Utah be designated a national monument, and acceding to pressure for new health rules. Meanwhile, out on the campaign trail, both presidential candidates are promising tax cuts. Not surprisingly, many have concluded that runaway government has returned, and that fiscal responsibility lies in ruins. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With one big exception, however, there are scant grounds for these fears. The exception is Bob Dole, whose promise to balance the budget and still cut taxes falls into the old category of hypocrisy: he is claiming to be responsible, while offering policies that would wreak fiscal chaos. For the moment, however, Mr Dole appears likely to lose the election. Assuming that Bill Clinton beats him, America will remain roughly on track for a balanced budget six years from now. Mr Clinton's election promises--Longer hospital stays for new mothers! Extra education programmes!--sound profligate but are in truth mercifully modest. The same goes for the Republicans in Congress, who are making much of their new willingness to pay for "commonsense" programmes, but who still retain much of their old budget-balancing zeal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider, first, the recent expansions in government regulation. Posing in front of the Grand Canyon (actually in Arizona) on September 18th, Mr Clinton declared 1.7m acres of Utah a national monument, so protecting it from mining. Critics called this the biggest land grab in recent memory. But the truth is that nearly all the land involved in the Utah "grab" was already owned by the federal government. Besides, it does not add vastly to the more than 100m acres of America already designated a national park or a national monument. Compared with Jimmy Carter, who turned 50m acres of Alaska into a national monument, Mr Clinton's grab looks pretty trifling. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same goes for the new health regulations. The day after the president's trip to the Grand Canyon, Congress agreed that new mothers should be allowed to stay in hospital at least 48 hours after giving birth. It also laid down that the maximum allowable cost of treatment for mental illness, which under most insurance policies is meagre, should henceforth be raised to the same level as the spending cap for physical illnesses. In principle (though not in compassionate practice), both new regulations are misguided: they will push up the cost of health insurance, so reducing the number of Americans who can afford it. Fortunately, however, both changes are modest. The new childbirth rule will raise insurance premiums by a barely noticeable 0.06%, according to the Congressional Budget Office; the mental-health clause will raise them by 0.4%. A much more sweeping attempt to put mental and physical illness on the same footing, which died in congruous earlier this year, would have increased premiums by a far heftier 4%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In general, the president is insisting that non-defence discretionary spending be increased, which is a big symbolic defeat for the cause of budget balancing. Last year, for the first time in 25 years, this category of spending fell. To build on that success, Congress laid out a plan to balance the budget by 2002, which was based on tightening the discretionary-spending belt in each intervening year. Now the belt is to be loosened.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile the House Republicans are also doing violence to the principle of fiscal responsibility. They are proposing to pay for next year's extra spending partly by auctioning radio frequencies. But their estimates for the potential receipts from this source are probably too high, and part of the expected auction revenue had already been pledged to cut the deficit. The Republicans also propose to raise the deposit-insurance premiums collected from banks and thrifts. But higher premiums next year will probably mean lower premiums later, so contributing nothing to the medium-term goal of balancing the budget. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In sum, both president and Congress sound as irresponsible as the average laid back baby-boomer. The good news, however, is that they sin only in small ways. At mid-week, the president was holding out for $237 billion in non-defence discretionary spending, a rise in real terms of only 3% on last year. Meanwhile the dodgy money raising wheezes proposed by Congress were unwise in principle but insignificant in size: they would raise a mere $5.5 billion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same goes for Mr Clinton's proposed tax cuts. In principle, these are rakish. Half the deficit reduction of recent years has come about because of the tax increases of 1990 and 1993, according to Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution. A proposal to cut taxes threatens to expand the deficit again. But the saving grace of Mr Clinton's tax cuts is that they are so small. Whereas Mr Dole proposes $550 billion worth of cuts, Mr Clinton promises a mere $20 billion or so. On the stump, the president boasts of tax credits and tax deductions with the devil-may-care panache of a champion budget-wrecker. The truth is that these flourishes have been carefully costed by mineral-water types with spreadsheets. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even when it comes to entitlements, the vast chunk of the budget not affected by this week's appropriations bills, Mr Clinton's irresponsibility is an affectation. He has spent much of the year attacking Republicans for their proposed cuts in Medicare, the health programme for the elderly. But the truth is that the president has proposed cuts too: $124 billion over six years, compared with Mr Dole's $158 billion. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For an election season, all this is quite remarkable. It does not guarantee that America will return to the budget-balancing path next year--the tax-slashing Mr Dole may beat Mr Clinton after all, or second-term Clinton may prove profligate. But there is at least a chance that the goal of balancing the budget by 2002 can be achieved. It had better be: in the 20 or so years after that, the retirement of America's rakish-workaholic baby-boomers will heap pressure on the public finances far more severe than any faced at present.<br>

<h1>Trends of the week</h1>


<p><b>Word: </b>"Liberal"--the label Bob Dole tries to attach to Bill Clinton. Mr Clinton says it doesn't stick.<br>
<p><b>Inexactitude: </b>Mr Clinton, appearing on "NewsHour": "There still has not been a single solitary shred of evidence of anything dishonest that I have done in my public life."<br>
<p><b>Fall guy: </b>The best quips on Mr Dole's embarrassing tumble after a railing collapsed in California come from Mr Dole himself. Example: "The first person to call me was a trial lawyer."<br>
<p><b>Complaint: </b>By the Nike Corporation ("Just Do It"), after Mr Dole unveiled his "Just Don't Do It" anti-drugs slogan. <br>
<p><b>Stealth: </b>Mr Clinton signs anti-gay-marriage legislation at 12.50am.<br>
<p><b>Prediction: </b>The election forecasts of seven political scientists, all with their own forecasting models, are published in the October issue of <i>American Politics Quarterly</i>. All predict a Clinton win. So does a <font size=-1>WEFA</font> Group model based on a state-by-state analysis: it says Mr Clinton will win with 406 electoral-college votes to Mr Dole's 132.<br>
<p><b>Surprise: </b>Although 23 points behind just three weeks before, Woody Jenkins, a Republican, wins Louisiana's open primary and will face Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, in the run-off. Hope for Mr Dole yet?<br>
<p><b>Company: </b>Asked in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i>/<font size=-1>NBC</font> poll which couple they would rather sit next to on an aeroplane, 35% of respondents said the Clintons, 23% preferred the Doles, 13% chose the Gores, 11% the Kemps and 7% the Perots.<br>
<p><b>Button: </b>"Hungarians for Dole".<br>

<h1>Nico Colchester</h1>

ON SEPTEMBER 25th, on a visit to New York, Nico Colchester died of a heart attack while out on his early morning run. Nico was deputy editor of <i>The Economist</i> from 1989 to 1993, since when he had been editorial director of the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister company. He was 49, and was one of Britain's finest writers on foreign affairs and business.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although Nico's writing ranged far and wide, he was probably best known for his work on the European Union, first as Bonn correspondent and then as foreign editor of the <i>Financial Times</i>, and from 1986 at <i>The Economist</i>. He wrote two surveys for this newspaper on the <font size=-1>EU</font>, and then in 1990 a book, jointly with his friend David Buchan of the <i>Financial Times</i>, called "Europe Relaunched: Truths and Illusions on the Way to 1992".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The book's sub-title sums up Nico's journalism admirably. He was pro-European, but as a result of hard thought, not dreamy sentiment, and was always fast to criticise the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s methods and muddles when he thought it necessary. A cover-leader of his, "Half Maastricht" (September 26th 1992), was typical in its punchy criticism of Europe's Maastricht treaty, and its prescient advice that a two-speed Europe was both desirable and inevitable. He was awarded France's Order of Merit in 1990 and Britain's Order of the British Empire in 1993.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of Nico's particular talents was in the use of humour to cast light upon serious matters. At the <i>Financial Times</i>, where he spent the first 18 years of his career, one of his trademarks was his use of the Mars bar as a commodity standard with which to analyse inflation. At <i>The Economist</i>, a splendid leader in mid-1988 brought bank collapses and the Falklands war together to caution readers of "the dangers of sogginess" and the merits of "crunchiness". And rare indeed, it sometimes seemed, was a piece from Nico without a quote from "The Wind in the Willows". "Poop, poop", went Mr Toad, whenever appropriate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nico was as energetic in life as in his writing. A regular runner for more than a decade, next month he was due to run a marathon in Greece, along Pheidippides's original course, for charity. When writing on knotty subjects, he was fond of inviting readers "to engage their mental four-wheel drives". Nico's was never disengaged.<br>

<h1>Thinking the unthinkable</h1>

<p><b>The huge opinion-poll lead of the Labour Party looks unassailable. But might the message of the polls be misleading?</b></p>
IF YOU read only the opinion-poll headlines, Tony Blair can begin measuring up the curtains for 10 Downing Street. As delegates gather for the opening of Labour's conference in Blackpool on September 30th, the party remains miles ahead; its lead extends to a credibility-defying 33 points, according to the latest Gallup poll in the<i> Daily Telegraph</i>. Although Labour's average poll lead has narrowed somewhat--by a couple of points after John Major was re-elected Tory leader last summer and by the same again earlier this summer--the Tories' recovery is glacial. In 1981, as long before the coming election, the Tories were 11 points ahead; in 1986, two points behind; in 1991, two points ahead-- and now 23 points behind, according to the (more credible) <font size=-1>MORI</font> poll for the <i>Times</i> carried out on September 20th-23rd (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This latest poll will particularly disappoint the Tories. They reckoned to have got the better of the political exchanges in August and September, when Labour had several internal rows. Yet, on this latest poll, the Labour lead has recently grown a bit, by two percentage points. As this week's spat between Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and the Tory Eurosceptics over the European single currency sinks in, the Tories could fall even further behind.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor, contrary to some Tory claims, is there much sign that people who talk of voting Labour are about to change their minds. According to another <font size=-1>MORI</font> poll in May, 67% of them are "very" or "fairly" strong in their backing. This compares with only 57% of Tories who are "very" or "fairly" strong. "The Tories are in deep, deep trouble," says Bob Worcester of <font size=-1>MORI</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, Labour's lead is based on some firm-looking foundations. Mr Major is as unpopular as ever. According to <font size=-1>MORI</font>, voters dissatisfied with him as prime minister outnumber those satisfied by 34 percentage points, the same as last September. And Labour has leads in all <font size=-1>MORI</font>'s three summary measures of party standing. By a three-to-two majority it is reckoned to have the best team of leaders; by more than two to one to be the most united; and by nearly two to one to have the best policies. Labour leads on eight of the ten issues reckoned by voters the most important facing Britain. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recent developments in the electoral system also make it very difficult for the Conservatives to win. The system--first past-the-post in single-member constituencies--is kind to parties which concentrate their votes in seats they might take, but hard on those whose vote is evenly spread across the country. Usually, this hurts the Liberal Democrats. But demographic changes and an increase in tactical voting in European and local elections since 1992 mean that it is the Tory vote which now looks the most evenly spread. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the next election, Labour may need only 1% more of the vote than the Tories to win an overall Commons majority. The Tories may need to poll at least 7% more than Labour to do the same. If the Tories do as well in 1997 as they did in 1992 in terms of the total vote, they are still likely to fall short of an overall Commons majority. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So is a Labour victory a foregone conclusion? Not necessarily. Although most poll analysts do believe that Labour will win, many are more uncertain of this than the polling evidence seems to warrant. Among their reservations:<br>
<font size=-1></font> <br><b>Doubts as to the accuracy of the polls</b>. Before the 1992 election, the polls gave Labour the edge. In the event, the Tories were ahead by 8% of the vote. Some think that the polls are still underestimating Tory strength. Tory supporters are more reluctant to tell interviewers how they vote because, today, many people think it barely respectable to admit to being a Tory. There is a problem of poll methods, too. It seems that the method of sampling used by most pollsters, designed to represent a cross-section of the whole population in a single group of voters polled, is flawed, and includes too few Tory voters in the sample. This is confirmed by a new study by John Curtice, a psephologist with the Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends, using data from the academic British Election Panel Study. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All the main pollsters now make adjustments to their polls which attempt to allow for the reticence of Tory voters. On these calculations, Labour's vote comes out 4.6% lower on average and the Tories 3.6% higher, according to Professor David Sanders of Essex University. But, if Mr Curtice is right, the polls still overstate Labour's true lead even after this adjustment.<br>
<font size=-1></font> <br><b>The "feel-good" factor</b>. Economic optimism has picked up. According to the September <font size=-1>MORI</font> figures, those expecting the economy to improve in the next 12 months are now only slightly fewer in number than those expecting it to get worse--by a mere one percentage point. Although this is worse than it was in August, when optimists actually outnumbered pessimists by two points, it is still much better than a year ago, when the figure was minus 19 points. A rise in house prices and consumer spending tell the same story. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether this will spill over into votes for the Tories is a much-posed question. Statistical models linking voting intention to economic optimism broke down when sterling was ignominiously ejected from the European Union's exchange-rate mechanism in September 1992. Since then, voters have been reluctant to give the government credit for an improving economy. But in time better economic performance must surely help the Tories, even though the polls are not yet indicating this.<br>
<font size=-1></font> <br><b>A decline in Tony Blair's ratings.</b> After last year's Labour conference, voters satisfied with his leadership exceeded those dissatisfied by 27 percentage points. In August, that was down to nine points.<br>
<font size=-1></font> <br><b>A "softness" in the Labour vote.</b> Many voters say they will back Labour next time without really identifying themselves with the party. Around 37% of electors now say that they "generally" think of themselves as Labour compared with 51% of electors who say they would vote Labour in a general election. Both parties report that the "focus" groups of voters which they use to test their image report that the commitment of many voters who say they will vote Labour remains uncertain. There is academic evidence to support this. Paul Whiteley of Sheffield University and Howard Clarke of the University of Texas have applied a statistical technique called "error correction" to measure softness. They confirm that the Labour vote is flaky.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But this does not mean that they think Labour will lose. They produce a variety of scenarios for the election. The best gives Labour a landslide-winning 46.5% of the vote. And no amount of "feel-good" alone wins the election for the Tories. But one scenario does: lots of "feel-good" and lots of Labour bickering. "It looks as if Labour is going to win, but they could blow it," says Mr Whiteley. The succinct advice to Labour is: "Shut up now!"<br>

<p><b>Crime</b></p>
<h1>Suspect figures</h1>

PUT not your trust in statistics is this week's lesson for Michael Howard. For the past two years, the home secretary has been boasting of the falling recorded crime figures and claiming that they prove his dictum that "prison works". Now the number of crimes recorded by the police, published on September 24th, is rising again. Violent crime, Mr Howard's principal target, is rising particularly fast. Presumably this proves that prison does not work.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact the numbers prove nothing except that it is risky to place much reliance on such famously unreliable statistics. The latest batch show that, so far as those recorded by the police go, violent crimes rose by 10% in the year to June; homicides were almost unchanged (at 730, compared with 729); property offences fell by 0.3%; motor vehicle break-ins and thefts fell by 1%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more important set of numbers was also published on the same day--the British Crime Survey (<font size=-1>BCS</font>), which is carried out every two years by asking people whether they have been victims of crime. The <font size=-1>BCS</font> shows a 2% rise in crime in 1993-95, the period when Mr Howard was saying the largest fall in crime for 40 years had taken place. Police and academic crime-watchers consider the <font size=-1>BCS</font> to be more accurate than the recorded crime figures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Robert Reiner, a criminologist at the London School of Economics, argues that "there never was a decline in crime. What has happened is a decrease in the proportion of crime that is getting recorded. The dark figure of unrecorded crime is growing." Mr Reiner thinks this is happening at the moment for three reasons.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, one of the main reasons that people report property crime is because their insurance companies require it. During the 1990s, there has been a marginal fall in insurance coverage in the rougher areas of cities, which may lead to less reporting. Second, the police, being overworked, are less inclined to visit people to take details of crimes; and if the victim cannot be bothered to go to the police station, then the crime does not get reported. Third, new management systems have been introduced into the police, requiring them to meet targets related to crime statistics. The police therefore have a greater incentive not to record crimes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What, then, do the more reliable <font size=-1>BCS</font> figures suggest? There seems to have been a slight decrease in property crime, and an increase in violent crime; but, in all, a smaller increase than at any time since the survey started in 1981. That may well be because of demographics: the proportion of male teenagers, who make up the bulk of criminals, is shrinking.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Otherwise, economics seems to provide the best explanation. <i>Pace</i> the government (which has always insisted, for obvious reasons, that there is no connection between people being out of work and committing crimes), plenty of research points to a positive correlation between unemployment and property crime. That would suggest a fall in property crime at a time when unemployment is falling. The other clear correlation is between rising living standards and violent crime. Most violent crime is alcohol-related; and the richer people are the more they drink, and the more they drink the more they beat each other up.<br>

<p><b>Deregulation</b></p>
<h1>Something must be done</h1>

IT IS against the law to charge for dancing on Sunday, either in a disco or at a decorous tea-dance. It is legal to charge for drinking, horse-racing and other Sunday activities but not, according to the Sunday Observance Act of 1780, for dancing. Despite the efforts of the government's deregulation task force, and the passing of the 1994 Deregulation and Contracting Out Act, which made it easier to get rid of unnecessary regulations, charging for dancing on Sunday remains illegal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Deregulation", said Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, on September 23rd when presenting the second report of the task force that he set up on deregulation, "remains one of the government's top priorities." This does not leave much hope for things lower down the government's list. In 1995, according to the government's own figures, 1,404 new regulations were added, and 420 were thrown out. But this is not necessarily the fault of evil bureaucrats. At least some of the blame lies with the politicians and the public.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To be fair, those figures are crude. Some of them relate to such unobjectionable measures as road closures. But anti-red tape activists insist that they are a massive underestimate: <font size=-1>MP</font>s supporting a parliamentary motion earlier this year to promote deregulation maintain that the real figure from April 1995 to July 1996 is 3,000 new regulations. The task force, too, is clearly not content: its report focused not on achievements, but on the vast amount still to be done.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So why are regulations being created faster than they are being abolished? Europe must take some of the blame. Single market legislation means that products must be acceptable throughout the <font size=-1>EU</font>, which regulates to harmonise. Hence, apparently, the need for ten pages of Euro regulations related to the sale of cut flowers. If Europe's Council of Ministers passes new regulations in areas where national rules already exist, the result is too often two sets of regulation on the same subject.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet more of the blame, say the deregulators, lies at home. As Maurice Denyer, managing director of a small building company and a member of the task force, points out, efforts to make life easier for businesses sometimes fall foul of the regulators' passion for regulating.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government has, for instance, moved towards goals-based regulation: telling businesses what to aim for, but not how to do it. The idea is to give firms freedom in how to comply with the rules. Yet, says Mr Denyer, inspectors have responded by making "accepted codes of practice" appended to the regulations increasingly rigid, so the effect is much the same as the old, prescriptive, regulations.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then there is the problem of vested interests created by the existing set of regulations. The almighty row about the deregulation of Sunday shopping hours was created not just by the trade unions and the religious few, but also by small shopkeepers who feared that their profit margins would be eroded by supermarkets. The result was partial deregulation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But a wider problem is attitudes to regulation among the public and in the press. Although people are against "red tape" in general, any particular health problem or accident inevitably leads to calls that "something must be done". The sharpest current example is a network of regulations and inspectors currently being set up for youth activity centres, as a result of an accident at such a centre in Lyme Regis in 1993, in which four teenagers were killed. The accident was a freak. The cost of setting up the system will be around &#163;5.5m if only the 3,000-odd profit-making centres are included, or &#163;100m if 80,000-odd voluntary sector ones are also included.<br>

<p><b>The economy</b></p>
<h1>Return of the North-South gap</h1>

DURING the boom of the late 1980s, it became fashionable to describe a Britain divided into two nations: the Loadsamoney South and the Bugger-all money North, in Harry Enfield's uncryptic words. The recession of 1990-92, which hit the South disproportionately hard, silenced such talk. Indeed, the thought spread that the 1980s were an aberration, and that future economic growth would be spread more evenly throughout the land. Now, with another consumer boom taking hold, it seems that the gulf between the rich South and the poor North is starting to widen again, and that it may go on widening for years to come.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The extent of the North-South divide, past or future, should not be overstated. In every region of Britain, average incomes per head have risen by at least 20% since 1979. There have long been pockets of wealth north of Birmingham to match anything in the Home Counties. The three local-authority districts in Britain with the lowest average incomes per head are in London. Some southern areas receive regional aid: Cornwall has had assisted-area status for more than 15 years. Even so, the North-South distinction matters.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<a href="br2.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference between unemployment in selected British regions and the national average rate (excluding Northern Ireland). The highest rate of joblessness over the past 20 years has been in the North of England, and the other above average regions are all from the northern half of the country. The South (comprising the regions of south-east and south-west England, East Anglia and the east Midlands) had below-average unemployment. In the 1980s, the gap between the highest and lowest jobless rates soared from 2-3% to 6-8%, then fell to 4% in the recent recession.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That four-percentage-point gap suggests that rumours of the death of the North-South divide in the 1990s were exaggerated. So do aggregate measures of prosperity: average <font size=-1>GDP</font> per head in the South is now &#163;10,069; it is &#163;8,448 in the North. The South's per capita consumer spending beats the North's by &#163;7,544 to &#163;6,412. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Does this matter? The answer depends largely on whether the gap is self-correcting, or permanent. After all, simple theories of supply and demand would suggest that firms will move to areas of low wages and high unemployment, to take advantage of cheaper labour and surplus workers, or that workers will move away from such areas to where more and better-paid jobs exist. Both movements should narrow the gap. At first glance, this seems to be what has helped to narrow the unemployment differentials since the late 1980s.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, this optimistic interpretation is challenged in "Planning for Local Change", a study of the British economy published on September 27th by the Henley Centre, a firm of economic forecasters. It concludes that the narrowing of the gap during the 1990-92 recession, far from being the start of a permanent structural shift in favour of the North, was a temporary correction resulting from the bursting of the late 1980s' housing and consumption bubble, which was biggest in the South.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With that correction now complete, the South is likely to grow faster once again, says the study. Indeed, the gap between the highest and lowest regional jobless rates has grown from four percentage points to five since 1992. And, as <a href="br3.gif">chart 2</a> shows, although manufacturing jobs have been lost equally in both North and South during the post-1992 recovery, the South has been leading the way in creating new service-sector jobs, as it did in the 1980s.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to one of the report's authors, Paul Williams, an economist at the Henley Centre, rather than moving to areas where wages are lowest, firms tend to cluster together in the more competitive bits of the country. The South is better represented in those service industries which are likely to create the most wealth over the next few years: telecoms, computers and financial services. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some leading economists, such as America's Paul Krugman, argue that, although regional disparities may grow in the short run, congestion costs will limit, and then reverse, the process of agglomeration in the long run. Mr Williams disputes this, arguing instead that the South's competitive edge comes from its superior ability--from a greater pool of educated workers and better access to finance, among other things--to move rapidly into whatever economic activity has the highest value added at any given moment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The North produces the lion's share of manufacturing output, but the manufacturing that does takes place in the South has a far higher value per tonne. When service firms have shifted away from congested parts of the South, they have tended to move first to less congested parts of the same region. There have been a number of well-publicised moves to the North, but most of these were of back-office, low value added activities. High value-creating activity remains largely southern-based; 60% of venture-capital investment in Britain goes to south-east England alone.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In America, although some states have enjoyed consistently faster economic growth than others during the past half century, the average rate of unemployment in each state has tended to stay close to the national average. Any deviations from the national average have mostly vanished within a few years, as the jobless moved to where the work was.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Britain, however, regional differences have persisted. Incredibly, the regional ranking of unemployment rates has barely changed since 1918. Migration has been relatively modest, although a southwards drift has recently restarted (see <a href="br3.gif">chart</a>). Moreover, movement is mostly by skilled, non-manual workers. As a result, there is little regional disparity in non-manual unemployment rates, but there are huge differences in manual joblessness. There are several plausible reasons why the less skilled stay put: it is hard for council tenants to move around the country, and property costs more in the South. But the perverse result is that, by offering an escape route to poorer regions' most valuable people, labour mobility exacerbates rather than ameliorates the North-South divide.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the divide does grow ever wider, it is likely to increase demand for more active regional policies to correct the imbalance. In fact, the government already transfers huge amounts northwards through the tax and social-security systems. "Financing Regional Government in Britain," a recent study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group, calculated how much tax each region would have to levy to pay for its own public spending. It found that, using 1993-94 data (the latest available), the basic rate of income tax would have to rise to 41% in Wales, 38% in Scotland and 32% in the North of England, compared with 24% now. (There would have to be similar increases in the top rate of tax.) People in the south-east and south west would enjoy a tax cut, to 18.5% and 22.6% respectively.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This complicates current demands for regional government in Scotland, Wales and northern England. Genuine autonomy in these areas would cost locals a fortune in higher taxes. But perhaps the oddest feature of British politics is the lack of interest in regional autonomy in southern England, which has much to gain by loosening ties with the rest of of the country. Many people in Italy's wealthy north voted for the independence-minded Northern League?. So where is Britain's Southern League<br>

<h1>Fair trade</h1>

BETWEEN now and the general election, Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, can expect frequent repeats of this week's run-ins with, on the one hand, Tory Eurosceptics and, on the other, Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. But the crumb of comfort for Mr Clarke in this week's economic data is that at least he will not face a balance-of-payments crisis. In the second quarter of this year, Britain ran a surplus of &#163;500m on its current account (its overall financial balance with the rest of the world), the biggest, and only the second, quarterly surplus since 1987 (see <a href="br4.gif">chart</a>). A positive balance for the whole of 1996 is now possible, or at worst a deficit of say &#163;1 billion-&#163;2 billion--nothing compared with the record deficit of &#163;22 billion in 1989.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economists in the City of London had forecast a deficit of over &#163;1 billion in the second quarter after news that there had been a &#163;3.6 billion deficit in traded goods during that period. But income from overseas investments was a surprisingly strong &#163;3.7 billion. And there was an equally buoyant trade surplus in services of &#163;1.9 billion, including a boost to tourism revenues of perhaps &#163;200m from overseas visitors to June's Euro 96 soccer tournament. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although unexpected, this current account rebound is no flash in the pan, reckons Jonathan Loynes, an economist at <font size=-1>HSBC</font>, an investment bank. Although the traded-goods deficit may get bigger as stronger investment and consumer spending sucks in imports, there is no reason why Britain's service exports or its foreign investments should falter, he says. For which good news Mr Clarke should be deeply grateful.<br>

<h1>Labour's awkward one-man band</h1>

IT WAS as wooer to shy virgin that Tony Blair gave his speech to a City of London audience this month. This was not the tough Mr Blair who will be paraded before voters at next week's Labour Party conference in Blackpool, but Tony Blair as Hugh Grant-- self-deprecating, charming and seductive. And so it took a certain nerve on the part of one member of the audience, George Cox of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, to ask the $64,000 question.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Mr Blair, like many here, I greatly enjoyed your talk and I applaud much of the sentiment in it," began Mr Cox. "My question is this: that if, sadly, at the last minute you had been incapacitated . . . could we have expected the same speech to have been given with the same insights, the same passion, the same conviction from any other member of your shadow cabinet, or perhaps of more importance, from any Labour candidate whom you will be putting forward to us to elect next year?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Blair replied with practised fluency. After the largest democratic exercise any party has undertaken, he had been elected on a modernisation ticket. There was "no real intellectual argument against modernisation". New Labour candidates and young Labour members were enthusiastic Blairites. His party was much less extreme and more united than were the Tories. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the one-man-band question is still the one the leader's intimates fear the most. It might cost them the election. Worse, if New Labour does prove a one-man band, it will fail in government. It is too easy to imagine circumstances in which a Labour government, elected with high hopes, dissolves into division and disarray. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The party's immediate priority is to try to stop the electorate imagining any such thing. At Blackpool the leadership will therefore seek to repeat last year's feat of winning every single tricky vote. They do not want a conference, but a rally.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet they may not get it. Imagine, if you will, the moment when the 85-year-old Barbara Castle, the personal embodiment of sentimental old Labour, totters to the rostrum to call for higher universal pensions. The argument against her is being conducted by Harriet Harman, who speaks for Labour on social security and who, for half the hall, is the traitor who sent her son to a selective grammar school. Ms Harman will win the argument. Lady Castle's proposal would clobber the taxpayer while doing nothing for poor pensioners who would lose in means tested benefits what they gain from higher universal pensions. But minds are not hearts, and Lady Castle may yet render her party one last disservice by winning the vote.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defeat for Mr Blair would not matter much in substance. Labour leaders have frequently ignored unpalatable conference decisions in the past. But it would be an uncomfortable omen for a Blair-led government. Two-thirds of Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s in the next Parliament will be retreads from this one. Many are not Blairites, but voted for him in a Faustian bargain: they give him silence, he gives them victory. But once he has won, they may not prove so tractable. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evidence of the potential cussedness of Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s in the next Parliament is contained in a fascinating paper, "Blair's Bastards", by Philip Cowley and Philip Norton of Hull University. Even now, their analysis shows, Labour rebels are both more numerous and more persistent than their Tory counterparts. Almost 70% of the party have rebelled against the party line since 1992; 35% have cast more than ten votes against the party line compared with 27% of Tories. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True, a few of the serial dissenters are to leave the Commons at the next general election--notably Peter Shore, a distinguished Eurosceptic. But, of the top 38 rebels, just five will definitely be gone from the next Parliament.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, Mr Blair will have potent weapons to wield against rebels: the power of patronage and the threat of expulsion or deselection. And he will be immeasurably helped by the fact that not one of the rebels proposes any serious alternative to Blairism.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, you can have rebels without a cause; which means that Mr Blair would be wise to contemplate an insurance policy. Even if Labour has a clear overall majority, he would be sensible to seek a working arrangement with Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, it may be easier for Mr Blair to do the deal if he has a majority than if the next Parliament is hung. In a hung Parliament, the Lib Dems will be <i>demandeurs</i>, with the power to pull the rug. Their price might prove too high. If, however, Mr Blair courts them when he has no need to, they should come cheaper. A cabinet job for Mr Ashdown; lesser ministries for Mr Ashdown's lesser colleagues; a modest reform of the voting system--although Lib Dem purists will huff and puff, these in reality might seal a deal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The advantages to Mr Blair would be substantial. The Lib Dems expect to win at least 30 seats. If they side with Labour, therefore, Mr Blair's majority will be 60 higher than if they are against him--a comfortable cushion against rebellion and the almost inevitable losses at by-elections. Such an alliance would also make it easier, if it endured, for him to win a second term. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seen in this light, the conference that is of most significance for a future Labour government may not be the party's own in Blackpool, but the one the Lib Dems have just held in Brighton. Some Lib Dems were outspokenly in favour of dealing with Labour. Some were outspokenly against. But most, including the leader himself, spoke about it not at all. As a result, come the day after polling, Mr Ashdown has a pretty free hand. If Mr Blair has any sense, he will firmly grasp it.<br>

<h1>Campaigning for a cause</h1>

WHY did 550 British marketeers, a habitually well-fed bunch, receive a Red Cross food parcel on September 24th? The Red Cross, one of the world's largest humanitarian organisations, is less concerned with their eating the loaf of bread it contained than their digesting the message on its wrapper. For Hovis, the baker of the bread, is one of the first companies to sign up with HelpAd, a company owned by the charity.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;HelpAd persuades makers of consumer goods to leave room for an advertisement on the outside of their packaging, and then sells this advertising space to another manufacturer, who makes something which goes well with the first product. Thus the loaf in the parcel carried an ad for Anchor butter; in another example Tabasco pepper sauce has bought spaces on the side of bottles of Del Monte tomato juice. The advertisements all include a little HelpAd logo explaining that the money from selling the space goes to the Red Cross. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;HelpAd charges commercially competitive rates for the space it sells. The aim is to secure a sustainable source of money for the Red Cross by tapping into companies' advertising budgets, rather than the discretionary funds usually set aside for charitable donations. The Red Cross spends around $24 billion a year-- around a tenth of the sum companies spend on advertising. HelpAd's goal is to be selling &#163;10m ($16m) of advertisements a year in Britain within two years. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far the makers of some 500 products have made inquiries. However, persuading protective brand managers to take the plunge has been laborious. A frequent obstacle to an apparently promising product marriage is that a parent company that makes a brand of cream cheese, say, which might potentially be advertised on another company's crackers in fact has its own rival brand of cracker under another label. So far HelpAds have appeared on seven products, and three more product pairings have been firmly promised to appear by February 1997. Many interested companies are holding off from commitment to see how these ten fare. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If they go well, HelpAd intends to expand overseas. Plans are already afoot in another seven European countries and in South Africa. Other kinds of advertising are on the cards, too. Robert Doyle, a Northern Irish construction surveyor who thought up the idea of HelpAd and who is now a consultant to the Red Cross, is encouraging sports stars to "give their right arms to the Red Cross", by using the right sleeve of their playing shirts as a location for a HelpAd. And HelpAd may function as a broker for charities other than the Red Cross, offering its service for a small percentage of the money paid for the advertisement.<br>

<p><b>Bulgaria</b></p>
<h1>Into the hole</h1>

FORTUNES are mixed among former communists. While frothy stockmarkets fuel recovery in Central Europe, Bulgaria is fighting to avert meltdown. On September 24th, the central bank raised its main interest rate almost threefold, to 300%, and placed nine banks under "special supervision". The move was a last-ditch attempt to restore public confidence in the banking system, to stave off default on the country's $11.9 billion foreign debt, and to halt the steep slide of the Bulgarian currency, the lev. The central bank's governor, Lyubomir Filipov, staked his job on the new reforms working: a brave bet indeed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Earlier stabs at reform were far too timid. In the spring, the central bank closed five troubled banks and raised interest rates several times, while the government launched a plan to shut loss-making industrial behemoths and kick-start privatisation. But this has proved inadequate. Inflation, brought under control last year, is now an annualised 110% and may soon hit 150%. The lev has collapsed from 71 to the dollar at start of the year to 230 (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). In recent weeks, depositors have lost all faith in the insolvent banking system, withdrawing local currency and switching it into dollars.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the government wants to avert disaster, it must move quickly on three fronts. First, it will have to close more dodgy banks, while toughening supervision and raising capital requirements for the survivors. Most banks are shoddily managed and have far too many dud loans. It must also stop state-run industry's losses. Of the 64 state-owned companies that the government promised to close earlier this year, only five have been wound up so far.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third aim should be quicker privatisation. Asset sales brought in a piffling 9 billion lev ($135m) last year. Only by speeding up the process can Bulgaria raise enough cash to see it through the coming months. On September 22nd, it announced plans to sell 15 of the largest state firms by the year's end. The sales should raise between $500m and $1 billion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But more than this is needed. Repairing a battered economy is expensive: raising the biggest Bulgarian banks' solvency ratios to international levels could cost $3 billion alone. On top of this, Bulgaria has its foreign debt to service. This month alone, it must find $130m to repay both principal and interest; next year it is expected to repay a total of $1.25 billion. If privatisation flags, the country may have to default for the second time since 1990.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether it does or not may depend on the World Bank and the <font size=-1>IMF</font>. Next week their representatives are due to meet government officials to discuss progress. If the Bulgarians impress the <font size=-1>IMF</font>, the Fund will release a $115m loan that it delayed last month; the World Bank may then follow with $200m of its own. If, however, the Fund holds on to its money, the lev--and Bulgaria's economic prospects--are sure to take another dive.<br>

<h1>The weirdest computer of all</h1>

<p><b>A quantum computer would rely on the surreal behaviour of the very small to work miracles with information. There is new hope that it might someday be more than fantasy</b></p>
THE computer has become so widespread, its applications so boundless, that it is easy to forget that it is just a machine, constrained like everything else by the laws of physics. But a machine is all it is, and a pretty simple one at that. The underlying logic of the programs--the binary choices that control the way a computer counts and calculates--would work just as well (if a lot more slowly) in a device that shuttled ball-bearings instead of electrons.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What, though, if a computer could be built around a different kind of physics, the quantum physics that governs the weird and uncertain behaviour of atoms and sub-atomic particles? A group of physicists and mathematicians that is working on this question believes that quantum computing could change computing just as thoroughly as quantum physics changed the Newtonian certainties of classical physics earlier in the 20th century.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Naturally, building a useful quantum computer would be difficult. Only the very smallest objects behave in a detectably quantum way. This means that the components of such a computer would be very tiny and very delicate. But so great is the theoretical appeal of the machine that America's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (<font size=-1>DARPA</font>) has just created an Institute for Quantum Information and Computing, and given it $5m to investigate the possibilities.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Bit players</b></b><br>
What makes quantum computing so attractive? For some jobs, a quantum computer would be able to put even the best of today's supercomputers in the shade. It would do this by employing a trick that ordinary computers cannot truly master--parallel processing. Although supercomputers are fast, they can, like all other digital computers, do only one thing at a time. Even the so called "parallel" computers now available are just collections of machines that each do only one thing at a time. But a quantum computer would be truly parallel. It would be able to do many different things simultaneously in the same piece of equipment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To see why, remember that every digital computer, no matter how wondrous its applications, consists merely of a lot of switches that are linked together and are either on or off. These switches can be thought of as the digits of numbers, in which case their ons and offs are the ones and zeros of binary counting. This is why, by a fortunate contraction of the words "binary digit", the currency of data processing is known as the "bit".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The switches inside a computer can also be interpreted as the trues and falses of a form of logic known as Boolean algebra. Indeed, they are organised into "logic gates" that do calculations using this algebra. A digital computer is mainly a machine for altering bits by running them through logic gates. The gate known as <font size=-1>AND</font>, for example, compares two bits. If both have a value of "one", it creates an output of one; otherwise it creates a zero. With the next tick of its internal clock, the computer then passes this output bit to another gate for further processing. Each tick, then, corresponds to one step of the calculation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the quantum world, however, the rules are different. A quantum computer's switches would not have to be either on or off. Like any quantum object which can come in several distinct states, a quantum switch can carry on indefinitely as a combination of all those states. It is not merely stuck halfway between on and off; it is actually on and off simultaneously, as if it existed in two parallel worlds.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bits in a "quantum computer" would not, therefore, be ones or zeros. They would be quantum combinations of one and zero. Such vacillating pieces of information are known as "qubits"(pronounced as "cubits", though they are usually rather smaller than the ancient Hebrew unit of length).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is this simultaneous existence in many states that would give quantum computing its power. An ordinary computer having (say) ten bits could exist in only one of 1,024 states (all the ten-digit sequences that can be made from ones and zeros) available to it, at each instant. A quantum computer with ten qubits could exist in all 1,024 states at the same time. It could therefore work on 1,024 calculations at once.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But qubits are fiendishly hard to make. For a quantum switch to maintain its multiple existence depends on one big proviso. Nothing can happen that might disturb it. No light must shine on it, no stray air molecules may bump into it, no inquiring probe can intrude on it. If it is disturbed, it stops vacillating and chooses a definite state to be in. This choice depends on chance and on the way its multiple personalities have interacted until then. If it happens prematurely, the computation will be ruined.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This proviso has made technical progress agonisingly slow. Paul Benioff, at Argonne National Laboratory, in Illinois, first applied quantum theory to computers in 1981. David Deutsch, at Oxford University, proposed the possibility of quantum parallel computers in 1985. Yet both had to wait until last year for the first two qubits to come on-line.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One group of quantum mechanics who created them was led by Chris Monroe, who works at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in Boulder, Colorado. Dr Monroe's group trapped a single ion (an atom with missing electrons) of beryllium, by walling it in with electric and magnetic fields and cooling it to within an ace of absolute zero (-273&#176;C). Such an ion has two energy levels--providing the first qubit. And it can vibrate in two ways within the trap--the second qubit. These qubits are linked together via a pulse of laser light, which can switch the ion from one energy level to the other. Whether it does so or not depends on which of the two vibrational patterns the ion is in.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result is a logic gate called <font size=-1>XOR</font>. This has two input bits, and reverses the value of the second if the first is "one". That is an important step. Though using many types of gate makes designing ordinary computers easier, it is possible to make do with just three: <font size=-1>AND</font>, <font size=-1>NOT</font> and <font size=-1>COPY</font>. A quantum computer is even simpler. It requires only two sorts of gate, and <font size=-1>XOR</font> is one of them. (The other would be able to change a zero into an arbitrary combination of zero and one. This has no equivalent in conventional computing.) <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Qubits can also be made out of light, because light can be polarised in two perpendicular directions. Jeff Kimble, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), in Pasadena, and the head of the <font size=-1>DARPA</font> quantum-computing institute, is working towards a light-based device. He and his team have designed a piece of apparatus that allows photons (the particles of which light is composed) to interact while they fly through a stream of caesium atoms. This interaction could in principle form the basis of logic gates like <font size=-1>XOR</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Trapping ions, though, may ultimately prove to be the best way to make real quantum computers. Such devices would require thousands of ions, vibrating in synchrony, and are certainly still in the realms of science fiction. But ion traps housing up to six ions have already been built during other atomic-physics projects. Groups at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico, and the University of Innsbruck, in Austria, are trying to improve upon them to connect a handful of qubits together.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Qubits v true bits</b></b><br>
Why bother? Why should <font size=-1>DARPA</font>, better known for researching missile defences and commissioning the precursor of the Internet, dabble in quantum theory? Perhaps to make better calculators. There are already three mathematical challenges known in which quantum computers would beat the pants off the ordinary kind.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first is up <font size=-1>DARPA</font>'s alley: cracking secret codes. The security of most "public key" coding schemes, in which people can exchange secrets without advance planning, relies on inscrutable large numbers. It is hard to factorise--to find numbers that multiply together to produce--some 200 digit numbers. But it is these factors that unlock the code. Since the programs for finding them are excruciatingly tedious, even for a fleet of supercomputers, such codes are pretty safe.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A quantum computer, on the other hand, would make short work of this task. In 1994, Peter Shor, a mathematician at <font size=-1>AT&T</font> Labs, in Murray Hill, New Jersey, designed a quantum circuit that could achieve it in many fewer steps. His quantum software arranges the multiple personalities of the qubits in a way that enables them to attack the problem separately, and then conspire together so that when they are, in the end, forced to behave like normal bits, they will be likely to produce the correct answer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like much of quantum theory, this can be properly explained only in mathematics, not words. But a sense of what it entails can be gained by recognising that the equations of quantum theory are not unlike those of wave motion, as Seth Lloyd, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has suggested. Each parallel path of a qubit is analogous to a sound wave of a particular pitch. When different tones play together, they interfere, reinforcing or cancelling one another depending on their strengths and timing. The parallel lives of qubits do the same. And the strongest tones are the ones likeliest to be chosen by the qubits when they are measured.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In this analogy, an ordinary computation can be thought of as a melody of single notes plinked out on a piano. A quantum computation, with its complex array of chords and rhythms, sounds more like the Berlin Philharmonic. Dr Shor's trick was to arrange the concert hall so that the music was completely dominated by the proper overtones and beats--the rich timbre of the French horns, say--that correspond to the correct solution.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lov Grover, a computer scientist at Bell Labs (which recently split from <font size=-1>AT&T</font> Labs), has written quantum symphonies to solve two other problems. One, published in May, is a way to search unsorted databases. If you were to sift through 10,000 pieces of paper scattered about your desk in search of one important memo, you would have to be prepared to scan 5,000 of them to have an even chance of finding it. By assigning each parallel computation to pursue a different choice, a quantum computer could do the same in only 40 runs.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Grover's other discovery, announced this month, is that quantum computers would be talented statisticians. They would excel at finding single numbers which depend collectively on lots of data: the median age of a large population, for example. If a quantum computer and an ordinary computer with the same internal clock rate raced to do it, the quantum computer would win hands down.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>
</p><p><b><b>Back to the future</b></b><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is, however, a snag. Qubits, not being true bits, are not truly digital. One of the big advantages of recording and processing information digitally is that it is difficult to make a mistake (electronic "ones" are not that easily turned into "zeros"), and surprisingly easy to design ways to recognise and correct any mistake that is made.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This ease of correction was shown in the 1940s, at a time when the first digital computers were being constructed. Claude Shannon, who also worked at <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, set the ball rolling by investigating ways of encoding bits of information so that they would resist errors during transmission down telephone lines. In the 1950s, John von Neumann, one of the mathematicians who helped to develop the theory of these early computers, went on to show how a reliable computer could be built out of unreliable parts, by using Shannon's ideas and combining them with extra (so-called redundant) circuitry.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The simplest error-correcting code is triple-redundant. Each bit is copied into two more bits: 0 becomes 000, and 1 becomes 111. If one bit accidentally flips, the other two indicate this and can be used to fix it. But Rolf Landauer, a physicist at the <font size=-1>IBM</font> Watson Research Centre, in Yorktown Heights, New York, has insisted that this cannot work with qubits, which cannot be measured, let alone copied. Yet error-correction would be vastly more important in a quantum computer than an ordinary computer, since the disturbance of even one qubit could ruin the coherence of the whole computation. If quantum computing is to become more than a dream, it needs a new way to correct errors as well as new hardware. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was therefore a welcome surprise when Dr Shor announced a year ago that he had invented a quantum error-correcting code. Instead of three qubits, Dr Shor's encoding formula required nine. A few months later other researchers at <font size=-1>IBM</font>, Los Alamos and Oxford came up with codes that work with five of them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The idea begins with the qubit that needs to be protected from errors, and four other qubits, set to zero. A sequence of logic gates changes and tangles all five bits into a larger quantum combination. Just as one qubit is a mix of two different states, two qubits are a mix of four, three are a mix of eight, and so on. Five entangled qubits span 32 possibilities--each of the five-digit sequences that can be made of ones and zeros.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Five qubits are enough, though, to preserve the quantum ambiguity of what is going on, even if one of them goes bad. One qubit being unmasked by, for example, a collision with a stray air molecule, does not reveal enough information for an observer to work anything out about the qubit originally used to make the mixture. In these circumstances, the calculation can be corrected, and proceed unhindered. The original mixing, in other words, creates quantum cannon fodder for such interactions as would otherwise spoil a combination. Some losses become tolerable without the game being given away.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are still problems to be overcome, of course. It is necessary to design logic gates that will work on entangled bundles of five qubits at a time. And errors can still creep in during the encoding process itself. Dr Shor's latest achievements, to be announced at the Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, being held in Burlington, Vermont, in October, address both of these concerns. First, he has designed logic gates for protected qubits by combining lots of two-qubit logic gates. Second, he has shown, theoretically, that the improvements in components needed to make quantum computing reliable should not, once such components actually exist, be too onerous.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His second result is analogous to the ideas in one of von Neumann's achievements, the "Synthesis of Reliable Organisms from Unreliable Parts". Early sceptics of computing thought that allowing computers to work, say, ten times longer on a problem would require components that were ten times as reliable. Von Neumann showed that, with the shrewd use of error correcting codes and redundant logic gates, the components did not need to be any more reliable. All that was necessary was that the speed of the calculation be slowed down to allow for error-correction. Dr Shor's result is not quite as powerful as this. He has shown that to allow a quantum computation to proceed for ten times as long, the reliability of components does have to be improved a little. But the improvement required is a small fixed increment, not a factor of ten.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That quantum error-correction is possible at all has led to a new wave of optimism about quantum computing. The circuitry for error-correction is too complex to be built in a laboratory anytime soon. But the group from Innsbruck, which is led by Peter Zoller and Rainer Blatt, has just published another partial error-correcting code based on the principle of quantum cannon fodder. This one is still simpler than Dr Shor's and should be particularly effective in correcting the sort of errors that might be expected in an ion-trap quantum computer.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Three times five, silly</b></b><br>
The Innsbruck group hopes to try out its scheme with a three-bit computer by 1998. Meanwhile, in Los Alamos, Richard Hughes and his team are planning to implement Dr Shor's algorithm for factorisation. With luck they will be able to factorise the number 15 within five years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That this is considered ambitious hints at the difficulty of this latest merger of physics and computing. Indeed, many physicists doubt whether quantum computing will ever amount to anything useful. Dr Landauer is one of them. His work on the ordinary (not quantum) physics of information led to a new appreciation of information's inextricable relationship with physics. But he does not expect <font size=-1>IBM</font> to be mass-producing quantum computers anytime soon.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In this, he is assuredly correct. And even among the quantum computer's enthusiasts, most researchers are motivated less by a desire to produce a practical quantum computer than by a wish to learn how to wield more control over quantum effects themselves. Until now, nobody has been able to direct quantum states with the flexibility or precision required for quantum computers. Doing so should help to illuminate some of quantum theory's more curious features.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, if quantum computing really could be made to work, physicists would have a powerful new analytical tool. One use for it would be to explore the many ramifications of quantum theory (such as the "Hubbard model" of how electrons hop around in a crystal, or theories of fundamental particles) that are thought to be correct but cannot be tested precisely. The sort of equations needed to check these ideas are too much for even the most nimble non-quantum supercomputer to handle.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1982, the late Richard Feynman, who was also at Caltech, suggested that a quantum computer would help to solve these sorts of problems. To simulate an ordinary object, only a few numbers are needed. For a quantum object every possible state must be tracked--an enormous set of numbers. How better to keep up with the calculation than by using something that is itself in a multitude of states?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether such uses will come to fruition remains to be seen. But, as Dr Landauer points out, in one sense quantum computing has already been useful. It has provided a salutary reminder that computing does not take place in an abstract mathematical world. It uses earth, air, fire and water--or single atoms of those things. It is subject to all the limitations, and all the possibilities, written in the laws of physics. Some mathematicians and computer scientists spend their days searching for the quickest possible algorithm to solve particular problems. To their surprise they must now learn quantum theory, in order to cover all the possibilities allowed by nature. After a long absence, they are being forced to return from the virtual reality of information science and deal with the real world, in all its indeterminate queerness.<br>

<h1>TECHNOLOGY BRIEF</h1>

<h2>Being digital is not enough</h2>

<p><b>The dustbin of history is full of technological ideas that looked good at the time, but which nobody wanted to buy. What does it take for a new gizmo to catch on? The first in a series of articles seeks lessons from attempts to replace the compact disc and the tape cassette</b></p><br>
EVERYONE who is anyone in the consumer-electronics business has a dream: to do to the compact disc what the <font size=-1>CD</font> did to the vinyl record. Many have tried. All, so far, have failed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Technologies may miss their mark for several reasons. They may not fill a market need. They may not deliver what they promised. And they may be too expensive to manufacture. But none of these reasons for failure applies to the various gadgets that have been put forward as successors to the <font size=-1>CD</font>. The market for recorded music is clearly huge. The new technologies worked. And they were not ludicrously costly to make. But they failed because they were not sufficiently better than the established alternatives.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the success of <font size=-1>CD</font>s, venture capitalists have introduced a rule of thumb, known as the <font size=-1>10X</font> rule, to help them decide which ventures to back. They ask themselves the question, "Is this thing ten times better than what it is replacing?" Or, perhaps more accurately, "Will consumers perceive it to be sufficiently better to think it worth the upheaval of changing?" So far, since the <font size=-1>CD</font>, it seems that no consumer audio technology has passed this test.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1982, when Philips and Sony introduced the <font size=-1>CD</font>, the perception of a massive leap was certainly created. <font size=-1>CD</font>s were, indeed, better than <font size=-1>LP</font>s. Encased in protective lacquer, and read by lasers instead of having sapphires dragged across their surfaces, they did not wear out. They needed to be neither flipped nor rewound. They took up less storage space. And some people even thought that the recording quality was superior. But what really helped the <font size=-1>CD</font> was timing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sales of recorded music went flat in the late 1970s. In 1980 they actually began to fall. The moment for a new technology was psychologically right. And <font size=-1>CD</font> was the better mousetrap people were looking for. In 1982, being digital was an excitingly modern concept. The perceived benefits were enormous. So sales grew by leaps and bounds (see <a href="st1.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Flushed with success, the same two companies introduced digital audio tape (<font size=-1>DAT</font>) in 1987. <font size=-1>DAT</font> has advantages over both <font size=-1>CD</font>s and tape cassettes (which survived the <font size=-1>CD</font> onslaught at least in part because another Sony technology, the Walkman, allowed them to do things that <font size=-1>CD</font>s could not). Digital tape beats <font size=-1>CD</font>s because it can record music instead of just playing it. And it beats cassettes because its sound quality is better. Unlike <font size=-1>CD</font>s, though, <font size=-1>DAT</font> bombed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The received wisdom is that it was killed by the record companies, who were afraid it might be used to make pirate copies, and thus wreck their sales. But other technologies (including <font size=-1>CD</font>s themselves) have been resisted by record companies and still succeeded. The real reason, therefore, seems to be that it simply did not pass the <font size=-1>10X</font> rule.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today, <font size=-1>DAT</font> lingers on in a few minor applications. It is the professional musician's favourite way to exchange demo tapes. And followers of bands such as the Grateful Dead and Phish (who permit audiences to record shows) use <font size=-1>DAT</font> in droves. But these are niche markets for specialists. They are not the places where billions are made.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Undaunted, the two companies tried once again in 1992, this time independently. Once again, they ran up against the <font size=-1>10X</font> rule. Philips introduced the digital compact cassette (<font size=-1>DCC</font>). This, at least, had the advantage that the machines designed to play it could (unlike <font size=-1>DAT</font> machines) also play ordinary cassettes. Sony replied with the mini disc which, unlike the <font size=-1>CD</font>, allows a user to make his own recordings. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This time the record companies could not be blamed for any failure. Unlike <font size=-1>DAT</font>, the <font size=-1>DCC</font> had the support of most of them. And the mini disc naturally had Sony Music (previously <font size=-1>CBS</font> Records) behind it. It was billed as the biggest, bloodiest fight-of-the-formats since the video-cassette recorder duel between Betamax and <font size=-1>VHS</font>. But it wasn't. The two did not lay a glove on each other. Instead, both were floored by existing technologies.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>DCC</font> was a total failure. Though superior to ordinary cassettes, it was not even as high-fidelity as <font size=-1>DAT</font>. This was because Philips made the tape heads of <font size=-1>DCC</font> players simple and cheap. That, in turn, meant that the music had to be simplified and compressed. Philips did this mainly by "throwing away" inaudible sounds. But even so, aficionados claimed to be able to hear imperfections in pieces with a wide range of treble and bass. And when aficionados fail to rave, consumers are unlikely to buy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The mini disc did not fail completely--it still has a following in Japan. But it did not storm the rest of the world. A mini disc looks like a small <font size=-1>CD</font>, but it works rather differently. A <font size=-1>CD</font>'s surface is covered with pits, which encode the information it carries. A mini disc is a magnetic recording (though, like a <font size=-1>CD</font>, it is read by a laser). This means that, like a cassette, it can be sold blank and used as a recording medium. And the mini disc not only trumps the cassette on sound quality, it is also able to leap from song to song instantly. Even so, these advantages do not seem to add up to the jump prescribed by the <font size=-1>10X</font> test--at least, not in the West.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The latest attempt, though, does pass the test, at least formally. The <font size=-1>DVD</font> (variously claimed to stand for "digital video disc" and "digital versatile disc") has narrower tracks and tinier pits than a <font size=-1>CD</font>. Each of its recording layers can hold about seven times as much information as a <font size=-1>CD</font>. This is enough to store a boxed set of music albums (or a feature film, or 4.7 gigabytes of computer memory; the <font size=-1>DVD</font> truly is versatile). Since the discs will feature at least two, and possibly four such recording layers (the laser can be refocused to read below the surface), they will beat the <font size=-1>10X</font> rule hands down in the area of storage capacity.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This, then, will truly test the rule. By the time <font size=-1>DVD</font>s are released (which was due to happen this autumn, but looks as though it will slip to next year), <font size=-1>CD</font>s will be a technology that is a decade and a half old. Their sales are still on the up, but they no longer carry the aura of modernity. The time may be ripe for a change, and the technological leap may be big enough for this to be the change that works.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But perhaps not. Though <font size=-1>DVD</font>s will surely do well in computer and video applications, where the extra capacity will be welcome, having more than 25 times as much music on a disc may not turn out to be what people want after all. And if it isn't, there is still plenty of room in the dustbin.<br>

<h1><center>Leadership by Stealth</center></h1>

VICTORIANS enforced their diplomacy by gunboat. At the end of the 20th century, the preferred instrument is the Stealth bomber. The Stealth is technically amazing, powerfully effective--and also bizarrely-shaped and difficult to trace. Is it not, in fact, rather like America's foreign policy?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As America goes nose-to-nose with Iraq's Saddam Hussein in the closing weeks of an election campaign, the familiar chorus can be heard. The United States is unpredictable; unreliable; too easily excited; too easily distracted; too fond of throwing its weight around. While Americans wonder which candidate will be better for their living standards over the next four years, America's friends have a wish-list of their own for foreign-policy improvements, irrespective of who wins or loses in November. And it is not short.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But is it fair? The main indictment, of inconsistency abroad, was current even before Mr Clinton began his unnerving odyssey through the perils of international affairs. Yet the verdict is not cut and dried. In many spheres, America has stood firm. It has persisted in trying to bring peace to the Middle East. It has remained committed to security in Europe, through <font size=-1>NATO</font>, and in Asia, through <font size=-1>APEC</font> and the security treaty with Japan. Most bases abroad have been retained. America continues to understand--indeed, to take pride in--its role as sole superpower, military colossus and chief knocker-together-of-heads on the world stage. It preened itself over the Rabin-Arafat handshake and, more justifiably, over Bosnia's Dayton accords--although they followed four damaging years of shall-we-shan't-we muddle towards the war.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America is also, however, consistent in less palatable ways. Since the end of the cold war, it has been in search of an enemy: and has found him in despots hither and yon, from Saddam Hussein to Cuba's Fidel Castro to Muhammad Farrah Aideed in Somalia. The personal vendetta, sometimes pursued by aged congressmen rather than the president, has become a regular event. So too has a manifest public reluctance to involve America in the sort of activities abroad that may be required of a superpower, especially the spending of money and the sending of troops.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here lies the nub of the matter. The real complaint about American foreign policy is not waywardness, but reluctance to engage. To begin with, it is often hard to get America's attention. The problem is not isolationism, which, some firebrands apart, has no constituency these days. It is the natural self-centredness of a vast continent that faces no immediate external threats. No president since Nixon has seen his main job as devising foreign policy. Mr Clinton's attention-deficit on the subject (recently reduced) is not, alas, an aberration. But a president can be helped by good advisers in both the State Department and the Pentagon; and, however the election turns out, a more authoritative secretary of state in a happier department would be useful.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For nowadays the main point of foreign policy ought not to be the elimination of immediate external threats, but the avoidance of future ones. On that score, recent policy looks misdirected. During his tenure so far, Warren Christopher has been 27 times to Damascus and only once to China. Indeed, from sheer energy and verbiage alone, it may well appear that little Cuba is as much a threat as an expansionary China. America has not hesitated to offend most of its allies in Europe and in its own hemisphere in the cause of bashing a neighbouring island which represents no threat to it at all. Meanwhile, the signals sent to China, which may be a huge threat in future, have been distinctly mixed: now tough on human rights, now fawning on trade; now oblivious to China's menacing noises in the South China Sea, now gunships in the Taiwan Strait.
</p><p><b>More clarity, less crusading</b>
<br>This choice of priorities has been unfortunate. Even more so, however, has been America's confusion between economics and politics, and its treatment of its biggest allies. Starting under George Bush, and continuing enthusiastically under Mr Clinton, America embarked on the idea that economics, not politics, should now take the lead in foreign affairs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a mistake in principle, for governments are no better at selling exports or levering open foreign markets than they are at domestic industrial policy. But it is a disaster in practice, because it leads inevitably to confrontation with America's rich-world allies, which are its main exporting rivals and offer the juiciest markets. Squabbles with Europe over trade, and divisive competition with it over exports to China, have been regular bugbears. Even worse was America's eagerness to take Japan to the brink of a trade war over cars in June 1995. America is not the only guilty party in this regard. But it is the world's leader, and it needs to keep in mind the temptation that a divided alliance offers to rogue dictators such as Saddam as well as to budding powers such as China.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These strains have been worsened by America's distrust of multilateralism. True, it can have its drawbacks, notably the confusion of lines of command; unilateral action must remain an option. But America needs to get over its awkwardness in tactical alliances, its hit-or-miss communication with allies, and, in particular, its niggling attitude towards the United Nations. For all its failings, the <font size=-1>UN</font> is a useful resource, not least in long-term peacekeeping. America's rudeness towards it, and refusal to help pay for it, are foolish.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The business of prioritising has also been confused by the conviction that America should have a set of moral rules for foreign policy. Several presidents this century have tried to formulate a doctrine that laid down when America would intervene, in defence of which principles. To uphold human rights or democracy is an admirable aim, but desperately uneven in application. Lack of democracy does not inspire America to put pressure on Saudi Arabia, for example. As a guiding rule for foreign policy, it is more honest for America to admit (as James Baker, then secretary of state, did during the Gulf war, and as Mr Clinton did over Rwanda), that it intervenes when an essential resource such as oil is at risk, or when the threat to world stability cannot be ignored.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's friends may feel that this is not good enough. But they should examine their own consciences. They frequently go crying to America over problems, such as Bosnia, in which it has no obvious interest. They are the first to complain if America does nothing. Yet if it intervenes, or adopts a policy of constant covert meddling, they may well complain even more. A little consistency in the world's attitude is overdue; a little more gratitude, when earned, might even encourage the American public.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All these improvements are devoutly to be wished as the next four years unfold. Would one candidate in the election ensure them more than the other? That is uncertain. Mr Clinton's grasp of foreign policy has improved markedly in the past two years; but his attention is still less focused than it might be, and his team is tired. Bob Dole has hinted that he might act more from principle, and his foreign-policy advisers have much to say about consistency and clarity. But he seems barely interested, and they are untried. Between the Clinton muddle and the Dole vacuum, the world may well go on asking whether America's foreign policy is a bird or a plane. And if that is an unfair question, the remedy is still largely--though not entirely--in America's hands.

<p><h2>Tribal splits</h2></p>
<p><p>The first <b>Bosnian elections</b>, intended to create national institutions in the aftermath of a 43-month civil war, passed off peacefully, with most voters favouring tribal parties. Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Muslim president, who favours a unified country, narrowly defeated Momcilo Krajisnik, a Serb separatist, for the chairmanship of a three-man presidency. Few Muslims dared to exercise their right to vote in their former homes, now ethnically cleansed by Bosnian Serbs.
<p>Umberto Bossi, leader of the separatist Northern League, proclaimed northern Italy an "independent and sovereign" republic called <b>Padania</b>. But fewer people than the League expected turned up to hear the announcement in Venice, after three days of secession rallies along the River Po.
<p>Russia's president, <b>Boris Yeltsin</b>, entered hospital in preparation for a heart operation. His stay is to be extended by several days, raising fears that he is sicker than the Kremlin admits.
<p>The European Union rejected a British proposal to scale back or eliminate a cull of up to 147,000 cattle thought to carry <font size=-1>BSE</font>, or <b>mad-cow disease</b>. Britain threatened to go ahead anyway, risking the collapse of an agreement designed to lead to the lifting of the <font size=-1>EU</font> ban on exports of British beef. Switzerland said it would kill one in eight of its herd to eradicate the disease.
<p>European governments tightened their belts to prepare for <b>economic and monetary union</b> in 1999. France announced a budget that it claims will cut its public-sector deficit to the Maastricht treaty target of 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> next year and its debt to 58%. Germany's parliament passed a series of cuts to social-welfare programmes.
<p>Eurostat, the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s statistical arm, said traditional <b>families</b> are in decline. Although 72% of men and women are married, the share is shrinking and 8% of children in 12 countries live with only one parent. Danes are the loneliest Europeans: 22% of them live alone; only 4% of Spaniards do so. Ireland has the biggest families, with half the population living in families of five or more.</p>
<p><h2>Korean conundrum</h2></p>
<p><p>A <b>North Korean submarine </b>ran aground in South Korean waters; 11 North Korean soldiers were later found shot dead on a mountain, in what the South Korean authorities said was a mass suicide. Another seven were found and killed by the South Koreans; others were thought still to be at large.
<p>The Japanese prime minister convened a special session of parliament for September 27th. This is widely expected to set the stage for a <b>snap election</b> in October.
<p>Indian police <b>arrested Sukh Ram</b>, a former communications minister, a month after police found over $1m in cash hidden in his house. Mr Ram was arrested on his return from abroad.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>The Afghan rebel militia, the <b>Taliban</b>, captured the strategic city of Jalalabad. They now control two-thirds of the country.</p>
<p><h2>Iraqi lull</h2></p>
<p><p>To general relief, <b>Iraq and America</b> both drew back from full battle, though America's military build-up in the Gulf continued. Massoud Barzani who, with Iraqi help, had defeated his Kurdish rival in northern Iraq, hedged his bets by renewing his previously warm contacts with America.
<p>Syria gave Israel, on the eve of Yom Kippur, a<b> bad case of nerves</b> by redeploying some 12,000 of its troops in Lebanon. The completion of Lebanon's general election showed Syrian-backed politicians firmly in control.
<p>Israel's Likud government approved plans to build 1,800 <b>new housing units</b> in Matityahu, a West Bank settlement where about 2,400 ultra-orthodox Jews live. Talks with the Palestinians on Israeli troop redeployment in occupied Hebron got nowhere.
<p>At the end of a "national understanding conference", <b>Algeria's</b> President Liamine Zeroual said a general election would be held early next year. Several secular opposition parties boycotted the conference. The Islamic party, the <font size=-1>FIS</font>, was barred. The <font size=-1>FIS</font>'s armed wing further distanced itself from what it called "suspicious terrorist operations" by its rival, the <font size=-1>GIA</font>.
<p>Eugene de Kock, a former policeman in <b>South Africa</b> convicted of murder and pleading for leniency, said that two former presidents, F.W. de Klerk and P.W. Botha, knew of covert attacks on anti-apartheid activists.</p>
<p><h2>America in camera</h2></p>
<p><p>A civil action against <b>O.J. Simpson</b>, the football star acquitted last year of killing his ex-wife and her lover, opened in Santa Monica without television cameras. It also lacked a jury, as lawyers scrambled to find 12 people uninfluenced by the criminal trial.
<p><b>Guatemala's</b> government and rebel guerrillas reached an agreement on the future role of the armed forces that should open the way to a full peace deal soon. The 45,000-strong army, notoriously as brutal as the rebels in the 1970s and 1980s, will be cut by a third.
<p>In Colombia, a <b>kidnapped </b>Briton and a Dane were released after months--against payment of a ransom, complained Colombian officials. The kidnapping of a new-born baby aroused public outrage. A Dutch couple kidnapped in Costa Rica by former Contra guerrillas from Nicaragua were freed, also for ransom. In Mexico, Marxist guerrillas threatened to hit big business, method unspecified.
<p>The five-country Andean Pact said it expected to sign a preliminary deal on free trade with the <b>Mercosur</b> customs union by year-end. Venezuela and Peru hope for full deals with Mercosur by then.

<p><h2>Ciao, Caio</h2>
<p><p>Barely three months into the job and two weeks after Carlo De Benedetti resigned as chairman, <b>Olivetti</b>'s chief executive, Francesco Caio, quit in the wake of an investigation into alleged false corporate reporting at the high-technology group. Mr Caio's replacement is Roberto Colaninno, boss of Sogefi, a car-parts firm.
<p><b>Italian prosecutors </b>ordered a new round of arrests, beginning with one of the country's most prominent businessmen, Lorenzo Necci, who is head of Italy's state railway. Among others detained as part of the same investigation into corruption were the head of a state-owned arms company, two magistrates and a former politician.
<p>In a serious blow for Britain's Serious Fraud Office, a judge ruled out any further legal action against four former executives of the <b>Maxwell group</b> of companies, including Kevin Maxwell, son of its founder, the late Robert Maxwell. Mr Maxwell, who had been cleared of conspiring to defraud the group's pension funds in an earlier trial, had argued that the <font size=-1>SFO</font>'s decision to seek another one was "oppressive". The judge agreed.
<p>Grappling with a <b>Czech banking crisis</b>, authorities took control of Agrobanka, the country's fifth-largest bank and its largest privately owned one. Agrobanka's links with Kreditni, a bust bank, were beginning to cause liquidity problems.
<p>The European Commission was expected to open a formal inquiry into the price paid by <b>Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais</b> for a former subsidiary. The state-owned French bank, undergoing a massive restructuring and about to ask the government to assume yet more costs, pushed Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Banque Occidentale into a state-owned holding company last year before buying it back in June.</p>
<p><h2>Beat that</h2></p>
<p><p><b>Ford</b> struck a three-year pay deal with its unions, setting a pace that General Motors, its bigger rival, might be forced to keep. America's number-two car maker promised to guarantee the survival of 95% of union jobs (now that it has slimmed down).
<p><b>Alcatel Alsthom</b> submitted a bid to buy <b>Thomson</b>, a defence group, from the French government, and said it would seek an Asian partner for the group's loss-making consumer-electronics business. The French government has received a rival bid from the <b>Lagard&egrave;re/Matra </b>group, another French conglomerate.
<p><b>Sony's Hollywood problems </b>returned with the ejection of Mark Canton from his job as chairman of Columbia TriStar Pictures and the refusal by Arnold Rifkin of the William Morris talent agency to take the job. Lucy Fisher, vice-chairman, didn't want the job either, but she is temporarily running the studios.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Scott Sassa quit as head of <b>Turner Broadcasting System's</b> entertainment division as the acquisition of <font size=-1>TBS</font> by <b>Time Warner</b>, newly equipped with federal approval, neared completion. Ted Turner, founder of <font size=-1>TBS</font>, takes on responsibility for the new group's cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> networks and will also become vice-chairman of Time Warner.
<p><b>Deutsche Telekom</b>, with a view to its partial privatisation in November, forecast a DM1.5 billion ($1 billion) dividend for 1996 despite a 96% plunge in first-half net profits from last year's DM3.5 billion to DM129m, caused mainly by the cost of redundancies. Telekom also said it was pulling out of a digital pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> consortium, intending to cash in on its cable-network monopoly. A prospective competitor, Vebacom, announced a deal with Ruhrgas to build a fibre-optic network alongside the country's gas pipelines.
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>) <br> Forecasts for international <b>air travel </b>are being revised upwards by the airlines. The International Air Transport Association (<font size=-1>IATA</font>) now expects average annual growth of 7.1% in 1996-2000, up from earlier forecasts of 6.6%. Domestic traffic will grow by 6%. By 2000 the total number of airline passengers is expected to have risen to almost 1.7 billion from 1.3 billion last year.</p>
<p><h2>Peaks and troughs</h2></p>
<p><p>American, British and German <b>stockmarkets </b>reached record highs and in Japan two days of trading on the Nikkei brought gains of more than 4%. But America said that July had seen a trade deficit of $11.7 billion, the biggest for five years.
<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>) <br> Mexico's remarkable return to health continued with the launch of a $1 billion global bond issue aimed at redeeming another chunk of existing high-interest <b>Brady bonds</b>. Mexico has raised more than $14 billion this year to pay off more expensive debt.
<p>As Switzerland's recession deepened--its <font size=-1>GDP</font> growth declined for the sixth quarter in a row--the country's third-largest bank, <b>Swiss Bank Corp</b> said that it would make a loss in 1996. It also plans a restructuring that will result in more central control, a loss of about a quarter of its branches and 1,700 jobs over the next three years.
<p>In the wake of "irregularities" discovered at some of its investments funds, <b>Deutsche</b> <b>Morgan Grenfell</b> sacked the funds' manager, Peter Young, for "gross misconduct" .
<p><p><b>Sumitomo Corporation</b> announced that its losses from apparently unauthorised copper trading by Yasuo Hamanaka were $2.6 billion, not the $1.8 billion it estimated in June. It has also decided to prosecute Mr Hamanaka.

<h1><center>Olivetti self-destructs</center></h1>
<p><b>The mayhem and the moral</b></p>


IT IS hard to believe, somehow, that Italy is the country that invented double-entry book-keeping, the basis of company accounts. For there is simply no good accounting word to capture the current state of affairs at Olivetti. On the face of it, Italy's biggest information-technology company--a firm as well-known in Europe as Apple is in America--seems simply to be imploding. At the start of this month it turfed out Carlo De Benedetti, its chairman for 18 years and the man who was once seen as the great white hope of Italian business. This week Francesco Caio, Olivetti's chief executive, resigned too. On September 17th alone the firm's share price fell by 10%, though it made a speculative rebound later in the week as Mr De Benedetti regained some influence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On one view, the turmoil at Olivetti represents a triumph for American-style shareholder activism in Europe. This, after all, is a company that has lost money every year since 1990. Unlike many Italian companies, however, it had increasingly turned to foreign investors in order to raise capital. This enabled its shareholders to insist on its Augean stables being cleansed. It was a meeting in London of foreign fund managers controlling a quarter of the company's equity that triggered the resignation of Mr De Benedetti. No such move would have been likely had Olivetti remained more typically Italian--that is, shielded from hostile scrutiny by a tangle of cross-shareholdings, family stakes and loans from friendly banks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, some will say that if this is a triumph of shareholder activism, who needs it? Certainly not the defenestrated managers. And arguably not the shareholders themselves. At first glance, the immediate result of their ousting of Mr De Benedetti has been self-impoverishment. Investors in the foreign funds that paid 1,000 lire (64 cents) a share for Olivetti's stock in a rights issue last December are unlikely to proclaim victory until the shares, which closed on September 18th at 511.5 lire, are showing a healthy profit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever happens next at Olivetti, the moral that is drawn from the affair matters well beyond the Italian border. A growing number of continental European companies from Italy and elsewhere are queuing up to raise capital in both the London and New York stockmarkets. Some, such as Germany's Daimler Benz cars-to-aerospace giant, have already taken the plunge. But those who have yet to jump may well be deterred by the mayhem in Milan, lest they suffer the same fate as Olivetti.
</p><p><b>The two missing ingredients</b></b>
<br>It would be a pity if they were deterred. Many European firms do indeed have much to gain by making greater use of international equity markets. These can provide cheaper sources of capital than bank lending, together with the extra scrutiny that keeps managers on their toes. But for stockmarkets to work their magic, two conditions are essential. First, investors must be confident that firms are providing them with accurate and timely information. Second, a stockmarket needs to be properly regulated. Neither condition seems to have been met in this particular case.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On September 16th Italian magistrates announced that they were questioning Mr Caio about whether Olivetti had issued misleading financial statements about its affairs. Mr De Benedetti has also been questioned. This does not prove that there is anything the least bit wrong with the company's accounts, and Olivetti has vehemently defended them. But it is this uncertainty--not the departure of Mr De Benedetti--that sparked the wild selling of Olivetti's shares this week. In these circumstances, Consob, Italy's stockmarket regulator, should have formally suspended trading in the company's shares until it became clear that the accounts were correct and consistent. It should not have allowed trading in the firm's shares to continue as panic spread. That is no way to run a stock exchange.

<h1>On the road</h1>


<font size=1>CINCINNATI, HARTFORD AND WILMINGTON</font><p>

IT WAS drizzling in Cincinnati last Monday, so Bill Clinton's campaign event could not take place outdoors, but had to move across the street to the old Music Hall building. This, it so happens, was the site of the 1880 Democratic convention, which nominated Winfield Hancock, a Civil War hero but a lousy campaigner. Hancock went on to lose to the handsome if scandal-tainted James Garfield, who just loved meeting voters. "The World Almanac of Presidential Campaigns" refers to the 1880 election as "one of the most boring and inconsequential of all time." In 1996, a day with each of the major candidates suggests strong similarities, albeit with parties reversed, with 1880.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Clinton campaign oozes energy and seems to do everything right. The stop in Cincinnati was part of a tireless week of campaigning covering places as far afield as North Carolina, Iowa and Arizona. Ohio, with its 21 electoral-college votes, is a key state--no Republican has ever won without carrying Ohio--and was the one most often visited by both sides in 1992. This year is no exception. In Cincinnati, presidential politics is as finely balanced as views on whether the city's famous chili is best "three ways" (without onions) or "five ways" (with beans and onions): Cincinnati's vote went both ways in 1992, with 43% for Mr Clinton and 43% for George Bush.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Mr Clinton was in the right place, and at the right time. On the day his opponent was setting out his policies on crime, the president was standing before rows of police officers to accept the cherished endorsement of the 270,000-member Fraternal Order of Police. It was the first time the <font size=-1>FOP</font> had endorsed a Democrat for national office.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Partly by dint of being president, wherever Mr Clinton goes it is a Big Event. In Cincinnati, the crowds were large, the surrounding security operation was imposing, the vendors of badges and other campaign memorabilia were out in force. There was "Hail to the Chief" to greet Mr Clinton's arrival at the Music Hall, plus an enthusiastic chant orchestrated by the local state representative. "Where's the president?" he asked three times. "Whoop, there he is!", the crowd roared thrice in response.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's the most unusual welcome I've ever had," Mr Clinton told his audience, "but I like it." Indeed, he likes everything about campaigning. He relishes the stump speeches, despite the hoarseness of voice they are causing. More than anything, he loves the adulation he gets when he plunges into a crowd. In the Music Hall, with a glowing, ruddy-faced smile, he lingered among his supporters, reluctant to leave, pausing for photographs, stretching out his hands to people desperate for a touch of the visiting superstar.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The contrast with the Dole campaign could hardly be greater. Bob Dole has been concentrating on Small Events, informal "Listening to America" sessions with sympathetic hand-picked audiences. Quizzical faces stare at the motorcade from the airports to the venues, where there often seem to be more Clinton/Gore demonstrators than Dole/Kemp supporters. Whereas with Mr Clinton you notice the prowess of the campaigning, with Mr Dole you puzzle over the point of it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why, for example, did Mr Dole spend precious time on September 18th "Listening to America" in Hartford, Connecticut, where a poll published that day showed him 26 points behind Mr Clinton? (Mr Dole was "listening" to a few women entrepreneurs, invited by the state Republican Party and outnumbered by the media squeezed into a meeting room on the 22nd floor of the Hartford Group insurance company.) And why did he then proceed to "Listen to America" in Wilmington, Delaware, a bellwether state but one with a grand total of three electoral-college votes? "Dole and Delaware. The Road to Victory Begins Here", proclaimed the banner in the hall of the Catholic girls' school.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The moderator of the Wilmington session was Steve Forbes, winner of the Delaware primary. Judging by the way he took charge of the question-and-answer session, he still rather fancies himself as the Republican candidate. He himself answered the questions from the invited panelists. As the proceedings dragged on, with Mr Dole shuffling in his seat, Mr Forbes began yet another reply by saying, "Bob will be responding later." Mr Dole looked at his watch and mumbled, "Not much later." When, at long last, Mr Forbes introduced Mr Dole, he praised him as "a man of few words".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole gave a 35-minute monologue, without notes. He brandished a nickel--the amount he says would have to be saved out of every dollar of cuttable spending under his economic plan--to illustrate how easy it would be to cut taxes and balance the budget as he proposes. He presented the election as a choice between "trust" (in him) and "fear" (being spread by the Clinton campaign). It was a competent performance, but not one destined to resonate far beyond the Delaware media market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The journalists who follow Mr Dole aboard his "Citizen's Ship" despair of the scarcity of real news generated by his campaign. Just a tiny nugget a day would keep them happy. The candidate, fearful of the off-the-cuff gaffes which caused him problems earlier in the year, now rarely wanders back to the press section of the aircraft. At least one daily newspaper is thinking of taking a break because it is "so dull". The greatest excitement during a Dole day comes from the bumps that invariably seem to happen in mid-air: if there is a bad-weather front lurking somewhere in the country, that is where the "Citizen's Ship" is likely to be.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet a day with the two candidates also leaves a nagging feeling that, despite all the outward appearances, Mr Clinton is not quite as strong as he seems, and Mr Dole not quite as weak. Mr Dole plays a good underdog, emphasising the point that he has been prematurely given up for dead before by showing a letter to his father from the hospital where he lay wounded in December 1945: "At the present time it would appear that his recovery is somewhat questionable," the letter said.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There may be no wild excitement at Dole events, but there is a palpable sense of respect. Boring as it is for reporters, Mr Dole is sticking relentlessly to his message, and the conversation of the campaign is turning to issues--crime, the economy, foreign policy--that work well for him. A few other things have also started to go right. Ross Perot will not be in the televised presidential debates. Some national polls show the race tightening.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ohio, where he is about nine points behind, is still very much in play. In Cincinnati, not all the police officers assembled behind the president were in fact Clinton supporters. Outside the Music Hall, which sits in a run-down part of town, protesters from the local homeless centre predicted that the welfare bill Mr Clinton signed would result in more people living in cardboard boxes in the neighbourhood. Peter Ritchy from the Homeless Hotline of Greater Cincinnati handed out leaflets complaining that Mr Clinton listened to his rich Hollywood backers while ignoring the poor. "The Democrats have gotten complacent that all the poor people are going to vote for them," said Mr Ritchy, who would like to vote for Ralph Nader himself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is still possible that this election could resemble that of 1880 in another respect besides tedium and the character of the candidates. It was one of the closest ever.

<h1>Trends of the week</h1>


<p><b>Faith: </b>Pat Robertson tells his flock at a Christian Coalition conference that, given the gap between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton in the polls: "There has to be a miracle from Almighty God to pull it out. And that could happen."
<p><b>Miracle: </b>The gap halves, to only eight points, says an <font size=-1>ABC</font> poll of likely voters.
<p><b>Lone star: </b>A new poll gives Mr Dole an 11-point lead in Texas. In August, polls showing the candidates neck-and-neck there brought talk of a Democratic landslide.
<p><b>Song: </b>Anything but "Dole Man", an adaptation of the 1967 song "Soul Man", which was the Dole campaign's anthem until a lawsuit by one of the song's owners silenced the fun. Time to turn now to rock 'n' Dole, or beBob?
<p><b>Omen: </b>Miss Kansas wins the Miss America beauty pageant.
<p><b>Book: </b>"Trusting the People", by Bob Dole and Jack Kemp (HarperCollins, $15). Mr Dole's plug for the 164-page <i>chef d'oeuvre</i>: "Doesn't take long to read."
<p><b>Good news: </b>The White House reveals that Mr Clinton tested negative for <font size=-1>HIV</font> in 1990 (in a routine test for an insurance policy). The bad news: Republicans, suspecting the president is hiding something, still press for release of his full medical records.
<p><b>Lollywood:</b> Even before last week's glitzy presidential fund-raiser starring Barbra Streisand, federal election reports show that residents of the 90210 zip code, covering Beverly Hills, had given five times as much money to Mr Clinton as to Mr Dole.
<p><b>Ladbroke's odds:</b> Clinton 1-7 (as last week); Dole 9-2 (last week, 4-1).
<p><b>Word-association: </b>The word voters most commonly associate with Vice-President Al Gore is "intelligent", according to a Pew survey. For Jack Kemp, Republican would-be vice-president, it is "football".
<p><b>Bumper-sticker:</b> Spotted in Louisville, Kentucky: "Cut Waste and Taxes. Re-Elect No One!"
<p><b>Free</b> <b>air: </b>Rupert Murdoch's Fox television network begins broadcasting ten free, one-minute spots by each candidate. The Dole campaign objected, however, that Mr Clinton would have an unfair advantage answering the set questions from the pomp of the Oval Office. Compromise: he sits at his Oval Office desk, but with curtains behind him and not a presidential seal in sight.
<p><b>Hot air: </b>According to a study by the Centre for Media and Public Affairs, candidate soundbites at the party conventions averaged 10.4 seconds in length, led by 15 seconds for loquacious Mr Kemp, 11 for Mr Gore, 10 for Mr Clinton and eight for plain-spoken Bob Dole.
<p><b>Fresh air: </b>A non-partisan commission recommended that the televised presidential debates should feature only Messrs Clinton and Dole. Ross Perot is excluded on the ground that he has no serious chance of winning the election.

<h1>The world in his armpit</h1>


<p>AMERICA adores telegenic leaders, so it is tempting to dismiss a bald guy with glasses. America reveres the treadmill and the weights room, so it is tempting to dismiss someone who looks physically frail. America has made a fetish of the sound-bite, so it is tempting to dismiss a speaker who, in praising a colleague at the recent Christian Coalition conference, could think of nothing better to say than, "What a great future he has, because he is right here and he is right here."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tempting, but disastrous: Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate's foreign relations committee, is not a man to be dismissed. For he brings one quality to international affairs that has proved invaluable. "Jesse hates foreigners," says someone who has spent years working with him; then, feeling the need to be fair, he adds, "except for Israelis, maybe." To this one could add that Mr Helms mistrusts most treaties, and the whole apparatus of international relations. He has likened development aid to throwing money "down foreign ratholes". In the latest issue of <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, he says that the United Nations threatens American interests, and that it should be cut by half or dismantled.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just recently, Mr Helms scored an arresting victory. A 25-year-old Helms staffer who reads <i>Jane's Defence Weekly </i>at bedtime fought a campaign to block America's ratification of the chemical-weapons ban. This was an ambitious venture, for no senator has ever mustered the 34 votes needed to vote down ratification of an arms-control deal before. First Trent Lott, the Republican leader in the Senate, lined up behind the Helms argument. Then Bob Dole put his weight behind it, and the pro-ratification forces had to withdraw the treaty from the Senate lest it be voted down.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It does not take brilliance to win support for an idea that clearly protects American interests. Mr Helms triumphs even without such an advantage: blocking the chemical-weapons treaty may on balance hurt America's interests, rather than the other way round. The treaty probably has enough support in other countries to go ahead anyway; and, if America stays out of it, its chemical companies will remain barred from lucrative export markets. Besides, the treaty will subject some would-be chemical-weapons-makers to inspections, however imperfect. For this reason it deserves America's support.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Helms has won several other anti-victories recently. In the first years of the Clinton administration, there were signs that America's embargo on Cuba might at last be lifted. This was encouraging: exposed to foreign trade and influence, Cuba's nasty dictatorship might well be undermined. Mr Helms, meanwhile, drafted a law entrenching the embargo, and threatening sanctions on third countries that break it. By a fluke, he got Mr Clinton to accept it: in February the Cubans shot down two American civilian aircraft, and the easiest way for the president to respond toughly was to sign the bill. Six months on, Cuba's regime shows no signs of falling. But the third-country clause has scummed up America's relations with its allies, which fail to see why their Cuba policy should be run by Mr Helms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Colombia is another place that Mr Helms has put his stamp on. Last year he backed a law to "decertify" Colombia as punishment for its puny zeal in fighting the drugs war, a move that would deprive it of aid. Up to a point, this was understandable: Colombia's President Samper had been accused of taking drug money for his election campaign. But these accusations were not proven; and, true or not, once in office Mr Samper fought the drug barons mightily. In 1995 his government lost nearly 600 police and security-force men in its drugs war. It also smashed the Cali cocaine mob. America cannot claim to have done as much within its own borders. Never mind: in March Colombia was decertified. Left unaided, the country has since descended even further into mayhem.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What to make of Mr Helms's influence? It reflects poorly on Mr Dole, who as Senate leader could have blocked Mr Helms's ascent to the chair of the foreign relations committee at the start of 1995. Mr Helms's intemperate views were no secret then; indeed, the senator had recently furnished fresh proof of them, by suggesting that the president's life might be endangered if he and his liberal views ventured into North Carolina, Mr Helms's state. Mr Dole might have encouraged Richard Lugar to seek the chairmanship, especially since Mr Lugar had spent as many years on the foreign relations committee as Mr Helms had, and even chaired it in 1985-86. But Mr Dole bowed to the underwhelming fact that Mr Helms had been in the Senate two years longer, explaining: "If you're going to start knocking down seniority, then it's a whole, you know..." . Such is the leadership and courage of the man nominated by Republicans for the highest office in the land.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Helms's successes also say something about America, and about foreign policy in many democracies these days. He has been elected, after all, to four terms in the Senate, and polls suggest that this November he will secure another six years. His criticism of the United Nations, though shot through with half-truths, is no more rabid than the <font size=-1>UN</font>-bashing to be heard last month at the Republican convention. His attack on foreign treaties and entanglements appeals to American voters--just as it would do, for that matter, to German or British voters fearful of European Union. When Mr Helms denounces the transfer of power to international bodies remote from sovereign individuals, he voices a concern heard all over the rich world. He becomes an internationalist, despite himself.

<h1>The flourishing business of slavery</h1>

<p>THE trade in child sex has topped the indignation charts in the West this year. But much of it is only the nastiest aspect of a wider evil: slavery. Every country in the world has outlawed this practice, in theory. In fact, millions of people, women and children especially, are still used as slaves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Child slavery has increased since the 1970s--in part, ironically, because that was when the shah of Iran banned the use of child labour in carpet factories. Many manufacturers promptly moved to Pakistan, Nepal and India, which had fewer qualms. Not only could they hire child labour dirt cheap, they found they could do even better by tapping into traditional systems of "debt bondage".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bonded workers agree to sell their labour in exchange for a lump sum, perhaps to pay a big medical bill. Such deals are common in countries where the poor's only equity is their sweat. But the line is easily crossed into slavery, when low wages, high interest rates and cheating make the debt impossible to repay. South Asia, where many people are illiterate, ignorant of their rights, and thus easily diddled, is the home of this system. The India-based Bonded Labour Liberation Front reckons that, from a small start in the late 1970s, there are now half a million South Asian children thus bonded (sometimes literally, by chains) to their carpet-weaving looms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Nepal and Pakistan, millions of bonded labourers work in farming. Here the relationship to slavery is clearest. Bonded debts can be passed on to the next generation. Those who are deemed not to have paid their debt can be sold to another landlord. If a man escapes his place of employment, his family can be held until he comes back, or sold if he does not. Bonded peasants can be sold into marriage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bondage-cum-slavery is also common in the brick kilns and mines of South Asia, in some remote areas of Peru and Brazil (with forced prostitution to match), in the servants' quarters and camel racegrounds of the Gulf (Bangladeshi child riders are a speciality), and in the brothels of South-East Asia. In the worst cases, workers are kidnapped, forced to work, assigned a debt, and prevented from escaping by armed guards with shoot-to-kill orders. A Brazilian researcher has estimated there are 60,000 slaves in his country, mostly in the vast Amazon region.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The emergence of <font size=-1>AIDS</font> has played a large role in entrapping more and more women and children in sexual slavery. Brothel customers, aware of the risks of infection, want young girls from the countryside, who are presumed less likely to have <font size=-1>HIV</font>. And they want brisk turnover. Both desires have led to an increase in the trafficking of Burmese girls and women into Thailand, and of Nepali girls into India; the Nepalis are also highly prized for their fair skin and delicate features.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thai human-rights organisations reckon there are 20,000 Burmese prostitutes in Thailand at any one time. Some have been kidnapped and literally sold into sexual slavery; a few have left home knowing they will be working as prostitutes. Most are brought under false pretences. The women are routinely forbidden to communicate with their families or even leave the premises.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nepali prostitutes in India--there are roughly 20,000 in Mumbai (Bombay) alone--have it even worse. The typical pattern is to kidnap or coax a girl away from home with the promise of well-paid work or marriage--some traffickers even go through a marriage ceremony--acculturate her to her work through rape and the lowest kind of prostitution, then sell her on to another brothel or abandon her when she is too old or becomes <font size=-1>HIV</font>-infected. Border police put the average age of trafficked girls at 13, but do little to stop the trade.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Slavery in Sudan is also a young and female phenomenon: when armed raiders from the Arab north swoop down on blacks in the south, they take mostly women and children back with them. Girls become concubines, older women become house-servants and younger children tend animals. Some are sold, perhaps even exported: the American embassy in Khartoum has acknowledged as "credible" reports that Dinka and Nuba children from southern Sudan are being sold on into Libya. The men are either killed or left behind to get together a ransom to reclaim their women and children--if they can find them. According to the London-based Christian Solidarity International, which has ransomed 20 Sudanese slaves, the going rate for a woman is five cows.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Sudanese government flatly denies that slavery exists there. It is lying: the evidence from human-rights organisations, exiles, traders and former slaves is overwhelming. Louis Farrakhan, the black leader of America's Nation of Islam, and occasional guest of the Libyan and Sudanese governments, has rebuffed assertions of slavery in Sudan as Zionist claptrap. Last March, he challenged journalists to go to Sudan and find it. Two reporters from the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> did just that and published their findings in June, sparking off a lively debate among black Americans about how they--and black Muslims in particular--should respond to the plight of enslaved black Africans.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Slavery is as rooted as ever in Mauritania, whose government also denies that it exists. As the government notes, the country has officially abolished slavery three times, most recently in 1980. Yet perhaps 90,000 blacks live as full-time slaves to their Arab masters. Several times that number are only semi-free. Most live in remote rural areas in the east. They have no right to property or marriage; parents have no rights over their children.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although these are the chief redoubts of modern slavery, the rest of the world is not immune. "Released" prisoners who are forced to continue working in Chinese labour camps could plausibly be called slaves. So could the several dozen Thai workers who were found locked into their clothing factory in Los Angeles last year. There are reports of women from South Korea, Taiwan and the United States being tricked into forced prostitution in Japan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where slavery is systemic and involves the actual buying and selling of human beings, it exists in part because governments are not trying very hard to stop it. Brazil has spoken out strongly against the use of forced labour, but the Amazon region is huge and few policemen and labour inspectors have been assigned to root out abuses. Thailand, Myanmar, India, Pakistan and Nepal all have impressive-sounding laws against slavery, kidnapping and child prostitution, but do little to enforce them. Too often, the police are buddies with the local oligarchs, or esteemed clients at the brothels that they ought to be busting.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rich world has little leverage to exert against slavery, though there are sporadic efforts. One such comes from Rugmark, an organisation that gives a seal of approval to carpets made without child labour. Another is an agreement by two western sporting-goods makers in Pakistan to send their child workers to school. But such responses can go only so far: most bonded labourers and outright slaves work for industries serving the home market that are immune to outside pressure. And the bosses, who live well off their cheap labour, are much closer to the powers that be than are their wretched workers. Until the penalties for slavery begin to outweigh its rewards, it will not disappear.

<h1>Master and slave in Mauritania</h1>

<font size=1>NOUAKCHOTT</font>
<p>SHE said she was a slave. Mohamed Ould Moissa said Aichana Mint Abeid Boilil was his wife.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Aichana took Mohamed to court to recover her five children. He claimed to be their father and wanted custody. She said she had never had sex with him, let alone been married to him; she called his claim a pretext to keep her children as slaves. The court sided with her, and the family was reunited, except for one daughter, "given" by Mohamed to one of his relations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Slavery was outlawed in Mauritania (see <a href="ir1.gif">map</a>) in 1980, but that did not eradicate the centuries-old practice. In the past, Moorish camel caravans used to sweep down on villages in the south, carrying off everyone the men could lay hands on. The enslaved had to tend their masters' herds, perform domestic chores and work the family's land. Disobedience or any attempt to escape was brutally punished. The women were the sex slaves of their owner, and their offspring generally grew up to be his slaves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Freed slaves or the descendants of slaves are known as <i>haratin</i>; they make up about 40% of Mauritania's 2m people. Some argue that many are still in bondage. "Nothing has been done to alter the situation that forced the government to ban slavery 16 years ago," says Boubacar Ould Messoud, president of <font size=-1>SOS</font> Esclave, an organisation set up to help slaves. "There are still slaves sweating to feed their masters." Certainly there are many thousands of people who work without being paid in cash.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Slavery is reinforced by race. Traditionally the lighter-skinned Bidan from the north enslaved the "black African" farmers from the south. But skin colour is no exact guide to status. Some Bidan are dark-skinned, and some black groups, especially the Sonink&eacute; and Hal-Pulaar (Fulani), also practise slavery, though less conspicuously.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Eight years after slavery was supposedly abolished, Fatma Mint Souleymane ran away from her master's constant beatings. Only when she reached Nouakchott did she learn that she did not belong to somebody else. "I was always working. I had no way of hearing the radio or time to chat with other slaves. How could I hear about the new law?" she asks. Others have heard about abolition, but know no other life than slavery. They accept their condition as "God's will" or simply do not believe they could be free.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pointing out that most political and economic power is in the hands of the "masters", the Bidan, Boubacar Ould Messoud accuses the government of not really trying to eliminate slavery, but merely making noises, to appease western aid donors. He calls for a nationwide awareness campaign to inform everyone that they are free and to change attitudes among both "slaves" and "masters". It must be couched in religious terms, he says, breaking the centuries-old indoctrination of slaves, who were told they would go to heaven if they were obedient, and to hell if not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government prefers to look the other way. "Slavery has been banned, so I can say that, legally, it no longer exists," avows Mohamed Lamine Ould Ahmed, minister for energy and one of few <i>haratin</i> to have got that high. "There are people who've stayed with their former masters. Having been freed, they've chosen to stay in the environment where they grew up, with people of the same tribe--their friends and relations."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may be partly true. What ex-slaves have gained in freedom, they may have lost in security. Traditionally, they were considered part of the family. Although abuses occurred, owners were responsible for their welfare and provided food, clothes, protection and medical care. Can freedom deliver these? Former slaves are more likely to end up, homeless and jobless, in the slums among the sand dunes around Nouakchott.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the Bidan too are suffering these days. The severe droughts of the 1970s and 1980s ravaged their herds, and many fled with their slaves to Nouakchott. Once in town the slaves, released because their masters could not afford to keep them, and used to manual labour, often did better than their ex-masters, who knew little more than how to ride camels. Often one hears of an impoverished "master" claiming the legacy of his deceased slave--a wooden shack or tent, and maybe a few scrawny animals. Some still accept the argument that if a man owned the slave, he owned the slave's property too.

<p><b>Iraq and America</b></p>
<h1>Saner voices</h1>

<p>AFTER two weeks of belligerence, peace of a sort descended on the Gulf. On September 13th Iraq dropped its earlier defiance, announcing that it was "suspending" missile attacks on American, British and French aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones, from which Iraqi aircraft are barred. Nor, it said later, would it rebuild its missile-smashed air defences in the south. Reports from Washington suggested this would not be enough: the United States also wanted Iraq to dismantle all its air defences. But by this time William Perry, President Clinton's defence secretary, touring the Gulf states, had had a full blast of the coolness with which his country's allies regarded the prospect of further strikes. The American build-up went swiftly on, but fire-eating evaporated into an unthreatening rumble. America, insisted Mr Clinton, was not seeking a confrontation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A week ago Mr Perry was promising a "disproportionate" response to Iraq's unsuccessful missile attacks. Then Saudi Arabia, the weightiest American ally in the region but under threat from internal dissent, made it politely plain that it did not agree. The claim that the American attacks on southern Iraq were for the protection of the Gulf's oil producers did not sway Prince Sultan, the Saudi defence minister: "I've not heard a threat from Iraq to Kuwait," he was reported as replying.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Understandably, Kuwait itself has been the United States' most enthusiastic supporter, allowing its territory to be used as a potential launch-pad for Stealth bombers. But, even there, the Americans took too much for granted, announcing that up to 5,000 ground troops were on their way to the sheikhdom, without getting Kuwaiti agreement. It came in the end, but the Kuwaitis gave Mr Perry a hard time before accepting that the troops--probably 3,500, from Texas--could indeed come.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Off flew Mr Perry to London, to meet his British and French counterparts. The British were publicly supportive, but privately relieved that the threat of battle had receded. Charles Millon, France's defence minister, chose to distance his country from American tactics: as soon as he got back to Paris, he issued a public warning against any escalation. To rub it in, on September 18th, after talks with President Jacques Chirac, the Saudi foreign minister declared that the two countries wanted to see "reason prevail, calm restored and the integrity of Iraq respected."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Calm, indeed, seemed to be restored--for the time being. But the Kurdish manoeuvres, which started the whole affair, are not necessarily evolving in a way to please Saddam Hussein. Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, having with Iraq's physical (and psychological) help defeated his rival, Jalal Talabani, is now intent on showing that he is not Mr Hussein's poodle. The time is not ripe, he says, for a new arrangement with Baghdad over some form of federation. And though Iraqi trade is welcomed over the now open border, Iraqis themselves are not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wisely hedging his bets, Mr Barzani wants to resume the good relations he once had with the Americans. They are no less anxious to detach him from Mr Hussein. Hence the meeting at midweek in Turkey between Mr Barzani and Robert Pelletreau, the State Department's Middle East man.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Americans, ostensibly, are continuing their efforts to mediate between the two Kurdish rivals. In practice, the whole status of northern Iraq has to be decided. Is it still to be deemed a "protected" zone? Are the American-led allies to go on providing their aerial umbrella? Can the aid effort be resumed, now that 2,000 Kurds, working in one capacity or another for the Americans, have been whisked off to Guam, in the Pacific, for safety and debriefing? In searching for answers, the Americans have first to explore Mr Barzani's intentions.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<p><b>Rail privatisation</b></p>
<h1>Trainspotting</h1>


<p>DESPITE opposition predictions that it would be "a poll tax on wheels", Britain's newly privatised rail network seems about to deliver significant improvements for its passengers. Roger Salmon, the rail franchising director, will invite bids next month for a new high-speed route to be operated by 160mph Italian-designed tilting trains on the west-coast main line. The journey time from London to Manchester will be cut by 25%, to less than two hours. A bullish message of increased investment and improving performance will also be given by Bob Horton, the chairman of Railtrack, at the newly privatised company's first annual meeting on September 25th.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True, little on the railways has changed just yet. Decades of under-investment have bequeathed a legacy of too much bumpy track and antiquated rolling stock. Punctuality and reliability remain as patchy as ever. Finding out when trains run and reserving seats is still often absurdly difficult. Media comment is invariably bilious. Passenger complaints are at record levels, rising by 14.5% in the year to the end of March, the 13th consecutive year in which complaints have increased (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). The sour public mood is unlikely to be sweetened by a series of one-day strikes called by the <font size=-1>RMT</font> transport union beginning on September 20th and 23rd, which threatens to cause widespread disruption across the country.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, those who said that splitting the nationalised British Rail (<font size=-1>BR</font>) into 60 separate private companies would prove a political disaster have fallen silent. Labour is busy backtracking on its commitment to restore "a publicly owned, publicly accountable railway". It is easy to see why. The announcement on September 17th that two more passenger services in the west of England have been successfully franchised means that more than half the network is now operated by private firms. Contrary to many forecasts (including by <i>The Economist</i>), competition for the passenger franchises has been so intense that subsidies required to maintain the privatised services are significantly less than they were under <font size=-1>BR</font>. Sir George Young, the transport secretary, claims that annual government grants to support the first seven franchises will, by 2003, be a third of the amount needed by <font size=-1>BR</font> to run them in its last year of operation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the private train operators have been in business for only a few months, their determination to improve service and attract more passengers is already beginning to show results. Later this month, Great Western, which operates services throughout the West Country, will unveil the first of its newly liveried and refurbished trains. The company has already reduced journey times on its long-distance routes by up to 20 minutes and is planning to introduce new motorail services. Great Western's passenger traffic is up by nearly 7% since privatisation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other operators are also trying to lure passengers back to the railways with better service. Chiltern Railways, a firm run by former <font size=-1>BR</font> managers, announced earlier this month that it had ordered 12 diesel-powered 100mph express trains to reduce its journey times between London and Birmingham by a third, in order to compete with InterCity services. Sea Containers, a freight company which took over the east-coast main line six months ago, is also planning to order two Italian or Swedish high-speed tilting trains to reduce the journey time between Edinburgh and London from 4.75 to 3.75 hours.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Train companies operating less glamorous routes are also keen to boast of their improvements. Prism Rail, which operates the so-called "misery commuter line" from Fenchurch Street in London to Tilbury and Southend, is spending &#163;14m on modernising stations. The company, run by former bus executives, has promised to replace two-thirds of its existing 40-year-old rolling stock with new trains by 1999.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until the new investment in track, stations and rolling stock comes onstream, passengers will understandably be sceptical about privatisation. So far improvements have been largely cosmetic. Midland Main Line, which operates services between London and Sheffield, offers all passengers free tea and coffee, for example. Great Western has introduced a business carriage where complimentary newspapers can supposedly be read in peace: mobile phones and tape players are discouraged. South West Trains, operated by Stagecoach, an aggressive bus company, maintains a spare train at Waterloo for peak-time emergencies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A lively price war is a more potent sign of the benefits of the new regime. Chiltern is promoting a &#163;20 day-return fare between London and Birmingham. This undercuts the peak fare on InterCity West Coast's line (which is 40 minutes faster) by &#163;35. Ferocious competition marked by knocking copy is also taking place over the London to Gatwick services operated by Gatwick Express and Network South Central. Both the west-coast and east-coast InterCity companies are fighting a price war with EasyJet, a budget airline, which offers a &#163;29 single fare on the London-Glasgow and London-Edinburgh routes. The rail companies responded with an identical fare and complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that EasyJet failed to tell passengers about the &#163;5 in airport tax.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The train operating companies have been slower to respond to long-standing complaints about the inadequacy of train-inquiry bureaus. A national system with a single phone number is under development, but industry sources acknowledge that the speed, quality and accuracy of information provided is still "a very thorny problem". The performance regime under which Railtrack and the train operators are penalised for late-running also causes problems for delayed passengers catching connecting trains. Companies are less and less willing to hold trains, for fear of financial penalties.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such transitional problems should soon be resolved. Better management aside, the fact that the new privatised railway has been given guaranteed levels of subsidy, a stable fare structure and the freedom to invest long term unhindered by the vagaries of the government's annual expenditure round should deliver better services eventually. Unfortunately for the Tories, they may not be in power to get the credit. Politics is so unfair.

<p><b>Universities</b></p>
<h1>Pay as you earn</h1>

<p>THE era in which the taxpayer footed most of the bill for sending a large proportion of Britain's 18-year-olds away to university, which began in the mid-1960s following the Robbins Report, may be drawing to a close. On September 19th the vice-chancellors of Britain's 115 universities proposed a scheme in which graduates would have to repay about a third of the cost of degree courses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Opponents of such a scheme say that it would deter students from poorer families--undermining the Robbins principle that university education should be open to anyone who would benefit from it. And none of the main political parties is keen to alarm middle-income voters with the prospect of hefty tuition bills for their children. Nevertheless, the imposition of university fees over the next few years now seems likelier than ever.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The universities have become exasperated with the government's relentless cuts in the funding it provides for each student. They have reached the conclusion that there is no chance of getting more money from whichever party forms the next government, so the students will have to pay. The universities will submit their proposals to Sir Ron Dearing's inquiry into the future of higher education, which will report after the next election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour and the Liberal Democrats accept the need to make students borrow to cover their living expenses, but say they should not pay tuition fees. Gillian Shephard, the education and employment secretary, appeared to adopt a similar line on September 18th, saying she expected the government to continue paying all tuition costs. However, whatever the parties' education spokesmen say now, if the Dearing inquiry calls for students to contribute to tuition costs the proposal is likely to get strong backing from the Treasury. The choice will then probably be between fees and no further expansion--or even a contraction--in university education.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The scheme the vice-chancellors propose is based on one that has been in operation in Australia since 1989. In the British version, for each year of study, students would borrow &#163;2,400 (at today's prices) to pay a fixed fee, plus &#163;4,475 for their living expenses. Once they have graduated, they would pay a surcharge of 3% of gross salary on their national insurance contributions until the debt is cleared. Now, full-time students aged under 21 make no contribution to tuition costs, and typically get a grant of &#163;1,586 a year and a loan of about &#163;1,600.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The prospect of accumulating up to &#163;20,000 in debt (plus interest at around the prevailing bank base rate) during a three-year course may indeed sound daunting to many potential students. But it would be fairer to taxpayers--and not as daunting for students as many critics assume. Once they graduate, students would pay only in proportion to what they earn, and over a term as long as would be required to clear the debt. Those on low incomes would be exempted from repayments. There would be no prospect of bailiffs knocking at the door. And, of course, getting a degree greatly increases the chances of landing a well-paid job, so even after paying the 3% levy most graduates should still be better off.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While the vice-chancellors' scheme is sensible, many academics fear that the government will use graduates' contributions as an excuse to make further cuts in its grants to universities. They point to Australia's new conservative government, which is both cutting universities' grants and increasing graduates' repayments. That is a possibility here. But surely the alternative--universities bursting at the seams, aspiring students turned away, and the quality of higher education declining because taxpayers simply do not want to pay any more--is worse.

<h1>Profit taking</h1>

<p>WITH only two months to go until the budget, anyone lucky enough to benefit from a tax break is starting to get nervous. Easily the most worried this year should be anyone who receives government-approved profit-related pay (<font size=-1>PRP</font>). The Treasury has spotted that the tax perk granted to <font size=-1>PRP</font> schemes is costing it a fortune (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>), and that an increasing number of such schemes are nothing more than tax-avoidance ploys. Thus, <font size=-1>PRP</font> is ripe for deperking.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Profit-related pay was given favourable tax treatment in the 1987 budget as a temporary measure intended to encourage firms to tie their employees' salaries more closely to company profits. This was supposed to help wages to fall during bad times and to encourage more entrepreneurialism among ordinary workers. High hopes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At first, the number of <font size=-1>PRP</font> schemes grew at a snail's pace: by 1991-92, they cost the exchequer only &#163;40m. But then firms, egged on by their accountants, found clever ways of using <font size=-1>PRP</font> without linking employees' pay any more closely to changes in their employer's profits. (Employees rarely want pay that is genuinely linked to their firm's profits--which is less certain than basic pay--unless it is on top of what they already get.) The cost of tax-rebates soared, to an estimated &#163;1.5 billion this financial year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>PRP</font> ploy appealed to firms because it enabled them either to increase their workers' after-tax pay without actually paying them any extra or to cut their own wage bill without cutting the after-tax pay of their employees. Thanks to such wheezes, says Chris Giles, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group, people as unfamiliar with profits as charity workers and university lecturers are now able to receive <font size=-1>PRP</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The case for scrapping the tax-break on <font size=-1>PRP</font> is overwhelming: even when it is not a scam, why should other workers subsidise it? But it may yet survive. Some 3m people get <font size=-1>PRP</font>; to a top-rate taxpayer on maximum <font size=-1>PRP</font>, the tax-break is worth &#163;1,600 a year. How many votes are there for the Tories in grabbing that?

<p><b>Voting reform</b></p>
<h1>Grim for Tories</h1>

<p>TONY BLAIR is against introducing full proportional representation in Britain. But the Labour leader is privately more sympathetic to a half-way sort of electoral reform, the alternative vote (<font size=-1>AV</font>), which takes account of voters' second preferences. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, although traditionally in favour of full <font size=-1>PR</font>, are now deliberately vague about other options for change. A resolution to be debated on September 24th at their annual conference in Brighton calls only for a "fair system of voting". Only the Tories adamantly resist even <font size=-1>AV</font>--unsurprisingly, since a new study of <font size=-1>AV</font> for <i>The Economist</i> suggests that it would probably mean many more Labour and Liberal Democrat <font size=-1>MP</font>s and far fewer Tories (see <a href="br3.gif">table</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The study, carried out by John Curtice, a psephologist, for the Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends (<font size=-1>CREST</font>), makes use of newly available data from the 1996 edition of <font size=-1>CREST</font>'s British Election Panel Study, which regularly interviews the same group of voters. The study shows that 51% of Liberal Democrat voters now prefer Labour as their second choice compared with only 29% who prefer the Tories. Similarly, Labour voters prefer the Lib Dems to the Tories by about eight to one, up from four to one at the time of the last election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the alternative vote, the candidate who comes bottom of the poll is eliminated and his vote redistributed among the other candidates according to the second preferences of his supporters until one candidate obtains 51% of the vote. As far more Lib Dems currently say they prefer Labour to the Tories, in the many seats where the Lib Dems are in third place their votes would switch to Labour under <font size=-1>AV</font>, knocking out the Tory candidate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The results are dramatic. Look at the second section of the table, which shows the results of a hypothetical election in which Labour and the Tories are level pegging with 39% of the vote each. Under the present system, Labour would still win more seats than the Tories, partly because of tactical voting. But under <font size=-1>AV</font>, Labour would win 105 more seats than the Tories, giving it a comfortable overall majority. If Labour wins the election by as much as recent polls suggest, it would get 451 seats, compared with 426 under the present electoral system (third section of table).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour is not the only gainer. True, the Lib Dems would still get less seats under <font size=-1>AV</font> than they would under proportional representation. However, they would get nearly twice as many seats as under the current system of "first past the post" in an election where the two big parties were neck and neck, and nearly three times as many in a Labour landslide.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conservatives could argue that this shows that <font size=-1>AV</font> is unfair to them. Those who complain about the existing voting system say that it unjustly gave the Tories an overall Commons majority at four successive general elections, even though they fell well short of half the vote in each of them. <font size=-1>AV</font>, our study suggests, could have the same effect, although this time benefiting Labour, not the Tories.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In practice, however, <font size=-1>AV</font> would probably not be as hard on the Tories as our crude numbers suggest. Most Lib Dems in the study have Labour as their second choice because of the Tories' current unpopularity. But this will not always be so. Indeed, at the time of the 1992 general election, the same <font size=-1>CREST</font> panel showed that Lib Dems were more likely to say that the Tories were their second choice than Labour. As the gap between Labour and the Tories narrows nearer the election, as it surely will, the gap in Lib Dem second preferences is also likely to narrow. If Lib Dem second preferences returned to what they were in 1992, then Labour would still be the biggest party in a level-pegging election, but would fall short of an overall majority. <font size=-1>AV</font> may seem an attractive half-way house for Labour, but it could still give the Lib Dems the balance of power in a hung Parliament.

<h1>Asia's costly labour problems</h1>

<font size=1>HONG KONG</font>
<p>"THE situation in the country has changed," Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, said last month. With the country short of manpower, he argued, firms should stop relying on cheap labour and shift to capital-intensive and high-tech industries. Dr Mahathir's prescription could apply to much of Asia, where labour difficulties are rapidly eroding the region's cost advantage over western countries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A study published on September 18th by Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy (<font size=-1>PERC</font>), a Hong Kong-based firm of consultants, weighs up the various factors that make a country's workforce attractive to foreign investors--including not just the cost of labour, but its quality, availability and stability. <font size=-1>PERC</font> asked 223 expatriate managers based in Asia to rank labour attributes on a scale from zero to ten (with ten representing the worst score). The managers also scored workers in a selection of western countries. When the grades for both skilled and unskilled workers were averaged out, only India and the Philippines got good marks (see <a href="wb1.gif">table</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problems raised by the managers vary from country to country. Staff in Hong Kong and Singapore, for instance, were highly rated for quality, but were expensive and likely to hop from job to job almost as quickly as the low-cost, but poorly skilled, Vietnamese. Although India may provide the cheapest and most available labour, only the Philippines scored reasonably well in all categories.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet even in the Philippines, which is attracting plenty of interest from foreign investors now that its economy finally seems back on track, problems crop up. For example, small foreign firms encounter particular difficulties, since Filipinos appear to respond best when employed by big multinationals with a strong corporate culture.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>PERC</font> study is another jot of evidence in what seems to be a disturbing trend. Despite Asia's potentially enormous workforce, most companies in the region complain about the difficulties of finding, training and keeping employees. With economic development racing ahead of local skills, workers often have to be imported to fill the gaps--even for unskilled jobs. Hence labourers from Myanmar work on Thai building sites; Filipinos assemble computers in Taiwan, and East European technicians beaver away in Singapore.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Malaysians were shocked earlier this year when 3,600 workers were laid off in Penang, the country's leading enterprise zone and home to 130 electronics firms. Those who cut back included Quantum of Japan, which transferred the manufacture of hard-disk drives to Japan, and America's Hewlett-Packard. Grundig, a subsidiary of Philips, a Dutch consumer-electronics giant, shut its factory completely. Although a slump in electronics was partly to blame for the retrenchment, companies in Penang face a severe shortage of skilled workers, as well as wage increases that have outstripped productivity gains.

<h1>Of MiGs and microchips</h1><p><b>Is Larry Ellison's vision of the future of the computer industry really that different from Bill Gates's?</b><p>MICROSOFT'S job is to get Windows everywhere," said Larry Ellison on September 16th. "It's our job to stop them." The founder of Oracle, the world's second-largest software company, is taking pot-shots at the largest one, and loving every minute of it (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart</a>). To a thumping rock soundtrack, he has just mounted the stage of a computer conference in Paris, to take part in a much-hyped "battle of titans" between himself (worth a mere $5 billion) and Bill Gates ($18 billion) over whether the future of their industry will belong to the <font size=-1>PC</font> or to Mr Ellison's cheap and cheerful network computer, or <font size=-1>NC</font>, which should soon reach the shops.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a striking contrast of styles. Mr Gates is coyly self-effacing in his Paris speech ("We're just plumbers," he claims). Mr Ellison is bitingly sarcastic ("More like the only plumber"). Mr Gates stays behind the podium and talks about directories and file formats. Mr Ellison stalks around the stage in his trademark tailored double-breasted suit and shows a picture of the MiG-<font size=-1>29</font> he is buying himself as a new toy. Mr Gates gives warning against industry "bologna" and hype. Mr Ellison talks grandly about the converging of television and information.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A network computer gets its information from the Internet and stores it there, instead of using its own memory and disk drives. This, says Mr Ellison, will change the world, not just the computer industry. Since they are easier to use (turn them on and they are connected) and will cost a few hundred dollars at most, the <font size=-1>NC</font>, unlike the <font size=-1>PC</font>, will spread beyond the rich and the corporate user.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This argument has struck a chord with many, making this a heady time for Mr Ellison. Two years ago, practically nobody outside the computer industry had heard of him or could say what Oracle did (it makes fairly arcane database software). Now Mr Ellison is stopped on the street by people who have seen him on <font size=-1>TV</font>, and is invited into the presidential limo to explain the <font size=-1>NC</font> to Bill Clinton. Better still, the unruly children of the computing world, always looking for a new prophet, now think that Mr Ellison and the <font size=-1>NC</font> might lead them out of the valley that has for the past 15 years been ruled by Mr Gates, the pharaoh of the <font size=-1>PC</font>. (The previous would-be Moses, Marc Andreessen of Netscape, was last seen being chased by Mr Gates's chariots.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But how real is the difference between Mr Gates and Mr Ellison? In terms of personality it could not be much larger. Despite recently becoming both a husband and a father, Mr Gates remains intently focused on technology and his business. He never talks of his private life in public, and starting a family has made no apparent difference to his famously long work hours. Even his $30m house is portrayed more as a showroom for Microsoft technology than a home.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Ellison, by contrast, works out, sails his boats, flies his planes, dates a lot, and meditates in the replica of a Japanese monastery he built near his company's California headquarters. "I don't dedicate my life to Oracle," he says. Ask him why, and something very unGateslike happens. He talks for nearly an hour about his feelings. He describes the need of a lower-middle-class kid growing up in Chicago to prove himself (his sister now complains that their early family life gets poorer with each telling) and muses about his reasons for pushing <font size=-1>NC</font>s ("Am I doing this for the greed of self-esteem or for the benefit of mankind? I don't know"). As for the MiG-<font size=-1>29</font>, it could fill several psychoanalysts' notebooks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Put in these terms, all the waffle about clashing titans seems justified. Yet it ignores two things. First, as Mr Ellison admits, his conversion to the <font size=-1>NC</font> was a little accidental. In 1993, Oracle looked at the idea of building databases to deliver digital movies, and worked with Apple to develop simple set-top boxes to display them. Two years later, when the Internet thundered past the stumbling interactive <font size=-1>TV</font> trials, Mr Ellison got his idea of retailoring them as <font size=-1>NC</font>s, still fed by Oracle databases. He first blurted out his "vision" at a meeting with Mr Clinton and a number of software executives, then floated it at the Paris conference last year. The press latched on to the idea and Oracle raced to come up with prototypes to match the rhetoric.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second hitch is that over the past year, the differences between his vision and Mr Gates's have blurred. The Microsoft boss also talks of simple, cheap devices that draw many of their programs from the network to which they are connected (indeed, the firm introduced its operating system for such machines, Windows <font size=-1>CE</font>, this week). Both think that the new devices will get many of their parts from the <font size=-1>PC</font>, which benefits from great economies of scale. Whether to call the boxes <font size=-1>PC</font>s or not is really a matter of semantics. The disagreement is really over how much of the market will go to each type of machine. Mr Gates, who has made his billions on the premise that people always want more power on their desktop, not less, thinks that some variant of the traditional <font size=-1>PC</font> will dominate. Mr Ellison thinks that most people will prefer <font size=-1>NC</font>s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given the fact that the technical gap between their two visions is so small, the struggle for leadership in the software industry may become a matter of personal will. Here, Mr Ellison does not have as much to lose or gain as Mr Gates: whether it is a <font size=-1>PC</font> age or an <font size=-1>NC</font> one, Oracle's databases will feed any networked device. But if Mr Gates yields the <font size=-1>PC</font>, then he loses the core of his business. That may explain why he seems to care so much more about the outcome than Mr Ellison. And so far in this industry, obsession has proved more rewarding than reflection.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<h1>The judgment of Salomon</h1>

<font size=1>NEW YORK</font>
<p><b>Warren Buffett and Salomon Brothers, Wall Street's oddest couple, may be heading for divorce. Why?</b></p>

<p>EVEN Warren Buffett, the Nebraskan billionaire who has won worldwide fame for his long-term investment acumen, is not infallible. In an occasional column, dubbed "Mistake du jour", that he pens for the annual reports of Berkshire Hathaway, an investment company that he controls, he has admirably owned up to a few bungles over the years, most notably a disastrous $358m investment in <font size=-1>US</font>Air, an American airline.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But for the ultimate Buffett blunder, nothing quite compares with his appalling nine-year investment of over $1 billion in Salomon Inc, which owns Salomon Brothers, an American investment bank. He has bought shares when Salomon's stock was expensive; he has declined them when they were cheap. His attempts to influence the firm's strategy have occasionally backfired spectacularly. Now Mr Buffett has announced new plans for his troublesome investment. Will he fare better this time?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rest of Wall Street will be watching closely, not least because Salomon Brothers is often cited as one of the few big Wall Street securities houses that may be snapped up when America eventually abandons rules that prevent commercial banks from owning large investment banks. Many will also be curious to see whether Mr Buffett and Deryck Maughan, Salomon Brothers' chief executive, can make any further progress in their crusade to turn one of America's most aggressive trading powerhouses into a far more shareholder-friendly beast.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Berkshire Hathaway owns two types of Salomon shares. It has 6.6m of the firm's ordinary stock (about 6.3% of the total, making Berkshire Salomon's biggest shareholder). And it still owns 560,000 of the 700,000 preferred shares it bought for $1,000 apiece in 1987. These pay a fixed 9% dividend each year. They can be converted into Salomon's common shares, at $38 per share, or redeemed for cash when they expire. The preference stock must be converted or redeemed in five tranches, the first in 1995 and the last in 1999.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year Berkshire decided to convert 140,000 preferred shares into cash, a decision that was interpreted as a warning from Mr Buffett to Salomon's managers to get their house in order. On September 12th, however, Berkshire announced that it intended to convert a second tranche of 140,000 into common shares when they expire next month. If it does so, it will increase its stake in Salomon to 10.3m common shares, or 9.8% of its equity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may come as some surprise to seasoned Buffett-watchers, for Salomon has been a worrisome investment for Berkshire Hathaway. Mr Buffett bought his common shares at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994. Salomon had made record net profits of $827m in 1993 and its share price that December was close to $50. But in 1994 Salomon lost a net $399m as bond markets collapsed. By the end of that year, its shares had fallen by 25%, to $37.5 (wiping $76m from the value of Berkshire's investment) (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last October, when Mr Buffett declined to convert his first tranche of preference stock into common shares, Salomon's share price was $40. He had decided, he said, that "there is something else I would rather have Berkshire do with the money." Ironically, Salomon has since been on a roll. It made a net $168m in the fourth quarter of 1995, and $567m in the first half of this year, the most profitable six months in the firm's history. Since last October its shares have climbed by 15%, to $46.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Buffett's financial misjudgments have not been the only embarrassments he has suffered as a result of his investment. John Gutfreund, Salomon Brothers' former chairman, was a trusted friend of Mr Buffett's. "John Gutfreund runs an extremely good operation at Salomon," Mr Buffett told his shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway's annual jamboree in April 1991. But four months later Mr Gutfreund resigned amid allegations that Salomon had been rigging America's Treasury-bond auctions. (The firm later admitted breaking the rules and settled civil charges against it.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This episode convinced Mr Buffett that the firm's culture needed to change. But at least one of the reforms that he inspired had disastrous consequences. In 1994, Mr Maughan overhauled the way that Salomon paid its star traders, tying their salaries much more closely to the group's overall performance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over the following months, about a tenth of Salomon's managing directors resigned as their salaries plunged. One who left was Dennis Keegan, head of the bank's bond-arbitrage group (which bets the firm's own capital). His outfit made $1.4 billion in pre-tax profits for the bank in 1992 and $416m in 1993. Faced with this exodus, Mr Maughan abandoned Mr Buffett's compensation scheme last year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why so many bungles? Mr Buffett is certainly not the first investor to come unstuck on Wall Street. Investment banks may sometimes earn fabulous riches. When they ration out that wealth, however, shareholders are often to be found at the back of the queue. Salomon is no exception. In 1994 the firm paid its staff $1.4 billion, despite its huge losses that year; Mr Keegan was paid an astonishing $30m. Yet if managers try to pay traders any less than they think they deserve, they are quickly lured away by offers from rival firms.
Heading for the exit
So what will Mr Buffett do now? The fact that he plans to increase Berkshire's stake in Salomon looks like a vote of confidence in the firm. But it may not be. Mr Buffett may have had enough. Although he will increase his ownership of Salomon if he converts his preference shares, he made a second, more important, announcement on September 12th. Berkshire may issue $400m of bonds that can be exchanged, at some future date, for a substantial amount of the Salomon shares that it owns. (If, for example, investors owning the bonds can swap at $50 per share, then Berkshire will rid itself of 8m shares in the event that all of the bonds are swapped for equity, and not redeemed for cash.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Mr Buffett finally appears to have done something shrewd with his investment. By announcing that he will convert his preference shares into common stock, he has sent a positive signal to the market while discreetly arranging a sale by the back door. At the same time, he may be able to reduce Berkshire Hathaway's borrowing costs: the higher investors think Salomon's share price will climb in the future, the lower the interest rate Berkshire will have to pay on the exchangeable bonds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This wheeze also suits Salomon. It appears less damning than a straightforward sale of the firm's stock. Those who think that this is yet more proof of Mr Buffett's investment savvy have little reason to cheer, however. For he did not cook up this scheme. Salomon did.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<html><head><title>The genetic illusion</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></p>

<h1><center>The genetic illusion</center></h1>

WHAT is man? Philosophers have debated this question for millennia, reaching no very serious conclusion. Lately, however, philosophy has become rather less fashionable than genetics, which is in the throes of a hugely expensive effort, known as the Human Genome Project, to answer the same question. This project is already showing great promise. It should produce many medical benefits. But it will also throw up some ethical dilemmas. Should humans be genetically engineered; should insurers have access to customers' genetic make-up to assess their risk of disease? And, in the longer run, it is in danger of creating a philosophical misconception of its own: that men's actions are determined by their genes, not by their own free will.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not the geneticists who are at fault. The trouble is that other people often read too much into what geneticists do. When a geneticist asks what man is, one obvious answer is: "99% a chimpanzee". This is the percentage by which a person's <font size=-1>DNA</font> appears to match that of his nearest non-human relation. What it is to be human is, in that sense, crowded into 1% of the 3 billion genetic "letters" that go to make up a person's genetic material--the human genome.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reading those 3 billion letters is the task of the genome project, which expects to list all of them within the next few years in the hope of producing new forms of medical diagnosis and treatment (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>). But this is not merely a matter of working out what the genes are. Biologists also need to interpret the messages genes carry, and how those messages interact to build a person. If and when the interpretation is completed, humanity will know its biological self better than was conceivable as little as two decades ago.

</p><p><b>After such knowledge</b>
<br>Yet anticipating that interpretation risks recapitulating mistakes that have dogged genetics since its inception. The subject got off to a bad start when the work of its founding genius, Gregor Mendel, was ignored for almost 40 years. The period of this ignorance--the last decades of the 19th century--was marked by the growth of eugenics. This movement proposed to improve humanity by a process tantamount to selective breeding. One strand of it, however, begat America's sterilisation and selective immigration laws of the 1920s, and ultimately led to the Nazi death camps.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another strand--concerned with the measurement of human intelligence--rapidly degenerated into a vacuous debate between those who thought intelligence to be largely inherited and those who believed it to be a product of a child's early environment: nature versus nurture, as the argument came to be known. By the time real scientific genetics started its careful, limited experiments on plants and fruit flies and fungi, ideological camps were already established, and prepared to pounce on any result that supported their point of view. Conversely, geneticists with particular points of view were not above making up results to support their own ideologies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is a real danger that this could happen again. The reaction against genetic explanations that followed the excesses of eugenics has lost much of its steam. There seems to be particular public interest in scientific results that purport to show that this or that aspect of human behaviour is under biological control. There is, it is said, a gene for "thrill seeking". Male homosexuality, one result suggests, is inherited down the maternal line. The brains of homosexuals are different from those of heterosexuals. The brains of dyslexics are different from those of people who can read easily. Few of these results have emerged from the genome project itself. But, as time goes by, some such information undoubtedly will, and will strengthen the idea that people's will is not as free as western philosophers have liked to suppose. Or, as it is often put, that biology is destiny.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet this would be an error. Clear limits exist to normal human behaviour, and such limits are obviously genetic. People do not, for instance, eat grass and moo. They do not, except in novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs, swing through the trees. But it is nevertheless true that they could choose to do these things if they wanted to, at least for a time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The respectable scientific case against free will is a physicist's case--that every outcome is an inevitable consequence of the arrangement of matter that immediately preceded it. This is not, however, a biologist's case. And it is certainly not a geneticist's case. For "biology is destiny" carries a second, unspoken, premise: "genetics is biology". The conclusion that follows is: "therefore genetics is destiny". Sometimes it is. Men with a fault in the appropriate gene will be colourblind without exception. Usually, though, things are more complex. Height is certainly under genetic control, but genes do not explain why young Japanese are taller than their fathers. The cause is a change of diet. And nutrition is just as "biological" as genetics.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;About a dozen genes are reckoned to control height. Brains are built and regulated by thousands of them. And in addition to this the scope for environmental effects on brain development, and therefore on behaviour and intelligence, is both enormous and commonplace. It is known as learning.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The complexity of the way the brain develops and functions, and the interaction between genes and environment that is responsible for it, will certainly be illuminated by the genome project. Genes will emerge that, if present in one form rather than another, or present in particular combinations, predispose people to behave one way rather than another. Other genes will cause only those predispositions appropriate to a particular environment to develop. All such predispositions will be expressed in the same way--in the actual wiring of the nerve cells that make up the brain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Does this make people prisoners of the way their brain is wired? This question is best addressed by asking not whether it seems difficult for someone to make a particular choice, but whether it seems impossible. Sometimes it clearly is. Certain diseases genuinely rob people of choice. Accidental brain damage can have the same effect. If neurobiology ultimately comes to show that the way someone's brain is wired really does limit their scope for choice in a given situation to no choice at all, then so be it. But even when the genome project is completed, the science that could come to that conclusion will still be a long way off--and just how far off can be imagined by thinking how much a person differs from a chimpanzee, yet how similar is their <font size=-1>DNA</font>. So much complexity from so little difference. Genetics has suffered before from a mountain of speculation being built on a molehill of knowledge, and humanity has suffered as a result. For now there is no reason to abandon the belief that people control their own actions--and should be held responsible for them.

<p><h2>Banned: the bomb</h2></p>
<p><p>The <font size=-1>UN</font>'s General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to open for signature a <b>Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty </b>that had earlier been blocked by India and Iran. India can still prevent the treaty coming into force. But other world leaders, including those of the five official nuclear powers, are queuing up to sign.
<p>Iraq's aircraft and air defences defiantly provoked American aircraft in the "no fly" zones. The United States threatened a <b>"disproportionate" response</b>, and flew <font size=-1>B</font>-<font size=-1>52</font> and Stealth bombers to the area. Earlier in the week, Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, had advanced to sweep Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan from its strongholds in Iraq's Kurdish enclave.
<p>Under Syrian pressure, <b>Lebanon</b>'s two Shia parties, Amal and Hizbullah, changed their minds to fight elections in southern Lebanon (as well as forthcoming ones in the Bekaa valley) on a joint ticket. The candidates they endorsed won overwhelmingly.
<p>Joachim Ruhana, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of <b>Burundi</b>, was murdered by gunmen. In an earlier development, Burundi's neighbours agreed to ease sanctions against the military regime in order to allow in humanitarian aid.
<p>A Commonwealth delegation reached agreement with <b>Nigeria</b> on sending a ministerial team to the country to discuss human rights abuses and a return to democracy.
<p>A relief convoy reached the Liberian town of Tubmanberg and found several thousand <b>starving people</b>. The town had been cut off for weeks by fighting between rival factions.
<p>President Albert Zafy of <b>Madagascar</b> quit after being impeached by the National Assembly. An election is set for November 3rd.</p>
<p><h2>Belgian crisis</h2></p>
<p><p>A Belgian court charged a former interior minister, Alain Van der Biest , and four others with the 1991 <b>murder of Andr&eacute; Cools</b>, a deputy prime minister. Information leading to the arrests may have come from investigations into the murder of four girls and the uncovering of a paedophile and car-theft ring. Outraged by apparent incompetence all round, King Albert called for reform of the judicial system.
<p>Russia's president, <b>Boris Yeltsin</b>, handed over most of his powers to the prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, before he has heart surgery later this month. He did not yield control of nuclear weapons or the right to name ministers and sign decrees.
<p>Europe's monetary committee agreed on a procedure for imposing sanctions against countries that run excessive budget deficits after they join <b>economic and monetary union</b>. Under the deal, still to be ratified, wayward countries could be required to put up non-interest bearing deposits and pay fines.
<p>Russian troops began withdrawing from <b>Chechnya</b> under the terms of the peace agreement.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<h2>American intrigue</h2></p>
<p><p>Susan McDougal, a business partner of Bill Clinton's in the failed <b>Whitewater </b>scheme, went to prison rather than testify about the president's role in the case. Analysts said this was unlikely to affect the president's chances in the election.
<p><b>Ross Perot</b>, floundering on in America's election campaign, picked as his running mate Pat Choate, an economist known mainly for his attacks on <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> and on pro-Japan lobbyists.
<p>The Senate passed the Defence of Marriage Act, which would deny federal recognition of <b>same-sex marriages</b> and allow states to refuse to recognise any that had been approved by other states.
<p>Mr Clinton asked Congress to find more than $1 billion a year for <b>anti-terrorist measures </b>at airports, federal offices and museums.
<p>At least 28 people in the United States were killed by <b>Hurricane Fran</b>, and 34 North Carolina counties were declared disaster areas.
<p>Further fighting in <b>Colombia</b> left at least 25 soldiers and policemen, and more guerrillas, dead. Vice-president Humberto de la Calle, having told scandal-wrapped President Ernesto Samper to resign because the country was "falling apart", was told in return that he himself should resign. He did.
<p>An opinion poll on <b>Nicaragua</b>'s October 20th presidential election found left-winger (and ex-president) Daniel Ortega now close behind the right-wing front-runner, Arnaldo Aleman. But in a (probable) run-off, he would be likely to be well behind.</p>
<p><h2>Troops out</h2></p>
<p><p>Japanese on the island of <b>Okinawa </b>voted decisively for United States military facilities on the island to be reduced, leading to fears that other regions of Japan may reject American troops.
<p>Malaysia said it was "offended" by statements by Singaporean politicians about possible <b>reunification </b>of the two countries. Singapore was part of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965.
<p>A quarrel between China and Japan over <b>disputed islands </b>in the East China Sea sharpened when the Chinese gave warning of "serious damage" to relations between the two countries unless a lighthouse built by Japanese right-wingers was removed from the islands.
<p>Thirty settlers were killed by tribesmen in <b>Bangladesh</b>'s Chittagong Hill Tracts. It was the worst massacre of settlers for many years. The tribesmen want all settlers to leave and for the region to be granted autonomy.

<p><h2>Rolling on</h2>
<p><p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>Unemployment in America</b> dropped sharply in August, to 5.1%, the lowest level in seven years. The Dow Jones climbed strongly, despite the prospect of higher interest rates. Of the big five economies, only America and Britain have succeeded in pushing down unemployment over the year.
<p>In the biggest expansion since it was formed in 1930, the <b>Bank for International Settlements</b>, the central banks' central bank, is adding nine new members from Asia and Latin America to its mainly industrialised member-countries. Among those invited to join, and forestalling moves among Asian countries to form their own (competing) network, were China, India, Singapore and South Korea.
<p>A report from the British government claimed Switzerland held <b>Nazi gold </b>worth $5o0m at the end of the second world war--close to $4 billion in today's terms and much more than was previously thought. The report could increase pressure on Switzerland to examine the role of Swiss banks in shielding Nazi firms. Britain reckons that Swiss banks could still hold 90% of the hoard, which was looted from occupied countries and from Jews, then banked in neutral Switzerland.
<p>Withdrawals from Morgan Grenfell's troubled mutual funds slowed, but the firm's parent, <b>Deutsche Bank</b>, has not ruled out the need to push more cash into the three funds. Deutsche Bank is considering transferring responsibility for the British operations to Frankfurt. The bank dispatched one of its top men to London to help sort out the mess.
<p><b>Kepit</b>, the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust, is to be broken up, an unusual move reflecting the trend towards protecting shareholders rather than managers. The episode is an embarrassing one for Kleinwort Benson Investment Management, which has seen the &#163;530m ($822m) trust limp since its launch 2.5 years ago.
<p>Sir Alastair Morton reckons <b>Eurotunnel</b> will reach agreement with its leading creditor banks on refinancing its huge debt before he retires next month as co-chairman. The Anglo-French operator of the Channel tunnel cut its losses to &#163;372m ($568m) in the first half from &#163;465m a year earlier, operating near break-even in the second quarter; financial charges shrank from &#163;355m to &#163;330m.</p>
<p><h2>Switched on</h2></p>
<p><p><b>Canal Plus</b> of France, recently thwarted in its plans to expand into Germany's digital-<font size=-1>TV</font> market, is to merge with most of the European assets of <b>NetHold</b> in a deal worth about $2 billion. This will make Canal Plus, with 8.5m subscribers, one of the biggest <font size=-1>TV</font> groups in the world. The owners of NetHold are two South African firms, Richemont, a luxury-goods and tobacco outfit, and Multichoice, a media holding company.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><b>America's discount</b> <b>drugstores</b> are consolidating. In a $1 billion deal, Phar-Mor will merge with ShopKo Stores, more than doubling the number of pharmacies in its chain. And in a second development Revco, the country's second-largest chain, launched a $330m hostile bid for Big B.
<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Trading in <b>Olivetti </b>resumed after a turbulent few days. Its shares had been suspended after Carlo De Benedetti stepped down as head of the Italian technology company and another departing executive accused the company of hiding the true extent of its losses.
<p>The <b>semiconductor industry</b> got some good news. One closely tracked indicator, the "book-to-bill ratio" for North American firms, rose slightly to 0.90 (for every $100 in shipments, chip firms received $90-worth of new orders) from 0.86 the month before. World figures, which arrive a month late, looked even better: 0.95 for July. But both are still far below the 1.16 figure of a year ago, suggesting that the industry is coming out of its year-long slump only slowly.
<p>America's Textron, whose 25 divisions worldwide range from Cessna aircraft to automotive parts, awarded a $1.1 billion, ten-year contract to<b> AT&T</b> to install voice, data and video communications.
<p>British women can now get <b>personalised jeans</b> from Levi Strauss, which is trying out its "Personal Pair" scheme in London after the new tailoring service proved popular in America and Canada.</p>
<p><h2>Wrecked</h2></p>
<p><p>Profits at <b>Renault</b> plummeted in the first half, and the French car maker warned of a loss for the full year. Net profits dropped by 91% to FFr158m ($31m), from FFr1.76 billion a year ago. Revenues fell 2.2% as a price war raged and recovery in Europe's commercial-vehicle market failed to materialise.
<p>Two big shipping lines are to merge their container operations, creating the world's biggest container group in a fragmented industry. Britain's <b>P&O</b> and <b>Royal Nedlloyd </b>of the Netherlands will have equal stakes in <font size=-1>P&O</font> Nedlloyd, which will have net assets of $1.5 billion and a $4 billion turnover. The news boosted the shares of both.
<p><b>Prudential Insurance</b>, already embattled in its life business, suffered a new blow. It lost a $4.5 billion-a-year contract to provide health insurance to the American Association of Retired Persons. Three competitors have taken over from it.

<h1><center>Funds and games</center></h1>
<p><b>Recent scandals in the fund-management industry are in danger of making regulators over-react
</b></p>

PETER LYNCH, Warren Buffett, George Soros. The fund-management industry has always been known for its stars, courted by investors and canonised by the press for their ability to beat the financial markets. More recently, however, two prominent fund managers have gained notoriety for less stellar deeds. Peter Young, of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (<font size=-1>MGAM</font>) in London, appears to have put his investors in a pickle; Colin Armstrong, of Jardine Fleming in Hong Kong, is said to have misused investors' funds. The danger now is that the damage will extend beyond these two firms, if regulators respond by issuing a raft of new rules, rather than letting the industry heal itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The pressure on them to do so is acute, because in both cases small investors were involved. When an investment banker or derivatives trader goes astray, it is usually his peers that are hurt: Nick Leeson took down the Barings blue-bloods, not the man in the street. But when Aunt Agatha is at risk, cries for the regulators to do something--anything--grow louder.

</p><p><b>Star-crossed investors</b>
<br>In fact, the industry has plenty of incentives to put its own house in order. Until recently, the rise of star managers was caused by the increased competition for new cash among unit trusts (mutual funds). It seemed an excellent marketing formula: find someone with a good track record, build up his public image to match his ego, and then leave him alone to work his magic. "People want to believe in magic, they want to believe in gurus," Mr Young was quoted as saying this week. But the industry is beginning to learn that the star system also entails huge risks. Not only is it a source of mischief, it also makes that mischief more visible when it is discovered. To remain competitive, funds will have to strive to avoid putting performance before propriety.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This requires two big changes. First, funds must reform the way they pay their managers. To lure the brightest stars, most firms allow them to engage in personal trading for their own account. This is a recipe for disaster, as it makes it far easier to engage in practices such as "front running" (buying a stock for yourself, then investing the fund's money in it to boost its price) and "rat trading" (waiting to see how trades turn out, and then booking the best ones to your own account). Although these practices are illegal in most places, they can be hard to detect; forbidding personal accounts would snuff them out overnight. Better to let managers invest in the same funds they manage--so that, to borrow one of Mr Buffett's folksy phrases, "they eat their own cooking" .
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides abolishing personal accounts, fund-management firms should also watch their stars more closely. Internal watchdogs are often afraid to trifle with the best performers, lest they leave in a huff. This is perverse. Since beating the market is difficult, a manager who thumps it consistently is either extremely clever, lucky--or a suitable case for monitoring. Indeed, it should not take long for funds that enact such reforms to score points with investors. In the past few years, an entire sub-industry of fund-tracking firms and financial journalists has arisen to monitor funds' behaviour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But although funds are capable of making many changes themselves, some new regulation is still essential. For a start, regulators must improve their ability to spot malpractice when it occurs. Britain's fund-management watchdog--the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation--learnt of Mr Young's deeds through sheer luck. It is now looking exhaustively into <font size=-1>MGAM</font>'s actions, and trying to discover whether the fund's trustees did their jobs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Regulators can also help to clarify the ways in which unit trusts should disclose their funds' risks. Since all investors are different, these rules must remain flexible. Many investors, for example, prefer to turn their judgment over to a professional, who will hop between stocks and bonds, and between different countries, to chase the best opportunities. If a fund wants to market itself in this way, it should be allowed to. Other investors, however, want to decide for themselves which kinds of assets to invest in; they simply want their unit trust to do so cheaply and effectively. For these investors, it is crucial that a fund does what it says it will: a European equity fund, for example, should not be buying shares in Asia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If regulators lay down effective disclosure rules, and ensure that they are complied with, it will become far easier for funds to tell investors what they are doing. After that, the need to compete should be enough to make sure that it is trustworthy managers who become the stars of the future.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<h1>The proper study of mankind</h1>

<p><b>The Human Genome Project has made great strides in the past year. By describing and cataloguing all the genes in a human body, it will change man's understanding of man. But not necessarily in ways most people expected </b></p>

BIOLOGISTS are often accused by their colleagues in other disciplines of suffering from physics envy. Physicists, the jibe goes, work on more fundamental problems. Therefore they have bigger tools.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until recently, the jibe was true. Sub-atomic-particle researchers have vast machines to pry into the building blocks of matter. Rocket scientists try to construct dwelling-places in space. Cosmologists plumb the origins of the universe with big, expensive telescopes. Now, however, biologists are matching their colleagues' ambition. Until recently, no project has sought to follow the Delphic Oracle's advice--"know thyself"--and disentangle what is, perhaps, the most intriguing fundamental problem of all: the nature of humanity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Human Genome Project, though it will not do this by itself, will be a start. It will give biologists a toolkit with which to describe, and hence perhaps to explain, human life. The aim of the project is to catalogue and analyse all the genes whose collective instructions go to build, and then to run, a human body. This collection of genes is known as the human genome. The description of the human genome will be akin to the description earlier this century of atoms and the particles of which they are composed. Those are the basic units of matter. Genes are the basic units of life.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The implications of this project, like those of atomic physics, are enormous, and, for the moment, unpredictable. The project's protagonists hope to discover new medical insights, which should lead to new forms of diagnosis and treatment. Gene therapy--the introduction into the relevant tissue of working genes to replace faulty ones--may one day cure diseases. Biotechnologists may find ways to add tailored versions of newly discovered genes into existing human genomes. And, if it is possible to describe what makes up the simpler organs of the body, it should also be possible, one day, to analyse what happens in the brain and hence much of what determines human behaviour. So at the end of the process stands the goal of a new understanding of human life itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As happened with the description of atomic particles, all this opens up frightening possibilities and ethical dilemmas. Can new forms of life be created? If life can be mapped, can it be replicated? Might genetic weapons be made to spread diseases, either known or newly created? If a genetic basis can be described for criminal behaviour might criminals come to be seen as victims of their genes rather than violators of the law? Might individuals carrying such genes be persecuted even if they had done no wrong? If scientists can identify the genetic basis for height or brainpower, might parents be able to specify their children's height or intelligence? Can parents "choose" their children?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All those questions are for the future--some for a distant one. Meanwhile, there is one last thing that makes the Human Genome Project unlike any other big science project so far. It will lead to discoveries that will make some people a lot of money. And because of that, as well as because the thirst for knowledge seems unstoppable, the genome project seems certain to continue to its end--wherever that may be.
</p><p><b>The three billion names of God</b></b>
<br>Given the hopes and fears attached to it, the nuts and bolts of the project are surprisingly banal. The formal goal is to describe the sequence of all the <font size=-1>DNA</font> in the nucleus of a human cell--that is, to work out the order of the chemical "letters" that carry the genetic message (see <a href="sf2.html">here</a> for an explanation of what a gene is and what it does). Working out this sequence is routine and rather dull. The technology for doing it was invented in 1975, by Frederick Sanger, of Cambridge University, and though it has been refined since, it has not been fundamentally improved upon. Most genomics laboratories consist of rows of quiet machines tended by a few technicians. The air of excitement is unpalpable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sequencing <font size=-1>DNA</font>, though, is the easy bit. The hard bit is making sense of the findings: this is what the project is really about. There appear, depending on whom you listen to and exactly what definition you use, to be anything between 50,000 and 80,000 genes hidden in the human genome. A few hundred were known about in general terms before the project started (they could be identified when they came in more than one variety or when they went wrong and affected the workings of the body). The rest remained to be discovered--and the complications were formidable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>DNA</font> amongst which the genes are scattered contains some 3 billion chemical letters. Only about 2% of these letters actually carry the message of the genes. Some of the rest help genes to function in various ways but most of them are either of unknown function or are parasitic junk.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, Dr Sanger's technique is only reliable for pieces of <font size=-1>DNA</font> less than about 500 letters long. Solving the human genome, therefore, means breaking the <font size=-1>DNA</font> up into 500-letter-long pieces, sequencing the pieces, sticking them together in the right order, and then tracking down the bits that actually constitute the genes. It is not just number crunching.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So imagine the genome project as a giant jigsaw puzzle. First, you have to assemble the pieces: 3 billion divided by 500--ie, 6m of them. And 6m is the minimum number. It does not allow for any overlaps (and it is by matching up overlaps that the pieces are put together), let alone for the errors and duplications that are the currency of scientific research.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So how can it be done at all? The answer is by taking advantage of two saving graces. First, there are several ways of breaking the puzzle up into sub-jigsaws. The individual pieces in the sub-jigsaws can be sequenced and assembled separately--and the sub-jigsaws fitted together again. The second saving grace is that lots of people can work on the jigsaw at the same time--the more the merrier, in fact. This is the main feature, other than its practical applications, which distinguishes the Human Genome Project from other big science. You do not need to build a particle accelerator or space shuttle to do it. Anyone who can afford a sequencer, a computer and a connection to the Internet can play. Thus, though the project started in American laboratories, it is now a global venture.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result, progress has been rapid. Both "physical maps" (linked sequences of sub-jigsaws) and "genetic-linkage maps" (which track the genes as they are mixed together from one generation to another) were completed in late 1995. The sequence will follow as night follows day (or as funding follows research). Completion is now predicted for 2000 or shortly thereafter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So scientists have now reached the stage at which they have defined the questions, established a method for tackling them and produced early results. These results, however, suggest that the project is likely to disappoint those hoping for miraculous medical breakthroughs and may reassure those who fear the eventual worst. For good or ill, the genome project will, at least for a while, produce less dramatic consequences than most people think.
</p><p><b>The secret labyrinth</b></b>
<br>Though the project was started largely because some top biologists realised it was technically feasible, it was sold on the back of its potential medical benefits. These will certainly come, but not as fast as politicians and the public have been led to believe nor, necessarily, in the way they might expect.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A genome project might be expected, mainly, to be about curing genetic disorders. Though hundreds of diseases--for example, Huntington's chorea and haemophilia--are indeed caused by single faulty genes, each one is rare. Natural selection has weeded them out. So even if they could all be eliminated by the project's discoveries, that would amount to less than 2% of the world's disease burden.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In most diseases the contribution of genes is fuzzier. A faulty gene may be a necessary but not a sufficient cause of a disease. Sometimes an environmental trigger may also be needed (some forms of schizophrenia are believed to fall into this category). Sometimes more than one gene may need to be faulty for an effect to show up (so-called polygenic diseases, such as colon cancer). Sometimes, a faulty gene may not be needed at all: some forms of breast cancer, for instance, are genetic (two genes that more-or-less guarantee its development have been isolated); other forms are not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the link between genes and disease is more complex than many people originally thought. When there is no simple relationship between a single gene and a disease, scientists cannot use traditional genetic identification (following bits of chromosome from one generation to another to see who gets the disease) to locate it on a chromosome. New tricks are needed to study such diseases. One of the most important is to see where genes are active.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To understand what is involved, imagine the project now not as a jigsaw but as a stamp collection. Geneticists have not merely to collect the genetic stamps, but also to stick them in the pages of the album corresponding to the places which use them. These, in the case of biology, are not countries but tissues. The trick of finding out which genes are active in which tissues was invented by Craig Venter, then at America's government-financed National Institutes of Health, now at the private Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville, Maryland. Instead of peering directly into the cell nucleus, Dr Venter looked at the messenger <font size=-1>RNA</font> that the nucleus sends out (again, see <a href="sf2.html">here</a> for the role of <font size=-1>RNA</font>). This is copied only from active genes, so examining it can give a good idea of what a particular sort of cell is up to. Dr Venter copied the <font size=-1>RNA</font> back into <font size=-1>DNA</font> and then sequenced short sections of it. These he called "expressed sequence tags".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By sticking his tags together with some nifty computer software, Dr Venter has been able to get a picture of what is going on in different tissues. He has identified the nuts and bolts of some 30,000 genes, and has worked out which are active throughout the body, and which have their activity confined to particular tissues. (Those who think it is the capacity of the brain that makes humans unique will be pleased to note that the brain has by far the largest number of unique genes.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Venter, though, was able to do more. With a gene's sequence in the bag, he was able to work out what the protein it codes for will look like. That, in turn, helps explain what the protein is likely to do (the functions of lots of genes and proteins have been worked out in organisms such as mice and yeast that are more amenable to experimental manipulation than people). He reckons that about 40% of the genes he has discovered are for housekeeping--ie, doing the things needed to keep a cell's metabolism running. Some 22% are to do with copying <font size=-1>DNA</font> into <font size=-1>RNA</font>, and <font size=-1>RNA</font> into proteins. And around 12% make so-called "signal molecules" such as hormones.
</p><p><b>Cleaning up in the gene pool</b></b>
<br>This sort of knowledge is scientifically invaluable. It is also invaluable to biotechnology companies whose owners hope to make their fortunes by interpreting it to the advantage of medicine. For it moves the focus from treating genetic diseases to making therapeutic proteins for problems that might not be regarded as genetic diseases at all--such as proteins that help boost the human immune system. There are half a dozen such therapeutic proteins already on the market; more than 1,000 other genes wait on the world's patent registers, ready (their discoverers hope) to generate cash.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The growth in the number of interested companies is a sure sign that the genome project is no longer like the other "big science" projects that are controlled by governments. The project is passing from the stage of basic to applied research. To see how, take the case of Human Genome Science (<font size=-1>HGS</font>), a company run by William Haseltine, a Harvard molecular biologist turned entrepreneur. His company started off in partnership with The Institute for Genomic Research, though the two organisations are now estranged. It has succeeded in building up a long list of genes, and of the tissues in which they are expressed; it also has a portfolio of some 90 so-called "purified proteins" that it hopes might have some therapeutic value.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As yet, <font size=-1>HGS</font> has no products. But it, and a number of other new firms (particularly Incyte Pharmaceuticals, of Palo Alto, California), are already making money by selling genetic information to more established drug companies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other way of making money from genomics is by genetic testing. This makes it easy to check for known faults in genes once they have been identified. Far easier, in fact, than developing a treatment. Most genetic diseases are still incurable and gene therapy has been a dismal failure so far.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Genetic tests are useful early warning signals of susceptibility in cases where early surgery is desirable (as with breast and colon cancer). But where neither cure nor treatment exists (as for example, in Huntington's chorea), it is hard to see what purpose such a test can serve except to inform decisions about having children or perhaps, to alert insurance companies that you are a bad risk. Insurance companies want this information. Customers, understandably, are reluctant to give it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The argument over genetic testing is symptomatic of what is--and is not--likely to emerge from the Human Genome Project. Fears of genetically engineered monsters look risible in the face of technology that cannot even put the genes needed to combat cystic fibrosis into the lungs of sufferers. And the flap caused whenever researchers think they have located a gene that influences behaviour is out of all proportion to the reality: most such claims have been withdrawn once further data have been collected.
</p><p><b>Are you the prisoner of your genes?</b></b>
<br>There is a common misconception that genetics is destiny. The early results of the genome project suggest that this is not so. It appears extremely rare that there is a single gene for anything--not even for most diseases, let alone for complex forms of behaviour, such as aggression, or sexuality. The determinants of such behaviour are embedded in a jungle of genes which affect many different things at once. It will be a while before anyone can isolate any part of this jungle. It is possible that they will never be able to do so because the nature of organisms is that they are more than the sum of their parts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is certain, however, is that, though the project will not tell us everything about ourselves, it will hugely increase our knowledge. Some of that knowledge will be welcome (genetically engineered bacteria, once the bugaboo of those who oppose biotechnology, are now workaday tools in factories and laboratories across the world). Some, of course, will not be. But, once tried and tested, it will be presumed to be the truth and integrated into the way people think of themselves. Knowing thyself is not always a comfortable process. But it is better than ignorance.

<h1>How genes work</h1>

<p>GENES are often described as the blueprint for life. In reality they are more like a cake recipe, as Richard Dawkins of Oxford University once put it. Change one bit of a blueprint and only the corresponding bit of the machine changes. Alter one of a cake's ingredients and the whole thing may turn out different.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Genes are pieces of <font size=-1>DNA</font> (deoxyribonucleic acid); they are found, organised into chromosomes, in the nuclei of living cells. <font size=-1>DNA</font> molecules look rather like twisted ladders with millions of rungs. The two uprights of each ladder form the famous "double helix" but, to understand the genome project, the parts to focus on are the rungs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each rung is made of a pair of molecules (called nitrogenous bases), out of a set of four known by the initial letters of their chemical names: <font size=-1>A</font>, <font size=-1>C</font>, <font size=-1>G</font> and <font size=-1>T</font>. <font size=-1>A</font> and <font size=-1>G</font> are larger molecules; <font size=-1>C</font> and <font size=-1>T</font> are smaller. Each rung contains one large and one small base. The shape of each base means that a pairing of <font size=-1>A</font> and <font size=-1>T</font> produces a rung of the same size as a pairing of <font size=-1>G</font> and <font size=-1>C</font>. The rungs fit into the ladder either way round, so reading the bases attached to a single upright yields a message written in four chemical letters, eg <font size=-1>ATGTCC</font>. Genes are sequences of several hundred, or several thousand of these letters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a gene to do its job, it is not enough for the message simply to be present in rungs of <font size=-1>DNA</font>; it has to get into the rest of the cell. For this to happen, it must first be copied into a second sort of nucleic acid known as <font size=-1>RNA</font>. This is chemically similar to <font size=-1>DNA</font> but has only one strand. <font size=-1>RNA</font> is made by an enzyme called transcriptase. This unzips the two strands of a <font size=-1>DNA</font> molecule and builds up an <font size=-1>RNA</font> molecule out of bases that match those on one of the <font size=-1>DNA</font> strands.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These <font size=-1>RNA</font> molecules are messengers armed with a copy of the gene. They drift around the cell until captured by pieces of molecular machinery called ribosomes that read the molecules and turn their messages into proteins.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Proteins are the real work-horses of cells. Like <font size=-1>DNA</font> and <font size=-1>RNA</font>, they are chains of smaller molecules linked together. (The component molecules of protein are called amino acids.) Some proteins, such as keratin and collagen, hold tissues and bodies in shape. Others, such as insulin, act as messengers between cells or, like haemoglobin, transport useful materials (in this case oxygen) to places they would not otherwise reach in sufficient quantities. Others still, such as transcriptase, are enzymes regulating almost all of the chemical reactions that go on in a body.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Genetic messages are read and turned into proteins as follows: when an <font size=-1>RNA</font> molecule is attached to a ribosome, its genetic letters are read off three at a time. Each triplet is like a genetic word. The word represents an amino acid (there are 20 amino acids to choose from, and 64 possible triplets, so most amino acids are actually represented by more than one triplet). As each triplet is read, the ribosome adds the appropriate amino acid to the growing protein chain until it comes to a triplet that says "Stop" . Changing the order of the bases in the original <font size=-1>DNA</font> can, therefore, change a protein's amino-acid sequence and can thus change what it does. Such changes are known as mutations. Some mutations are devastating--faulty insulin, for instance, produces diabetes; faulty haemoglobin, anaemia. Some make little difference. And a very few improve things--thus providing the raw material for evolution.

<h1>Can happy days be here again?</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font>
<p>WITH scarcely seven weeks to go until election day, strategists in both the Republican and Democratic campaigns are working overtime. There are new advertisements to write, debates to win and undecided voters to be influenced. But perhaps all this frenetic activity is futile. Many of the number-crunchers reckon that the biggest influence on voters' behaviour has already occurred: the rate of economic growth in the second quarter of an election year. With revised figures showing the economy booming along at an annual rate of 4.8% in April, May and June, Bill Clinton cannot lose.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sensibly, the strategists do not put too much faith in such seers. But, as far as Mr Clinton is concerned, the good economic news just seems to keep coming. Far from slowing down over the summer, as many had expected, the expansion continues apace. Indicators of consumer confidence are buoyant; manufacturers' orders are accelerating; and, most important, the labour market shows no sign of running out of steam. A quarter of a million new non-farm jobs were created in August and America's unemployment rate fell to 5.1%--a low that has been matched only once since 1980.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As always, the statistics need careful interpretation. The dramatic drop in the unemployment rate comes mainly from a shrinking of the labour force. Many new jobs came from the public sector, especially in local education, where some states have brought in mandates to shrink class sizes by recruiting more teachers. The growth of private jobs has actually slowed since June. Nonetheless, with unemployment among men of 25 and over at 3.8% (see <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>), there is no question that the labour market is tight. And, unsurprisingly, wages are edging up: average hourly pay in August was 3.6% higher than a year ago, the biggest annual wage increase since December 1990.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The combination of low unemployment and swelling paypackets raises the chances of (and the need for) a rise in interest rates at the Federal Reserve's monetary-policy meeting on September 24th. Accelerating wages, the biggest single component in firms' costs, often herald inflationary pressure. At its previous meeting in July, the Fed decided against raising rates. It opted for an "asymmetric" position--meaning that it had a bias towards tightening in future. Today, with an ever-tighter labour market, members of the Federal Reserve Board are publicly voicing concern.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One might expect higher interest rates to be music to the Republicans' ears, particularly if they prompt a long-expected stockmarket correction. But, fortunately for Mr Clinton, the bond market seems to have already factored in a rate increase of between 25 and 50 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point). And the stockmarket rose on the day the strong employment figures were released. There seems to be a consensus that a modest rise in interest rates now will temper the economy's excesses and let the recovery steam ahead.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some Cassandras, however, are less sanguine. Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, thinks much higher interest rates are in the offing. He makes a striking comparison between today's economy and that of spring 1988. Then, too, the economy was well into the sixth year of a recovery; unemployment had fallen below 5.5% and stayed there until mid-1990. Meanwhile, wage-growth rose from 3% a year to nearly 4.5% and, in response, the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates by 300 basis points. The parallels today are sufficient, he believes, for an overall rise of 175 basis points (to 7%) before mid-1997, far more than most people on Wall Street expect.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one believes that the booming growth earlier this year can be sustained for long without upward pressure on prices. But the issue of whether unemployment is already "too low" is trickier. Much depends on what you believe the <font size=-1>NAIRU</font>, or "non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment", is. This is the rate of joblessness that is consistent with no inflationary pressure. Economists long thought that America's <font size=-1>NAIRU</font> was around 6%, but unemployment has been well below that level for two years, with scant signs of inflation. Whatever the reasons for this (perhaps globalisation, possibly corporate downsizing), the optimists reckon that America's <font size=-1>NAIRU</font> has been brought down--perhaps to 5.5%. Few would put it much lower than that. So, with the actual rate at 5.1%, it is only a matter of time before increasing wage pressure pushes up prices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The inflationary risk of higher wages depends on how far they are matched by productivity gains. If workers are producing more efficiently, then companies can afford to pay them more without raising overall costs. But evidence of greater productivity is mixed. The most recent statistics released this week show that in the year to June manufacturing productivity rose by 4.2%, while wages and benefits rose only 3.9%. But once you include the service sector of the economy, productivity gains are not keeping up with pay rises. Overall non-farm business productivity rose only 0.8% in the year to the second quarter and overall worker compensation by 3.7%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given that American companies have been investing more, this miserable productivity performance is a puzzle. One possibility is that improvements are not being measured properly; another is that they take time to come through. A third rationale--suggested by Robert Reich, the labour secretary, this week--is that there has not been enough investment in people to help them use all those fancy new machines that firms have bought.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a new study, Mr Reich's chief economist, Lisa Lynch, together with Sandra Black of Harvard University, measured the impact on firms' productivity of different kinds of investment geared towards people, as well as changes in workplace practices. They found that raising the educational level of employees in a firm by one year, for instance, improved productivity by 8.5% in manufacturing and 13% in non-manufacturing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The conclusion for Mr Reich is clear: use government policy to foster this kind of investment in people. Hence Mr Clinton's campaign proposals for tax credits for college education: a clearly-targeted proposal to address a specific problem. Meanwhile, the Republicans' across-the-board income-tax cut can be lambasted as fiscally dangerous and insufficiently targeted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever the economic merits of targeted tinkering with the tax system, the state of the economy is clearly helping the Democrats. With wages rising and most Americans admitting that they feel better-off, Mr Dole's tax-cutting message is proving hard to sell. Signs of discomfort are becoming evident in the Dole campaign: new advertisements, which barely mention the tax cuts, are being aired on television. Clearly the strategists are still trying hard. But the game may already be over on the economic front.

<h1>Trends of the week</h1>


<b>Statistic: </b>Bill Clinton paid the 27th visit of his presidency to California (more than California's own Ronald Reagan made in his two terms). Judging by the polls, Mr Clinton looks set to win the reward for his frequent flying: California's 54 electoral college votes.
<P><b>Damning statistic: </b>According to a briefing from the Media Studies Centre, the 1996 race is likely to be the least-covered presidential campaign in recent memory. From January to the end of July, network coverage was down 43% compared with 1992, and down 51% compared with the stunningly soporific campaign of 1988.
<P><b>Reshuffle: </b>Mr Dole replaced his media team. A sign of trouble--and a portent of more aggressive ads?
<b>Non-events: </b>Mr Dole's "Listening to America" sessions, at which hand-picked friendly audiences praise the candidate.
<P><b>Sticker:</b> "Bob Dole Listens".
<P><b>Optimist: </b>Jack Kemp, campaigning in Harlem.
<P><b>Doppelg&auml;ngers: </b>To help candidates prepare for the presidential debates, ex-Senator George Mitchell plays the part of Mr Dole for Mr Clinton; Senator Fred Thompson, an ex-actor, plays Mr Clinton for Mr Dole.
<P><b>Least-wanted job: </b>Ross Perot's running mate, turned down by more than one recognisable name. The poisoned chalice was at last accepted by Pat Choate, an economist and fellow anti-<font size=-1>NAFTA</font> crusader. Mr Choate played Al Gore in rehearsals for Mr Perot's disastrous televised <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> debate with the vice-president in 1993.
<P><b>Ladbroke's odds: </b>Clinton 1-7; Dole 4-1; Perot (50-1 last week) no longer listed.
<P><b>Quote: </b>Dick Morris, former Clinton strategist-in-chief, now a writer with a $2.5m contract, on the White House collection of <font size=-1>FBI</font> files, as recorded in the diary of prostitute Sherry Rowlands and printed in the tabloid <i>Star</i>: "It was Hillary, in 1993. She ordered them. She's a paranoid lady--she did it." 
<P><b>Denial</b>: Mr Morris tells a congressional committee that Miss Rowlands got the wrong end of the stick.
<P><b>Morbid speculation: </b>Mr Dole's musing on what he would want on his tombstone: "The people trusted him".

<h1>NetNanny states</h1>

<font size=1>SINGAPORE</font>
<p>ASIA'S authoritarians are continuing their unequal struggle against the Internet. In China last week some users noticed that access had been blocked to over 100 sites on the World Wide Web, the multimedia part of the Internet. The ban seems to cover, among others, American newspapers, Tibetan exiles, the Taiwanese government, <i>Playboy</i> and <i>The Economist</i>. The Chinese government has said nothing about what is going on--although it did promise a clampdown against pornography last February. The ban still seems patchy. International wire-services that provide Internet access seem to be unaffected--which may have something to do with the fact that they are compelled to pay fat fees to the official Chinese news agency.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New controls are also on their way in Singapore, where three local Internet "service providers" have more than 150,000 subscribers--5% of the population. In March the government began a drive to curb unwholesome activity in cyberspace, such as pornography and "material sowing social and religious discord."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until now, regulation in Singapore has relied largely on self-policing. Access providers were urged to install filtering software, such as Surfwatch, CyberPatrol or NetNanny. Some content providers, including political parties and religious groups, have to register with the authorities. But for those who managed to dodge the barricades to ogle hard-core porn or incite revolution, the chief constraint was the fear of being caught.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From September 15th, a new phase of regulation begins. Internet providers will introduce technology that enables them automatically to block access to sites banned by the regulator, the Singapore Broadcasting Authority (<font size=-1>SBA</font>). As might be expected, some Internet users are up in arms at censorship. Others, however, have more practical worries. Technology designed to censor material has hitherto been used on a much smaller scale, by companies. It tends to slow down connections to less-frequented Internet sites. The more banned sites there are, the slower it will be.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Optimists think the <font size=-1>SBA</font> list will be short. After all, Singapore is enthralled by the commercial possibilities of the Internet and cherishes its position as a regional communications hub. Others fear the worst. Already, big businesses, which have their own leased lines for Internet access, have secured an exemption from the new requirements. That only heightens the fear of some individual users that their access will be sharply curtailed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor has the government disguised its wish to censor objectionable political material as well as pornography. Internet "newsgroups" have provided perhaps the freest forums for political discussion Singapore has known. The question of re-merger with Malaysia, for example, has provoked a debate that has at times become overtly racist. The government is particularly worried by the fact that people can post their views anonymously, or under false names. Subscribers to a news group discussing Singapore were amused to find anonymous postings purporting to be from Lee Kuan Yew, the former Singaporean prime minister, hurling criticism--and sarcastic praise--at the regime. The real author of these messages has not yet been found.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In early September, Singapore and the six other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations met in Singapore to discuss the promotion and policing of the Internet. Singapore is far ahead in the business and even administrative uses of the Internet (which can be used, for example, to apply for some government permits). But agreement on a common approach to regulation was difficult. There, too, Singapore is streets ahead.

<p><b> BY INVITATION</b></p>
<h1>Democracy's second age</h1>
<p><b>One of the biggest gaps between Britain's two main political parties concerns constitutional reform, where Labour is advocating far-reaching changes. Here Tony Blair, the party's leader, sets out his party's plans and defends them against the Tory charge that they would break up the United Kingdom</b></p>

<p>WE ARE now in the Second Age of democracy. It is time to give it a second wind. After a long battle, the First Age established universal suffrage. This finally came to the United Kingdom, in 1928, when the vote was extended to all adult women.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nearly 70 years later, however, Britain has changed radically. The attempt to change prevailing social and economic conditions (and the need to fight two world wars) hugely extended the scope of central government. In 1900, central government spending as a share of <font size=-1>GDP</font> amounted to 9.7%; in 1930 it was 13.0%. Today, it is over 42%--steady at that level since 1979.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In mid-century the majority of the country was self-consciously working class, and paid less than 10% of their income in tax. Today, the largest grouping is the middle class; the groups classified as "<font size=-1>ABC1</font>" by pollsters make up 52% of the electorate, and pay over 35% of their incomes in taxes. Even those in the bottom fifth of the income distribution pay almost 40%. So government now spends more public money and the majority of the population fund the expenditure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These changes raise serious questions for democracy. Is it still supportable that the power to decide how these vast resources are spent should reside exclusively with a highly centralised national government? And do the more educated and wealthier citizens of today, albeit all of them with the vote, really have power over the system?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To make matters worse, some British institutions have not yet caught up even to 1928. They are actually pre-First Age. Think of the way Parliament works, sometimes seeming more private club than modern democratic forum; or the composition of the House of Lords; or constitutional conventions established in the 18th and 19th centuries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The consequence of ignoring these questions is that politics becomes less respected, less accountable, more remote from people's lives. That is bad for Britain and bad for democracy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Contrary to the Tory<i> canard</i>, constitutional reform is not an issue for the "chattering classes", irrelevant to most people. Properly done, it will go to the heart of public concerns. It is important not only for its own sake, but because it makes possible the attainment of other vital goals: a stronger economy, better transport, good schools and crime prevention.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Walter Bagehot, the great Victorian editor of <i>The Economist</i>, declared at the outset of his classic text "The English Constitution": "Every constitution must first gain authority, and then use authority." It must, he went on, "first win the confidence and loyalty of mankind, and then employ that homage in the work of government." These are wise words, and they summarise very well my approach to constitutional reform (or democratic renewal, as I prefer to call it).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Changing the way we govern, and not just changing our government, is no longer an optional extra for Britain. So low is popular esteem for politicians and the system we operate that there is now little authority for us to use unless and until we first succeed in regaining it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For three decades the standing of Britain's constitution has been declining. Barely a third of the people now declare themselves satisfied with their system of government. Parliament's very <i>raison d' &ecirc; tre</i> is to express and redress popular grievances. When it has itself become the focus of those grievances, it is obliged to act.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We do not need to exaggerate to make the case. Britain is not recovering from war-time defeat or social collapse, nor is it tainted by totalitarianism. We are not faced with the necessity of building a new constitution from scratch, as for example was post-war Germany.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain is, however, struggling to find its way after the collapse of the grand 20th century ideologies of left and right. These too often placed ends above means, grand projects of social or economic reconstruction above the democratic requirement for consent, self-government and respect for rights. The result has been 80 years since the first world war of a steady accretion of power to ministers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New Labour's aim is a partnership between people and politicians based on trust, honesty and a realistic assessment on both sides as to what government can deliver.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The challenge facing us is that which confronted the Victorian reformers in the last century who, almost uniquely, gave Britain democracy without revolution. It is to take a working constitution, respect its strengths, and adapt it to modern demands for clean and effective government while at the same time providing a greater democratic role for the people at large.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour's programme for democratic renewal is threefold: to strengthen the rights and obligations of citizens; to take decision-making closer to the people; and to improve the democratic credentials of Westminster.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Democracy can flourish only as part of a rich culture of rights respected and duties performed. Most of these rights and duties relate to community life beyond the sway of the politician or the ordinary scope of the courts. But the duty of the state's constitution to safeguard freedoms, and encourage the performance of duties, remains profound.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British state presently does too little on these counts. Basic rights, to information, legal equality, due process and security of property, are too often flouted. And little attempt is made to encourage people to take more than a cursory part in their own governance. The idea that the people at large might play a greater political role is instinctively alarming to many in the elite for its implication of greater "direct democracy." It ought, instead, to be seen as critical to developing a richer notion of democratic citizenship.
</p><p><b>Tory Bourbons</b>
<br>The case for a freedom of information act and the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law is now generally agreed outside the Conservative Party and even by some within it. The onus must always be on public authorities to explain why citizens should not have access to information and not vice versa. Britain already has a <i>de facto</i> bill of rights through its ratification of the European Convention underpinned by a court in Strasbourg which delivers more hostile judgments against Britain than any other state. Only the strange mentality of the modern Tory Bourbons could think it satisfactory to force British citizens to go to France to enforce their rights because their own courts are incapable of doing so.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More information and guaranteed rights are only two means of achieving far broader democratic objectives. Greater use of referendums is another, to give citizens a veto over proposals to change their system of government, and to give legitimacy to the changes to which they do agree. Other democratic innovations, such as citizens' juries, are being piloted with some success to assist decision-making in the <font size=-1>NHS</font> and local government. Informed public participation is the key, complementing not replacing established decision-making by elected representatives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most political decisions of concern to citizens affect their immediate locality. The revival of local government must be the prime means for achieving the second objective of taking government closer to the people. Local government's democratic voice needs strengthening, by establishing a closer engagement between local authorities and their electors. This is why I am so strongly attached to the principle of elected mayors for London and our leading cities--generating local chief executives with a direct mandate, able to mobilise their communities behind urban renewal as mayors across Europe and the United States do.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Strengthening the intermediate tier between London and the localities is also necessary. Here again our agenda is one of sensible, incremental change to meet modern democratic demands.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Scottish Office was established as long ago as 1885 to provide a Scottish dimension to administration north of the border. But it is Westminster-controlled and Westminster-oriented. The Scottish people rightly insist on something more democratic, in the form of a Scottish parliament with legislative powers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tories claim that this would threaten the unity of the United Kingdom, yet they rightly consider their proposals for devolved government in Northern Ireland as perfectly compatible with the union. Their opposition to our decentralisation plans ignores the wisdom of the ages, as well as concrete experience in other countries. As William Gladstone, the Victorian prime minister, said: "The concession of local self-government is not the way to sap or impair, but the way to strengthen and consolidate unity."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Precisely this rationale has led every other large European democracy, including France and Spain with centralising traditions as strong as Britain's, to create a regional tier between central government and local authorities. Spain, for example, has met regional aspirations of varying strengths by adopting a rolling programme of devolution, across a lengthy timespan, in line with the flow of popular sentiment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We are proposing a similarly refined approach for the United Kingdom. Scotland with its distinct national, legal and cultural institutions is manifestly in a class of its own. Even the current secretary of state for Scotland, Michael Forsyth, concedes that once a Scottish parliament is established, it will be here to stay. In their own separate ways, Wales and London also have powerful claims to--and their people want--their own authorities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Across the rest of England, popular enthusiasm for a regional political voice varies greatly. Our policy reflects this, allowing greater regional government as people demand it. In the north-east and north-west demand for greater powers is strong. In other places, there is less demand. So be it.
</p><p><b>Shaking up Westminster</b>
<br>Westminster has for too long insulated itself from change while imposing it on everyone else. Here again, Labour must settle some important unfinished business from a century ago, starting with the House of Lords. It delights and astonishes me that we are about to fight an election in which the Tories will be defending the right of ancestral dukes, marquesses, earls and barons to make the law in a modern democracy. And this in a society which John Major claims he wants to make "classless"!
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour will remove the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the Lords and introduce a more open system for nominating life peers. We will consult widely about an appropriate second-stage reform, but we should be clear that removing the absurdity of the hereditary element will be a huge step forward in itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Effective democracy depends, above all, on the quality of the House of Commons. Electoral reform for the Commons has a totemic status among some of Britain's constitutional reformers. I appreciate the reasons for this, not least 17 years of "elective dictatorship" by Tory governments returned on minority votes, pushing through divisive and destructive policies such as the poll tax and rail privatisation, which is why I have confirmed John Smith's pledge to hold a referendum on the issue.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, I personally remain unpersuaded that proportional representation would be beneficial for the Commons. It is not, as some claim, a simple question of moving from an "unfair" to a "fair" voting system. An electoral system must meet two democratic tests: it needs to reflect opinion, but it must also aggregate opinion without giving disproportionate influence to splinter groups. Aggregation is particularly important for a parliament whose job is to create and sustain a single, mainstream government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever the electoral system may be, something has to be done about the House of Commons itself, which, to more and more voters, seems arcane and ineffective, or worse. We need to improve the way we scrutinise and debate legislation, how <font size=-1>MP</font>s hold the executive to account, how we organise the legislative programme and how we deal with European legislation.
</p><p><b>Opponents of reform</b>
<br>Opposition to Labour's plans for constitutional modernisation come from two camps. The first group are opponents of principle. They are against any tampering with Britain's "perfect" constitution. The second group are tactical opponents. Though not against reform, either they believe that it is a distraction from the "serious" business of reducing unemployment, improving education and such like, or they recoil from the parliamentary battles required to enact constitutional reforms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first camp, led by John Major, is intellectually barren. For Mr Major, whatever is is best, from hereditary peers to the unaccountable quangocracy. Nothing like this has been heard since the Duke of Wellington thundered in defence of pocket boroughs and electoral corruption in 1830.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Major's position is more extreme than that of his predecessors. Although the Tories opposed most of the big constitutional reforms of the past two centuries, no previous Tory leader since Wellington refused to countenance<i> any</i> democratic reform. Balfour favoured radical reform of the Lords as long ago as 1911. Even Lady Thatcher once proposed all-party talks on a bill of rights. Ted Heath and Alec Douglas-Home were once supporters of Scottish devolution. London's elected authority was established by a Tory government (in 1889), together with the national system of county councils.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In truth, as Mr Major's more sophisticated predecessors recognised, the undoubted strengths of the constitution are the fruit of deliberate reform in centuries past. Its growing weaknesses need to be tackled in the same way. Renovation, as any disciple of Edmund Burke knows, is a prime means of conservation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tory opponents of change are also fatally inconsistent. They themselves have carried through far-reaching constitutional changes in the past 18 years, although in ways that have made Britain less democratic rather than more.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The balance of power between local and central government has radically shifted in favour of the latter. The Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty extended the powers of the <font size=-1>EU</font>. And the Major administration itself promises significant constitutional re-engineering, including an elected assembly in Northern Ireland (without any cut in the number of Northern Ireland <font size=-1>MP</font>s, or any brouhaha about a "West Belfast question").
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our unwritten constitution has its vices. But its virtue is that it does not require neat solutions. It can cope with the diversity of the United Kingdom, the specificities of its nations and regions. The union that makes up the <font size=-1>UK</font> is a partnership based on give and take to the benefit of all. By respecting the differences of tradition, culture and institutions, we strengthen the union rather than weaken it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more plausible critique of what we are proposing--and it is heard from some who count as supporters of New Labour--is that this programme is a distraction. Labour governments, they say, should be concerned with delivering jobs, growth and economic equality, not with airy-fairy notions such as democracy and participation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is historically unfounded. The role of left-of-centre parties around the world and down the ages has been to extend democratic power, while the right has struggled to reduce it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But in any case economic reconstructions and democratic renovation are not alternatives. They go in tandem. To take a historical analogy, extending the vote to the middle and working classes was not an alternative to making Britain the workshop of the world in the last century. It was only by incorporating and empowering the people who made it such that their energies and skill could be fully harnessed to the task of modernisation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain's constitutional exceptionalism would be tolerable if experience suggested it yielded social progress and economic success. The evidence points the other way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, there are those who argue that the path to constitutional reform is strewn with good intentions but failed plans. They remember the unsuccessful struggles of Harold Wilson's 1966-70 Labour government with House of Lords reform, and of Jim Callaghan's 1976-79 Labour government with devolution, and are overcome by an understandable faintheartedness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Constitutional change can, I accept, be a fraught endeavour. In the end it is a question of political will, parliamentary skill and eventually popular support.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And in this regard, history is a poor teacher. Times have changed. Constitutional issues are now at the heart of political debate. We gauge that constitutional conservatism is dying and that popular support for change is tangible and steadfast. As important, we are prepared this time to put that judgment to the test by laying our most important proposals to the test of popular endorsement through referendums. We will seek a specific mandate from the Scottish people for the creation of a parliament, and for its tax-varying powers. We will set up regional government only where people vote for it. We will give the people the ultimate say on the system by which they elect their representatives at Westminster. Despite the initial concern these commitments sparked within the Labour Party, I am convinced that they are essential to ensuring that constitutional reform does not run ahead of public opinion. That would be fatal to it.

</p><p><b>Democratic renewal</b>
<br>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a widespread perception that the right was "winning the argument" on the central economic issues of the day. Now the economic argument has changed, with Labour advocating long-term investment--above all in education--reform of welfare and leadership by Britain in Europe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If I am not mistaken, in the mid-1990s, another perception is taking hold: that the centre-left is "winning the argument" on constitutional matters. Mr Major in his bunker reminds me of those Labour die-hards who went on arguing for nationalisation and statism long after their irrelevance was plain to the rest of the world.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We shall fight the general election <i>inter alia </i>on democratic renewal. More important still, with the support of the people we shall deliver what we promise on democratic renewal as an essential element in our project: the modernisation of Britain.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<p><b>Advertising</b></p>
<h1>Too many puffs</h1>


<p>THE Advertising Standards Authority (<font size=-1>ASA</font>) may be, in the words of its own code, "decent, legal, honest and truthful", but is it effective? For years the self-regulatory body, which is financed entirely by the advertising industry, excited little controversy. More recently, however, it has been running into trouble. Complaints to the authority have risen by nearly a third at a time when its rulings are increasingly under attack from both advertisers and the public.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Politicians appear to have little respect for the authority. The Conservative Party openly defied the <font size=-1>ASA</font> over its judgment that the party's poster featuring Tony Blair with demonic red eyes was a breach of the code. "We are totally unrepentant," said a senior Tory official. Labour seems no happier with the <font size=-1>ASA</font>. Nigel Griffiths, its consumer affairs spokesman, says the <font size=-1>ASA</font> reacts too slowly to complaints. By the time it issues an adjudication the advertising campaigns have already finished, he argues.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Doubts over the authority's competence are not confined to politicians. Pressure groups such as Friends of the Earth, whose advertisements have been the subject of adverse rulings, often claim the authority is unprofessional and poorly informed. Others, such as Action on Smoking and Health, dismiss it as "weak and ineffective".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>ASA</font> also sometimes seems to be out of touch with public opinion. It recently rejected complaints about a Gossard bra poster featuring a semi-naked model reclining invitingly in a haystack accompanied by the slogan: "Who said a woman can't get pleasure from something soft?" The decision has provoked a storm of protest from women's groups. The authority ruled the advertisement's innuendo was acceptable on the grounds that parents could truthfully tell their children that the poster was praising the bra's qualities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some such controversies, especially on matters concerning public taste, are inevitable. And the very nature of its task means that the authority can never please everyone. But charges of incompetence are more serious. This is the kind of criticism which the authority is now facing from food firms and anti-smoking groups over its handling of an advertisement run earlier this year by Philip Morris, a cigarette company.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The advertisement suggested the health risk from passive smoking was less than eating one biscuit a day. <i>The Economist </i>has learned that the authority provisionally decided that the advertisement was unacceptable because it gave a "misleading impression" of comparative risk but then, only after representations from the company, decided to seek independent advice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Complaints about the advertisement were first made in June. But it was not until the middle of August that the <font size=-1>ASA</font> decided that it needed independent scientific advice, something which should have been obvious at the outset. By the time the <font size=-1>ASA</font>'s council finally rules on the complaint on September 13th, Philip Morris will have long since ceased running the advert. In France, by contrast, the courts ordered the company to call an immediate halt to a similar campaign and it is now also facing an action for damages.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The French approach risks state censorship and assumes that consumers are too stupid to make up their own minds. Self-regulation, or no regulation at all, makes better sense. But if self-regulation is chosen, there is not much point to it being done incompetently.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>ASA</font> should not have needed three months to judge whether this advertisement was misleading. Had it sought advice earlier, it would have quickly learned there is plenty of evidence available on which to judge the relative risks of eating fat-laden biscuits and passive smoking. Numerous studies have examined the fat issue. And as long ago as 1988 a government-appointed commission reported on the risks of passive smoking. Since then, the Royal College of Physicians has done a similar study.

<p><b>Teaching</b></p>
<h1>A shortage of sirs</h1>

<p>TRYING to teach quadratic equations to a bunch of unruly teenagers is hardly the cushiest of jobs. So as unemployment continues to fall, it is not surprising that teacher-training colleges are finding it hard to recruit prospective maths teachers. But there are growing worries that the supply of teachers may be dwindling just as the number of school-age children is growing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government asked teacher-training colleges in England and Wales to recruit about 2,000 people to train as maths teachers this autumn. John Howson of Brookes University in Oxford, who has just been appointed as the government's adviser on the supply of teachers, reckons they will end up with only 1,500, a shortfall of 25%. He also predicts shortfalls in other secondary-school subjects: 15% in science and 10% in languages. So far, though, there is no lack of people wanting to become primary-school teachers or to teach history or games.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government wants to expand the number of places at teacher-training colleges by about 30% over the next five years. This is partly because the number of pupils is expected to rise during that period from 9.5m to about 10m. But it is also because more than half of all teachers are over 40, and increasing numbers are leaving the profession well before retirement. According to official figures, a minuscule 0.4% of teachers' jobs are unfilled. In fact, Mr Howson says, these figures understate the problem of shortages: by January, when they are collected, many schools have decided to make do with whatever staff they can get, whether or not they are qualified in the subject they are teaching.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An official survey of 1,615 students who received a postgraduate certificate in teaching in 1995 gives further cause for concern about the quality as well as the quantity of trainee teachers: 88% of them had earned only a "pass" in their first degree (ie, lower than a third-class degree).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It seems to be mainly men who are turning away from teaching. In primary schools, the proportion of female teachers has risen from 78% in 1980 to 83% now. Last year, for the first time, there were more women than men teaching in secondary schools. The government is worried about one possible consequence: that, with fewer male teachers around, many boys--particularly those brought up only by their mother--are not encountering "positive role-models" during their formative years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Teaching is not the best-paid job, especially for those with degrees in maths and science. But it is not badly paid either. Between 1980 and 1992, teachers' pay grew faster than that of nurses, hospital doctors, police officers and most other non-manual workers, although their pay has been squeezed slightly since. Mary Russell, secretary of the Universities Council for the Education of Teachers, says that it is not starting salaries (at least &#163;12,400 a year) nor the pay of head teachers (up to &#163;55,600 a year) that pose the problem: it is a lack of mid-level jobs which discourages people from joining and staying in the profession.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So there may be something in Labour's proposal that a new breed of higher-paid "superteachers" be created. As well as continuing to teach, they would act as mentors to other, less-experienced staff. The government's Teacher Training Agency is looking at similar proposals. But the national teachers' pay agreement already gives schools a fair amount of leeway: for teachers with ten years' experience, their basic pay of &#163;21,000 a year can be increased by up to &#163;4,400 to reward excellence or to retain staff in subjects where there is a shortage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to Mr Howson, the key to avoiding a serious shortage of teachers is to improve the battered image of teaching which, he feels, is more of an obstacle to recruiting and retaining teachers than pay. Many teachers blame politicians and school inspectors for their profession's poor image. The politicians and inspectors rightly reply that improving standards is the best way to raise any profession's prestige, including that of teachers.

<p><b>Medical science</b></p>
<h1>Partying post-op</h1>

<font size=1>GLASGOW</font>
<p>COMPANIES that announce breakthroughs in medical science usually get a hero's welcome. But whereas surgeons applauded when Health Care International (<font size=-1>HCI</font>), a private hospital, announced this month that one of its doctors had invented an anaesthetic machine which means people feel much less sick after operations and speeds their recovery, reaction in Scotland was less than ecstatic.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1994, <font size=-1>HCI</font> opened a swanky 240-bed private hospital to do expensive surgery on rich foreigners at Clydebank in Glasgow. Though it promised hundreds of jobs in an area of long dole queues, it went straight to the top of the local hate list. In an area which prides itself on being the cradle of socialism a century ago, it was regarded as an evil changeling, not least because the Tory government had promised a &#163;30m grant to help build it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The critics felt themselves thoroughly justified when, four months after it had opened, <font size=-1>HCI</font> went bust because its forecasts of patient numbers had been hopelessly optimistic. The Abu Dhabi Investment Company bought the bankrupt business, saving the government some embarrassment, although this did little to change local opinion, which regards it as a parasite on the National Health Service.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This view might also have been thought by critics to be justified when Gavin Kenny, a professor of anaesthesia at Glasgow University, shifted his research team from Glasgow Royal Infirmary to <font size=-1>HCI</font>, lured by lavish facilities. But Mr Kenny's move speeded up work on a machine which uses micro-computers to control the rate at which an anaesthetic is pumped into the blood of patients undergoing surgery.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such machines are nothing new. But Mr Kenny's device uses two micro-computers to achieve much closer monitoring of the pump feeding the anaesthetic into the patient. Extensive testing of the equipment has sufficiently impressed the authorities which regulate medical equipment in Britain and, so far, four other countries, to make this the first such machine to be licenced for commercial sale to hospitals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The anaesthetic used by Mr Kenny's machine is propofol, which has been in use for about ten years. It reduces the sickness felt by patients after they wake up from an operation. However, difficulties in controlling the dosage have always meant that anaesthetists have also had to rely on anaesthetic gases breathed in through a face mask. These gases cause post-operative nausea in about half of all patients. Mr Kenny's machine reduces or eliminates the need for such gases. Tests at <font size=-1>HCI</font>, which is using Mr Kenny's machine on all its patients, and at other hospitals show that the machine cuts the proportion of patients suffering nausea to less than 10%. So most patients thus treated recover from the anaesthetic in hours rather than days, says Mr Kenny.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anaesthetists who have either tried the machine, or seen it demonstrated at medical conferences, are enthusiastic. So are hospital administrators. Mr Kenny says that studies in America have shown that, although the drug costs about $14 (&#163;9) more per operation than conventional drugs, faster patient recovery time can save about $400 per patient. The British makers of the computer-controlled pump say they will cost about &#163;1,500, not much more than conventional anaesthetic pumps. Use of it was authorised only in August, but they already have orders for 400.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Edinburgh house in which Sir James Young Simpson, another Scottish doctor, discovered the first modern anaesthetic, chloroform, in 1846 has a commemorative plaque on it. Mr Kenny may eventually be as esteemed as Sir James. But whether his innovation encourages the Scots to pay more regard to <font size=-1>HCI</font> remains to be seen.

<h1>Sega's sonic hedge</h1>
<p>
SEGA ENTERPRISES, the Japanese firm that created Sonic the Hedgehog, is feeling prickly. The home video-games market, which turned Sega and its charmless mascot into household names, has been in the doldrums for three years, with sinking demand and a nasty price war. Worse, Sega appears to be on the losing side: revenues from its consumer sales are expected to be only &#165;114 billion ($1.05 billion) this year, down from &#165;301 billion in 1993, according to Morgan Stanley, an investment bank.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sega's attempts to revive its fortunes in the home rested on the Saturn, a fancy video-games machine it released last year. Unfortunately the PlayStation, a machine made by Sony, has proved much more popular in Europe and the United States. Now Sega's old rival, Nintendo, has launched an even fancier machine, the Nintendo 64. It looks set to knock Saturn for six in Japan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Game over? Not quite. More than half of Sega's &#165;384 billion in total revenues come from two other markets: coin-operated arcade games and amusement centres. The first is doing well enough--Sega has about half the market--and Morgan Stanley reckons it will bring in &#165;114 billion this year. But it is the amusement centres that currently excite Sega executives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On September 7th the firm launched Segaworld, a joint venture with Trocadero, owners of the eponymous building in London's touristy Leicester Square. Sega grandly calls Segaworld a "theme park for the 21st century" , but in reality it is a vast (110,000 sqare feet or 10,220 square metres) video-game arcade.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At around &#163;50m ($78m), Segaworld cost far more than the average games centre. But it charges far more, too. Segaworld expects 1.75m people, each paying an admission charge of between &#163;9 and &#163;12, to pass through its doors in the first year. When inside, Segaworld's six flagship interactive rides are free, but the coin-operated machines are not. The company reckons that each visitor will spend &#163;15 (including admission), bringing in a handy &#163;26m in the first year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While this will hardly make up for Sega's losses in the game-machines business in the immediate future, the firm thinks it might do so in the long run. It plans to launch dozens of these mega-arcade centres, the next in Sydney later this year. It already runs two similar centres, revoltingly called Joypolises, in Japan. Yasuo Tazoe, Sega's head of amusement theme parks, reckons that the company's parks might ultimately bring in &#165;200 billion annually in the Japanese market alone. Rather than earning just a series of one-off revenues from selling coin-operating machines, Sega should earn a steady cash stream, from per-use fees on the machines as well as admission fees.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Elsewhere, the spoils could be even bigger: in America alone the theme-park business was worth $12 billion in 1994. A lone hedgehog may not look like much next to Disney's beloved menagerie, but Mickey doesn't surf.

<h1>Karl Kehrle</h1>

THE achievement of Karl Kehrle, a Benedictine monk, was to breed a very decent British bee. Wherever in the world apiarists meet they speak in awe of Mr Kehrle's sturdy bee, which produces lots of honey and is reluctant to sting. Like the British themselves, it is a mongrel, combining the virtues of the native bee with those of worthy bees from elsewhere. Mr Kehrle once heard of a promising bee said to be found only in central Africa. Although in his 80s, in poor health and carried on the back of a friend, he tracked the bee down on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Selective breeding has been going on in a random way for thousands of years since animals and plants were first domesticated. Gregor Mendel (1822-84), like Mr Kehrle a monk, laid the foundations of what has come to be called genetics. Mendel did clever things with garden peas, but had no success with bees, whose sexual practices remained a mystery to him. Queen bees, it is now known, mate with a drone, or several drones, while on the wing. Then, loaded with sperm, they return to the hive for several years, producing huge numbers of bees. Mr Kehrle pioneered artificial insemination for bees, impregnating his queens with the sperm of immigrant bees. "A very delicate operation," remarked a colleague of Mr Kehrle.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His Buckfast bee, named after the abbey in Devon where Mr Kehrle was a monk, became an unusual export, earning many thousands of pounds for the order. Numerous Buckfast bees have been imported by commercial honey producers in the United States, where disease has caused widespread damage. (The Benedictines, a fairly liberal order, have a talent for making money: their abbey in northern France makes a liqueur, much in demand despite being too sweet for some tastes.) Mr Kehrle became a celebrity within the bee world, lecturing here, picking up an honorary doctorate there, written up in bee journals, made a vice-president of Britain's International Bee Research Association. A species of bee was named after him. It wasn't a bad career for someone who, as he occasionally remarked, had no formal education at all.
</p><p><b>The Italian clue</b></b>
<br>Karl Kehrle was born in Germany. His mother, a keen Roman Catholic, heard that the monks rebuilding their abbey at Buckfast, shut down in the reign of Henry VIII, needed workers. So Karl, not quite 12, was sent to England. He wasn't strong enough to lift stones, so he helped with the bees. By 1919, aged 21 and now a monk named Brother Adam, he was the abbey's master beekeeper. He set out to save the native British bee, which was being wiped out by a disease called acarine. He cross-bred Italian bees, which were free of acarine, with some of the abbey's bees that had eluded the disease. The cross-breeding was a process that was continued under Mr Kehrle over subsequent years with the help of other foreign bees.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some bee people, while admiring Mr Kehrle's skill as a beekeeper, note that his innovations owed much to the work of Ludwig Armbruster, a fellow German (later a victim of the Nazis), who, following up the work of Mendel, published research on bees and genetics. Mr Kehrle was, by contrast, a hands-on, practical man. But this was no bad thing. Someone has to turn theory into practice. He was unsurpassed as a breeder of bees. He talked to them, he stroked them. He brought to the hives a calmness that, according to those who saw him at work, the sensitive bees responded to. He was very upset when two of the abbey's queen bees were stolen, and remarked on the frailty of humans. Bees, he said, would never behave like people. "He loved the bees almost as much as he loved God," said a colleague.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A mischievous comment, perhaps. Yet even in the brotherly community of an abbey little jealousies can arise over a colleague who seems to have got more than his fair share of attention. In 1991 Mr Kehrle asked the abbey to provide him with a qualified assistant to help with research into the varroa parasite, which, like the acarine disease of the 1920s, is threatening British bees, and is at present controlled, although only partially, by chemicals. The abbot turned down the request, and apparently felt that, after 80 years at the abbey, it was time for Brother Adam to part from his bees and spend the remainder of his life on monkish duties. "I am sure that he would consider himself a monk first and a beekeeper second," said the abbot, not entirely convincingly. Mr Kehrle handed over his hives to young monks, but was never unwilling to give advice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He said he wanted to live to 100. The astonishing thing is that he lived as long as he did. Physically, he was not strong. His journeys abroad in search of bees, often partly on foot or by donkey, were exhausting. He suffered several heart attacks. Doctors routinely told him he would never work again. Several times he received the last rites of his religion, but clambered from his bed to see how his bees were managing without him. If an interest in life can keep you going, it certainly worked with Karl Kehrle.</td></tr></table>

<h1><center>Saddamned</center></h1>

GIVE Saddam Hussein a glimpse of weakness and he will exploit it. By sending his tanks to help one Kurdish faction against another, he was not transgressing the letter of the international rules that tie him down. The spirit is something else. Mr Hussein was testing the boundaries, reinserting his armed fist--albeit by invitation--into the bit of Iraq that is forbidden to him. Had he met no resistance from the Americans, who hold the key to his chains, he might have construed inaction as a cue for escape.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bill Clinton gave him no chance to make that mistake. That is why America's cruise-missile attacks this week were justified: Mr Hussein's record for trickery and brutality means he should never be given the benefit of any doubt. But while these raids were the right answer to the immediate question, it would be a mistake to imagine that they make the bigger problem of how to live with Saddam any easier.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The legal basis for the raids was shaky. Yet when it comes to dealing with a proven international menace like Mr Hussein, law may sometimes have to yield to power. Too bad, therefore, if <font size=-1>UN</font> resolutions could not honestly be cited to justify America's strikes. Anyway, Mr Hussein must have known that Mr Clinton would retaliate. He has done so before after Iraqi misdemeanours, and it was unthinkable that, only two months before a president hopes to be re-elected, he would do nothing this time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The raids on Tuesday and Wednesday morning destroyed Mr Hussein's air defences in southern Iraq, thus clearing the way for American, British and French aircraft to patrol an extended no-fly zone, reaching almost to Baghdad's southern suburbs (see <a href="ir1.html">page</a>). This zone--which, incidentally, has never received official <font size=-1>UN</font> blessing--was first applied to northern Iraq to protect the fleeing Kurds from Mr Hussein's vengeance, later to the south to protect Shia Muslim dissidents. The rules are not Saddam-proof. But the patrolling aircraft keep an eye on things, ensuring that the dictator cannot do anything really dreadful, at least without being spotted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Iraq's 3.2m Kurds do pretty dreadful things to each other without any help from Mr Hussein. They exist in limbo, their land is split between two warring factions and they are crudely exploited by neighbouring states. Both Turkey and, more recently, Iran have launched violent raids across the border in pursuit of their own Kurdish dissidents. The latest Iranian incursions--about which the world only tut-tutted--ended in some kind of informal (and denied) alliance between the government in Tehran and one of the factions. This led the other faction to turn to Mr Hussein. He, leaping at the chance to return to forbidden territory, sent his tanks to dislodge the first faction from Arbil, the regional capital.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the Kurds' interests are no longer being spoken of by the Americans as their central concern. Rather, the Americans are now talking about the defence of the oil-producing countries that lie south of Iraq. In retaliating against Mr Hussein, they say, their choice of target--Iraq's southern air defences--was to protect an endangered region. This raises echoes of the Gulf war. In 1990 Iraq was palpably a danger to its neighbours, gobbling up one of the richest of them. But the concerns that held the Gulf-war coalition together have faded, and Iraq is much weaker, militarily, today than it was then. Certainly, the missile raids have been tepidly, or even critically, received by America's allies: only Britain, Germany, Japan, Canada, Israel and Kuwait have backed them. The first attempts by America and Britain to get a resolution deploring Iraq's incursion through the <font size=-1>UN</font> Security Council this week met with stiff resistance from the three other permanent members, France, Russia and China, and had to be tempered.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, the other Arab oil-producers, fervently anti-Iraq in 1990 and still no friends to Mr Hussein, now tend to be more worried about the mullahs in Iran--or about their own people, angered by a superpower bashing an Arab leader. With little direct experience of elections themselves, Arabs interpret America's Middle Eastern policy in exclusively electoral terms. This, they claim, explains why America seizes the chance to be tough on Iraq while shrinking from telling Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, to accept his country's commitments towards the Palestinians. Such cynics take it for granted that no vigorous American pressure will be put on Israel until after November--if at all.

</p><p><b>Be charitable, and vigilant</b>
<br>America cannot ignore such views, even if it disagrees with them. So far, this episode has not shown the Iraqi at his most wicked. If he responds as belligerently as he promises to, that judgment may change, but in this instance he has not yet shown himself bent on some evil purpose beyond his borders. That is why the response should remain proportionate. In particular, America should not join Mr Hussein in his disregard for his people. His latest adventure has imperilled the implementation of the oil-for-food deal which could save the lives of thousands of Iraqis now dying from malnourishment and lack of medicine. The deal is on hold at least until the country is safe for the <font size=-1>UN</font> monitors who will supervise it. America has now indicated that it will block it, reviewing yet again the laboriously negotiated monitoring arrangements. It should not: the further punishment of Iraqi civilians will not put an end to Mr Hussein's rule.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the other hand, the efforts of the outside world, through the <font size=-1>UN</font>, to prevent Iraq getting biological, gas or nuclear weapons, or the means to deliver them, must remain as relentless as ever. The West long ago decided it would not, or could not, deliver Iraqis from their tormentor. It will not do so now. It must, however, ensure that he never again menaces anyone else. For though he may be no immediate threat to his neighbours today, he remains a potential threat to everyone as long as he is in power. If the world is to live with him, it must never relax its efforts to confine his tyranny to Iraq, and to minimise it even there.

<p><h2>Iraq and America</h2></p>
<p><p>
<p><b>Iraq</b> sent its army into the northern autonomous enclave at the invitation of one Kurdish faction to displace a rival faction from Arbil, the Kurdish capital. In response, the Americans launched cruise missile raids against air defences in southern Iraq, and extended the southern no-fly zone almost to the outskirts of Baghdad. Britain backed the strikes, France and Russia disapproved.
<p>After long haggling and under American and Egyptian pressure, Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, met the Palestinians' Yasser Arafat, a thing he once said he would not do. The two agreed to continue the<b> peace process</b>. But Mr Netanyahu refused to set a date for Israel's overdue redeployment of troops in Hebron.
<p>Hutu rebels attacked government garrisons in northern <b>Burundi</b> and shelled the capital, Bujumbura. They hope to bring down the government of Major Pierre Buyoya, who seized power in July.
<p>Good news from <b>South Africa</b>: Nelson Mandela and Gra&ccedil;a Machel, widow of a former president of Mozambique, are a couple; it's official. But no marriage plans yet. Bad news: Bantu Holomisa, a former deputy minister, was expelled from the <font size=-1>ANC</font> for accusing a senior party member of taking bribes.
<p><b>Zimbabwe</b>'s civil servants ended a fortnight-long strike, after the government, already driven to offer a 20% pay rise, agreed to reinstate those it had sacked.</p>
<p><h2>Chechen peace?</h2></p>
<p><p>President Yeltsin's defence adviser, <b>Alexander Lebed</b>, signed a peace deal with the separatist Chechens' guerrilla commander, Aslan Maskhadov, that postpones a final decision on the breakaway republic's constitutional status for five years. But Mr Yeltsin, who is said this week to have agreed to a heart operation, has not yet backed the deal.
<p>In the first of a series of important <b>regional elections</b> in Russia, Dmitri Ayatskov, a technocrat with no formal party affiliation, was elected chief of the region of Saratov with 80% of the vote. This was a blow for the Communists, whose presidential candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, carried the province in July.
<p><b>Bernard Tapie</b>, a colourful and controversial French businessman-cum-politician convicted of fraud, said he would give up his seat in the National Assembly, but for the time being he is hanging on to his membership of the European Parliament.
<p>The European Parliament began to examine charges that the European Commission tried to suppress investigations into links between <font size=-1>BSE</font>, or <b>mad-cow disease</b>, and a similar disease in people. In a letter leaked to a French newspaper, a top farm Eurocrat discouraged a colleague's request for an investigation, saying that "all discussions on <font size=-1>BSE</font> inevitably cause problems in the beef market."
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Ethnic Albanians in <b>Kosovo</b>, a province of Serbia, agreed to end their six-year boycott of Serbian schools. This may pave the way for an accord on the future of the province.
<p><b>Finland's government </b>said it would cut spending by 5% in real terms next year to 191 billion markkas ($42 billion) in order to meet the criteria for joining Europe's economic and monetary union.
<p>More than 2,000 <b>unidentified corpses </b>have been found dumped in Moscow Region this year, <font size=-1>2X2</font> television reported, quoting an official.</p>
<p><h2>Ever onwards</h2></p>
<p><p>The American election campaign kicked off in earnest. <b>Bill Clinton </b>shrugged off the resignation of Dick Morris, his chief campaign strategist, over a sex scandal and, aided by his forceful actions in the Gulf, regained his 20-plus-point lead over Bob Dole.
<p><b>Colombia </b>was shaken by guerrilla attacks in which nearly 80 people died. One army post was overrun, leaving more than 30 soldiers dead and many more than that in rebel hands. The guerrillas, active for decades but not on this scale, combine claims of left-wing politics with real-world kidnapping, sabotage of oil pipelines, and drug-running.
<p>In <b>Mexico</b>, a little-heard-of new "People's Revolutionary Army" launched attacks in several states, killing more than 15 people. The Zapatist rebel movement told the newcomers to stay off its
<p>Chiapas turf, but broke off talks with the government, to prove its own revolutionary credentials.</p>
<p><h2>Identity crisis</h2></p>
<p><p>Japan and China are in dispute over eight <b>uninhabited islands</b>, called the Senkakus (in Japanese) and the Diaoyu (in Chinese). Indonesia conducted a big military exercise around its Natuna islands, where it is engaged in a $36 billion joint venture to develop natural-gas fields.
<p>Hong Kong's chief justice, Sir Ti Liang Yang, became the latest candidate for the job of <b>chief executive </b>after the British colony is returned to China next July. Separately, China agreed that its representative would shake the hand of Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last governor, at the handover ceremony in 1997. The British were relieved.
<p>Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's former prime minister, said in Beijing that <b>China </b>would suffer "political and economic costs" if it mishandled the reunification of Hong Kong or Taiwan. China should give Hong Kong dissidents "time to adjust" to the transfer of power, he said.
<p>About 13m Japanese took part in an exercise designed to limit casualties in<b> earthquakes</b>. Japan experiences a tremor nearly every day.
<p>A species of <b>pheasant</b>, thought to be extinct and last seen in 1928, has been rediscovered in Vietnam.

<p><h2>Ciao, Carlo</h2>
<p><p>After 18 years in control, <b>Carlo De Benedetti</b> quit as chairman of Olivetti after pressure from Francesco Caio, the new chief executive, and foreign shareholders underwhelmed by his efforts to turn round the Italian electronics group. Its shares leapt before being suspended after another departing executive said that first half pre-tax losses of 440.2 billion lire ($270.2m) understated the company's true financial plight.
<p>Britain's <b>General Electric</b> pacified angry institutional investors by agreeing to raise the performance targets in a &#163;1.5m ($2.3m) incentive package for George Simpson, its new managing director. <b>Procter &amp; Gamble</b> in America gave John Pepper, its chairman and chief executive for the past (very profitable) year, a package that rose 18% in fiscal 1996 to $2.12m.
<p>Potash Corp of Saskatchewan, a top producer of potash and potassium, agreed to pay $1.2 billion for Arcadian Corp, a big nitrogen producer, beating an offer by Freeport-McMoRan, a New Orleans-based mining company. The deal gives Potash the three ingredients it needs to become the world's biggest integrated producer of <b>fertilisers</b>.
<p>Alcatel Alsthom of France and General Electric of Britain are pondering a merger of their <font size=-1>GEC</font> Alsthom train-making and power-plant joint venture with Framatome, already the world's biggest maker of nuclear-power plants. A merger would create an <b>engineering giant </b>second only to <font size=-1>ABB</font> Asea Brown Boveri, and, through a share swap, take Framatome out of the hands of the French state and into private ownership.</p>
<p><h2>Shored up</h2></p>
<p><p>Deutsche Bank stepped in with &#163;200m ($311m) in cash to restore trading in three investment funds managed by its <b>Morgan Grenfell </b>subsidiary in London. Dealing in the &#163;1.4 billion funds had been halted and a fund manager suspended when Morgan Grenfell found "possible irregularities". Investigators began an inquiry. The revelation came only days after <b>Flemings</b>, an investment banking group, was fined &#163;700,000 by regulators in London and Hong Kong and ordered to pay $19.3m in compensation to investors after one of its fund managers diverted profitable trades to his personal account.
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">table</a>)<br>European <b>business students </b>prefer to work for consultancies, preferably American ones, and preferably multinational.
<p>The British government approved the &#163;3.2 billion ($5 billion) recovery plan by <b>Lloyd's of London</b> in the wake of overwhelming acceptance of it by names, the insurance market's investors, to complete one of the biggest turnarounds in corporate history.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Consolidation among American banks continued apace with the third largest such deal. <b>NationsBank</b> agreed to pay $9.5 billion for <b>Boatmen's Bancshares</b> in a takeover that will create America's fourth-largest banking group. The combine would have
<p>assets of $230 billion and a presence in 16 states, ranging from North Carolina to the mid-west.</p>
<p><h2>Turbulent</h2></p>
<p><p>The Farnborough air show in Britain set the scene for another dash by <b>Boeing and Airbus </b>in the race to develop a super-huge commercial jet. Boeing, which plans to stretch its existing 747 to accommodate 550 or more seats at a cost of $5 billion, reckons developing a new superjet could cost $15 billion; Airbus insists its <font size=-1>A3XX</font> fly for $8 billion. New orders claimed by Boeing at the show amounted to $6.3 billion, by Airbus $3 billion.
<p><b>A&eacute;rospatiale</b> of France became the first of the four Airbus Industrie partners to declare its results from the consortium, which is planning at last to turn itself into a limited company. The French firm made an operating profit from Airbus of FFr1.08 billion ($216m) in 1995, up from FFr734m the year before. A&eacute;rospatiale itself, which declared a big loss in its other businesses in 1995, said it would be well back in profit in 1996, a year ahead of schedule.</p>
<p><h2>The Saddam effect</h2></p>
<p><p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>The <b>price of oil</b> jumped after the United Nations suspended the "oil for food" deal, in which Iraq was to be allowed to sell $2 billion-worth of oil to buy food and other necessities, in the wake of Iraq's attack on the Kurds.
<p>August was Russia's first
<p><b>inflation-free</b> month since the start of economic reforms in 1992. The State Statistics Committee said consumer prices fell 0.2%, mainly because of seasonally cheaper food. Monthly inflation has been falling steadily since January 1995, when it stood at 17.8%.
<p>The European Union may block imports of <b>genetically engineered corn </b>from America over worries about it damaging human and animal health. The maize is designed to be resistant to a crop pest in Europe but contains another gene which some fear could increase resistance to antibiotics in animals that eat it unprocessed.
<p>Moody's Investors Service <b>downgraded Thailand</b> because of the country's reliance on short-term foreign borrowing. Its sovereign short-term debt rating was shaved from Prime-1 to Prime-2.

<h1><center>Monopolies in cyberspace</center></h1>
<p><b>Hands off Microsoft--for now</b></p>

BILL GATES'S Microsoft is one of the world's most innovative companies, his position as the world's richest man well deserved. But any firm that dominates its market as thoroughly as Microsoft dominates software rightly arouses the suspicion of regulators. There has been hardly a week in the past five years when antitrust investigators have not been scrutinising Microsoft. Is it now time for them to act?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason for posing the question anew arises from the difficulties of Netscape. This firm, quicker than Mr Gates to spot the potential of the Internet, has captured about 80% of the market for the "browsers" that guide users through cyberspace. Until recently its success suggested that the software industry was too fast-changing for regulators to understand, or for any one firm to dominate for long. It had once been argued that since Microsoft's Windows operating system (the program that lies between all other software and the computer itself) is installed on most of the world's <font size=-1>PC</font>s, Microsoft would enjoy an unfair advantage in selling its own application programs. But then along came the Internet, and the rules seemed to change. Now there was plenty of room--or so it seemed--for nimble upstarts such as Netscape to catch the giant of software napping.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that the giant has woken up. Netscape achieved its early domination by distributing its browser for free. Though the program now costs $50, its technical superiority and brand name have kept it on top. But the latest version of Microsoft's browser matches Netscape's, feature for feature. Moreover, Microsoft gives its browser away, and has promised that it will always be free: indeed, it plans to eliminate it as a stand-alone product entirely, by making it part of Windows. It is distributing the browser over the Internet, and Mr Gates has arranged deals with most big on-line services and Internet providers to use it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft will probably win this battle, even though it has less than 20% of the market today. The combination of its technical excellence, marketing deals and free distribution will probably be too much for Netscape. If the young software firm cannot find another hit-product its fortunes could plummet as quickly as they rose. So it is hardly surprising that Netscape has now cried "foul", prompting yet another antitrust investigation by America's justice department.

</p><p><b>Microsoft is to be admired, not trusted</b>
<br>Should the trustbusters clamp down? Unless Microsoft is indeed guilty of some of the outright dirty tricks Netscape has accused it of, the answer on balance is no.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It will be a shame to see an innovator such as Netscape go under, if that is what happens, but the job of a trustbuster is not to keep alive plucky firms. It is to protect consumers by ensuring that a market remains competitive enough to spur innovation and keep prices in check.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For now, the software market still passes these tests. It remains relatively easy for new firms to barge into the market, as Netscape itself proved when it grabbed almost all the browser market within a year of its founding. Keen programmers are still coming from nowhere with world-beating programs and growing rich on them. And although a company such as Microsoft possesses huge advantages in marketing and distribution, the Internet has probably made the job of new entrants easier. Word on hot new products spreads quickly in cyberspace, and, if they wish to, technically proficient consumers can download software directly from the Internet into their computers. Another reason for confidence is that Microsoft keeps its operating system "open", making public the codes that enable competitors' applications to run smoothly on Windows.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What, though, if Microsoft chose to abandon this policy? And what about the complaint that Microsoft is, in effect, "dumping" its browser to put its competitor out of business? These are scarier questions. With $7 billion in the bank and ownership of the operating system, Microsoft could probably conquer practically any market if it wanted to badly enough. The justice department needs to intervene the moment it seems that Microsoft's formidable market power is threatening the interests of consumers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is, of course, easier to preach vigilance than to tell regulators how to recognise that moment when it comes. In the browser war, it is market power that threatens to clinch things for Microsoft: the deadliness of its product is not that it is better than Netscape's but that it is free. On the other hand, Microsoft is not yet in a position to foist an inferior or pricier product on consumers without a competitor popping up.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The worry is that this could swiftly change once more of Mr Gates's rivals have disappeared. Microsoft has already picked off rival after rival by making previously stand-alone software products into part-and-parcel of its operating system. Until now, the consumer has not visibly suffered. Just possibly, the simplicity of buying a seamless do-everything operating system from a monopolist is anyway worth more to consumers than they would gain if regulators were, say, to split Microsoft into a maker of operating systems and a maker of applications. But that sort of monopoly would need to be regulated on price. Those who thought the moral of Netscape's rise was that innovation can beat Microsoft can scarcely ignore the moral of the smaller firm's present peril.

<h1>Smashing the lock</h1>


<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><P>

FEW Americans can hate Saddam Hussein more than poor Bob Dole. By inviting American air strikes, Iraq's dictator gave President Clinton a chance to look resolute, and to dispel the idea that a Democrat cannot be trusted with military affairs. On the evening of September 3rd, after Mr Clinton had unleashed the first mini-storm of missiles on Iraq's air defences, an <font size=-1>ABC</font> News poll found that nearly eight in ten Americans approved of the president's action; and that, if it came to full-scale war with Iraq, a majority would choose Mr Clinton to lead it in preference to Mr Dole.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This capped a run of awful news for the Republicans. After their convention in San Diego, the Dole team had been buoyed by polls showing that the gap between their candidate and the president had halved to ten points. Their spirits held up through the Democratic convention. On the last day Mr Clinton gave a disappointing, laundry-list speech; and a sex scandal forced the president's Svengali, Dick Morris, to resign. But, on September 3rd, two new polls put the president's lead back at 21 points (see <a href="am1.gif">map</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more closely Mr Dole examines his predicament, the more hopeless he must feel. A candidate's usual strategy is to focus attention on issues that put him in a better light than his opponent. In Mr Dole's case there are precious few of these. On education and family values, on Medicare and the economy, and even on traditionally Republican strongpoints like crime, taxes and the budget deficit, voters trust Mr Clinton more than Mr Dole, according to polls conducted by Gallup. The Iraqi crisis seems to have robbed Mr Dole of the defence issue, as also of the charge that Mr Clinton tends to avoid a fight. Each new set of encouraging economic figures blunts the appeal of Mr Dole's promise of tax cuts and regulatory reform.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The president's only point of vulnerability is "character". Asked which of the candidates has a higher moral character, voters prefer Mr Dole by a margin of 26 points. But it is peculiarly difficult for the Republicans to turn this fact to their advantage. If Mr Dole seeks to shift attention to Mr Clinton's personal failings, he will be accused of dirty campaigning; and this accusation may sully his own character in the public's eyes. Focus groups show that undecided voters--the ones who determine the outcome of elections--are especially turned off by <i>ad hominem </i>campaigning. It is as though Mr Dole holds a trump that he is not allowed to play.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are still two months to go, time enough for voters to change their minds several times. The televised debates are unlikely to help the tongue-tied Mr Dole. But other things may, notably a set-back for the president's foreign policy in Bosnia or Iraq, or progress (of which, inevitably, there are rumours) towards indicting Hillary Clinton for her alleged role in the Whitewater affair. Yet, barring calamity, the president's lead looks unassailable. He won the election in 1992 with 43% of the vote; this time round, polls predict he will get about 55%. Meanwhile polls give Mr Dole 35% or so; in this century, the lowest winning percentage of the popular vote was Woodrow Wilson's 42% in 1912.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Translated into electoral-college votes, Mr Clinton's lead looks devastating. The map below compiles the latest polls from each state. Some date from before the conventions, so should be treated cautiously; but, given Mr Clinton's continuing lead in national polls, they probably give a fair idea of the voters' mood. Taken together, the state polls (excluding Texas, West Virginia and Vermont) suggest that Mr Clinton would win 417 electoral college votes, compared with 81 for Mr Dole. This would represent more than a resounding victory. It would bury the Republican claim to a "lock" over the electoral college.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This lock is said to consist of the states listed in the tables that accompany the map. The 12 states in the first table have voted for the Republican candidate in all seven presidential contests since 1968. The 12 in the second have done so six out of seven times. Altogether, the 24 states in the lock are worth 238 electoral college votes--just 32 short of the total needed for victory. Given this powerful base, Republican candidates have been able to concentrate their time and advertising dollars on a few swing states: usually the industrial centres around the Great Lakes (Michigan, Illinois and Ohio) and in the north-east (New Jersey, Pennsylvania).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Dole team still talks as if the election will be decided on this traditional battle-ground. The truth is that Mr Dole may be pressed to hold the states in his own base. Of the 24 "lock" states, four are leaning strongly to Mr Clinton, and nine are leaning slightly towards him. And the biggest states are among the likeliest defectors. The 13 in which Mr Clinton now leads account for 176 electoral-college votes, a bit more than two-thirds of the total in the lock.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The biggest defector is California, where the latest poll gives Mr Clinton a lead of ten points (even though it was taken at the same time as the Republicans were holding their convention in San Diego). In 1992 a big Clinton lead in California persuaded George Bush to pull out of the state several weeks before the election. For the moment, Mr Dole vows not to do this, partly in order to force his rival to devote resources to California, and partly in order to help his party's congressional prospects there. He is betting that a part-Californian running mate, together with ruthless views on civil rights and immigration, will shake the president's lead. If it does not, Mr Dole may at some point decide that California is unwinnable, and concede the state's 54 electoral-college votes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole is also under threat in Florida, which is worth 25 electoral votes, and which narrowly tipped to Mr Bush in 1992. No poll has been taken in Florida since late June, when Mr Clinton had a lead of two points; another poll conducted a fortnight earlier had the president 13 points ahead. In his convention speech, Mr Clinton went out of his way to attract Florida voters, promising to conserve the precious Everglades, to stand up to Fidel Castro, and to protect the Medicare programme beloved of Florida's many pensioners. On September 5th-6th, hurricanes permitting, he was due to campaign in the state.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton will also have a go at North Carolina, part of the Republicans' supposed southern stronghold, and at Arizona, which has not voted Democratic since 1948. If Mr Clinton succeeds, and the Republican lock is smashed convincingly, you will see some acrobatic punditry. Just two years ago, after the Republican victory in the mid-term elections, there was talk of a historic realignment in the opposite direction: the Democrats' grip on both chambers of Congress had been broken for the first time in 42 years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What to make of this confusing mix of realignments? It may be that controlling Congress makes it harder to win the presidency. Americans dislike handing too much power to either party, so they tend to entrust each with Congress or the White House but not both. In 1994 they put Republicans in charge of Congress in order to check Mr Clinton's expansive view of government. In 1996 they seem set to put Mr Clinton in the White House in order to check the Republican government-cutters who run Congress.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or, alternatively, it may be that all theories of realignment are empty--or that, in the expression used by Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia, "dealignment" is the real trend. He reckons that, in the 1960s, 75% of Americans felt some kind of party allegiance; today, as few as 60% do. As a result, voters are more fickle, and electoral "locks" are outdated. It is no longer just a belt of industrial America that determines elections. Most of the country can swing.

<h1>Trends of the week</h1>

<p>
<b>Resilience: </b>Bill Clinton, boosted by a triumphant train trip, the Democratic convention and a quick bus tour with Al Gore, has restored his lead over Bob Dole to some 20-plus points.<p>
<b>September Surprise</b>: Saddam Hussein.<p>
<b>Word:</b> Bridge. Mr Clinton wants to build a bridge to the 21st century. Mr Dole calls it a toll bridge ("You gotta pay").<p>
<b>Coincidence: </b>The Clinton/Gore post-convention bus tour began in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, the birthplace of America's best-known Clinton-basher, talk-show host Rush Limbaugh.<p>
<b>Pain in the neck:</b> The White House disclosed that the presidential neck had a benign cyst, which was removed on September 4th. Mr Dole has cheekily been calling for full disclosure of Mr Clinton's medical records.<p>
<b>Local heroics: </b>Mr Dole wants to scrap the Energy Department to help pay for his proposed tax cut, but in Albuquerque he pledged to keep New Mexico's two national laboratories (10% of the department's budget). Mr Dole also campaigned hard in Utah, one of only three states that solidly support him.<p>
<b>Debate: </b>Whether Ross Perot should be included in the three planned presidential debates, starting on September 25th. It would suit Mr Clinton to have him in, and Mr Dole to have him out.<p>
<b>Ads:</b> Mr Perot began airing a half-hour <b>"</b>infomercial<b>"</b> called <b>"</b>Results, Not Free Candy<b>"</b> (paid for from the $30m in federal funds that the billionaire-candidate has decided to accept). The Clinton and Dole campaigns traded blows in ads on rising drug abuse.<p>
<b>Quote:</b> Mr Dole, in a <i>New York Times </i>interview: "We're going to compete for every vote...Jack Kemp is certainly reaching out to black communities. I've tried to over the years. Hispanics. So I'm very optimistic. I feel good. I'm confident. Sleep good. Work hard. I mean, I like to work. I like to campaign. I like people. I was out there the other night with flashlights..."<p>
<b>Ladbroke's odds:</b> Clinton 1-6; Dole 7-2; Perot 50-1.<p>
<b>Forbearance:</b> Eileen McGann, whose husband Dick Morris resigned as chief Clinton strategist because of a sex scandal: "I'm an adult. I accepted Dick's apology."<p>
<b>Sex fad: </b>Triangulation.

<h1>The Washington Wobbler v The Baghdad Bruiser</h1>

<p>AH, SADDAM. There is nothing quite like that infamous face, and the evocative accompaniment of Peter Arnett once again sending reports from Baghdad on <font size=-1>CNN</font>, to rally Americans and inspire them with a sense of foreign-policy purpose. It is the face of The Enemy. Since the collapse of communism, America has suffered from a shortage of compelling enemies--except in the fantasy world of this summer's blockbuster movie, "Independence Day", which invented a super-enemy from outer space. As a result, the country's foreign policy has tended to appear adrift. Threats to American interests have often seemed distant (as in Bosnia) or faceless (as the possible bombers of <font size=-1>TWA</font> flight 800 remain). Saddam Hussein lends American policy a wondrous clarity and unity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At least for a few days. Then things get trickier. As you might expect from such a wily operator, the Iraqi dictator has picked the moment for his provocation carefully. For a number of reasons, America faces peculiar difficulties in calibrating its response.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One reason is presidential politics, with the election just two months away. Whether or not this weighs in Bill Clinton's calculations (perish the thought), his task is complicated by the suspicion of others, including America's allies, that it must. The president's plans for missile attacks on Iraq were laid between stops on his campaign bus tour. And his decisions have certainly done his re-election prospects no harm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Early polls showed Americans to be overwhelmingly in favour of the missile strikes against Iraq ordered by Mr Clinton. Out of the news went the unsavoury story of Dick Morris, Mr Clinton's master-strategist who resigned after tabloid reports of his foolish affair with a prostitute, and in came images of the president acting as commander-in-chief. Criticism of Mr Clinton by his Republican rival, Bob Dole, for allowing the crisis to brew turned to patriotic expressions of solidarity once the military response was launched.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole is in any case on shaky ground when it comes to tough-minded advice on the handling of Mr Hussein. Mr Dole, remember, led an appeasing mission of senators who in 1990 met Mr Hussein in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul shortly before the invasion of Kuwait. Kansas was a big grain exporter to Iraq. They delivered a tough letter from George Bush but, according to the Iraqi transcript of the meeting, the then senior senator from Kansas and Senate minority leader told the Iraqi leader that a Voice of America journalist responsible for a broadcast that had caused particular offence to Mr Hussein had been sacked.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But what if the tension in the Gulf refuses to die down and, worse, claims casualties among the American air forces patrolling the now-enlarged no-fly zone over southern Iraq? That would surely aggravate divisions over the appropriate response to Mr Hussein--divisions which pose the second complication for Mr Clinton. Because Mr Hussein's military move came within Iraq's own borders, and in response to a request from one Kurdish faction fighting against another, the case for punitive reprisals looks to some less than black-and-white. Some of America's own allies, notably France, expressed public misgivings about the American riposte. The qualms of others--Turkey, Saudi Arabia--ruled out attacks on Iraq from their territory and so limited Mr Clinton's military options.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is far from obvious that the president could command adequate support for an escalation of his actions against Mr Hussein, if that is what he wanted to do. Opposition would come not only from abroad, but at home. A report published on August 29th by the Cato Institute, a libertarian Washington think-tank, argued that America should withdraw its troops from the Gulf because it has "no interests to justify the risks and costs" of attempting to manage security there.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, America does have big security interests in the Gulf. It has interests in the supply of oil, in the stability of a volatile region, and in the protection of allies from the ruthless aggression of Mr Hussein, the would-be regional hegemon. The trouble is, until this week the Clinton administration has not spent much effort reminding anyone of those interests.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which points to the third, and deepest, complication exposed by Mr Hussein: the failure of Mr Clinton to develop a clear set of foreign-policy priorities. In the absence of the Soviet threat, Mr Clinton can list a series of lesser post-cold-war threats, such as terrorism and weapons proliferation. But he has given little sense that he has in his mind a hierarchy of American interests or any workable principles by which to judge what he would do to defend them. Instead, Mr Clinton has opted for ad-hocery. This landed him in early trouble (over Bosnia, for example) but later produced some tentative successes (Bosnia again). On balance, there has been enough for Mr Clinton to brag about, but not enough for him to inspire confidence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You might think that in such circumstances foreign policy would be right in the thick of this year's election campaign, with Mr Dole itching to attack a Clintonian weakness. But no. Foreign policy featured only briefly at both the Republican and Democratic conventions last month. After his laundry list of domestic policies in his acceptance speech in Chicago, Mr Clinton turned to Abroad almost as an afterthought. As for Mr Dole, he told the <i>New York Times </i>this week that his main message was about the economy, drugs, the budget, education; he would add "some foreign policy, some more trade, other things as they come up."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Saddam Hussein has now come up, in a big way. Whatever else Mr Hussein achieves, he has suddenly placed foreign policy where it should have been all along in an American election campaign: at its heart. It was not so long ago that an American president came to power believing, admittedly a tad simplistically, that dealing with the world was the principal job he had been elected to do. "All you need is a competent cabinet to run the country at home," said Richard Nixon. "You need a president for foreign policy."

<h1>Provocation and response</h1>

<p>SADDAM HUSSEIN'S neighbours, it appears, can now sleep more securely in their beds. That, say the Americans, as well as punishing Mr Hussein for sending his army, by invitation of one Kurdish faction, into the Kurdish area of northern Iraq, was the aim of their missile attacks on Iraq's southern air-defence network this week.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The attacks made it possible, and reasonably safe, to extend the ban on Iraqi aircraft flying in Iraqi air space. The southern no-fly zone has been stretched by 110km (70 miles) up to the 33rd parallel, almost the outskirts of Baghdad (see <a href="ir1.gif">map</a>). The zones were originally set, by the victors of the Gulf war, to help protect Mr Hussein's rebellious subjects from his vengeance. Maybe they help the neighbours too. But these, Kuwait apart, are yet to show their gratitude. America's action has split the coalition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The strikes came early on September 3rd, with a follow-up 24 hours later. Most of the cruise missiles were launched from warships in the Gulf, others from bombers based in the Pacific, but refuelling in the air over Diego Garcia (owned by Britain, one of the few unquestioning allies). On September 4th, American and British, but not French, aircraft began patrolling up to the new limit; on one flight an American fighter fired a missile at an Iraqi radar tracking it. The huge banned area, over half of Iraq, includes a couple of air bases where the planes have either been moved north or are presumably grounded.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or are they? Mr Hussein responded to the raids with predictable belligerence. He ordered the "falcons" of his air force (which seems to be in even worse shape than the rest of his demoralised war machine, with about half of its 300 or so remaining combat aircraft grounded through lack of spares) to treat the no-fly limits as "non-existent." What if his pilots obey, and manage to shoot down a patrolling aircraft? For the Americans, said a diplomat, that would be "a make-my-day kind of thing" .
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Saudi Arabia, the Americans' launch pad and ally in the Gulf war, has been notably quiet this time. Iran, wrote a London-based Saudi weekly, is now a bigger menace than Iraq. Kuwait, Iraq's victim in 1990, cheered the Americans on. But the sum of Arab comment is that the strikes will not make much difference--except, maybe, to Mr Clinton's hopes of re-election. America's western allies are less openly cynical. But France and Russia alike stalled an early British and American bid to get the <font size=-1>UN</font> Security Council to deplore Iraq's action against the Kurds. America's response, said Russia, was inappropriate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not unprovoked, though. On August 31st Mr Hussein sent 30,000 Iraqi troops and 400 tanks to help the Kurdistan Democratic Party (<font size=-1>KDP</font>), led by Massoud Barzani, displace the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (<font size=-1>PUK</font>), led by Jalal Talabani, from Arbil, the regional capital of the Kurdish enclave. The two factions, enemies for decades and at each other's throats for the past 18 months, use and are used by Iran and Turkey, as those two governments hunt their own Kurdish dissidents across the border in Iraq. Mr Talabani, said his rival, had ganged up with Iran; hence Mr Barzani's own plea for help to the army of Iraq.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Iraqi troops left Arbil as soon as the <font size=-1>KDP</font> had taken over from the <font size=-1>PUK</font>. And then? It depends whom you believe. The losers talk of mass executions and Iraqi security men staying on in civilian clothes; the <font size=-1>KDP</font> says fewer than 200 fighters were killed and no civilians. Inviting the Iraqi army in seems a desperate move--and a despicable one, to many Kurds--given Mr Hussein's record: he slaughtered thousands of Kurds in 1988, gassing villagers and destroying villages. But neither Iran, Turkey nor Iraq will give the Kurds independence. So, at some point Iraq's Kurds will have to seek a deal with its government--which could still be led by Mr Hussein.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Did the incursion break any <font size=-1>UN</font> or other rule? Probably not. The Americans quote Security Council Resolution 688, passed in April 1991, which tells Iraq to end its repression of the Kurds. Repression, Mr Hussein could say: my (momentarily) good friend Barzani asked us in. More awkward for the Americans, the resolution does not empower any <font size=-1>UN</font> member to enforce it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But that anyway is debating-chamber stuff. Real-world reactions to the affair will depend, as ever, on governments' view of their national interests. One consequence could be a grave threat to the deal under which Iraq was to be allowed to sell $2 billion-worth of oil over a six-month period to buy food and medicine. After five years of stalemate--due mostly to the Iraqis, then, for a much shorter period, the Americans--the strict monitoring arrangements had been negotiated and sales were due to start this month. Now they will be delayed, certainly until Iraq is deemed safe for the <font size=-1>UN</font> monitors, possibly longer, if delay is used as a form of economic punishment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Americans say it will be some time before they look again at the plan. But a long delay would hurt, probably kill, many ordinary, poor Iraqis. It might have a less obvious consequence. The <font size=-1>UN</font> agency that monitors the destruction of Iraq's nastiest weapons was to be paid from the oil sales. Without them, it will be broke.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<p><b>Scottish politics</b></p>
<h1>A vote too far</h1>

<font size=1>EDINBURGH</font>
<p>POP into the Edinburgh offices of either the Scottish National Party (<font size=-1>SNP</font>) or the Scottish Conservative Party just now, and you find the same thing--cheery people brimming with optimism. This good humour is at odds with the political standing of both parties. The <font size=-1>SNP</font> has little hope of winning more than the four parliamentary seats it has now, while the Tories' opinion-poll ratings in Scotland remain stuck at little more than half the 26% share of the vote they won at the last election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the reason for the jolliness is not hard to find. It is the dreadful hash that Labour is making of its plans for a devolved Scottish parliament. What Labour proposes--an elected parliament to run Scottish domestic affairs with limited taxation powers--is clear. It is how this will be established which is causing the merriment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In June, Tony Blair announced that there would be pre-legislative referendums in Scotland and Wales. These, he argued, would dispel doubts about whether voters wanted devolution and would help speed the necessary bills through Westminster. To counter the Tories' damaging campaign that the Edinburgh parliament would levy a "tartan tax" on Scots, he declared that the Scottish referendum would have a second question solely on the taxation powers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This seemed like a bright idea. But left-wingers and nationalist-minded members of his Scottish party were enraged. They reckoned that Scots would vote for a parliament but against being taxed by it, and that this would severely weaken the scheme. They also resented not being consulted before the announcement.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Blair and his Scottish spokesman, George Robertson, were unable to quell this rebellion despite much arm-twisting. At a meeting of Labour's Scottish Executive Committee on August 31st, after two hours of dead-locked discussion, Mr Robertson accepted an idea that a further referendum authorising a decision by the Scottish parliament to use the taxation powers would make it more likely that yes-votes could be secured to both questions in the first referendum. This two-legged, three-humped camel of a plan then squeaked through the committee by 21 votes to 18.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although Mr Blair thus avoided an embarrassing defeat by Labour's Scottish executive, he now has a worse headache. The <font size=-1>SNP</font> was quick to point out that getting independence only needs two votes (for them in the election and in a subsequent referendum on an independence settlement) whereas getting Labour's full plan for devolution needs five votes (for a Labour government, in the first two-vote referendum, for a Scottish parliament, and then in the second referendum).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>SNP</font> thinks that voters will never understand this; and the party loudly proclaims that Labour is abandoning its Scottish parliament plan. Editorials in the main pro-devolution Scottish newspapers, the <i>Herald</i> and the <i>Scotsman</i>, which have so far loyally backed Labour, also interpret the referendum manoeuvring as evidence that Mr Blair wants to ditch devolution.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is unlikely. He has already staked too much on it. Nevertheless Labour has given its opponents potent ammunition. On September 3rd, an obviously delighted John Major mocked Labour's latest plans as a "steeplechase of stupidities" in a speech to Scottish businessmen. As it is, Labour's divisive wranglings have cost it Scottish support already. An opinion poll published in the <i>Herald</i> on September 2nd showed that, compared with the previous month, Labour support had fallen by three points to 48%, while the <font size=-1>SNP</font> was up six points to 29% and the Tories were steady at 15%. Mr Blair is due to visit Scotland on September 9th to explain himself. He has a lot of fast talking to do.

<h1>Through the roof</h1>


THERE is now no doubt that house prices are rising steadily. Unlike last year, the pick-up in prices during the spring has continued throughout the summer (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). According to figures published by the Halifax, a building society, on September 2nd, average house prices rose by 0.5% during August, to 5.7% higher than a year earlier. This is good for people wanting to sell their homes, particularly those who have been unable to do so because of "negative equity" (the value of their mortgage exceeding the value of their property). It is less good for buyers, although if higher prices tempt more people to consider selling their homes, there might be greater choice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now that prices are rising, how much further will they go? Partly this depends on supply. Anecdotal reports suggest that for many owners prices are still too low for them to sell and, in particular, that there is a shortage of high-quality properties. That suggests that, if demand increases strongly, so might prices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some economists claim that demand is hard to predict because average incomes are no longer a good indicator: in the 1990s, average incomes have risen steadily while the housing market has slumped. But according to Nigel Pain and Peter Westaway, two economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, housing demand reflects not current income but rather how confident people are about their future income. A good proxy for this is consumer spending, which is now soaring. Mortgage-interest rates are at their lowest for decades. Lenders are keen to lend--the average ratio of loan to house price for first-time buyers is 90%, higher even than in the 1980s. As a result, say Messrs Pain and Westaway, prices could rise by as much as 10% in 1997.

<p><b>Northern Ireland</b></p>
<h1>The soul of Ulster</h1>


<font size=1>BELFAST</font>

<p>WHEN Northern Ireland's political parties resume talks on September 9th, attention may no longer be focused on the exclusion of Sinn Fein, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s political wing. Instead, the spectacle of unionists falling out with each other will be impossible to ignore.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the top of the agenda will be what to do about the fringe political parties--the Progressive Unionists and the Ulster Democrats--which speak for loyalist paramilitary groups. The ultimatum by the "Combined Loyalist Military Command" to leave Ulster or face "summary justice" delivered to Billy Wright and Alec Kerr, two hardline loyalists, has divided unionist politicians and left them in a quandary.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Loyalist leaders are fed up with Mr Wright in particular, who they cannot control and who has made no secret of the fact that he wants the loyalists to call off their own ceasefire. Worse for the loyalist leadership, Mr Wright brushed aside their deadline--midnight of August 31st--and held a series of media interviews in which he declared his determination to stay. As <i>The Economist</i> went to press, Mr Wright was still alive, and still granting interviews.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has left unionist leaders in the awkward position of condemning a death threat against a man who wants to resume violence. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party has demanded the explusion of the two loyalist parties from the talks, on the obvious grounds that their refusal to repudiate the threat to Mr Wright and Mr Kerr violates their commitment to the exclusively democratic means enshrined in the "Mitchell principles" which are supposed to be the basis for participation (and for Sinn Fein's exclusion because of the absence of an <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, has been more ambivalent. He held secret talks with Mr Wright during the stand-off between police and Orange Order marchers at Drumcree in June. Now he is offering to mediate between loyalist leaders and Mr Wright. Meanwhile none of the other parties at the talks, including the nationalist <font size=-1>SDLP</font>, wants the loyalist parties to be expelled. This is because they assume that this would lead directly to an ending of the loyalist ceasefire.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps it is not surprising that a squabble between the killers in their midst has divided unionists. Nationalists have frequently been divided by the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s violence, and a feud between warring factions of <font size=-1>INLA</font>, a republican splinter group, claimed a life this week. But unionist politicians are also about to face a rebellion from an unexpected quarter: Protestant businessmen.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In "Agenda", a <font size=-1>BBC</font> Radio Four documentary to be broadcast on September 7th, Bill Tosh, chairman of the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, says that business organisations will be asking for a place alongside the political parties when the talks convene next week. If that does not work, Mr Tosh says businessmen are ready to become even more directly involved in forging a political settlement and then making it work. "We want to get our hands on the problem and help with its resolution. And if it has to be through an appointed body to include ourselves, so be it."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This sounds like an outright challenge to unionist politicians. Many Protestant businessmen are keen to do more business with counterparts in the Irish Republic, which has the fastest growing economy in the European Union, and impatient with the lack of progress towards a political settlement. To unionist politicians this smacks of putting profit before principle. To outsiders it might sound more like the pragmatism and willingness to compromise which Northern Irleand has sorely needed for so long.

<p><b>Traffic</b></p>
<h1>Not bothered</h1>


<p>TWO years ago the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution published a 300-page report arguing that traffic growth was unsustainable and that vehicle exhausts were causing 10,000 deaths annually. Since then its detailed recommendations for restraining car use have not elicited any kind of formal response from the government--an unprecedented snub for a Royal Commission. Ministers have not even bothered to reject its recommendations publicly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has so angered the commission's members, who include some of the nation's top scientists, that they have decided to try again, determined this time that what they say will not be ignored by the next government. Sir John Houghton, the commission's chairman and a former chief executive of the Meteorological Office, will announce next week that the commission is to launch a further study into traffic growth. It is very unusual for a Royal Commission to revisit a subject on which it has just reported. But sources close to the commission stress that, if difficult decisions on restraining car use are not made, the consequences for the environment and the nation's health could be terrible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new study, which is deliberately timed to be published after the general election, will be designed to force the next government, be it Labour, Conservative or coalition, to face these hard choices. The commission's first report recommended increasing duties on petrol and diesel twice as fast as the 5% rate adopted by the government, thus doubling the price of fuel by 2000; halving spending on new motorways and trunk roads; and setting ambitious targets for increasing the use of public transport and shifting heavy freight loads from road to rail.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These recommendations proved anathema to Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Michael Heseltine, then president of the Board of Trade. They privately criticised the commission for having failed to quantify the cost of its proposals and their impact on business competitiveness. Brian Mawhinney, the then transport secretary, was predictably hostile: the commission alleged that his department was in the pocket of the road lobby. Even John Gummer, the environment secretary, distanced himself from the recommendations, claiming that increasing fuel duties would not have much impact on drivers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With few friends in the cabinet, the report had a cool reception in Whitehall. "It's all very difficult," one senior civil servant muttered. The only official response to the commission's recommendations was oblique references in the government's transport green paper, published earlier this year, which seemed to dismiss the commission's proposals for setting targets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the report has been officially cold-shouldered, its views have not been without influence, even within government. The building of new motorways and trunk roads has been severely reduced, rail fares have been pegged in real terms, and the call for a national strategy on air quality has been endorsed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not surprising, in the run-up to a general election, that ministers have shied away from more radical proposals. Yet the issues raised by the commission's first report will not go away. Despite attempts by the government to massage the numbers, traffic is forecast to more than double by 2025. The current road system cannot sustain anything like that growth without traffic, eventually, grinding to a halt.

<p><b>Criminal Justice</b></p>
<h1>Racial bias</h1>


<p>ASK a group of youths on the streets of Brixton in south London what they think of the criminal-justice system, and you will get an earful. The almost universal opinion of young blacks that British justice is biased against them is hardly surprising given the current rates of imprisonment. New research findings to be published later this year show that young black males (Afro-Caribbeans and black Africans) are 12 times more likely to be imprisoned for rape, robbery and drug offences than young white males (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Are young blacks singled out for special treatment by the police and the courts or do they offend more often? Perhaps both. The author of the study, David Smith, professor of criminology at Edinburgh University, argues that young blacks do commit a disproportionately large number of crimes. And yet even Mr Smith admits that racial discrimination exists in many parts of the criminal-justice system. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is that discrimination which was the subject of a report published on September 2nd by the Penal Affairs Consortium, an alliance of 31 penal-reform organisations. The report argues that part of the reason why ethnic-minority groups as a whole, not just blacks, are heavily over-represented in the prison population (18% compared with 5.5% of the general population) is that there is discrimination at every stage of the criminal-justice system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The study notes that black males are significantly more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than are white males. More than a third of those stopped and searched by police in Greater London in 1994-95 belonged to minority groups. Similarly, a review of seven police forces found that young blacks were less likely to be cautioned and more likely to be prosecuted and remanded in custody than comparable white offenders. It is significant that the sharpest discrepancies in imprisonment rates tend to be for those crimes such as drug possession where the police have most discretion about whether or not to prosecute. In crimes where there is less room for discretion, such as burglary, imprisonment rates vary less.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once on remand, black offenders were more likely to receive a jail sentence. A 1992 study into race and sentencing by Roger Hood, director of the Oxford Centre for Criminological Research, found that overall, black males were 17% more likely to receive a prison sentence than white males. Even after controlling for 15 key variables, such as the seriousness of the offence, the study found that blacks had a 5-8% greater chance of being sent to prison.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The extent of racial discrimination within the system has become much clearer since the 1991 Criminal Justice Act required racial monitoring by the police, the probation service and the courts. Even less in dispute is the fact that ethnic minorities are seriously under-represented in the staff of criminal-justice agencies. A report published this month by the National Association of Probation Officers found that only five out of the 514 circuit judges were from minority ethnic groups, two of the 339 district judges and 13 out of 897 recorders. And, despite a decade of attempting to recruit more minority policemen and women, their numbers remain tiny. In September 1995, 2,223, or just 1.75%, of the 127,222 police officers in England and Wales came from minority groups.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Little wonder that the view on the streets of Brixton is one of suspicion and distrust. In fact, this breakdown in confidence is itself one reason why young blacks fare so badly in the criminal-justice system. Young blacks are much less likely to admit an offence when questioned by the police, which means they cannot be cautioned and are thus more likely to be prosecuted. Similarly their tendency to plead not guilty in court, even if the evidence is overwhelming, frequently results in harsher sentences.

<p><b>Sun Microsystems</b></p>
<h1>Collateral damage</h1>

<p>AS THE shells fly in the battle between Microsoft and Netscape for the web browser market, one company flinches more than most each time Netscape takes a direct hit. Since the upstart Netscape first grabbed the lead in the Internet's largest software market less than two years ago, Sun Microsystems has been its most partisan supporter. Together, the pair have whipped up wild enthusiasm for Sun's new programming language, Java, that could challenge Microsoft's overall dominance of the software industry. What happens to Sun if Microsoft wins?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, the question might seem premature. Microsoft, after all, still has less than 20% of the browser market. But Microsoft's war machine has never run more impressively than it has in browsers. In less than a year, Microsoft has matched Netscape's software technically, signed up all the biggest Internet service firms to distribute its browser, and is giving its program away for free while Netscape charges $50 for its own. If current trends continue, Microsoft may have passed Netscape in the market by the second half of next year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That would be dark news indeed for Netscape, and would not make Sun shine either. Netscape has been Sun's strongest supporter in pushing Java. Although Sun first introduced Java early last year, few Internet surfers could use it until Netscape included it with a new version of its browser earlier this year. Netscape has also promoted the idea that its browser, along with Java, could in effect replace Microsoft's Windows operating system as the main way people and software interact with their <font size=-1>PC</font>. It talks of using Java in the coming wave of low-price "network computers".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Little surprise, then, that Sun wants Netscape to win. But it is not directly threatened by the prospect of a Microsoft victory, for two reasons. The first is that Java is close to establishing itself. With or without Netscape, hundreds of software firms are developing Java programs and have a vested interest in seeing them find a market. Microsoft would prefer developers to switch to ActiveX, its own Java-compatible Internet language, but it knows that its browser must be able to run Java too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second reason is that, as much as Sun's reputation has been burnished by Java over the past year, direct revenues from the language are minimal. Nearly three-quarters of its $7 billion in sales for the year that ended in July came from workstations and servers--powerful machines running the <font size=-1>UNIX</font> operating system that are used on the desktop by engineers and to run networks and Web sites.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The hitch is that the server market no longer looks the redoubt for Sun that it once was. High-end <font size=-1>PC</font>s running Microsoft's Windows <font size=-1>NT</font> software are almost as powerful and cheaper than <font size=-1>UNIX</font> workstations: they have been gaining ground (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). True, Sun's machines are powering ahead in the new market for Internet servers (though that is the area where what the company calls the "halo effect" from Java may matter most). All the same, it is clear that in the medium term Sun will need to discover a new market, outside the <font size=-1>PC</font>'s shadow. And this is where Java could matter greatly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the competition in high-end computing increases, Sun wants to open another front, at the other end of the market: software for cheap and simple consumer devices, from mobile telephones to television set-top boxes, that connect to the Internet. Java was originally intended to be a language for set-top boxes and "embedded controllers" in electrical appliances and industrial equipment, but was quickly adapted for the Internet when the growth of the network exploded in 1994. Now Sun is returning to its original strategy. Along with Navio Communications, a new Netscape spin-off, it is working on ways to use Java and browsers with gadgets that most people do not think of as computers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sun is even developing its own processor chips expressly designed to run Java quickly on such machines. It reckons that such chips could make up half of the processor and controller market by 2000, bringing Sun $15 billion a year, as much as all its other businesses combined. This claim is questionable--manufacturers may be reluctant to let Sun create a hardware and software monopoly in small devices to match Microsoft's and Intel's lock on the <font size=-1>PC</font>--but it seems inevitable that telephones and other devices will become smarter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The question is what will fire them: Java or something else? Microsoft, naturally enough, has its own plans for that market. It tried and failed to shoehorn chubby Windows code into telephones and fax machines. Now it is coming back with a slimmer version. It is too early to know how that will fare compared with Java. But it seems inevitable that the victor of the Internet wars will influence the winner in this potentially bigger market below the <font size=-1>PC</font>. Java has the lead at the moment. But if Microsoft captures the browser market, this is where it will surely try to use its clout next.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<p><b>American banking</b></p>
<h1>Send in the marine</h1>

<p>WHAT ever happened to the urge to merge which characterised American banking last year? Hugh McColl, long the chairman of NationsBank, based in North Carolina, recently averred that big mergers were an "old paradigm". Banks should concentrate on the needs of their own customers. But Mr McColl, an ex-marine of aggressive mien and acquisitive habits, knows when to ignore his own advice. On August 30th NationsBank said that it would pay $9 billion for Boatmen's Bancshares, a smaller rival based in Missouri with assets of $41 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;NationsBank thus becomes America's fourth-largest bank. It now has operations in 16 states, 13m customers and a clear lead in the race to become the first national retail bank. The deal startled Wall Street, which had unwisely taken Mr McColl at his word. But it has greater significance: it highlights the ever more intense search for efficiency by America's banks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The deal--America's third-biggest banking merger ever--comes after a brief lull. According to Houlihan Lokey Howard &amp; Zukin, a Los Angeles investment bank, the volume of banking mergers in the first half of 1996 slipped to $9.7 billion from $21 billion in the same period last year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For both sides, the Boatmen's deal carries clear attractions. Boatmen's shareholders get a 40% premium on their shares. And NationsBank is happy to pay it, for several reasons. First, Boatmen's gives it a large and respected business in trust and investment management, previously an area of weakness. Moreover, it is acquiring a unique franchise: a string of small acquisitions by Boatmen's has already turned it into the largest bank in five mid-western states. Third, NationsBank reckons it can squeeze $335m of annual costs out of Boatmen's flab within three years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some argue that the Boatmen's deal is the first portent of a new wave of banking mergers. Certainly, more are likely, if only because the market is still divided among almost 10,000 banks. Regional banks, taking advantage of the liberalisation of interstate banking laws, will drive consolidation. The largest of them--known as "super-regionals" --such as Norwest, Banc One, First Union and First Bank System, are evolving into diversified banks covering several regions. They hope eventually to become truly national retail banks. None can yet boast a national brand.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Several super-regionals have bagged big game recently. Last year First Union bought First Fidelity for $5.6 billion and Wells Fargo swallowed First Interstate after an $11 billion hostile takeover. These banks may now pause to digest their prey. Others, such as Norwest and Banc One, have been stalking banks in the mid-west and south-east.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But acquiring has become expensive. So keen was NationsBank that it paid 2.7 times Boatmen's book value in a market where paying twice book value is considered generous. If, as seems likely, other would-be sellers demand such prices, buyers will be deterred.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead, they will focus on improving their own efficiency. Although mergers help banks to rationalise branch networks and computer systems, there are other ways to do so. Several are closing expensive old branches and replacing them with lower-cost outlets in supermarkets and shopping malls. Wells Fargo has even begun renting space in its own branches to retailers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With an average cost-to-income ratio of 59%, American banks are now among the world's most efficient (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). Still, this conceals a huge disparity among them. Michael Mayo, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, an investment bank, reckons that over the next five years the average cost-to-income ratio may fall below 55%. Only the fittest, and those with marine training, are likely to survive.

<h1>Just when you thought it was safe...</h1>

ROME<p>DESCRIBING banks as Shylocks is now rather more than just colourful hyperbole in Italy. With about 3% of bank loans thought to exceed new legal limits for usury, imposed earlier this year, bankers are beginning to worry about their pound of flesh. This month the treasury ministry will begin implementing the law by dividing loans into different categories, grouping them by their riskiness. By March next year, it will announce the average interest rate for each category, and any loan on which interest is more than 50% above average will be deemed usurious, and thus illegal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the new law is aimed at banks, they are only small-time players in a booming loan-sharking business. According to the Bank of Italy, more than 300,000 families fell into the clutches of loan sharks--known as <i>cravattari</i>, or stranglers--in 1993, the latest year for its figures. They borrowed almost 4 trillion lire ($2.6 billion) and paid nearly 3.5 trillion lire in interest. Confesercenti, a retail traders' association, says that the business has grown ten-fold since then.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The authorities are barely scratching the surface in tackling the problem. Earlier this week, the <i>Guardia di Finanza</i>, Italy's financial police force, announced that they had uncovered 140 cases of loan sharking during the first seven months of the year and brought charges against 371 people. Despite a well-publicised effort to crack down, these figures are virtually unchanged from a year earlier.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The loan sharks were helped by Italy's recession in the early 1990s, which hurt many small firms. The Bank of Italy reckons that 90% of the money borrowed from <i>cravattari</i> during that period was used for financing businesses. Rather than blaming the business cycle, or the <i>cravattari </i>themselves, many people accuse the banks of extending too little credit to help small firms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is no doubt misleading to place banks in the same category as the <i>cravattari</i>. The interest rates that they charge are around 18% on personal loans, compared with the 150% to 200% annual rates charged by the <i>cravattari</i>. And by forcing the banks to swim with the sharks, Italy's authorities may foster a perverse outcome. The new law will probably force many banks to ration credit more tightly, leaving even more victims within reach of the ever-circling predators.<fly><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Italy's banks deny these claims vehemently. They argue that families and small firms are among the riskiest borrowers, with default rates that are 50% higher than those on large loans. Moreover, they say, default risks differ enormously across regions and borrowers, and so interest rates must vary widely to reflect these risks.

<h1><center>Fit to rule?</center></h1>

ANIMAL, vegetable or mineral? It is a question the people of several large countries may reasonably be asking of their political leaders these days. Deng Xiaoping, China's untitled but paramount leader, is 92 years old, never seen in public and, it seems, scarcely able to talk. At 65, Boris Yeltsin is much younger than Mr Deng, but he has already lived seven years longer than the average Russian male and looks far from well on the increasingly rare occasions when he makes an appearance. President Suharto of Indonesia is 75, spent several days in July having tests in a German hospital and, it is said, has grown seriously remote from his 190m people. For the citizens of these three countries, which together account for over a quarter of the world's population, a sickly gerontocrat means perpetual speculation and uncertainty. Is it also worrying for everyone else?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The worries may seem overblown. China is not notably worse governed now than it was a few years ago, when Mr Deng was a bit more sprightly. Certainly, the old man's decrepitude does not seem to have led directly either to chaos or to aggression. Such chaos as exists--and it is largely the benign anarchy of economic growth--probably derives from decisions he took when he had some command of his faculties: his last act of known significance, on a tour of southern China in 1992, was to call for uninhibited economic expansion, which has led to much boisterous prosperity (as well as some much less welcome inflation). As for aggression, China exhibits all too much of it, but it is far from clear that it would exhibit less either if Mr Deng were more effectively in charge or if he were unambiguously dead. Even the implications of Mr Yeltsin's parlous health may be exaggerated. Better, certainly, that Russia should be erratically governed by a sick democrat than consistently misgoverned by a healthy communist or a clear-eyed nationalist.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet to say all this is only to say that things might be worse, as indeed they might. They might also be better. The Chinese, and their neighbours, would be far better served by a leader who was able to take considered decisions and overrule, if necessary, colleagues who wanted to stand in the way of political reform and good relations with other countries. The Russians would be better served by a president who would end the war in Chechnya and attend to the creation of a sense of civic decency in their country. And the Indonesians would be better served by a president who would stop corruption and liberalise their country's political system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Age alone does not disqualify politicians from getting things done. If Mr Deng is one day remembered more as a great reformer than as a brutal autocrat, and he may be, it will be because of the changes he wrought after his ascent of the greasy pole in 1978--at the age of 74. Old men, from Gladstone to de Gaulle to Nelson Mandela (75 when he became president of South Africa), have shown that great things can be achieved in old age. Bob Dole must certainly hope so. If elected in November, at 73 he would become the oldest man ever to assume the American presidency.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;History, however, suggests that old politicians do not usually make up in wisdom what they lack in youthful vigour and sharpness of mind. Almost all Ronald Reagan's accomplishments came at the outset of his term of office. Even then he was culpably hard to educate about the economic consequences of cutting taxes but not spending, and towards the end he was so detached as to be almost dangerous: at the Reykjavik summit in 1986, when he was 75, he was nearly beguiled by Mikhail Gorbachev into signing America up for a nuclear-free future.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Old men are, inevitably, also more prone to illness than younger ones, and illness undoubtedly impairs judgment. Roosevelt might well have driven a harder bargain with Stalin at Yalta had he not been dying. Eden might not have mismanaged Suez had he not been ill. Churchill and Mitterrand might have presided over more than stagnation in their final administrations had they not been beset by infirmity.

<br>Still, America, Britain and France all survived the experience of frail old leaders with relatively little upheaval. One reason is that in these countries power is not entirely concentrated in the hands of one person, sane or gaga. Another is that, when a mistake is made, the institutions and mechanisms exist to repair the damage and restore some kind of continuity. Democracies offer orderly procedures for choosing successors. That, no doubt, is why voters may be ready to elect elderly politicians to office, especially nowadays when they have reasonable grounds for believing they will be told about the onset of any serious affliction. Mitterrand disguised the extent of his cancer for a while, but it is unthinkable that the American press would today fail to report the degree of paralysis of a president, as it did in Roosevelt's day.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although established democracies may be able to weather the rule of the distempered or the disabled, two other kinds of country may not. One is the new democracies, of which there are many, where the succession mechanism may be untested, the institutions fragile. This is true of South Africa, whose reputation for relative political tranquillity rests largely on Mr Mandela, who, fit though he is for a man of 78, is hardly in charge of day-to-day events. Trouble may already be brewing there. Russia is even more worrying, if only because it is a nuclear power with an expansionist history and an uncertain commitment to democratic rules. Mr Yeltsin's second term has started badly, with all the characteristics of a coma interrupted by fits. If it continues thus, it may be hard to bring it to a decent end, and meanwhile the power struggle to succeed will intensify.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Outright autocracies, however, are far more dangerous, since they generally prescribe no procedure for the handover of power. True, China has an heir-apparent in the shape of President Jiang Zemin, but his succession is far from assured. In any event, the prickly, uncertain nature of Chinese politics is likely to continue after Mr Deng's death, at least for a while, even if Mr Jiang does take over. In Indonesia, no heir of any kind is in sight and speculation about who it will be is now rivalled by how and when the changeover will come.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the problem of the aged leader does not stop there. Zaire boasts one of the world's longest-running despots in Mobutu Sese Seko (65). Jordan's King Hussein is younger (60) and much less wicked, but perhaps less physically robust. King Hassan of Morocco is 67. President Assad of Syria is 65. None of these men runs a model democracy, or even a model monarchy. None can be sure of bequeathing a trouble-free succession. If you are worried about your own health, worry also about the health of every antique autocrat.

<p><h2>Serbmandering</h2></p>
<p><p>The Bosnian president, Alija Izetbegovic, called for a Muslim boycott of the <b>Bosnian municipal elections</b> which Serbs plan to hold on September 14th. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, charged with supervising the Bosnian elections, said it was postponing the official municipal poll because of alleged irregularities, though other votes would go ahead that day as scheduled.
<p>Russia's ailing president, <b>Boris Yeltsin</b>, went on holiday to a resort near Moscow. He refused two requests from Alexander Lebed, his special representative for Chechnya, for a meeting to discuss Mr Lebed's Chechen peace plan. Russian troops continued to withdraw from Chechnya's capital, Grozny, leaving it to separatist rebels.
<p><b>Estonia's parliament</b> failed to elect a new state president. Neither the reformist incumbent, Lennart Meri, nor his ex-communist rival, Arnold Ruutel, could muster the two-thirds majority needed, despite three rounds of voting.
<p>A conference opened in Stockholm on the international <b>sexual exploitation of children</b>. The search continued for the bodies of young victims of sex abuse in Belgium.
<p>The <b>Danish Supreme Court</b> agreed to allow 11 citizens to bring a constitutional challenge to Denmark's signature of the Maastricht treaty. The case may take four years. Until it is resolved, Denmark is unlikely to ratify amendments to the treaty being discussed by the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s inter-governmental conference.
<p>After hunger strikes and a two-month protest, 300 <b>illegal immigrants</b>, mostly from Africa, were evicted from a Paris church in an operation involving tear gas, batons and 1,000 police officers.
<p>The <b>hijacking </b>of a Sudanese airliner on a flight from Khartoum to Amman ended at London's Stansted Airport with the release of all passengers and crew. The Iraqi hijackers and their families were taken into custody.</p>
<p><h2>Heads will roll</h2></p>
<p><p>Two former presidents of <b>South Korea </b>were sentenced for their roles in a military coup and a massacre in Kwangju in 1980. Chun Doo Hwan was sentenced to death and Roh Tae Woo to 22.5 years in jail. Government critics said the two men had been put on trial to boost political support for President Kim Young Sam.
<p>Yakio Hatoyama, a member of <b>New Party Sakigake</b>, part of Japan's ruling coalition, said he was resigning to form a new party that would stand for "real democracy".
<p>Prosecutors arrested Takeshi Abe, the ex-head of Japan's <font size=-1>AIDS</font>-study team, for allegedly administering <b>untreated blood products </b>to haemophiliacs even though he knew that these might lead to <font size=-1>AIDS</font>. About 1,800 haemophiliacs have been infected with <font size=-1>HIV</font>, the virus that leads to <font size=-1>AIDS</font>, of which more than 400 have died.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Four members of an opposition party in <b>Singapore </b>faced jail after being accused by the government of "contempt of Parliament". They had allegedly lied about the cost of the state's health care.
<p>More than <b>200 pilgrims </b>to a shrine at Amarnath in the Himalayas died in bad weather. The shrine has a naturally formed ice phallus of Shiva, a Hindu god.</p>
<p><h2>Inroads</h2></p>
<p><p><b>Israel's government</b> approved further Jewish settlement-building ("unfreezing a plan accepted by the Rabin government", it said), and allowed the demolition of a Palestinian community centre under construction ("without a permit") in East Jerusalem. "Declaring war" on the Palestinians, cried Yasser Arafat, calling a half-day shutdown in the West Bank and Gaza.
<p><b>Turkey and Israel</b>, already linked by an agreement on air-force training, signed one for co-operation between their defence industries.
<p>The <b>Zimbabwean government </b>offered a 20% pay rise to thousands of civil servants whose strike since August 20th had disrupted the country's essential services.
<p>A former senior South African security policeman, Eugene de Kock, was convicted on 89 charges, including six of<b> murder</b>, by a court in
<p>Pretoria after a trial lasting two years.</p>
<p><h2>Making tracks</h2></p>
<p><p>At their convention in Chicago, <b>the Democrats </b>re-nominated Bill Clinton for four more years in the White House and offered "the end of the era of big government." To get <font size=-1>TV</font> coverage, Mr Clinton travelled there by train, and the paralysed "Superman" star, Christopher Reeve, made a prime-time speech.
<p>The Defence Department denied that it had intentionally quashed a 1991 classified report, revealed in the <i>New York Times</i>, suggesting that American troops were exposed to <b>Iraqi chemical weapons </b>during the Gulf war. But it said the full relevance of the report had not been recognised at the time.
<p>Foreign<b> oil companies in Colombia</b> were rattled by a proposal in the country's Congress for changes which--said the foreigners--would make them little more than contractors for the state oil company. Then the interior minister said it was ready to talk about anything, oil nationalisation included, that might bring peace with "left-wing" guerrillas who demand just that and sabotage pipelines to prove it.
<p><b>Japan</b> embarked on a love-in with Latin America. After Mexico, Chile and Brazil, its prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, visited Peru to sign a $615m loan deal, before flying to Costa Rica.

<h1><center>The quality of Korean mercy</center></h1>
<p><b>The trial and sentencing of South Korea's former leaders raise some hard questions--not least for authoritarians in the rest of Asia</b></p>


HOLDING hands as they stood together in the dock, Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo, two former generals and leaders of South Korea, were sentenced respectively to death and to 22.75 years in prison this week. That both men may yet be pardoned will not erase the discomfort many people felt at the sight of two once powerful men humbled in this way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sharpest discomfort will have been felt by other authoritarian rulers in Asia, who must wonder whether one day they too may face a reckoning in court. But even those pressing for democracy and the rule of law have reason to ponder events in South Korea. Several questions hang over the trial. Was this really justice in action? Even if the two men were guilty as charged, is it really wise or fair for an emerging democracy to treat former rulers with such harshness? And what impact will the sentences have on the transition to more liberal government elsewhere in Asia?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the first two questions--about the justness and wisdom of the trial--the answers must be equivocal (see <a href="as1.html">page</a>). There was a strong element of political expediency in the decision to prosecute the two men. Kim Young Sam, South Korea's current president, had originally said he would let history judge his predecessors. Many suspect that he changed his mind not out of a sudden desire to see history's wrongs righted but because he feared that Messrs Chun and Roh were considering a political comeback.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sympathy for the two old generals does not rest on that alone. The two men presided over a period of extraordinary economic growth, which made their countrymen significantly better off. Mr Roh even smoothed the transition to democracy, won a free election in 1987 and then, in 1992, stepped gracefully aside to allow a civilian to take his place as president--the very civilian who authorised his prosecution. In other words, the two men were not all bad. Some people argue that, whatever their misdemeanours, it would have been better to forgive and forget.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Messrs Chun and Roh were not innocent men and their conviction has established an important principle: that South Korea's leaders are accountable before the law. Both men were convicted of offences--such as treason and accepting huge bribes--that would be crimes under any conceivable government. And though they did their countries much good, as well as some harm, it is hard to argue that the two men do not deserve any bringing to book. The Kwangju massacre in 1980, which solidified Mr Chun's hold on power, claimed at least 200 victims. There is clearly a demand, both from the families of the victims of Kwangju, and within South Korea as a whole, for some kind of accounting for the events of 1979-80. Such an accounting may help to draw a line under the years of military rule and the traditions of political corruption those events sustained. The good deeds of the generals can only be mitigating factors--and in fact it looks as though such considerations will lead to pardons for both of them.
</p><p><b>The lessons for dictators</b>
<br>The question of the impact of events in South Korea on the rest of Asia is more troubling. The current South Korean government can reasonably say that such intangible calculations are not really its concern. Its main preoccupation is to help its people to come to terms with the country's troubled recent history and, at the same time, to establish civilian government and the rule of law.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it is probably true that neither the generals who run Myanmar, nor President Suharto in Indonesia, nor the Communist Party in China, will be encouraged to move towards democracy by the fate of Messrs Chun and Roh. After all, Mr Roh ceded power as gracefully as any military man can. Now he has fallen victim to the process of democratisation that he helped to foster. The moral drawn by Asia's nervous dictators may well be that, when democrats are at the door, lock them up rather than usher them in.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the sake of the rest of Asia, it might have been better if the South Koreans had followed the South African model: establish a commission to examine the past, and try to strike a balance between justice and reconciliation. Still, it is unlikely that, even if the South Koreans had behaved with more restraint, assorted rulers in Jakarta or Beijing would then have cheerfully ceded power. And the broader lesson of South Korea is that ordinary Asians, despite their alleged preference for strong leadership, will also increasingly demand--and get--accountable government and the rule of law. That, after all, is what was being demanded at Kwangju.

<html><head><title>Saving children from sex</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h1><center>Saving children from sex</center></h1>
<p><b>Rich countries' laws won't stop poor countries' paedophiles</b></p>

EVEN in a world grown hardened to man's inhumanity to man, cruelty to children, and especially the sexual exploitation of the young, still has the power to shock. This week the first World Congress Against the Commercial Exploitation of Children met in Stockholm, bringing together government and non-governmental organisations (see <a href="eu1.html">page</a>). The figures it rehearsed were hideous: more than 1m children a year are added to the miserable total of youngsters used for commercial sexual purposes around the world; child prostitutes are visited by 10m-12m men a week; one-third of child prostitutes in Asia are <font size=-1>HIV</font>-positive. The emotion aroused by such numbers, and indeed by cases such as the abduction and murder of several young girls in Belgium, can easily lead governments into measures that mollify public outrage but do nothing to help potential victims.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Preventing the sexual abuse of children is difficult enough when it takes place within the borders of a rich country with adequate laws. But good communications have been kind to paedophiles. Thanks to inexpensive international air travel, they can easily reach pornographic materials and young victims beyond the scope of their country's disapproving courts. Wherever children live in poverty, they are at risk of commercial sexual exploitation. Their exploiters often include visitors from rich countries. Guided by word of mouth or by information on the Internet, sex tourists may behave abroad as they would never dare to behave in their own countries.
</p><p><b>Small beginnings</b>
<br>In frustration a dozen or so countries, mostly rich and western, have passed laws prohibiting their citizens from behaving abroad in ways that would be illegal at home. More such laws are on the way. Some countries insist, as a general legal principle, that their citizens can be prosecuted for breaking national laws abroad. Others are increasingly using the principle to deal with issues such as football hooliganism or hijacking. But the main drive to extend the reach of a country's courts beyond its borders is horror at the sexual exploitation of foreign children.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One problem with such measures is that they are particularly difficult to enforce. Courts in developed countries may set different standards for the collection of evidence from those set in the country where the offence took place, and some require witnesses to testify in person. Some sketchy evidence also suggests that courts may deal more lightly with an offence committed abroad than at home.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the bigger problem is that, by proposing to prosecute their own citizens for misbehaving abroad, rich countries may inadvertently give the impression that the commercial exploitation of children is mainly an offence committed by foreigners. In fact, by far the main customers of child prostitutes are locals. The first requirement for ending child prostitution is for countries, poor and rich, to pass appropriate laws. Indeed, one of the justifications for extra-territorial laws is often the inadequacy of poor-country laws. In some countries, for instance, the age of consent is low; in others, commercial sex with girls is outlawed, but not with boys.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even more important than passing laws is enforcing them fairly and vigorously. Too many countries have turned a blind eye to the excesses of the sex trade in the hope of luring tourists. The best way for richer countries to help is by giving aid and training: to the police, who may be in league with brothel owners, and to children at risk. Only when poor countries care more about protecting their children than their tourist revenues will this nasty global trade start to die.

<h1>Stable prices and fast growth: just say no</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Paul Krugman, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is one of the world's most distinguished economic theorists, who has done seminal work in international trade and finance. He is a noted slayer of sacred cows, and a part-time scourge of pseudo-economists in high places. He has won many academic honours, and quite a few enemies.</i>
<p>
<b>BY INVITATION <br>In this article, Paul Krugman questions current orthodoxies about monetary policy in rich countries (see <a href="sf1.gif">charts</a>)</b>


<p>MANY years ago, Paul Samuelson, who is widely regarded as the father of modern economics, memorably cautioned against basing economic policy on "shibboleths", by which he meant slogans that take the place of hard thinking. Strictly speaking, his was an incorrect use of the word: the "Oxford English Dictionary" defines a shibboleth as "a catchword or formula adopted by a party or sect, by which their adherents or followers may be discerned, or those not their followers may be excluded." But in a deeper sense Mr Samuelson probably had it right: simplistic ideas in economics often become badges of identity for groups of like-minded people, who repeat certain phrases to each other, and eventually mistake repetition for truth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Public discussion of monetary policy is increasingly dominated by two such sects. The shibboleth of one sect is "growth"; that of the other, "stable prices". Those who belong to neither sect find it hard to get a hearing: it seems that you must believe either that central banks should aim for zero inflation to the exclusion of all else (and that stable prices will bring huge economic benefits) or that central banks should stop worrying about inflation altogether and go for growth (and that by so doing they can bring back the growth rates of the 1960s).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But we need not make this choice. We can and should reject both fatuous promises of easy growth and mystical faith in the virtues of stable prices.
</p><p><b>The case against growth</b>
<br>Bob Dole, the Republican Party's presidential candidate, is running on an economic plan which depends crucially on the assumption that over the next seven years the American economy can grow at an annual average rate of at least 3.5%--more than half as much again as the recent sum of labour-force and productivity growth. While his more conventional advisers have offered some unconvincing claims that his tax-cutting and tax-reforming plan will produce huge gains in economic efficiency, the main argument underlying this kind of "growthism" is the insistence of a vocal group of pundits that the only current obstacle to faster growth is mean-spiritedness at the Federal Reserve Board.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This pro-growth critique of America's central bankers cuts right across the usual left-right divide. On one side stands Robert Bartley, the ultra-conservative editor of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, declaring that the central bank is responsible for America's disappointing growth even in the long term: "if the Fed stamps out any growth in excess of 2.5%, the long-run growth rate of the economy will be less than 2.5%." On the other stands the liberal financier, Felix Rohatyn, whom President Clinton unsuccessfully proposed as the Fed's vice chairman. Mr Rohatyn has claimed that monetary policy can safely aim for 3.5% or even 4% growth in each of the next five or ten years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some simple arithmetic suggests why he is surely wrong. Over the past four years the American economy has achieved an average annual growth rate of less than 3%; nonetheless, this modest growth has been enough to reduce the unemployment rate by more than two percentage points. If the economy were to grow substantially faster over the next four years than it did over the past four, it seems hard to avoid the conclusion that the accompanying fall in unemployment would also be substantially larger. And since the current unemployment rate is only 5.3%, to believe that the Fed can safely target the kind of growth Mr Rohatyn advocates (or that Mr Dole is counting on), you must believe that unemployment can be driven below 3%--which is not only much lower than the current rate but well below even the rates that prevailed at the height of the Vietnam war--without creating inflationary pressures. How many people would be prepared to defend that proposition?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some growth proponents like to point out that the American economy grew at slightly more than 3.5% during the seven years from 1982 to 1989. But that was mainly a matter of recovery from a deep recession; over the course of that recovery the unemployment rate fell by more than five percentage points. To manage a comparable performance over the next seven years America would have to achieve a negative unemployment rate by 2003.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While they are rarely willing to confront this arithmetic directly, members of the growth sect do offer some arguments about why they think high growth targets are now feasible. Here is what one of the many influential publications supporting the sect said recently:<p>
<ul><font size=-1>For some time, </font><i>Business Week </i>has taken a strong pro-growth position. We believe that <font size=-1>U</font>.<font size=-1>S</font>. productivity is higher than government statistics indicate and inflation is significantly lower. We see the global economy as severely restraining the pricing power of companies which recognise that in the current competitive reality they must generate profit by boosting efficiencies, not prices. In other words, we believe the <font size=-1>U</font>.<font size=-1>S</font>. can achieve growth rates higher than 2% without renewed inflation.
</font></ul>
<p>Many people find these arguments convincing. You have to think about them a bit to realise that they make no sense at all.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider first the proposition that higher growth is now possible, because true productivity growth is much higher than the disappointing official numbers. There are good reasons to doubt this claim--the rhetoric of business productivity seems to have outpaced the accomplishment--but suppose that it were true. It would still offer no justification for a more expansionary monetary policy, or a higher growth target. Why? Because estimates of growth and estimates of productivity are based on the same data. Suppose the official numbers say that the American economy is growing by 2% annually, while productivity is rising only 1%. And suppose you think that the true rate of productivity growth is actually much higher, say 2.5%. Then you must correspondingly believe that true  growth is higher by exactly the same amount--that it is 3.5%. So you should not fault Alan Greenspan for failing to deliver a high growth rate; you ought to believe that he has already done so.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What about the argument that global competition prevents inflation? One might point out that the American economy is not actually that globalised: imports are only 13% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, and at least 70% of employment and value-added is in "non-tradable" sectors that do not compete on world markets. One might also point out that if the economy really were as globalised as <i>Business Week </i>imagines, increased domestic demand would do little for American growth and employment--most of the extra spending would be on goods produced elsewhere. But the crucial point is that if you believe that prices throughout the American economy are closely constrained by foreign competition, you ought to conclude that changes in the dollar's exchange rate--which immediately change the costs of those foreign competitors measured in dollars--must have a powerful effect on the inflation rate. An episode like the 1993-95 rise in the value of the yen, which at a stroke increased the dollar costs of American industry's most formidable competitors by 50%, must surely have led to a sharp acceleration in American inflation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it didn't; and this is decisive evidence that global competition does not, in fact, constrain prices the way the growth tribe imagines. Oh, and by the way: wouldn't a looser monetary policy lead to a weaker dollar? And if foreign competition constrains American prices, doesn't that mean that monetary expansion would translate into inflation more, not less, surely and rapidly in a globalised economy than in a closed one?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps one should not be too hard on <i>Business Week.</i> After all, the editorial simply repeated the arguments made by Mr Rohatyn, Lester Thurow and others of the growth sect; and the logic of its case was no more confused than usual. But that, of course, is the point.
</p><p><b>The case against stable prices</b>
<br>While the growth sect has converted America's Republican Party and much of its business press, central bankers remain notably unmoved. This is easily understood in the case of the Fed, which can with some justification claim credit for an unemployment rate that is close to a 20-year low. But European central banks, faced in many cases with unemployment at rates not seen since the 1930s, have been equally unwilling to heed the sometimes desperate calls of political leaders for lower interest rates (Jacques Chirac of France, for example, declared recently that France needed lower interest rates to cut unemployment). Instead, with hardly any exceptions, central bankers insist that the best thing they can do for the economy is to pursue unrelentingly the goal of price stability.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ideology underlying this intransigence is nicely captured by the wording of "The Economic Growth and Stability Act", proposed last year by Senator Connie Mack, who was widely touted as Bob Dole's likely running mate before Jack Kemp entered the picture. Price stability, the act declares "is a key condition to maintaining the highest possible levels of productivity, real incomes, living standards, employment and global competitiveness." It's a confident declaration; you would never guess that there is hardly any reason to believe it is true.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact is, however, that the costs of low inflation (ie, at the low single-digit rates that now prevail in rich countries) have proved theoretically and empirically elusive. Very high inflation, which leads people into costly efforts to avoid holding cash, is one thing; but the West is not remotely in that situation. Moreover, it is fairly certain that the costs of inflation, such as they are, are "non-linear": ie, 3% inflation does much less than one-third as much harm as 9%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, even if the gains from price stability are nowhere near as large as Senator Mack imagines, why not go for them? Because to do so would be very expensive. The great disinflation of the 1980s, which brought inflation rates down from around 10% to around 4%, was achieved only through a prolonged period of high unemployment and excess capacity--in the United States, the unemployment rate did not fall back to its 1979 level until 1988, and the cumulative loss of output was more than a trillion dollars.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is every reason to expect that a push to zero inflation would involve a comparable "sacrifice ratio"--that it would cost as much as half a trillion dollars in foregone output to wring the remaining three points or so of inflation out of the system. This is a huge short-term pain for a small and elusive long-term gain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And even this may not be the whole story: there is some evidence that a push to zero inflation may lead not just to a temporary sacrifice of output but to a permanently higher rate of unemployment. This is still controversial. The standard view, embodied in the concept of the <font size=-1>NAIRU</font> (non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment), is that there is no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. But recent work by George Akerlof, William Dickens and George Perry* makes a compelling case that this no-trade-off rule breaks down when inflation is very low.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>NAIRU</font> hypothesis is based on the reasonable proposition that people can figure out the effects of inflation--that both workers and employers realise that an 11% wage increase in the face of 10% inflation is the same thing as a 6% increase in the face of 5% inflation, and therefore that any sustained rate of inflation will simply get built into price and wage decisions. There is overwhelming evidence that this hypothesis is right--that 10% inflation does not buy a long-term unemployment rate significantly lower than that which can be sustained with 5% inflation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But suppose that the inflation rate is very low, and that market forces are "trying" to reduce the real wages of some workers. (Even if average real wages are rising, there will usually be some industries in which real wages must decline to maintain full employment.) Is a 2% wage increase in the face of 5% inflation the same thing as a 3% wage cut in the face of stable prices? To hyper-rational workers, it might be; but common sense suggests that in practice there is a big psychological difference between a wage rise that fails to keep pace with inflation and an explicit wage reduction. Messrs Akerlof, Dickens and Perry have produced compelling evidence that workers are indeed very reluctant to accept nominal wage cuts: the distribution of nominal wage changes shows very few declines but a large concentration at zero, a clear indication that there are many workers whose real wages "should" be falling more rapidly than the inflation rate but cannot, because to do so would require unacceptable nominal wage cuts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This nominal wage rigidity means that trying to get the inflation rate very low impairs real wage flexibility, and therefore increases the unemployment rate even in the long run. Consider the case of Canada, a nation whose central bank is intensely committed to the goal of price stability (the current inflation rate is less than 1%). In the 1960s Canada used to have about the same unemployment rate as the United States. When it started to run persistently higher rates in the 1970s and 1980s, many economists attributed the differential to a more generous unemployment insurance system. But even as that system has become less generous, the unemployment gap has continued to widen: Canada's current rate is 10%. Why? A Canadian economist, Pierre Fortin, points out that from 1992 to 1994 a startling 47% of his country's collective-bargaining agreements involved wage freezes. Most economists would agree that high-unemployment economies like Canada suffer from wage inflexibility; Mr Fortin's evidence suggests, however, that the cause of that inflexibility lies not only in structural, microeconomic problems but also in the Bank of Canada's anti-inflationary zeal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the belief that absolute price stability is a huge blessing, that it brings large benefits with few if any costs, rests not on evidence but on faith. The evidence actually points the other way: the benefits of price stability are elusive, the costs of getting there are large, and zero inflation may not be a good thing even in the long run.
</p><p><b>A shibboleth-free policy</b>
<br>Suppose you reject both the miracle cures of the growth sect and the old-time religion of the stable-price sect. What policies would you advocate?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A shibboleth-free policy might look like this. First, adopt as a long-run target fairly low but not zero inflation, say 3-4%. This is high enough to accommodate most of the real wage cuts that markets impose, while the costs of the inflation itself will still be very small. Monetary policy, however, affects inflation only with a long lag, so you also need some intermediate target. A reasonable strategy is to try to stabilise unemployment around your best estimate of the level consistent with stable inflation at the desired rate, even while recognising that such estimates are imperfect. So you should be prepared to adjust the unemployment target if inflation is worse or better than expected. And of course if past misjudgments have caused inflation to move above--or below--the target, policy must seek to bring it back into line.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This proposal will presumably bring angry objections from both sides. The growth sect will denounce it as an acceptance of defeat, insisting that the West needs higher growth to raise living standards and solve its budget problems. Unfortunately, economics is not only about what you want, it is also about what you can get. Growth may be good, but achieving it requires more than simply declaring inflation to be dead.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, the stable-price sect will denounce this strategy as irresponsible, a return to the bad old inflationary ways of the 1970s. But the strategy is not outlandish--on the contrary, it is intended to be a description of the actual policies followed by several of the world's big central banks. In particular, what I have described is close to the behaviour predicted by the "Taylor rule" . This rule, which suggests setting interest rates automatically based on a comparison of the actual and potential output of an economy, successfully tracks the policies of the Federal Reserve. (It is ironic that the Fed, whose policies are in fact more growth- and employment-oriented than any other western central bank, is the target of most of the growth sect's attacks.) But the strategy described is also arguably a pretty good description of the behaviour of other central banks, including the Bank of England and even--dare one say it?--the Bundesbank, which talks a monetarist game but rarely meets its own announced targets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course these sensible central banks will deny that they follow any such strategy. This is understandable. Anyone who has watched the press pounce on a novice central banker naive enough to speak intelligibly realises why more experienced hands prefer to cloak their actions in obscurantism and hypocrisy. But while hypocrisy has uses, it also has dangers--above all, the danger that you may start to believe the things you hear yourself saying. This is not a hypothetical possibility. Right now there are central banks--the Banks of Canada and France are obvious examples--which really seem to believe what they say about stable prices; their sincerity is costing their nations hundreds of thousands of jobs.
</p><p><b>Beyond the slogans</b>
<br>It is disturbingly easy to imagine a future in which each of the great monetary shibboleths becomes the basis of policy in a major part of the advanced world. In the United States powerful groups on both left and right now propagandise incessantly for the belief that Americans can grow their problems away; aside from raising the possibility that America will end up rediscovering the joys of stagflation, this campaign seriously weakens the country's already faltering resolve to put its fiscal house in order. But the bigger risk is probably in Europe, where--despite a far worse employment performance than in the United States--the rhetoric of price stability goes largely unchallenged, and is likely to have growing influence over actual policy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In particular, what will happen if Europe's economic and monetary union comes to pass? The new European Monetary Authority will operate under a constitution that honours price stability above all else; more important, it will feel obliged to show itself a worthy successor to the Bundesbank, which means that it will try to implement in practice the kind of policy the Bundesbank follows only in theory. The result will be that Europe's unemployment problem, which would be severe in any case, will be seriously aggravated.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Shibboleths make you feel good. They are an alternative to the pain of hard thinking and, because so many people repeat them, they offer a reassuring sense of community. But you must go beyond shibboleths, however comfortable they make you feel: monetary policy is too serious to be conducted on the basis of slogans.

<h1>The mighty fall in South Korea</h1>

<p>AS IF resigned to their fate, Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo--two former presidents of South Korea and army colleagues since their days at military academy--trudged into court on August 26th, holding hands and wearing prison uniform, to hear their sentences. There were no gasps of surprise, just an eerie silence as the judge wrapped up his two-hour statement and sentenced Mr Chun to death on charges of mutiny and treason for his role in the military coup of 1980 and the subsequent massacre of demonstrators in Kwangju. For his part in these events, Mr Roh was given a sentence of 22.5 years in prison. Outside in the drizzling rain, 600 riot police edged nervously around as a couple of dozen protesters yelled abuse and demanded a still harsher sentence for Mr Roh.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apart from their crimes against the state, the two former presidents were also found guilty of receiving huge amounts in bribes from industry while in office, and were fined more than 500 billion won ($610m) between them. Both have until September 2nd to appeal against their sentences. Thirteen of their former military cronies were also given jail terms of four to ten years for crimes perpetrated during the coup and subsequent crackdown. A dozen of the ex-presidents' former aides were given prison sentences for their roles in collecting the bribes, along with nine businessmen who were found guilty of bribery.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The eight-month court case was supposed to heal the wounds that have festered since the tragic events of 16 years ago. After the assassination in 1979 of President Park Chung Hee (himself a former general) by his security chief, Mr Chun used his position in the army to snuff out the chance of political liberalisation. Instead, supported by Mr Roh, he seized power and proceeded to expand martial law throughout South Korea, claiming that the communist regime in North Korea was planning to take advantage of the chaos and massing its troops for an attack.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The invasion from the North never came. But the coup set off student protests in the south-western city of Kwangju in May 1980. The army's bloody crackdown there officially left some 200 protesters dead. Unofficial estimates run much higher. But, faced with further widespread protests in 1987, Mr Chun resisted the temptation to resort to force again. Instead, he eventually stepped aside in favour of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Mr Roh. Benefiting from a split in the opposition, Mr Roh won South Korea's first free presidential election in 1987.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During his five-year term in office, Mr Roh won credit from his countrymen (as well as the court last week) for bolstering democracy and for improving South Korea's standing abroad. The country played host to the Olympic Games and joined the United Nations during his time in power. His friend and mentor, Mr Chun, was exiled to a distant temple in disgrace as part of a deal the two men struck in a bid to end the continuing criticism of their mutiny and suppression of civil rights. In 1992 Mr Roh stepped down, and Kim Young Sam was elected as South Korea's first civilian president in 32 years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Roh, and even Mr Chun, might eventually have been forgiven their military sins by a country grown rich and successful during their stewardship, had it not been for a scandal that broke last year. The hidden millions that Mr Roh had raised from various captains of industry came to light in October and quickly implicated Mr Chun. With both men behind bars, President Kim moved swiftly to get a special law passed that prevented the country's statute of limitations on the 1980 coup and the Kwangju incident from taking effect. The new investigation into the two incidents launched by President Kim led to the trial that started last December and culminated in this week's sentencing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The guilty verdicts were a foregone conclusion, although some were taken aback by the severity of the sentences on the ex-generals. Even more surprising were the tough prison terms received by the leading businessmen for bribery. Kim Woo Choong, the founder and chairman of Daewoo, and the heads of three other <i>chaebol</i> (industrial conglomerates), were given jail sentences of two years or more. The chairman of the Samsung group, Lee Kun Hee, had his two-year sentence suspended. All of them remain free for the time being. Daewoo's Mr Kim has just gone to China to open a new hotel and to Eastern Europe to visit his new car factories.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Big business has been rattled by the turn of events. The South Korean courts have traditionally been lenient towards businessmen charged with corruption. Their contribution to the country's prosperity has tended to excuse most misdeeds. Some believe the government is spoiling for a fight, blaming business (hypocritically) for the corruption that has long permeated politics. There is even talk that, if he avoids jail, Mr Kim may have to resign his position as chairman of Daewoo and go into exile abroad. He has run into trouble with the government on several occasions since he threatened to run against Kim Young Sam in the 1992 election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The whole trial has been shot through with accusations of political opportunism. Government critics claim the case against the two former presidents was only brought to strengthen President Kim's influence before the general election last March. Cynics have also pointed to the hurried way the case against the two ex-presidents was mounted just as serious questions were beginning to be asked about illicit payoffs that President Kim is said to have received from Mr Roh to finance his own presidential campaign. Such questions remain to be answered.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly, the prosecutions of Mr Chun and Mr Roh have helped President Kim crush the factions within the ruling party that remained loyal to the two ex-presidents. That should help him when picking a successor to run for the presidency in 1997. To ensure that he does not suffer a similar fate as his two predecessors, President Kim needs to have a friendly face in the presidential palace when he steps down. But he also needs at least to give the appearance of having handled the recent trial with dignity and fairness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one expects Mr Chun to be hanged. His lawyers are preparing his appeal, a procedure that could take the courts until next May to decide. But what if Mr Chun decides not to appeal? In his final statement in court, Mr Chun said he expected no mercy and wanted only to be the "last victim of political revenge" . Against their lawyers' advice, both Mr Chun and Mr Roh have privately hinted that they are ready to let their sentences stand. If that is what they decide to do, President Kim might then have a serious problem on his hands.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<h1>Pity the children</h1>

<p>ONE of man's nastiest vices, the sexual exploitation of children, has become an international business. An international conference has therefore gathered to ponder ways to prevent it: the World Congress on the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, which met in Stockholm this week. Like most such conferences, it was long on "global partnership" and "stronger co-operation" . But its main outcome was to expose the powerlessness of rich-country governments to root out a practice for which there is great demand.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In any given year, 1m or more children (90% of them girls) join the sex trade, some as prostitutes, some in pornography. Child prostitution is mainly but not exclusively a problem in poor countries, and the conference rightly deplored rich tourists who travel to poor countries to have sex with children. Many rich countries are making an effort to scare--or shame--their citizens into behaving decently abroad. Some airlines show videos urging vistors not to have sex with children; signs in Taiwanese hotels warn guests not to bring children to their rooms. More than a dozen countries have passed legislation allowing citizens to be prosecuted at home for crimes committed abroad.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the child-sex market is predominantly domestic: Filipino child prostitutes have more customers from the Philippines than from Japan or the West. Child prostitutes generally cater for the lower end of the market, where tourists are unlikely to trawl. International efforts to stamp out child sex must therefore take a back seat to local ones. Laws passed recently in Thailand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Brazil show that governments are getting more serious about restricting the child-sex trade, but enforcement is sporadic. It is still not unusual for child prostitutes to be arrested while their clients walk free.

<p><b>The National Lottery</b></p>
<h1>An easy-going lot</h1>

<p>WHEREAS the regulators of the privatised utilities are getting a reputation for being tough on the companies they supervise, Oflot--the National Lottery regulator--is looking like a bit of a soft touch. Last month, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee said Peter Davis, director-general of Oflot, had made "serious errors of judgment" in accepting free flights from one of the firms in the Camelot consortium, which runs the lottery. And on August 30th a report from the National Audit Office (<font size=-1>NAO</font>) criticised Oflot for being slow to carry out checks on some of Camelot's operations, and for failing to ensure that Camelot's computers are secure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>NAO</font> says that, apart from a few initial checks, it took Oflot more than a year from the lottery's launch in November 1994 to start work on a system for monitoring whether cheques drawn on Camelot's prize-payment account were all being paid to genuine winners. Progress has been slow in other areas too. Oflot is supposed to carry out an assessment of Camelot's marketing every six months, but no such assessment had been carried out almost a year after the lottery was launched.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the prizes won on the lottery fall short of an annual target laid down in Camelot's licence, the firm eventually has to hand over the difference to the funds that distribute a proportion of all lottery takings to a variety of good causes. Until then, it earns interest on the money. The <font size=-1>NAO</font> points out that this added &#163;6m to Camelot's profits of &#163;77.5m in the year to March. Last year, the House of Commons National Heritage Committee said Camelot should be made to hand over the interest as well. Camelot argues that this would require a complete renegotiation of its licence, and Oflot seems happy to accept this.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>NAO</font> also points out that the lottery's computers have crashed three times since it was launched. Punters' money was apparently not put at risk, but the report complains that no tests have been carried out to see what would happen if someone deliberately overloaded the computers or fed them false instructions to try to breach their security. Camelot says it has already done tests that exceed British Standard 7799 (which covers computer security) and that the software it uses has been widely employed in other countries' lotteries, and has so far proved resilient. Oflot accepts Camelot's assurances, and says it cannot see how the tests the <font size=-1>NAO</font> is calling for would make much difference.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The lottery has been a huge success, has raised larger sums than expected for a wide range of good causes, and has had no breaches of security. But Mr Davis would be wrong to dismiss the <font size=-1>NAO</font> report as nit-picking. If the public became worried that lottery money was at risk from computer hackers, or that Camelot was making an unreasonably big profit, there could be a big drop in the number of people taking part. Perhaps it is time for Oflot to follow in the footsteps of the electricity and gas regulators, and start taking a tougher line.

<h1>Inflated expectations</h1>

FEARS that inflation will be higher in two years' time should be taken seriously--which is why the Bank of England continues to urge Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, to consider raising interest rates soon. But it would not be astonishing if Mr Clarke's interest-rate policy were guided less by the inflation prospect for 1998 than by the predicted rate for the year to May 1997--by which time a general election will have to be held. The short-term picture may prove far rosier than the longer-term one, giving Mr Clarke all the excuse he needs not to raise interest rates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clarke has promised to bring underlying inflation (which excludes mortgage-interest payments) to an annual rate of less than 2.5% by the end of this Parliament. This measure is expected to fall in August, from 2.8% in July. Last year's jump in seasonal food prices, due to hot weather, is unlikely to be repeated. Inflation will probably be unchanged during the autumn, and then start to fall steadily from December until well after an election has been held. So reckons Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, an investment bank.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He points out that output-price inflation--inflation in the prices charged to retailers by producers--has slowed abruptly, after an even sharper fall in input-price inflation (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). Output-price inflation is now almost three percentage points lower than it was a year ago. According to Mr Saunders, on each of the seven occasions over the past 30 years when it has fallen by that much in a year, retail-price inflation has fallen over the subsequent six-months by at least 0.3 percentage points. If history repeats itself, Mr Clarke should hit his inflation target.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is not certain. Although input and output prices have soared and plunged over the past few years, underlying inflation has been remarkably stable. Partly that was due to fortuitously timed changes in indirect tax, but it also reflected retailers' varying of profit margins to smooth the impact of output-price changes. With consumer spending likely to grow strongly over the next few months, retailers may try to raise their margins. If they succeed, Mr Clarke can kiss his inflation target goodbye.

<p><b>Local councils</b></p>
<h1>Trimming the fat</h1>

<p>IN THE run-up to the budget in November, local councils will once more be pressing the government to let them increase their spending by more than the rate of inflation. Councils in England, which currently spend about &#163;50 billion a year, have already asked for permission to increase this by 5% next year. The government, desperate to keep public-sector borrowing under control, is unlikely to agree. Instead it may suggest to councils that they take a closer look at a series of recent reports by the Audit Commission, which monitors councils' finances. These suggest that there is plenty of scope for savings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The commission's most recent report, published earlier this month, is a study of the lessons garnered from audits of councils carried out in the fiscal year 1994-95. It concludes that far too many council staff are calling in sick, "an indicator of poor morale and an opportunity for significant savings". The commission found that one council in London (it does not say which) cut &#163;500,000 from its pay bill simply by monitoring absences due to "sickness" more closely. The potential savings across the country from such a measure could add up to tens of millions of pounds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The commission also says that fraud against local councils is on the increase, and urges that councils try harder to prevent it, rather than merely detecting it after the event. Auditors identified specific cases of fraud involving &#163;46m in 1994-95, although the commission believes the actual amount is far higher. A study published in January by the Department of Social Security reckoned that fraudulent claims for housing benefit (which is administered by local councils) may come to as much as &#163;1 billion a year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year another highly critical report from the Audit Commission said that councils were spending &#163;500m too much on pay, especially senior officials' pay. The report argued that, when councils' budgets are trimmed, "senior <font size=-1>HQ</font> staff often escape unscathed while the council freezes vacancies or cuts the number of front-line staff." In some councils, a junior librarian has eight levels of management above him. In the leaner ones, there are just four.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result of such poor management, councils' bills for white-collar staff rose almost twice as fast as average earnings in Britain between 1987 and 1993. Last year's report caused a rumpus, but its estimates were probably cautious. They were based on the assumption that councils could cut their pay bills by 5%; a few councils that had made a determined effort saved 10%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reluctance of many councils to get rid of their staff and to hand work over to private firms means that they are unlikely to be getting the best value for money. A study published on August 30th by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent think-tank, looked at how the cost of collecting household rubbish changed after the government forced councils to invite tenders from private firms to do the job. It found that, four years after compulsory tendering was introduced, those councils whose own workforce won the contract had cut their costs by 10%. Those who had given the contract to private firms were saving 20%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In spite of councils' protests, the government is pressing ahead with the expansion of compulsory tendering: one of the prime targets for this is councils' finance departments, which cost about &#163;2 billion a year to run. It is likely that a large proportion of this could be saved. For instance, the Audit Commission has found that it takes just two people to handle 100,000 invoices a year at some council offices; in others the same job is being done by 14 people.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One source of possible savings has so far received little attention: councils' spending on property. Birmingham council announced this month that it wanted to cut the office space it occupies by 20% this year, by encouraging more staff to work from home or to share desks. Housing-repair staff and hygiene inspectors are likely to be among the first to start working from home. The council aims to save &#163;2.5m in total over the next three years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why are so many councils hesitating to make the most of the scope they have for cutting costs? Almost all of the efficiency gains would mean job losses, and councillors have traditionally seen themselves as important providers of employment in their local area. Council staff are highly unionised, and would not accept big job cuts without a fight.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, councils suspect, with some justification, that the more they save now, the smaller the grant the government will give them in future. Since government grants provide more than 80% of councils' income, this is a considerable disincentive to making the hard decisions needed to achieve big savings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain badly needs a better way to pay for local services. The Labour Party has said it wants to restore local-government powers, but has not said much about the increased financial accountability, and autonomy, this would entail. One of its few specific proposals on the matter is to abolish compulsory competitive tendering while requiring that councils "obtain best value for local residents" --an intriguing combination. After the poll-tax fiasco, there seems to be little enthusiasm in any political party for another set of drastic reforms.

<h1>Beware Geeks bearing gifts</h1>

<p>THE Internet is well known as a pioneer when it comes to technology. Less noticed is its role on the cutting edge of management fashion. Nowadays, it is fashionable for firms to "outsource" product development to just about everybody. Leading Internet firms have developed this method a stage further: they have found an outside supplier so keen to tender his services that he is sometimes willing to pay for the privilege. The name of this fool? The consumer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ruse is based on a Greek letter. Add "beta" to the name of any software package, and your product need no longer work as it should--or at all. It can be full of bugs, crashing constantly, sometimes taking the rest of your computer with it. If it does, too bad. Expect no refund. Rather than compensate users, the software maker asks them to spend hours documenting the faults--for free.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beta software is work in progress, released provisionally. Over the past year, Microsoft and Netscape have managed to get millions of Internet surfers to download beta versions of their Web browsers and document the flaws. Netscape offered users a <font size=-1>T</font>-shirt for each serious bug they found; Microsoft offered nothing but the thrill of helping Bill Gates conquer the world.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a new twist, Microsoft even charged users $32 for the privilege of testing Windows 95 last year. Most other beta programs are free--but then so are most programs available on-line. And, unlike other free programs, beta software usually carries a time-bomb that disables it after a month or two.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So why accept it? Partly for fun. Partly because it is often the only way to keep up with the Internet. Since April, both Microsoft and Netscape have released two big upgrades of their browsers, with several beta versions in between. Web publishers adopted features from the newest beta versions to make their sites look better than the competition. Viewers with "old" versions of the browsers cannot see these innovations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Internet software firms argue that the beta system helps to speed up innovation (although many users would love to take a break from the frantic upgrade cycles). It also lets them rush out unfinished work and claim that they have developed new features ahead of their competitors. If it doesn't work, you were warned--and could you help us fix it?

<p><b>Telecoms mergers</b></p>
<h1>Two Davids join</h1>
<p><b>America's latest huge telecoms merger may lead the way to full-scale competition in its local-call market</b></p>

<p>SINCE America opened its local-telephone markets earlier this year, the mighty firms that formerly monopolised the business--the so-called Baby Bells--have been jumping into bed together with an athleticism that belies their bulk. So far, the two biggest deals have been the mergers of Bell Atlantic with Nynex (whose combined market capitalisation is $44 billion) and Pacific Telesis with <font size=-1>SBC</font> Communications ($43 billion). By this standard, the $23 billion deal that was announced on August 26th is something of a tiddler. But the merger of WorldCom, a 13-year-old long-distance carrier from Mississippi, and <font size=-1>MFS</font>, a nine-year-old Nebraskan telecoms firm, is more significant than it looks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;WorldCom and <font size=-1>MFS</font> are two of America's new breed of telecoms companies. WorldCom is the country's fourth-largest long-distance carrier, and owns thousands of miles of fibre-optic circuits. <font size=-1>MFS</font> has local fibre-optic networks in 50 American cities. Thanks to its recent acquisition of <font size=-1>UUN</font>et Technologies for $2 billion, it is also the world's largest Internet access-provider. This will make the new firm, <font size=-1>MFS</font> WorldCom, the first American telephone company since <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s break-up in 1984 to offer customers every sort of telephony: local, long-distance and (since this is 1996) Internet access.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One-stop shops are said to represent the future of the telecoms business. In the international market, firms have fallen over themselves to provide them through alliances such as Concert (which brings together Britain's <font size=-1>BT</font> and America's <font size=-1>MCI</font>), and Global One (America's Sprint, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom). Why is <font size=-1>MFS</font> WorldCom the first company to take the leap in America?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it the answer is that, until this year's Telecommunications Act, none of the big companies was allowed to offer both local and long-distance service. But although they are now free to do so, none has rushed in. The reason is that the law treats full entry into the local market by any company that is not a Baby Bell as a trigger that allows the Bells to invade the long-distance carriers' turf. None of the long-distance companies has wanted to face this unprepared. Hence their interest in less-than-full entry into local-call markets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the new law, a potential competitor has three ways to enter the local-telephone market. It can buy the Baby Bells' local service at rates guaranteed to be 17-25% less than the price the Baby Bells charge their customers, and then resell it to its own customers. It can lease parts of the local network &#224; la carte, for instance by hiring the local Bell's wires but providing its own switches; the Federal Communications Commission then says how much the Bells can charge. Or it can try to build its own rival network.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first of these--resale--is easy but hardly profitable. A long-distance firm hoping to win local-calling business would probably have to offer customers at least a 15% discount to switch. Take out marketing and other costs, and that leaves little or no profit. A would-be competitor might use such cheap local calling as a loss-leader to sell customers an all-in-one telecoms package, including other more profitable services such as long-distance calling. But every time customers called for repairs and found a worker from the local Baby Bell at their door, one-stop-shopping would seem a bit of a sham.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The &#224; la carte option offers a competitor the opportunity of fat margins on the parts of the job it does itself. But it leaves the newcomer dangerously dependent on its main competitor for other services. Even if the Baby Bells try to be scrupulously honest in their dealings with such intruders, they may not be very good at it. As Dan Reingold, a telecoms analyst for Merrill Lynch, an investment bank, puts it: "You go into a restuarant that has always served a set meal that never varies and now you want to pick <font size=-1>A</font> from this menu and <font size=-1>B</font> from that. You wouldn't be surprised if they delivered the wrong dish to the wrong table."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third option--for a competitor to build its own network--is the surest but also the most expensive. It is relatively cheap to lay a few long-distance lines, but wiring every home costs a fortune. Moreover, this is where the trigger comes in. The new law says that if a Baby Bell faces a significant "facilities-based" competitor (ie, one with large networks of its own) it is allowed to enter the long-distance market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, Sprint and <font size=-1>MCI</font>, the big three long-distance companies, this has, until recently, seemed a reason for caution. Their basic plan has been to experiment with the &#224; la carte and resale options first. However, as the limits of these two approaches have become clearer, the advantages of building networks from scratch have increased.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With its new merger, WorldCom has a head start. <font size=-1>MFS</font> has already built more local telephone networks than any firm except the Baby Bells (and <font size=-1>GTE</font>, which acts like a Bell). Even so, the new firm's local-telephone networks will still be well short of the level needed to trigger the Bells' entry into the long-distance market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By using <font size=-1>MFS</font>'s local networks, WorldCom will be able to bypass the local-access charges it pays to local-telephone companies in those regions, saving it as much as $400m a year. Likewise, among <font size=-1>MFS</font>'s highest costs are the charges it racks up sending calls long-distance between the cities in which it operates. After the merger, it will be able to transmit these on WorldCom's lines, saving up to $40m a year. And <font size=-1>UUN</font>et, <font size=-1>MFS</font>'s Internet subsidiary, will be able to shave up to 50% from its running costs by using WorldCom's lines.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now attention is turning to Teleport, an Oregon-based telecoms firm, which has put $1.2 billion worth of local networks in the ground--just 10% less than <font size=-1>MFS</font>. Teleport's share price has risen 50% in the past month. The question is not whether it will be snapped up, but which long-distance firm will be the one to do it.

<html><head><title>Which Bill Clinton?</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></p>

<h1><center>Which Bill Clinton?</center></h1>

HE NOW has more yesterdays, he says, than tomorrows. Given that the speaker was one William Jefferson Clinton, election-campaigner <i>extraordinaire</i>, it can safely be assumed that such melancholy was intended only as a reflection on the passing of his 50th birthday and not also on his prospects for a second four-year term in the White House. His opinion-poll lead over the Republican challenger, Bob Dole, may have narrowed appreciably during the Republican Party's convention in San Diego, but next week President Clinton has the chance to widen it again with his own party's spell in the camera lens, at the Democrats' convention in Chicago. Mr Clinton's position remains strong. But he has some weaknesses to overcome.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chief among them is his own lack of consistency. The joke made by a senior adviser to Mr Dole, that the much-touted differences between Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, his running-mate, are less than those between Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton, rings uncomfortably true. For sure, Mr Dole is also vulnerable to the charge of inconsistency, for a man once contemptuous of tax-cutting "supply-side" economics is now running on exactly that platform. Mr Clinton can, and should, exploit this, and point to the fact that if Mr Dole really intends to cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time he will need to trim back public-spending programmes which he claims will be preserved. Yet the trouble is that Mr Dole's underlying image, of experience, humility, even staidness, is likely to reassure. The abiding impression produced by Mr Clinton's inconsistency does not.
</p><p><b>His biggest weakness</b>
<br>It is that you never know what you are getting with Bill Clinton. In political terms he has posed as a New Democrat, an Old Democrat and now, in effect, a moderate Republican. His style has swung even more violently: at times he has been a clever, energetic activist; an undisciplined, sometimes disloyal leader; a man of principle; a man of pragmatism; an idealist determined to set a moral course for foreign policy; a realist intent on defending American interests; a man who talks to terrorists; a man who condemns them. A guessing game is under way to divine how a second-term Clinton might behave (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>); revealingly, the clues lie more in the constraints surrounding him than in the man himself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This, rather than scandals about sex or money, is likely to become the real "character" issue in this election campaign. Mr Clinton is a likeable man, good at empathising with ordinary people, excellent at waxing presidential at times of national tragedy. But can you trust a man who has changed his stance so often? Do you even know what you are voting for?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton's task, beginning with his speech formally accepting his party's nomination, will be to challenge these doubts, to re-interpret them, even to redefine this weakness as a strength. This he must do by stressing that there is no shame in learning from your mistakes, that the whole point about experience is that it makes you change your ways. In that cause his half-century, with its associated implications of maturity and greyer hair, has proved uncannily timely.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, voters will still have to be convinced that the change is for real. Fortunately, the two areas in which the Republicans are likely to focus their attacks are also areas in which experience can usefully be displayed. The first is economic policy. Mr Dole's claim, typical for a challenger, is that America's economy is growing too slowly, that wages are stagnant, and that he has a magic bullet with which to improve things. The Old Clinton would not only respond by rubbishing Mr Dole's bullet; he would also try to find one of his own. The Experienced Clinton should react differently: the economy can and must grow faster, he can say, but there is no painless way to make this happen overnight. Taxes must be reformed to boost incentives and encourage savings; regulatory thickets must be hacked away; a president must stimulate, and co-operate with, state and local governments to improve education. Fiscal stability is an essential backdrop for this task--and would be threatened by the Dole plan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second opportunity for Mr Clinton to try to prove that he has matured lies in foreign affairs. This poses a harder task, for a strong, clear position in matters of defence and foreign policy has of late been more naturally associated with Republican presidents (Nixon, Reagan, Bush) than with Democrats (Carter, Clinton). And it is traditionally assumed that elections are won more on domestic issues than by foreign entanglements; indeed, Mr Clinton ran and won on exactly that proposition in 1992. Yet foreign policy is where presidential character counts for most: not character as saintliness, but character as decisiveness, as clarity of thought and deed, as an ability to set priorities, as calm leadership at times of crisis.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Experienced Clinton will not be wishing for a crisis in which to prove himself. But he must nevertheless show that he has learned his foreign lessons, by defining the challenges America faces, and defining his priorities--such as security in Asia rather than human rights in China--to show that he now knows when not to intervene as well as when to act. For what is needed above all in foreign policy is consistency: needed by foreigners, so that they know what to expect; needed by Americans, so that they know why American money is being spent, or lives lost. And needed, more than anyone, by Bill Clinton.

<p><h2>Kremlin chaos</h2></p>
<p><p>A bloodbath loomed in <b>Chechnya</b>, then seemed to recede, as another shaky ceasefire collapsed and Russian forces prepared to take back parts of the republic's capital, Grozny, captured by rebels earlier this month. Boris Yeltsin's defence adviser, Alexander Lebed, made a last-ditch attempt to stave off a resumption of full-scale war.
<p><b>Mr Yeltsin's health</b> continued to cause worry. After being invisible since his inauguration on August 9th, the president appeared on television and was reported to be working in the Kremlin. But it was unclear whether he was making day-to-day decisions. Mr Lebed suggested that the president's signature on an important decree on Chechnya had been faked.
<p>The five Nordic nations said they supported the efforts of the three <b>Baltic</b> <b>countries </b>to join <font size=-1>NATO</font>, though two of the Nordics, Finland and Sweden, are not members themselves. The chancellor of hitherto neutral Austria, Franz Vranitzky, said his country was in no hurry to join.
<p><b>Greece</b>'s Socialist prime minister, Costas Simitis, was expected to call an early general election, hoping to strengthen his parliamentary position.
<p>Magistrates in northern Italy want to investigate <b>Umberto Bossi</b>, leader of the separatist Northern League, on the ground that some of his speeches could have incited his followers to assault opponents of his party.
<p>The United States appears reluctant to <b>renegotiate the rent </b>for its 18th-century official residence in Moscow, fixed in 1985 at 70,000 roubles. Then it was worth about $60,000; inflation has whittled that down to $13.</p>
<p><h2>The Taiwan thorn</h2></p>
<p><p>Taiwan's relations with China were again under a cloud after President Lee Teng-hui suggested <b>slowing down investment </b>in China, which has amounted to $30 billion over the past eight years. China offered to resume direct shipping links and start political talks. But the Chinese were riled when the Taiwanese deputy president, Lien Chan, turned up in Europe, possibly seeking business and diplomatic ties.
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>In unprecedented scenes of violence before the government presented its budget, <b>Australia</b>'s Parliament building in Canberra was attacked by several thousand people protesting against proposed trade-union reforms and cuts in government spending. But the stringent budget, which included a 10% cut in foreign aid, was welcomed by the markets.
<p>South Korean police stormed a Seoul university, arresting more than 5,000 students demanding <b>unification </b>with North Korea and the withdrawal of American troops.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>The Philippine president, Fidel Ramos, and a Muslim leader, Nur Misuari, agreed on a deal designed to end 25 years of <b>civil war in Mindanao</b>, which has claimed more than 100,000 lives.
<p>The <b>Thai government </b>of Banharn Silpa-archa was under threat after the opposition proposed to censure him for alleged corruption and mismanagement.</p>
<p><h2>Apartheid apology</h2></p>
<p><p>The former president of South Africa, F.W. de Klerk, told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that he was sorry for <b>human-rights violations </b>under apartheid, but said he had never sanctioned killings.
<p>Thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees fled from camps in <b>Burundi </b>claiming persecution by the army. Thousands of Zairean Tutsis, their citizenship denied, were driven out of eastern Zaire.
<p>Riots in southern Jordan, after the government more than doubled the <b>bread price</b>, were suppressed by the security forces. King Hussein's hints at Iraqi involvement were greeted with scepticism.
<p>Fighting between <b>Kurdish</b> <b>factions </b>broke out in northern Iraq. One of the factions, led by Massoud Barzani, claimed Iran was helping the other, led by Jalal Talabani.
<p>Palestinians rejected the suggestion that Israel's long overdue redeployment in <b>Hebron</b> should be linked to the closure of Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem.
<p>A former Iranian president, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, claimed that the Iranian regime was planning to <b>assassinate </b>him. He was testifying in Berlin at the trial of five men accused of murdering members of the Iranian Kurdish opposition.</p>
<p><h2>The third man</h2></p>
<p><p><b>Ross Perot</b>, founder and bankroller of the Reform Party, won his party's nomination for president and said this time he would take federal matching funds for his campaign, rather than rely (as in 1992) on his own fortune.
<p>America's Green Party nominated<b> Ralph Nader</b>, a free-spirited consumer advocate, as its candidate for president. Mr Nader said he did not want any federal money for his campaign, and also declared that he would not run on the Green Party's platform.
<p>In <b>Peru</b>, a congressional committee backed a reform that might let President Alberto Fujimori win a third term.
<p>Tax rises proposed by <b>Argentina's</b> new economics minister led theoretically pro-government trade unions to threaten a fresh general strike. But gunfire disrupted a meeting to fix the details.
<p>An era ended in the <b>Dominican Republic</b>: right-wing President Joaquin Balaguer handed over, at the age of 88, after seven terms of office, to right-winger Leonel Fernandez, who promised wide-ranging privatisation.

<p><h2>Buba relents</h2>
<p><p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>The <b>German Bundesbank </b>trimmed its key short-term repo rate by 0.3% to 3%. The news helped to relieve pressure on the French franc, encouraging the Bank of France also to cut its intervention rate by 0.2% to 3.35%. The Federal Reserve had earlier decided to leave American short-term rates unchanged.
<p>Shares in <b>tobacco companies</b> fell yet again, on news that President Clinton was about to approve the Food and Drug Administration's proposals to regulate tobacco as a drug.</p>
<p><h2>Latin foray</h2></p>
<p><p><b>Chrysler</b>, the smallest of America's big three car makers, is venturing further into Latin America. It has announced a new $315m factory in Brazil to assemble pick-up trucks and build diesel engines, and another $65m investment to expand its $100m car plant in Argentina.
<p>Germany's smallest car maker, <b>Porsche</b>, which is looking for a partner to help finance a move away from luxury sports cars and into upmarket sports utilities, is talking to Mercedes-Benz. For Mercedes, which is about to produce a sports utility of its own in Alabama for America's buoyant market for such vehicles, the benefits are unclear--other than to take up slack capacity in some of its factories.
<p>First-half profits at <b>Volvo</b>, Sweden's biggest car maker, fell by 28% to SKr3.9 billion ($590m). The firm's car unit seems to be turning round; but its overall results were hit by losses at its American lorry-making arm.
<p>The Dutch government confirmed that Samsung Aerospace of South Korea is again visiting The Hague to discuss buying <b>Fokker</b>. The aircraft maker collapsed in March after its main shareholder, Deutsche Aerospace, pulled out.</p>
<p><h2>Heir today</h2></p>
<p><p><b>AT&T</b>'s heir-apparent quit suddenly, leaving America's long-distance telephone giant searching for another president and <font size=-1>CEO</font>. Alex Mandl, who was number two in the group for less than a year, was tempted away by the challenge of running a new wireless-communications venture.
<p><b>Coca-Cola's coup</b> in persuading Cisneros Bottling in Venezuela to switch allegiance from <b>PepsiCo</b> has boosted Coca-Cola's 10-15% share of the country's (admittedly small) soft-drinks market to 60%. A stunned PepsiCo said the move by Cisneros was illegal; Cisneros complained that PepsiCo had rejected its expansion plans.
<p>The battle for the <b>Internet </b>heated up further. Ten of America's biggest technology and communications companies agreed to set up a $100m venture-capital fund to finance start-ups developing products that use Java, an Internet programming language. Noticeably absent was Microsoft, which is promoting a competing standard.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Meanwhile, <b>Netscape</b>, which is battling with Microsoft for control of the market for Web browsers, accused the software giant of antitrust violations. It claims that Microsoft is charging some <font size=-1>PC</font> makers more for the Windows 95 operating system if they include Netscape's browser with their machines.
<p>(See <a href="wtw3.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>America's trade deficit</b> (in goods and services) with China overtook its deficit with Japan for the first time. The June figures showed that the deficit with China rose by nearly 9% in the month to $3.33 billion. The deficit with Japan grew only 3.6%, to $3.24 billion, down from the $5.34 billion it stood at a year ago. Overall, America's trade gap in June was some 24% narrower than a year earlier, at $8.11 billion.
<p>Pre-tax profits at <b>BSkyB</b> jumped by 66% to &#163;257m ($398m) in the year to end-June, with new subscribers rising by 900,000 to 5.5m in Britain and Ireland. The satellite broadcaster's revenues rose 30%, squeaking above &#163;1 billion for the first time.
<p>Germany's <b>Hoechst</b>, through its AgrEvo agrichemical unit, is taking over <b>Plant Genetic Systems </b>in a two-stage deal that values the Dutch-Belgian research group at around DM1 billion ($672m). The deal, said Hoechst, gives it "critical mass" in plant biotechnology, and puts paid to speculation that Hoechst was losing interest in agriculture.
<p><b>Alan Bond</b>, a one-time tycoon who won the America's Cup yacht race for Australia in 1983, was jailed for three years for fraud. The ownership of Manet's painting, "La Promenade" , had been shifted to benefit a private family company to the detriment of Bond Corp. Another former Australian tycoon, John Elliott, was acquitted on charges of defrauding the Elders group.
<p>The break-up of Britain's Thorn <font size=-1>EMI</font> into two separately listed companies brought two different reactions from investors.<b> EMI Group</b> quickly saw its share price leap as investors reckoned the now unencumbered music company was not only a good investment but could also be ripe for a bid. Shares in <b>Thorn</b>, the consumer-rentals side of the business, went the other way.
<p>Two of America's biggest companies in the fast-growing <b>manufactured-homes market </b>are coming together. Champion Enterprises of Michigan is paying about $328m for Dallas-based Redman Industries.
<p>One of the biggest property developers in the world, Texas-based <b>Hines</b>, paid <font size=-1>MACIF</font>, a French insurer, about FFr1.5 billion ($295m) for a 50% stake in seven shopping centres, one of which will be the largest covered mall in Europe.

<h1><center>Wobbly tigers</center></h1>
<p><b>East Asia's economies are experiencing growing pains</b></p>

TO EXCITED onlookers, the East Asian tigers seem to be tiring. Their export growth has slowed. Several are running alarming current-account deficits; some currencies have come under speculative assault. Attacks of political jitters, ranging from Seoul to Jakarta, make matters worse. Some foreign investors are nervously asking whether more Mexican meltdowns could be in the making (see <a href="fn1.html">page</a>). Others have concluded that the miracle years, at least, are over.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recent figures lend the pessimists some plausibility. Thailand's exports rose only 7% in value in the first half of this year, compared with a 27% rise last year. China's exports have actually fallen. Malaysia and Thailand look like running current-account deficits of 10% and 8% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> respectively this year--similar to the deficit that undid Mexico. Across the region growth forecasts are being whittled down. This is grist to the mill not just of current gloomsters, but also of those who argue that the East Asian "miracle" was always a myth, based not on genuine leaps in efficiency but on huge and unsustainable increases in capital and labour inputs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the pessimism is premature. In the long run, East Asian growth will almost certainly slow, as economies mature; but that run is still some way off. The tigers' current ills should be temporary, caused in part by weaker demand in the rich world, and in part by easily rectified policy mistakes at home. Sluggish demand in Europe and a stock overhang in America have cut demand for electronic goods--a big chunk of East Asian exports--just as over-capacity has depressed semiconductor prices. The recent rise in the dollar, to which many Asian currencies are in effect pegged, has eroded the tigers' competitiveness. Yet even after these have been reflected in downward growth revisions, East Asia will remain by far the world's fastest-growing region.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More disturbing than any of these ills has been the intemperate response of some governments. The Malaysian prime minister has hinted at import controls on non-essential goods. South Korea and Thailand have begun official campaigns to discourage luxury imports. Such prescriptions treat the symptoms, not the disease, and they could have dangerous side-effects in economies that are highly dependent on free trade. Ministers would do better to tighten their monetary and fiscal belts than to toss out their Italian ties.
</p><p><b>Chasing their tails</b>
<br>Two key distinctions between East Asia and Mexico are that Asians save more than Mexicans, and that their current-account deficits reflect an investment boom, not a spending spree. Yet investment is not always good (any more than consumption is always bad). Foreign-financed investment will pay only if it boosts countries' long-term export potential and so generates enough income to repay the debt. Several current projects--Malaysia's new administrative capital or the world's tallest building in Kuala Lumpur among them--look unlikely to do that.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even more seriously, exchange-rate policy has often undermined monetary control by making it hard to raise interest rates. Most East Asian governments have held their exchange rates low to keep exports competitive. But heavy inflows of capital in recent years have caused rapid monetary expansion, which has in turn triggered inflation or higher imports. Easier money has also facilitated unwise investment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The correct cure is for governments to run even tighter fiscal policies to dampen domestic demand, and to unshackle their currencies. Thanks to current market nervousness, some currencies, such as the Thai baht, would probably fall at first. But in the medium term they would be likely to rise; unlike the Mexican peso in 1994, most East Asian currencies are undervalued. That may sound counterintuitive when their economies are running massive current-account deficits, but these reflect an excess of investment over domestic savings, not an overvalued exchange rate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What about East Asian governments' fears that exchange-rate appreciation could further hammer their exports? Japan shows that this need not happen. Its exchange rate has risen strongly over the past two decades, with, until recently, few ill-effects on exports. Indeed, it is normal for emerging economies that are seeing rapid productivity growth to experience a rise in their real exchange rates. This can come about via higher inflation or, better, through an appreciation in the nominal exchange rate. Hobbled tigers may easily trip over; free tigers are less likely to.

<h1>Modesty ablaze</h1>

<p><b>In a new book this week, and at the Democratic convention next, Bill Clinton is putting his grand vision for leading America into the next millennium. Translated into practical policy, his agenda looks unambitious</b></p>


<p>NOT for Bill Clinton a quiet family gathering to mark his 50th birthday. No, on the eve of his birthday last Sunday the president celebrated with cocktails for 200 at the Sheraton in New York, a glitzy gala at Radio City (linked by satellite to parties at 89 other places), and finished up with a modest $10,000-a-plate dinner for 700 at the Waldorf-Astoria. There was a jumbo cake and a jumble of celebrities--Whoopi Goldberg, Tony Bennett, Aretha Franklin, Kenny Rogers, Shania Twain and many more. There was also the obligatory Clintonian tear, shed as his elementary-school teacher from Hot Springs, Arkansas recalled how she gave a busybody Clinton, aged seven, a <font size=-1>C</font> for conduct.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here, you might think, was a fitting reflection of what America has learnt to associate with Clintonism: entertaining and irrepressible, yet prone to excess and full of baby-boomer self-indulgence. And inseparable from politics. The festivities raised an estimated $10m for the Democratic Party. But Mr Clinton is hard to pigeon-hole. Lest his partying seem a tad too ostentatious, he humbly spent his actual birthday with his vice-president rebuilding a burnt-down black church in Tennessee.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The president's half-century is emblematic in a subtler way. At 50, he looks different from the boyish Mr Fizz who came to the White House effervescent with energy and ideas; the face bears more lines, the hair is greyer, the eyes seem more sunken. He jokes about being eligible for membership of the American Association for Retired Persons. He reflects wistfully that being 50 means "more yesterdays than tomorrows". Ironically, the president (as well as his much older challenger) is having to contemplate the limits of age.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And his presidency has had to adjust to the age of limits. The office has given Mr Clinton a painful lesson in the politics of scarcity. He came to the White House bearing too many promises that he could not deliver. He was the self-advertised agent of change who became a veto-wielding change-resister, bent on restraining Republican revolutionaries. He championed a 1,400-page health-care reform, one of the greatest expansions of federal power since the New Deal, only to declare the era of big government over and to end the federal guarantee of welfare for the poor that had existed since before he was born.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three powerful constraints have been at work. First, Mr Clinton won in 1992 with only 43% of the popular vote, a relatively weak mandate. It should have led him to reach across the party divide to build support for his proposals. Instead, Democrats in Congress persuaded him even before he reached the White House that they could work without Republican help. Mr Clinton's reward for overreaching was the rejection of his health-care plan and a fist in the face from voters, who in 1994 gave Republicans control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hence the second constraint: a Republican-run Congress that has largely set the agenda since early 1995. Mr Clinton turned out to be rather adept in his new role of counter-puncher to the Republicans. Still, to paraphrase the president, the era of big Clinton proposals was over.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Big proposals anyway tend not to come cheap, and in deficit-cutting times money is hard to find. The federal budget is the third big constraint on Mr Clinton. Once the federal government has paid for defence, debt interest and its commitments to health care for the elderly and other "entitlements", less than one-fifth of the budget remains for discretionary spending. Not much there for a would-be government activist like Mr Clinton to play with.
</p><p><b>Clinton being Clinton</b>
<br>All this should help to concentrate the minds of people puzzling over the sort of president Mr Clinton would be if he were to win another term in November (as polls still predict, see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>). In Washington, it is fashionable to begin such speculation by wondering how Mr Clinton would behave when, for once, he no longer had to think about his next election. He has been running for some office or other ever since, as a 16-year-old, he worked the dormitories at Camp Robinson in Arkansas to be elected one of his state's "senators" to the Boys Nation in Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>. This year Mr Clinton never actually bothered to make a formal announcement of his re-election bid; it hardly seemed necessary for a president often caricatured as running a "permanent campaign" anyway.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If he wins, runs the speculation, could Clinton finally be Clinton? And what would that mean? Over the past four years he has variously seemed a New Democrat, an Old Democrat, and even an imitation Republican. He has been ill-disciplined and tightly controlled, a reformer and protector of the status quo. Republicans fantasise that an unfettered Clinton would be a liberal (to non-Americans, a social democrat) like his wife, Hillary, or his deputy chief of staff, Harold Ickes. Others fondly believe that he would be an unabashed centrist like Dick Morris, a consultant who has masterminded his return to favour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such speculation is fun but largely fruitless (given the difficulty of tying down a man who is fraternising with stars one day and banging nails into church beams the next). It also misses the point, which is that even a Clinton free of campaign calculus would in all probability face much the same constraints that have shaped his first four years in the White House. In a three-way race, polls now show him gravitating back towards 43% of the vote. The chances that the Democrats will recapture both houses of Congress are slim (see <a href="am1.html">page</a>). And the budget arithmetic remains as stubborn as ever.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So detective work on a second-term Clinton starts with these constraints and then looks for other clues. Clues come from the pattern of other second-term presidencies, from Mr Clinton's record in his first term, from his agenda for another and from his new book "Between Hope and History" (Times Books). Taken together, they point to a curious hybrid, a mixture of Millennium Bill, orator-in-chief for a dawning "age of possibility", and Modesty Bill, born-again incrementalist in an age of constraint.
</p><p><b>If at first you succeed, try again</b></b>
<br>From George Washington to Ronald Reagan, the experience of presidential second terms has often been poor. The pattern is of disappointment or downright failure: re-elected Eisenhower achieved little; Nixon resigned in disgrace; the Reagan revolution happened in his first year. It is all too easy to see how a second-term Clinton could conform to the pattern.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scandals such as Watergate and Iran-Contra are all too common in second terms. And with Whitewater and several similar matters unresolved, it does not take much to imagine a re-elected Clinton engulfed by scandal. The Clintonites hope they might have got some of these second-term blues out of the way in their first term. But since an independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, is still sifting through the evidence of Whitewater and the rest, that hope may be vain. The problem that scandal reveals is often hubris, a sense among people in a re-elected administration that they can now do anything they want--like pack the Supreme Court, to take the example of Franklin Roosevelt. Who would think the Clinton White House to be hubris-free?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are other pitfalls. Staff turnover tends to be high, and sometimes highly disruptive. The Reagan White House lost much of its effectiveness with the appointment of Donald Regan as chief of staff. The day after Nixon's re-election in 1972, his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, demanded letters of resignation from all cabinet officers and sub-cabinet appointees. It would be no surprise to see a big exodus of exhausted veterans of the first Clinton term.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second-term presidents are wont to think increasingly about their place in history, and accordingly gravitate more and more towards foreign policy. That has already begun to happen with Mr Clinton, prompted by the loss of initiative in domestic policy to the Republican Congress. Conventional wisdom says second-termers have about two years to get any serious domestic legislation done, after which they become lame ducks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is awkward, for second-termers may lack the agenda and the verve for swift action. Most are returned to office not for what they promise to do but for what they have already done. As Chuck Jones of the University of Wisconsin observes, the past three re-elections (Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan) have been strikingly similar: they were "approval elections", in which the president wins overwhelmingly while an opposing Congress is also voted back. Now, voters seem to like the job done by President Clinton and the Republican Congress, after initial stand-offs and government shutdowns. In a recent poll by <font size=-1>USA </font>Today/<font size=-1>CNN</font>/Gallup, 64% said they counted Mr Clinton's first term a success.
</p><p><b>The record so far</b>
<br>History, then, suggests that, even if he is re-elected, Mr Clinton's finest achievements may already be behind him. No matter. In "Clinton: The President They Deserve" (Fourth Estate, forthcoming), Martin Walker of Britain's <i>Guardian</i> newspaper argues that Mr Clinton has already achieved nothing less than a post-cold-war reordering of America's policy consensus. During his presidency, Mr Walker claims, Democrats and Republicans have come round to broadly similar views about leaner and meaner government at home, and free trade abroad. Mr Clinton read and (not surprisingly) admired Mr Walker's book.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The depth of this consensus is open to argument. So is whether Democrats or Republicans deserve most credit for it. But what is certain is that over the past four years Mr Clinton has come to adopt (or co-opt) some core Republican policies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True, the process has often been chaotic. Mr Clinton campaigned as a social conservative but soon got bogged down in issues such as gays in the military and political correctness in cabinet appointments. For too long, the Clinton White House was a place of rambling meetings, run by a president who talked too much, tried to please too many people and micro-managed too many decisions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His policy reversals were numerous and ignominious. Having promised a middle-class tax cut, he raised taxes (only to let slip long afterwards that he thought he had raised them too much). He promoted a $30-billion stimulus package, which he later privately derided as "pure pork". (Thankfully, the pig was killed by Republicans in Congress.) His welfare reform arrived too late and, he subsequently confessed, was too weak. After projecting budget deficits as far as the eye could see, he suddenly converted to the Republican cause of a balanced budget by 2002. Above all, he saw health-care reform--the country's most urgent priority, he said, and his central piece of legislation--go down in flames.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Mr Clinton has also shown himself to be resilient and capable of learning on the job. In foreign affairs, he has grown into the job through his stumble into Haiti (a tentative success) and his better-late-than-never intervention in Bosnia (ditto). He bravely defied public opinion to come to Mexico's aid in 1995. His peacemaking efforts in the Middle East and Northern Ireland have run into trouble, but he has gained kudos for trying. Few would have thought it when he came to power--and fewer still after America's public humiliation in Somalia--but it is no longer absurd to talk of Mr Clinton as a foreign-policy president.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At home, he has discovered a gift for sounding presidential at times of national tragedy, such as the bombing in Oklahoma City and the crash of <font size=-1>TWA </font>flight 800. He has learnt to use the presidential bully pulpit to talk eloquently about social issues, especially race. And over time, with both Democratic and Republican Congresses, he has signed a swathe of legislation, ranging from gun controls to health-care portability, and rises in the earned-income tax credit and the minimum wage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result is that Mr Clinton's record of achievement so far looks better than that of his Democratic presidential predecessor, Jimmy Carter. Three big pieces of legislation stand out. True, two of them--the passage of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (<font size=-1>NAFTA</font>) in 1993 and the recent welfare reform ("ending welfare as we know it")--were Republican-inspired and involved the president in an agonising confrontation with his own political supporters. But it took Mr Clinton to deliver enough Democratic votes for these measures, much as it took Nixon to go to China. The third, the budget battle of 1993, Mr Clinton won by the thinnest possible margin against unified Republican opposition. It was the basis of a fiscally prudent macroeconomic strategy that has paid off.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the Clinton administration, the budget deficit has shrunk by more than half and (with a little help from American enterprise and Alan Greenspan's Fed) the economy has grown steadily, while inflation has remained in check. Americans have created more than 10m new jobs and unemployment, 7.1% of the workforce when Mr Clinton came to power, is down to 5.4%. The stockmarket has soared and the "misery index"--the unemployment, inflation and interest rates combined--is the lowest for nearly three decades.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a decent record, but one that leaves Mr Clinton curiously short of ideas for the next four years. He has become the don't-rock-the-boat candidate, a bulwark against Republican excess. He has been criss-crossing the country with a collection of small but popular initiatives, promoting school uniforms or youth curfews, or brokering deals that give free cellular telephones to neighbourhood-watch schemes or give parents more control over what their children see on television. Little presidential initiatives seem to go down big: Mr Clinton's espousal of family leave (rules requiring firms to give parents time off for say, taking their children to the doctor) have been immensely popular.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the Democratic Party he leads calls for smaller government and for a "moderate, achievable, commonsense agenda". In the age of limits, Mr Clinton has scaled himself back to the point where he no longer has any Big Idea. He is Modesty Bill.
</p><p><b>The agenda</b>
<br>That is not the way the president presents himself, of course. At the Democratic convention, he will bundle up his little ideas into something grander, complete with the vision thing. Happily for him, a second term would take him into 2001. Enter Millennium Bill, ready to define the quality of life Americans want in the 21st century.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And what might that be? Peace and prosperity, apparently. The two are related in the Clintonian vision: peace abroad requires a robust American economy. So a second term would see Mr Clinton galloping after various peace-making initiatives and adding new ones where opportunity arose, say, in Cyprus (presumably, he will have a more vigorous foreign-policy team to help him do this).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for prosperity, in his new book, Mr Clinton reiterates his familiar mantra: "opportunity, responsibility, community". In so far as this meant anything in the first term, it boiled down to putting America's macro-economy into some sort of order. The second term, says the president's spokesman, Michael McCurry, would be about the micro-economy--about pay cheques and the details that affect "real" living standards.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The budget-balancing effort would continue, but education--which White House officials dub the key to higher living standards--would be at the heart of Clinton-2. Here the president has a blizzard of proposals: a $1,500 tax credit to help give all Americans the chance of at least two years in college; more money for public-school infrastructure and for pre-school programmes; encouragement for schemes that put computers in classrooms and keep schools safe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sensible as this sounds, there is only so much that a president can do for education, which is mainly the responsibility of state and local governments. The federal government controls only 6% of America's education budget. Mr Clinton's own Treasury Department reckons that the best way to improve living standards for the middle classes is to have policies--such as further trade liberalisation--which make sense for the economy as a whole.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton might go for a bit more incremental health-care reform. He would like to promote portable pensions and campaign-finance reform (especially if Ross Perot, a third-party candidate, runs strongly on the issue). But overall it is the modesty of the once-expansive Mr Clinton's agenda that is so striking.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will he be content for things to stay that way? The activist in him (and in Hillary) will surely seek outlets. If the era of big government is over, for example, might he not explore the possibilities of "smart" government? He has talked of "a different kind of government activism", of "rule-making", of a president's scope for doing "an awful lot of things by executive action" . The danger in this is that the president would revert to the sort of busybody behaviour that earned him a <font size=-1>C</font> for conduct back in second grade. He might become a meddler burdening his country with rules that cost money and, perhaps, intrude on civil liberties.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An alternative possibility could lie in another characteristic that affects second-term presidents: the tendency to focus on their place in history. Such long-term thinking has not been much in evidence in Clinton-1. But it might conceivably lead Clinton-2 to begin the necessary debate on reforming Social Security and other entitlements which threaten to cripple American taxpayers in the next century. Launching a reform of such magnitude would be unpopular and politically perilous. That is why it is conspicuously absent from his book. But it is the towering task for a true 21st-century president.

<h1>The speaker vanishes</h1>


<font size=1>SKIPPACK, PENNSYLVANIA</font>

ONE of the more substantial stories of the recent Republican convention in San Diego was that Newt Gingrich, the radical Speaker of the House, had done a disappearing act. Early this year, after Mr Gingrich's drive to balance the budget had resulted in a government shutdown, polls suggested that his unpopularity surpassed that of Richard Nixon during Watergate. So Mr Gingrich spoke only briefly in San Diego, and not during prime time. The stage was occupied instead by moderate Republicans more likely to charm undecided voters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gingrich's vanishing has nothing on Jon Fox, a Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania. On August 15th Mr Fox's campaign manager, Linda Gerhard, told your correspondent that she was not sure where her candidate was. On August 16th she said the same. The next day--a Saturday, and so a prime campaigning day--she professed unchanging ignorance. A couple of hours later, your correspondent attended an agricultural fair in Mr Fox's district. Funnily enough, the missing congressman was there as well, tugging at a poor goat's udders in a speed-milking competition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides dodging the press, Mr Fox has grown wary of meetings with constituents. He generally gets on well with local folk, and was once pronounced (by the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>) "the zen master of constituency service". But Mr Fox is no longer loved by all, thanks to his links to the disappearing Mr Gingrich. Last year Mr Fox supported the speaker's plan to rein in the cost of Medicare, the health programme for the old. Enraged pensioners have heckled Mr Fox, and picketed his meetings. They have driven a steamroller up to his door, a gentle appeal not to steam-roll senior citizens. Now Mr Fox's staff refuses to tell callers where he plans to speak, lest seniors heckle him again. His tea ceremonies have become almost private affairs, with carefully selected audiences.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such Republican disappearances encourage Democrats to talk of winning back the House of Representatives this November. Two years ago, with Mr Gingrich very much in view, the Republicans took control of the House for the first time since 1952. They managed this by turning a host of disparate local campaigns into a national referendum on the unpopular President Clinton. Now, however, Mr Clinton's standing has improved, and his place as public demon has been taken by Mr Gingrich. This is what gives the Democrats their hope of winning back the House--though the Senate, which always kept its distance from Mr Gingrich's schemes, seems likely to remain Republican.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Democrats draw courage from House elections past. The Republicans currently hold 236 seats to the Democrats' 198, so if 20 seats changed hands they would lose their majority. This seems within reach: 12 of the 25 elections since the second world war have produced a swing this size or bigger (see <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>). Moreover, House landslides have a way of reversing themselves. Democrats gained 38 seats in 1964, only to lose 47 seats in 1966; Republicans gained 33 seats in 1980, but lost 26 seats two years later. This time round, 77 Republican congressmen are defending seats in districts that Mr Clinton carried for the Democrats in 1992. A Democratic victory, reversing the Republican landslide of two years ago, seems altogether possible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Democrats' main targets are the 73 Republicans elected for the first time in 1994. The freshman class voted faithfully for Mr Gingrich's efforts to rein in federal spending and so balance the budget. For this generally honourable effort, they got little thanks: one poll found that 45% of Americans saw them as "extremists". Twenty-nine of the freshmen were elected last time with 55% or less of the vote: their seats would be more than enough to return the House to the Democrats. To press their advantage, the Democrats have linked House freshmen to Mr Gingrich in thousands of television ads. Some of the targets are losing their nerve: Mr Fox's disappearing act does not bespeak much confidence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet, in an equally telling way, Mr Fox's opponent is also concealing something. His name is Joe Hoeffel, and he too was milking goats at the Saturday fair, a bit more speedily than his rival. Afterwards he munched a hamburger, shook some hands, and headed off to a supermarket that had the two qualities campaigners seek: a lot of people, and only one exit. As shoppers emerged, Hoeffel leaflets were shoved into already overladen hands. You had to read the leaflet very carefully indeed to see that Mr Hoeffel is a Democrat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This hiding of party label has an important purpose. Registered Republican voters outnumber Democrats in the district by two to one. So, although Mr Fox squeaked home in 1994 with just 49% of the vote--making him one of the freshmen-to-beat if the Democrats' hope of a reverse landslide is to be realised--he still has a huge advantage. Again, Mr Clinton carried the district in 1992, making it one of the 77 that Democrats count as winnable. But the truth is that Mr Clinton's narrow victory that year was largely thanks to the independent candidacy of Ross Perot, who drained the Republican vote. In 1988, in a two-man race, George Bush carried the district comfortably.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, Mr Fox's disappearing act illustrates the Democrats' ground for hope, but Mr Hoeffel's subterfuge shows why these hopes may well be disappointed. The Gingrich brigades are unpopular for now, but the dominant current of the past 15 years favours the Republican Party. More and more Americans live in the suburbs, fear crime, resent tax, hate government. This explains why, since 1988, Republicans have signed up 4.2m new members in the 28 states that register voters by party, whereas the Democratic Party has added only 1.4m. It also helps to explain why Republicans held the presidency from 1981 until 1993, and why even the victorious Mr Clinton was backed by only 43% of the voters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a time, the Democrats retained control of the House despite this Republican advance. This was because the South, though willing to support Republican presidential candidates, retained strong ties to sitting Democratic congressmen. Gradually, however, these old timers are stepping down or switching parties. Younger Democrats can no longer count on tradition and civil-war memories to carry them to power. Their constituents are letting their social conservatism, not their historical consciousness, guide their choice of party.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This year alone, some 30 Democrats are retiring from the House, six of them from Texas. Republicans reckon this Texodus, together with other upsets in the old Confederate states, gives them a chance to expand their House majority. Democrats may pick up a seat or two in the liberal north-east; the west and mid-west look balanced. John Morgan, a Republican demographer whose predictions in 1994 proved uncannily correct, reckons his party will pick up a total of ten seats or so this November.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To frustrate this prediction, the unpopularity of Mr Gingrich and his party will have to be extreme. The signs are that it is fading. Bob Dole is doing better in the presidential race, which should encourage more Republican voters to turn out, so helping congressional candidates. In January an <font size=-1>ABC</font>/<i>Washington Post </i>poll, which asked voters which party's candidates they would be more inclined to send to the House, put Republicans nine points behind the Democrats; this month the gap was just three points. Until recently, Democrats were planning to attack House Republicans for not passing any laws. But Republicans have just scored a number of successes, notably welfare reform. They can no longer be accused of running a do-nothing Congress.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the time being, therefore, the House Republicans are feeling smug. But the past half-century has shown how volatile House elections have been, how mysterious the motives of voters. Outside the single-exit supermarket, Mr Hoeffel handed a leaflet to a muscular, dyed-blond man, who responded with a series of obscenities. For a full minute the car park echoed with his shouts, while his wife looked on nervously. Then the man got into his car, drove back up to the supermarket door and yelled: "I'm voting for you."

<h1>Trends of the week</h1>


<p><b>Bounce:</b> Most polls showed Bob Dole sharply narrowing the gap with Bill Clinton, thanks to a smoothly choreographed Republican convention and his well-received acceptance speech. But Mr Clinton can expect his own bounce at the Democrats' convention in Chicago.
<p><b>Turn-off</b>: Only 17.9m viewers tuned in to the networks' coverage of Bob Dole's speech at the Republican convention, 34% fewer than watched the closing session at the 1992 Houston convention.
<p><b>Air wars</b>: The Dole-Kemp campaign, out of money and outgunned in the airwaves in recent months, at last got its hands on $61.8m of federal funds and started firing back with its first new television advertisement since the spring.
<p><b>Tax wars: </b>Claim and counter-claim over which was the biggest tax increase in history: Clinton's in 1993, says the Dole campaign; Dole's in 1982 (when he chaired the Senate Finance Committee), counter the Clintonites.
<p><b>Nominations: </b>The Green Party picked Ralph Nader, a consumer advocate, as presidential candidate. Mr Nader wants grass-roots activists to challenge America's "corrupted" political duopoly. The new Reform Party, also challenging the duopoly, nominated Ross Perot.
<p><b>Issues of the week:</b> Ecofeminism and earth spirituality, both to be found on the Green agenda, to Mr Nader's intense discomfort.
<p><b>Dubious counting: </b>Ross Perot's votes, Bill Clinton's golf round, Bob Dole's spending cuts.
<p><b>Publishing sensation: </b>"Between Hope and History: Meeting America's Challenges for the 21st Century", by Bill Clinton (co-author of the 1992 blockbuster, "Putting People First" ). A must for wavering voters at $16.95.
<p><b>Song</b>: "Happy Birthday, Mr President".

<h1>The warder of the nation</h1>

<font size=1>HAVANA</font>
<p>THE knock on the door came in the middle of the night. Two plain-clothes men entered the home of the startled Cuban family, and dragged away the American who had just rented a room from them. Dozens of other visitors were caught in the dragnet that eerie night and hauled off to be questioned at a crumbling mansion known as "the centre for the control of foreigners".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The official in charge, with the patience of a man relishing his power, explained that foreigners simply must not move out of hotels into private homes. Nor may they rent private cars from locals. Never mind that the law does not forbid Cubans to make money this way, and that plenty have been doing it openly for months. After a few tense hours, the American was dumped back at his hotel, with the comment: "How else can we maintain control?"
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fidel Castro clearly has no intention of easing his grip. The end of the Soviet Union and of its subsidies forced him to allow a bit of capitalism, and a smaller dose of political freedom. But neither is welcome. The Cubans this week kicked out an American diplomat whose support of political dissidents had long irritated them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of Mr Castro's enemies believe outside pressure can finish him. President Clinton has just appointed a senior envoy to drum up international support for the Helms-Burton law, which seeks to punish companies that invest in Cuba. But the United States' bully-boy tactics have outraged its friends. And the impact of American sanctions seems likely to be diminished by a slow economic recovery now under way in Cuba. As Mr Castro well knows, the real threat is from within.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has never faced serious political opposition in Cuba. One reason is that an extensive network of informants ensures that none gets organised. Another is that the natural leaders of any opposition have mostly fled the country. The groups that did emerge could muster few followers: an old joke calls them "bicycle clubs", because all the members can fit on one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When these groups at last organised themselves last year into a united front, called Concilio Cubano, the government watched warily. Infighting, prodded along by infiltrators, might have done for the group anyway. But as it gained momentum and support abroad early this year, the regime cracked down. Some 150 members were detained before it could hold its first official meeting in February; key organisers remain in prison. Dissidents vow to fight on, but the break-up of Concilio has turned them once again into isolated voices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One human-rights advocate, pointing out a spy in the park across from his house, explains that activism in the interior is much harder than in Havana, with its bustle of people and friendly embassies. A movement for academic freedom was recently crushed. An activist says students and university staff in Havana are ripe for organising--but what can she do from the remote province to which she has been banished? The frightened mother of a persecuted journalist clings to the telephone number of a Concilio contact, written on her palm in case she is suddenly abducted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A bigger threat to the system than political dissidence, argues Vladimir Roca, himself a brave voice of dissent, may be the arrival of a bit of free enterprise. The regime has legalised the dollar and self-employment--but then has clamped down on the result. When hundreds of tiny caf&eacute;s appeared, offering tastier fare than the state-run restaurants, they were hit with hefty taxes, seating limits and frequent inspections, to keep the market spirit within bounds. Farming has been partially freed. There is more food around, and more farmers and middlemen with money. So now this too is under threat. The same fear explains the clampdown on private car and room rentals, and on prostitution, widespread and tolerated two years ago.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While the more open-minded officials and academics have been receiving conference invitations, scholarships and other support from abroad, hardliners are worried. Raul Castro, Fidel's brother, calls those who want faster economic reform the "fifth column" of the Mafia and the <font size=-1>CIA</font>, and since March has been shoving them aside.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The regime is not alone in its concern about the impact of capitalism. The voice of Jose Conrado, the priest of Palma Soriano in eastern Cuba, was nearly drowned out by the pounding drums and raucous revelry of the carnival around his church last week. But the excesses of the annual bacchanalia bother him less than the "grave moral decay born of the economic situation" . The dual economy has forced Cubans to do anything--from engaging in prostitution to stealing from their employers--to make a dollar, he argues, for without that a family simply cannot eat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A red banner in El Cobre, near the eastern city of Santiago, proclaims <i>Ayer, hoy y siempre</i>--yesterday, today and forever. It is not promoting communism, though, but another revolution slowly taking shape. The banner hangs at Cuba's holiest Catholic shrine. The growing moral emptiness of Castroism has led to a sharp rise in church attendance, both Catholic and Protestant, notably among the young. Initiations into <i>santeria</i>, a variety of cults derived from Africa, are on the rise. But here the regime is tolerant; it sees capitalism as a far more immediate threat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even there it may be wrong: such capitalism as exists may in the end serve as a lifeline. But one threat is inescapable. A billboard in Granma province, depicting the heroes of the revolution, declares: <i>Ayer, hoy y ma&ntilde;ana--</i>yesterday, today and tomorrow<i>.</i> But it stops short of <i>siempre</i>. Even Fidel is not immortal. The revolution began in Granma, and support for it and the great leader remains strong there. Till when? Few believe the regime can long outlast the death of the one man who supplies its mystique. This month he turned 70.

<p><b>Utility regulation</b></p>
<h1>Making merry</h1>

<p>TOGETHER, the privatised telecoms, gas, electricity and water industries serve 25m customers and have annual sales of &#163;51 billion, representing 8% of Britain's <font size=-1>GDP</font>. So it is hardly surprising that the regulators who determine what prices these industries can charge have become controversial public figures.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On August 21st Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator, stepped into the limelight yet again, imposing new limits on the price British Gas can charge other firms for using its pipelines. This will save households an average of &#163;28 a year. British Gas, predictably, protested that the cut represented "the seizure of shareholders' income on an unprecedented scale" and said it may appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ms Spottiswoode is not the only regulator to clash with the regulated. Recently battles have raged between Oftel's Don Cruickshank and British Telecom, Ian Byatt of Ofwat and the water companies, and Stephen Littlechild of Offer and assorted electricity firms. This may reflect good regulation at work: a well-regulated monopolist is not a happy one. However, the belief is growing in the City of London and Parliament that these rows owe as much to the personal idiosyncracies and agendas of individual regulators as to good regulation. Is British regulation, invented in the 1980s during the privatisation process, not working?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since privatisation, all the regulators have become steadily tougher, imposing more stringent price limits and promoting more competition. They limit prices using a formula restricting increases to inflation minus an amount, <font size=-1>X</font>%, determined by the regulator and fixed for five years. At the end of the first five years after privatisation, each regulator increased "<font size=-1>X</font>"--but by much more since early 1995 than before. This is reflected in the price of utility shares which, in the past 18 months, have underperformed the <font size=-1>FT</font>-<font size=-1>SE</font> 100 index by a third. (See <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some regulated firms and City analysts attribute this recent display of regulatory muscle to politics. Formally, the regulators are independent of government. But, with an election pending, might they be acting on orders from the Tories to lower prices and make privatisation popular with voters? Or, because Labour complains endlessly about the fat profits of the utilities and intends to reform regulation, are they becoming enthusiastic consumer champions in order to win reappointment should the government change? Or, less cynically, has constant criticism made the regulators wary of doing anything that seems to favour privatised firms over the consumer?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Naturally, none of this can be proved. Every regulatory act is justified by pages of tedious documentation, full of complex calculations of the cost of capital and so forth, disputable but never disprovable. But if the regulators have been favouring customers at the expense of shareholders--who are due a decent return on their capital--the regulators will have helped consumers only in the short run at the cost of doing them harm in the long run.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why? The privatised utilities are hugely unpopular because they earn juicy profits. But high profits in the short term are the <i>quid pro quo</i> for lower prices in the long term. That is because the regulator sets the price cap at a level that should allow the utility a reasonable profit if it performs reasonably efficiently, and far bigger profits if it performs more efficiently than the regulator expects. When the regulator next reviews the price cap, the greater efficiency achieved by the firm is then taken into account, resulting in lower prices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The prospect of bigger profits is the carrot encouraging a utility to increase efficiency. Without that, the firm has little incentive to become more efficient, and so consumers may not get lower prices. In fact, despite all the speculation, there is a great deal of evidence that the regulatory system has been working as it should. Many privatised firms initially made (perhaps too) healthy profits, but they did this by increasing efficiency. In real terms prices have been reduced by 44% in telecoms, by 24% in gas and by 10% in electricity since privatisation. They have risen only for water, where the resulting income has been used to begin rebuilding decrepit infrastructure. And now that the regulators have seen how much utilities can earn, they are lowering prices still further and demanding even greater improvements.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately Labour remains unimpressed by this. It not only promises to levy a "windfall profits" tax, but proposes to replace the current system of price regulation with what it calls a "profit sharing" rule, splitting any "extra" profits between shareholders and customers, perhaps fifty-fifty. This idea is analysed in "Incentive Regulation", a recent report by the Centre for the Study of Regulated Industries, a research group. It points out that, to deliver the same incentives to boost efficiency (ie, total benefit to shareholders and customers) as the current regulatory system, the price cap would have to be fixed for a longer period than under the current system, which rewards shareholders before customers. It would also encourage firms to use creative accounting and, to be fair, firms would have to be able to recoup cash from customers should their profits fail to meet expectations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In any case, Labour is ignoring the fact that the regulatory system already shares extra profits between customers and shareholders--erring on the side of consumers. Ivan Viehoff, an economist at Nera, a consultancy, calculates that in the electricity industry, over 70% of the benefit from an efficiency saving introduced in the year after a price review typically goes to customers, and 90% of the saving from a change made in the year before a review. That is why utilities often delay such changes until after a review, says Mr Viehoff.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead of whingeing about utility profits, or regulators, both Labour and the Tories ought to explain more clearly to the public how the incentives in the current system operate, so that utility profits are seen in context, rather than undermining a system that is working well.

<p><b>Pressure groups</b></p>
<h1>Dead-rat politics</h1>

<p>NO DOUBT the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee listened to many different voices when considering the question of whether to advocate a ban on handguns. But it cannot have harmed the opponents of a ban (on whose side the committee came down) that the <font size=-1>MP</font>s' only expert adviser was Colin Greenwood, the editor of <i>Guns Review</i> magazine, a voice of the gun lobby which regards the police as "malicious" and the media as "sick" for campaigning for gun control.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is rarely the case that the "expert" (expert witness, expert adviser, expert being interviewed on a hastily-put-together news item) is the disinterested sage that the word implies. Usually, he or she comes from a lobby group and is spinning a line.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;William Waldegrave, chief secretary to the Treasury, expresses his alarm at the growing power of pressure groups in a collection of papers published this week by the Social Market Foundation, a centre-right think-tank ("Pressure Group Politics in Modern Britain", &#163;10). The problem, he maintains, is not so much that pressure groups are increasing in number or in strength. His main concern is the declining effectiveness of the institutions that are supposed to protect the common good against vested interests: principally, Parliament and the media. They, contend Mr Waldegrave, are not doing their job.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Waldegrave has a point. Admittedly, if the media promote lobbies, they also sometimes puncture them. Mr Greenwood's exposure, for instance, undermined the authority of the select committee's report. And special interests have always pressed, or obstructed, the government. For example, Lord Robert Cecil, later prime minister, wrote in 1858 of: "the utter impotence of Parliament to raise its hand against the attorneys and the licensed victuallers, or the extreme difficulty with which even so small a body as the ecclesiastical lawyers have been dealt with." And yet today the growth of lobbies seems inexorable. Their clout in Britain is still dwarfed by that of American lobby groups, but Britain seems headed in America's direction.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pressure groups normally want government to spend more money. Parliament came into existence in part to stop the executive from spending too much, a point which Mr Waldegrave says <font size=-1>MP</font>s are in danger of forgetting. Almost every report from a select committee demands that more money be spent on something. Few politicians have much interest in arguing that less be spent--except the beleaguered chief secretary to the Treasury.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprisingly, given the Tories' record and funding sources, Mr Waldegrave's concern is less with business lobbies than with campaigns with more momentum than sense. In one typical case an <font size=-1>MP</font>'s constituent was killed by a piece of machinery. The <font size=-1>MP</font> sounded off in the local newspaper; national newspapers took up the story, as did the opposition; there was a debate; a minister made a conciliatory speech; the bureaucracy started to draft plans to set up an inspectorate. At this stage, somebody asked what the real risk of sudden death from this sort of machinery was. Four times less than that from being struck dead by lightning, it turned out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The media's failure to challenge pressure groups' claims is well illustrated by a paper in Mr Waldegrave's collection by Peter Bazalgette who is, er, a food expert. He tells the story of Alar, a spray used on red apples to delay their maturation so they become bigger and redder before picking. A <font size=-1>TV</font> documentary reported that, in large quantities, Alar could cause cancer in mice (though not in hamsters or dogs). Since children eat more apples than adults do, the risk to them seemed higher. A group called "Parents for Safe Food" was formed, and the actress Meryl Streep appeared on commercials in America demanding that Alar be banned.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ms Streep later recanted, after the risks had been properly explained to her. The carcinogen in Alar, it turned out, exists naturally in mushrooms at 1,000 times the strength. Mr Bazalgette blames such scares on the "dead-rat syndrome", whereby a researcher somewhere feeds huge quantities of some substance to a rat which eventually keels over. He writes up the experiment, describes it in primary-school English in a press release, and bingo.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such stories get space in the papers because journalists are lazy and credulous. It makes a much better story to cry "something must be done" than to argue that, even if the possibility of minutely increased risk to health exists, it would be better if the government did not expensively stick its nose into yet another area of life.

<p><b>Flat-screen technology</b></p>
<h1>Preparing for prime time</h1>

<font size=1>TOKYO</font>
<p>AFTER numerous false starts, the flat television set is at last poised to reach the stores this autumn. Japanese electronic companies are preparing to roll out a range of flat-screen <font size=-1>TV</font>s that are only a few inches thick but offer picture sizes of up to 40 inches (102cm) diagonally. But do not expect customers to stampede to buy the early models. A typical set will cost around $8,000--almost three times the price of today's big-screen <font size=-1>TV</font>s. So why the sudden interest of the Japanese firms in getting slimmed-down screens into the retail market? The answer has as much to do with computers as with televisions. (See <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some specialist flat screens are already in operation; the New York Stock Exchange, for instance, uses nearly 3,000 of them. However, the most common use for the technology so far has been the smaller flat-panel displays used in lap-top computers. Sales of such liquid-crystal displays (<font size=-1>LCD</font>s) reached $6 billion in 1995--and the business has been dominated by Japanese firms, such as Sharp, <font size=-1>NEC</font>, Toshiba and Hosiden. However, the latest 12-inch colour <font size=-1>LCD</font>s that the Japanese firms were hoping to sell for $650 a panel are now being offered by South Korean suppliers for $420 apiece. By contrast, the market for bigger flat-<font size=-1>TV</font> screens looks blissfully free of competitors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another prompt for action has come from the desk-top computer market. The conventional cathode-ray tube (<font size=-1>CRT</font>) monitor used by desk-top computers is getting too big for the desk. New computer programs, particularly Microsoft's Windows 95, cram lots of graphical detail on to the screen. Already, 17-inch computer monitors have replaced the old 14-inch versions as standard; an increasing number of users are buying 21-inch models, which cost more than $900, are the size of small packing crates and weigh a ton. At these dimensions and prices, space-saving flat-screen alternatives begin to look highly attractive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given that 70m desk-top computers are now sold every year this looks like a promising business. Sharp, which has 44% of the <font size=-1>LCD</font> business, has spent $500m boosting its capacity for making large <font size=-1>LCD</font> panels for the desk-top monitor business. It hopes to grab 5% of this market next year--even though the flat-screen devices will still cost three times more than comparable <font size=-1>CRT</font> displays. When the price difference is down to just twice as much, Sharp reckons its flat-panels will win 15% of the monitor market--an annual 9m units that might be worth more than $10 billion a year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Flat-screen monitors could also play a crucial role in the equally long-awaited (and by no means certain) convergence of the <font size=-1>TV</font> and the <font size=-1>PC</font>. The chief problem with <font size=-1>PC</font> monitors as <font size=-1>TV</font> sets is that they are too small for the picture to be seen from across the room. That is changing: Gateway <font size=-1>2000</font>, one of America's largest mail-order suppliers of <font size=-1>PC</font>s, already sells a $3,800 computer equipped with television functions and a 31-inch monitor. But such monitors could strain even the sturdiest desk. Flat-panel displays would solve that problem; they would also give the <font size=-1>PC</font>-<font size=-1>TV</font> a standard.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Revealingly, many of the big <font size=-1>CRT</font> makers are rushing into the flat-screen business, even though it will cannibalise their existing market. <font size=-1>NEC</font> is spending &#165;25 billion ($230m) on a new factory in Kagoshima to produce 40-inch plasma display panels (<font size=-1>PDP</font>s)--a rugged form of flat-panel display that provides a wider viewing angle and is easier to make in large formats than the traditional <font size=-1>LCD</font>. Early versions are expected to cost around &#165;450,000 apiece. By 2000 <font size=-1>NEC</font> expects to have spent &#165;85 billion building up its <font size=-1>PDP</font> capacity to 150,000 units a month. The company hopes that by the end of the decade the worldwide market for <font size=-1>PDP</font>s will be worth &#165;260 billion a year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>NEC</font> will face plenty of competition--not least from Fujitsu, which launched a 21-inch <font size=-1>PDP</font> screen several years ago. The company is spending &#165;60 billion on a factory in Miyazaki to produce 20,000 42-inch panels a month by December. Hitachi claims to be spending much the same on <font size=-1>PDP</font> facilities. After halting its flat-panel work in 1993 because of rising costs and uncertain demand, Hitachi is reckoned to be two years behind its rivals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile Sony is quietly pressing on with its big-screen Plasmatron, a cross between a <font size=-1>PDP</font> and an <font size=-1>LCD</font> that it has developed jointly with Tektronix in the United States. Sony is preparing to launch a 25-inch flat-screen <font size=-1>TV</font> this autumn; and to follow it up with a 40-inch model next year. Sony claims that Plasmatron displays can be stretched to 50 inches or so.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the Japanese electronic industry throws its money behind a product as heavily as this, things happen. Ironically the immediate future of flat-screen <font size=-1>TV</font>s may be bound up with the single exception to this rule: high-definition television. Although Japanese firms have been pushing the product for years, the aesthetic advantages of <font size=-1>HDTV</font> are obvious only on screens at least 40 inches across. Flat screens that size would be nearly a yard shallower than traditional <font size=-1>CRT</font> tubes. At that size, making glass tubes becomes even more expensive than crafting silicon panels, so huge flat-screen <font size=-1>TV</font>s may yet end up cheaper.

<h1>Emerging Asia's sombre era</h1>

<p><b>Some Asian tigers seem to be picking up nasty Mexican habits</b></p>

<p>"A MASSIVE current-account deficit, a crippling foreign-debt burden and excessive monetary growth encouraged speculators to attack its currency." Thus a description of Mexico before its financial meltdown in December 1994. But it could now sum up a number of fast-growing Asian economies. Thanks to economic woes and political turmoil, the currencies of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia have all been attacked this year. Could these economies be going down Mexico's way?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The obvious parallel between these three tigers and Mexico on the brink is that they have large current-account deficits. Their governments are anxious to play down fears that they are heading for a balance-of-payments crisis--just as Mexico's did for most of 1994. Cynics could argue that such denials often prove excellent predictors of a crash. But can one be more precise about the indicators that might give an early warning of a Mexican-style problem in South-East Asia?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Morris Goldstein, an <font size=-1>IMF</font> economist currently on leave at the Institute for International Economics, a think-tank in Washington, thinks so. Using lessons from Mexico's crisis, he has produced a list of potential danger signals. Our table on the next page draws on some of these to examine how five Asian economies today compare with Mexico in 1994.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are seven signals to watch for, starting with the one that Mr Goldstein thinks is most important:
<p><font size=-1><li><b>A mismatch between short-term debt</b> <b>and foreign reserves</b>. If investors are doubtful about a country's ability to repay its debts, they will be reluctant to roll over maturing loans. This was Mexico's Achilles' heel. At the time of its liquidity crunch, the country's foreign-exchange reserves covered only 20% of its short-term foreign debt. In the five Asian economies, the reserve cover is much higher, ranging from 73% in Indonesia to 186% in Malaysia. The second line of the table measures how many months' imports are covered by a country's reserves. This shows that the tigers also have plenty of ammunition with which to defend their currencies.
<p><font size=-1><li><b>A big current-account deficit</b>. Such deficits are not necessarily bad. It makes sense for emerging economies with profitable investment opportunities to import capital from richer ones. However, at some level a deficit becomes unsustainable. That depends upon several things. The lower a country's foreign debt and the faster its economic growth, the easier it will find financing a big deficit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Worryingly, the table shows that Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand already have larger foreign debts as a share of <font size=-1>GDP</font> than did Mexico in 1994. True, fast-growing Asian countries should be able to run bigger current-account deficits than more sluggish Latin American ones. But Mr Goldstein says the Asians are playing with fire if they continue to run deficits greater than 5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. Forecasts for 1996 suggest that Thailand's could be 8% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> (the same as Mexico's in 1994); Malaysia's may be even bigger, at almost 10%.
<p><font size=-1><li><b>Investment or consumption? </b>If a current-account deficit mainly reflects higher investment, which will increase an economy's ability to repay debt, it will be more sustainable than a deficit driven by consumer spending. In the four years to 1994, four-fifths of the increase in Mexico's current-account deficit reflected lower savings and increased consumption. In contrast, the widening of most of these Asian economies' deficits reflects higher investment, not consumption. In Malaysia's case, however, serious doubts remain about how much of its investment is truly productive. How, for example, will the fortune being spent on a new capital or ever taller office buildings boost economic growth?
<p><font size=-1><li><b>A budget deficit</b>. According to the "Lawson Doctrine", named after Nigel Lawson, a former British chancellor of the exchequer, a current-account deficit is a cause for concern only if it reflects a budget deficit. If, on the other hand, it reflects private-sector decisions about savings and investment, it is benign. Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea all have comfortable budget surpluses, but Indonesia is running a deficit, forecast at 2.4% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> this year. Mexico too had a modest budget deficit in 1994.
<p><font size=-1><li><b>The composition of capital inflows</b>. Is the current-account deficit financed by foreign direct investment (<font size=-1>FDI</font>) or flighty portfolio capital? The higher the share of <font size=-1>FDI</font>, the less vulnerable the recipient country is to sudden outflows. The table shows net <font size=-1>FDI</font> plus the current-account balance as a percentage of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. The more negative the number, the more dependent a country is on "hot" money. Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea look better than Mexico did in 1994. Thailand, however, is even more worrying: virtually all of its current-account deficit is financed by short-term capital.
<p><font size=-1><li><b>An overvalued exchange-rate</b>. The more overvalued a currency, the greater the incentive for speculators to attack it. Most of these Asian countries' currencies are linked to the dollar. The recent rise in the greenback has therefore lifted their real trade-weighted exchange rates, but only by 5-8% over the past two years. Indeed, on most estimates of purchasing-power parities (<font size=-1>PPP</font>s, which equate the prices of a basket of goods and services in different countries), most Asian currencies are undervalued.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our Big Mac index provides a crude guide to <font size=-1>PPP</font>s. It suggests that the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit are undervalued against the dollar by 20% and 36% respectively. And since the dollar is itself still undervalued against most other main currencies, this implies that the Asian currencies are still more undervalued against the yen and the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark. In contrast, in 1994 the Big Mac index suggested that the Mexican peso was perhaps 5% overvalued against the dollar.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This raises a paradox: how can a country run a current-account deficit if its currency is massively undervalued? For an answer, consider the United States, which has had a persistent current-account deficit despite widespread agreement that the dollar is cheap. Current-account deficits reflect a country's imbalance between domestic savings and investment, not the relative value of its currency.
<p><font size=-1><li><b>Rapid monetary growth</b>. This is especially dangerous if it inflates an asset-price bubble that then bursts, leaving banks with huge bad loans on their books. Like Mexico in 1994, several Asian countries have too much money sloshing around.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, there is no single figure that can accurately predict trouble. As the table shows, on some indicators these Asian countries do better than Mexico; on others they look just as bad; on a few, they look worse. So which of them is most likely to become Asia's Mexico? Malaysia looks dodgy on the basis of its current-account deficit, but it is saved by strong <font size=-1>FDI</font> inflows and reserves almost twice as big as its short-term debt. A second contender is Indonesia: although its current-account deficit is a modest 3.7% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, its reserves are equivalent to only three-quarters of its short-term debt, which could leave it vulnerable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is, however, Thailand that has more Mexican symptoms than the rest: a huge current-account deficit; a heavy debt-to-<font size=-1>GDP</font> ratio; rapid monetary growth; and a worrying dependence on "hot money" to finance its deficit. To be fair, it has some way to go before it develops the full Mexican disease. The country has a comfortable cushion of reserves, a healthy budget surplus, and its currency is undervalued.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, Thailand's economic policymakers, and those of other emerging Asian countries, would still do well to remember that there is one more unwelcome difference between themselves and Mexico. If investors fled their markets, they would have no willing, deep-pocketed neighbour ready with a bail-out.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<h1><center>China looming</center></h1>

SEVENTY years ago, scare-mongering westerners called it "the yellow peril". Today it is called the People's Republic of China. The rise of a nation so huge is certainly a world event. Is it also a reason for the world to shake in its shoes?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;China is not only the world's most populous country; for the past 20 years, it has had the world's fastest-growing economy. Project current growth rates into the future and you find that the Chinese economy will overtake that of the United States in less than 20 years. (Measure output a different way, and it will take China a bit longer to become the world's biggest economy.) True, projecting current trends is an ancient fallacy. True, even when China's economy is bigger than America's the average Chinese citizen will still be far poorer than the average American. "China as number one" may still be a distant prospect--but the reality of a China that will demand and command a growing share of the world's resources is already here. A richer China presents enormous commercial opportunities for outsiders. It also raises political and military concerns.

</p><p><b>A panda as big as the Ritz</b>
<br>Those worries are rarely discussed in public by western elites. But to many ordinary people it seems obvious that the rise of China has to be a bad thing. Any country with more than a billion people must concern the rest of the world; and this is one with traditions of inherent superiority that go back centuries before the peoples of the West came--and at that only for a time--to similar ideas. Today's China is also a one-party state that has clashed several times with its neighbours and recently turned tanks on its own people. Such a chain of thought leads logically to the notion that maybe the West should try to hinder, not help, the rise of China, perhaps by cutting back on commercial ties. It is not enough to say, as most western policymakers do, that China's rise is unstoppable and the West just has to learn to live with it. Given the importance of trade and foreign investment to China, outsiders could slow its growth, albeit not stop it. Should they try?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Western diplomats, businessmen and politicians are largely united in saying No. China's rise should be welcomed, they say, and helped. That view is often advanced for short-term reasons, such as a desire not to antagonise China's leaders, or to win a contract. It is correct for long-term ones.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The orthodox argument for thinking that a stronger China will be easier to live with can be called "liberal internationalism"--the notion that as economic ties between nations grow, so political conflicts will fade. Tie China to the world with trade and investment, the argument goes, and you will inevitably make it not just stronger, but friendlier.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Humph. That was the argument in the first decade of this century that suggested a European war was unthinkable. War broke out, nonetheless, in 1914. One reason was that Germany was led at the time by a group of militarists suspicious of the rest of Europe, anxious to ward off their own people's demands for political liberalisation and uninterested in the pacific virtues of European commerce. Little as others understood it, Germans then--and later--saw themselves as encircled by a hostile world. The parallel with today's China is striking. You will not find many liberal internationalists in the Chinese leadership. On the contrary, they--and many other Chinese--have long memories of being preyed upon by western and then Japanese imperialism, and they draw from their history a grim notion of the way countries deal with each other. They think it is natural for the strong to prey upon the weak. So, next time round, let China be the strong one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And, they might add, if it does a bit of its own preying, well that is just tit-for-tat. Of course, they add no such thought; oh no, a strong China will never behave like the western imperialists of old. China, they say, has always been peaceful. Rubbish. China forcibly colonised Tibet in the 1950s, attacked India in 1962 and Vietnam in 1979 and within the past year has grabbed a reef in the South China Sea and threatened violence against Taiwan. All with solid justification, in the Chinese view--which is yet another reason why a strong China is likely to be increasingly assertive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The real reason to believe that growth in China will prove to the West's political as well as commercial advantage is that, in time, it is likely to lead to political liberalisation. And history suggests that, by and large, democracies are less aggressive than dictatorships: even the fiercest critics of the United States have to admit that it is 150 years since it was at war with Mexico or Canada, neighbours that it could have defeated within a month. Western politicians are not going to say this to the current Chinese leadership, but it must be the basis of their long-term strategy on China.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As yet, admittedly, there is little sign that China's boom has led to much political loosening. Indeed, there is less scope for political organisation now than a decade ago. But while political freedom has diminished, personal freedom has increased markedly. Students are no longer routinely assigned to jobs by the government; peasants flood into the cities to find work. And the experience of the Asian tigers such as South Korea or Taiwan suggests that, in time, greater personal and economic freedom does lead to political loosening.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is possible that China may resist that trend. Its sheer size, its Communist legacy, its relative poverty compared with the other tigers and the relative lack of American influence over its political leadership all suggest that China's transition to a looser political system will be even more fraught and less predictable than in other Asian countries (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>). Such fears, as well as a general worry that political change in China could lead not to democracy but to chaos or civil war, incline some westerners to accept the official Chinese line that a China led by "strong" leaders is actually in the West's best interests. But the history of this century hardly suggests that putting your faith in dictators to keep the peace is a safe bet. The demise of Communist oligarchy in China is overwhelmingly in the West's interests, as it is in the interests of ordinary Chinese themselves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The implications for Western policymakers are threefold. First, they should welcome Chinese economic growth in the hope, albeit not the certainty, that this will lead to political liberalisation. Second, they should accept that they have little direct influence over internal Chinese politics and so should not cede points of principle in the hope of bolstering moderates there. Last, so long as China retains the habits of one-party oligarchy, westerners must not be shy of demanding that it accept international norms of conduct (eg, over Taiwan) and meet its international commitments (eg, over Hong Kong). The panda may be larger and fiercer than the tigers. But, with luck, time and wealth will tame it.

<p><h2>They're off</h2></p>
<p><p>Bob Dole picked his old Reaganite adversary, Jack Kemp, as his running-mate for the presidential election; Nancy Reagan moistened eyes over her husband's "long goodbye"; Colin Powell got a conservative audience to cheer his tolerant speech; and the <b>Republican convention </b>began the party's desperate attempt to catch up with Bill Clinton in the opinion polls.
<p>A New York policeman, strolling unchallenged through off-bounds parts of Kennedy airport, confirmed the slackness of American <b>airline security</b>. Four weeks after <font size=-1>TWA</font> flight 800 crashed, evidence began to point to an explosion.
<p><b>Colombia's </b>government made a deal with angry peasant farmers in its southern region of Putumayo. The government will not use aerial spraying to destroy their coca plantations provided they do the job themselves. They will get subsidies to switch to food crops. Peace in Putumayo? We'll see. Less coca-growing? We probably won't see.</p>
<p><h2>Hope in Cambodia</h2></p>
<p><p>Thousands of <b>Khmers Rouges guerrillas </b>were reported to be ready to stop fighting the Cambodian government, creating speculation that the civil war may be ending. Ieng Sary, once Pol Pot's deputy, was said to be among those seeking peace.
<p>Singapore is to install a system that will ban the island's 100,000 <b>Internet users </b>from having access to "objectionable" material. Critics of the plan say it could be a means of political censorship.
<p>The chairman of <b>Myanmar</b>'s ruling military junta, Than Shwe, paid an official visit to Malaysia. Opposition groups condemned the welcome given to the representative of a regime "notorious for its atrocities" .
<p>South Korean <b>riot police</b>, backed by helicopters, raided a university campus to end a demonstration by students sympathetic to North Korea.</p>
<p><h2>All the tsar's men</h2></p>
<p><p>Russia's Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the Duma, reconfirmed <b>Viktor Chernomyrdin</b> as prime minister. If the recently re-elected but frail president, Boris Yeltsin, were to die or become incapacitated, Mr Chernomyrdin would take over for three months.
<p>Russia's new presidential defence adviser, Alexander Lebed, went to <b>Chechnya </b>to talk peace with a separatist guerrilla leader, Aslan Maskhadov, after Chechen fighters had intensified the war by capturing parts of Grozny, the republic's capital. By August 15th, a partial ceasefire seemed to be holding.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><font size=-1>NATO</font> put its troops in <b>Bosnia</b> on alert when the Bosnian Serbs stopped them inspecting a military base; the inspection went ahead. Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's president, promised Warren Christopher, America's secretary of state, that the Bosnian Croats would dissolve their mini-state, as promised in the Dayton agreement.
<p>Two <b>Greek-Cypriots</b> were killed and many injured by Turkish-Cypriot soldiers and civilians. They were demonstrating, on the border between the two communities, against the island's continued division.
<p>Romania and Hungary agreed on the text of a treaty which, among other things, is supposed to protect <b>ethnic</b> <b>Hungarians </b>in Romania.</p>
<p><h2>Treaty banned</h2></p>
<p><p>Negotiations on a global <b>nuclear test ban treaty</b> failed, as India stuck by its objection that the text did not include a timetable for nuclear disarmament.
<p>Foreigners left <b>Burundi</b> as international sanctions imposed after a military coup began to bite.
<p>Two years after an estimated 1m people were massacred in<b> Rwanda</b>, its parliament passed a law under which more than 80,000 people imprisoned on suspicion of genocide can be tried.
<p>South Africa's rand slithered, as a <b>bribes scandal </b>lapped near President Nelson Mandela. Bantu Holomisa, until recently a minister, says the <font size=-1>ANC</font> accepted money from a businessman who wanted charges against him dropped.
<p>Eight leading supporters of ex-President Kenneth Kaunda went on trial in <b>Zambia </b>charged with treason and hiring saboteurs to plant bombs.
<p><b>Nigeria's</b> ruler General Sani Abacha sacked the military administrators of all the country's 30 states.

<p><h2>Budget-busters</h2>
<p><p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The Bundesbank said Germany's budget deficit is likely to rise to more than 3.5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> this year, above the Maastricht limit of 3% for Europe's economic and monetary union. The gloomy message comes with the realisation that <b>growth in Europe</b>, and especially in Germany and France, is still weak. This will make it harder for countries to meet the Maastricht targets in 1997. Consequent doubts about <font size=-1>EMU</font>'s chances weakened the French franc.
<p>Germany's <b>Volkswagen</b> defied sluggish growth in Europe to report global sales up 13% and a net profit that soared in the first half to DM282m ($189m), up from DM113m a year earlier.
<p>The world's biggest reinsurance group, Germany's <b>Munich Re</b>, is to take over America's third-largest, <b>American Re</b>, for around $3.3 billion. The move may herald further consolidations in the world reinsurance industry.</p>
<p><h2>Bondage</h2></p>
<p><p>The federal government scored a big victory in its attempts to clean up America's <b>municipal-bond market</b>, when a former partner at Lazard Fr&egrave;res was found guilty of fraud and corruption. Retained by municipal clients to offer independent financial advice, Mark Ferber, who will appeal, recommended underwriting work to Merrill Lynch without disclosing that Merrill Lynch was paying his firm a $1m annual retainer.
<p>Continuing a wave of good results from Swiss banks, <b>Swiss Bank Corp</b> overcame a rise in bad-debt provisions and a depressed Swiss economy to report profits sharply up in the first half of 1996. Boosted also by the bank's takeover of S.G. Warburg, a British investment bank, net profits rose to SFr722m ($593m), up from SFr540m a year ago.
<p>Martin Ebner's <font size=-1>BK</font> Vision investment group lost a battle against <b>Union Bank of Switzerland </b>but said its war with the bank would continue. <font size=-1>BK</font> Vision, the bank's biggest shareholder, said it would not fight a court decision to reject a special investigation into share dealings by the bank before its annual general meeting in 1994.
<p><b>Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan </b>was fined $1m by regulators for unauthorised bond trading at its New York branch, the latest in a string of Japanese institutions to run into trouble in America.
<p>Meanwhile, <b>Daiwa Bank</b>, which was kicked out of America and fined $340m for covering up a $1.1 billion trading loss, has asked the Japanese tax authorities if it can set the fine against tax. Tax officials say a loophole may force them to allow the request.</p></p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><p>
<p><h2>Burnt</h2>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>) </b><br>Tobacco shares were battered after a Florida jury awarded $750,000 to a lung-cancer victim and his wife. The jury decided that Brown &amp; Williamson, whose parent, <font size=-1>B.A.T</font>, is the second-largest tobacco company in the world, had misled smokers about the dangers of cigarettes. As in the only previous case in which an award was made, in 1988, Brown &amp; Williamson hopes to overturn the verdict on appeal and continue the industry's record of no payouts so far despite numerous lawsuits.
<p><b>Thyssen</b>, a German engineering group, described the arrest of ten of its top managers, including Dieter Vogel, its chief executive, on fraud charges as "monstrous". It said it would bring charges against the Berlin public prosecutors for unlawful arrest. The executives are accused of misappropriating DM37.8m ($25.6m) during the privatisation of a former East German metals company.
<p>There were two big <b>energy and utility</b> mergers in America. Houston Industries, one of the biggest, is buying NorAm Energy, a natural-gas company, for $2.4 billion. Delmarva Power &amp; Light and Atlantic Energy, two East Coast utilities, are to merge in a $830m share swap.
<p><b>General Mills</b>, an American food group, is to buy the Chex Cereal line from Ralcorp Holdings for $570m. The deal confirms General Mills's position as America's second-biggest breakfast-cereal maker.
<p><b>British Petroleum </b>said it wanted to hurry through a $5 billion deal with <b>Mobil </b>to combine European downstream assets, raising speculation about a merger between the oil majors.
<p>In the latest of a string of acquisitions, <b>Softbank</b>, a Japanese software and publishing company, is to pay $1.4 billion for 80% of <b>Kingston Technology</b>, a California-based firm that is the world's largest memory-board maker.
<p>Shares in <b>Flextech</b>, a loss-making firm that has interests in 13 European cable and satellite <font size=-1>TV</font> stations, soared after it confirmed that it was talking to the <b>BBC</b> about a joint venture to launch six new channels. The attraction for the <font size=-1>BBC</font> would be access to America through Flextech's parent, Tele-Communications Inc, America's biggest cable operator. For <font size=-1>TCI</font> and Flextech, the lure is the British broadcaster's archive.
<p>A jump in the number of rough diamonds from Russia slipping past the informal cartel arrangement it has with <b>De Beers</b>, which controls most of the world market, has depressed De Beers's shares. But De Beers, which declared net profits up 18% to $482m in the half year, reckoned Russia would soon sign a firm contract--though whether it will slow the leaks is questionable.

<h1>A funny-looking tiger</h1>
<p><b>What can the Asian tigers tell us about the future of China?</b></p>

<p>FOR almost 20 years China has had the fastest growing economy in the world. Even so it is easy to find people deeply pessimistic about the country's future. Western academics speculate about political turmoil, hyperinflation and national disintegration. In China itself, many intellectuals share some of this western pessimism and base their worries on the cyclical features of Chinese history, in which dynasties rise and fall and periods of prosperity and strength are followed by periods of weakness and chaos.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If you are looking for optimists, however, the people to talk to are overseas-Chinese businessmen in the rest of Asia. They were the first to spot what was happening in China after the start of Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms in 1978, and the first to invest. After the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, the overseas Chinese retained their faith and continued to invest, while westerners pulled back. Even today, investors from Hong Kong, Taiwan and South-East Asia have bigger stakes in China than have American or Japanese multinationals. Nothing seems to shake their confidence. Just months after China was threatening to invade Taiwan, Formosa Plastics, one of the island's largest firms, announced plans to invest $3.8 billion in new power plants on the mainland.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The overseas Chinese base their optimism on the belief that China is just the latest and largest in a series of Asian economic miracles. To them, the lessons for China of the tiger economies--Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand--are twofold. First, that growth of the sort that China has had for two decades can be maintained for many years yet. Second, that political turmoil of the sort experienced by China in 1989 need not prevent growth. Indeed, for many tigers, a massacre seems to have been a sort of bloody rite of passage to economic adulthood.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much of the debate about the future of China involves, in one way or another, this parallel with Asia's tiger economies. If the optimists are right, China is just another tiger and its future is clear: there will be decades more of supercharged growth, probably accompanied by gradual political liberalisation, as the market economy breeds a more pluralistic society. For many of the pessimists, however, the things that distinguish China from the tigers are more striking than the similarities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economically, they say, China has not yet overcome the legacy of central planning. Internationally, it faces more uncertainties than other countries in the region that have sheltered under America's security umbrella. At home, China's dictatorship is in its own league when it comes to the brutalities it has inflicted upon its people, and its political problems still run deep; no one knows what will happen after the death of Mr Deng. Above all, there is the country's size. China's population is now over 1.2 billion, and 70% live in the countryside. In contrast, the two tiger economies to have made it into the club of rich countries--Hong Kong and Singapore--are city-states, and the largest of the middle-income tigers, South Korea, has 40m people--the size of a middling Chinese province.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So who is right? The answer depends on economics, politics and the international environment in which China will develop.
</p><p><b>The economic parallels</b>
<br>On the economic arguments, the optimists seem, for the most part, justified. Take long-term growth rates. The experience of the other tigers shows that annual growth of 8-10% can be sustained for many years. South Korea is now growing at almost 8% a year, even though its <font size=-1>GDP</font> per head is now more than $10,000. Singapore is an even more spectacular case. Its <font size=-1>GDP</font> per head is now almost the same as that of America--and its economy has lately been growing at rates of up to 10% a year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, some of the factors that were crucial to the growth of the tigers also seem to obtain in China. High savings, for example, have permitted very high levels of investment. In China, at 40% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, the savings rate is even higher than the thrifty East Asian average (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact that Asian governments consume a relatively small share of <font size=-1>GDP</font> has also been important to growth. Remarkably, despite being run by a Communist Party, the Chinese government's share of <font size=-1>GDP</font> is tiny. Officially, government spending was just 11.6% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> last year, compared to around 20% in the Asian tigers. Off-the-books revenue-raising schemes by local governments may mean that the Chinese state's take is twice the officially stated level. Even so, the basic point remains that the Chinese government's share of national income is comparable to those of the tigers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In one respect, China is arguably better off. The enormous size of its labour force should mean that it will take much longer for China to experience upward pressure on wages as a result of labour shortages.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A final parallel with the tigers which supports the optimists' case is the extent to which China's economic dynamism is linked to success in manufactured exports. Though the tigers are now experiencing difficulties as their rate of export growth slows, it is clear that, in the long run, a determination to export has helped East Asia's most successful economies to increase productivity and to embrace international standards in technology and product development. China is following the pattern. In 1978 its exports totalled a mere $9.8 billion. By 1994, they were $121 billion, making China the eighth largest exporter of manufactured goods in the world.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the other hand, the structure of Chinese exports provides the pessimists with their first reason for caution over the country's prospects. Though the growth of China's exports compares well with that of the tigers, the country is unusually dependent on foreign investors to make them. While foreigners account for just 2% of China's manufactured output, they account for 30% of its exports--and this proportion is growing, not shrinking.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The East Asian experience has been that the efficiency of foreign investors will rub off on domestic producers. But that does not seem to be happening in China. Nicholas Lardy, an expert on Chinese foreign trade, reckons that "To some extent export industries appear to be enclaves." He worries that "Over the longer term it will be difficult for China to sustain the growth of exports at anywhere near that of the past decade, unless there is widespread industrial restructuring." The recent decline in Chinese exports suggests that Mr Lardy's pessimism may be being borne out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Doubt over the future of Chinese exports points to the fact that, despite similarities to the tigers, the legacy of central planning has left China with some unique problems. Two big and related difficulties have still to be overcome: a financial system which is not yet run on market lines, and the country's huge number of loss-making state-owned enterprises. These are the two main economic planks in the pessimists' case.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One legacy of central planning is that China has more than 100,000 state-run companies, employing two-thirds of the urban workforce. This means that the unusually low figure for state spending as a share of <font size=-1>GDP</font> does not capture the full extent of government involvement in the economy. The government admits that almost half the state-sector firms are losing money and that the proportion is rising.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anxious about creating mass unemployment in the cities, the government is committed to keeping these sinking firms afloat. As a result state banks--which are meant to lend on commercial lines--are, in reality, under pressure to keep extending credit to state firms. The consequence is that a mass of unpaid debts is undermining the financial system. So, while the Chinese may save a great deal, a lot of that saving is wasted. Something like 70% of bank loans to industry still go to the state sector, which produces just 34% of industrial output. The pressure on the government to provide fresh credits to state-run firms also means that China is still vulnerable to bouts of inflation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The pessimists are right to draw attention to these weaknesses in the economy, but the question is whether they can be dealt with. On this, economists are increasingly hopeful. The private sector is growing so fast that the state's share of production and employment is falling steadily. According to Fan Gang, one of China's leading economists, the number employed by state industries has fallen by 10m to 90m in the past year alone. The growth of private firms, alongside the quasi-private economy of China's so-called "township and village enterprises" (companies set up by local governments but run on market lines), may mean that the withering of the state sector can be managed smoothly. That in turn should allow more resources to be shifted to the private sector, increasing China's potential for growth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Similarly, while China has far to go before establishing a market-based financial system, the central bank is now saying the right things--and even doing some of them. A recent surge in inflation (which hit 27% in 1993) was reined in without provoking a crash, in marked contrast to the boom-bust cycles of the 1980s. This suggests that the government is developing better tools for managing the economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly, few western economists watching China are predicting that growth will slow any time soon. Pieter Bottelier, head of the World Bank's office in Beijing, thinks that China's current growth is sustainable for another 20 years. But, if that is to happen, he concedes, much will depend on continuing stability in domestic politics and international affairs. Neither can be relied upon.
</p><p><b>The political questions</b>
<br>Asian businessmen were much less fazed by the killings in Tiananmen Square than westerners. After all, many had witnessed similar events in their own countries--and seen them prosper.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1980 the South Korean army killed thousands of civilians in Kwangju; the decade of military rule that followed saw <font size=-1>GDP</font> grow by 177%. In 1976 the Thai army killed hundreds of students at Thammasat University, Bangkok; the Thai military was only dislodged from power 20 years later, having seen output rise by 235% over the period. The rule of both the Kuomintang (<font size=-1>KMT</font>) in Taiwan and President Suharto in Indonesia was established after massacres of thousands. They too became tigers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clearly, bloodshed and repression do not preclude an economic miracle. Nor do they preclude a subsequent move towards democracy. Three of these countrie<b>s--</b>Taiwan, Thailand and South Korea<b>--</b>are now among the most democratic in East Asia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since many Asian businessmen put the killings in China in 1989 in the context of the development of the rest of East Asia, they were less quick to assume that Tiananmen was a harbinger of economic disaster. But dismissing the events of 1989 as just a regrettable blip, typical of Asian miracles, may be too glib. In politics, the pessimists have good grounds for worrying that China's problems run much deeper than those of the rest of East Asia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike the tigers (though like Vietnam), China is having to make the transition to a market economy under Communist-Party rule. That seems to make the country's historical burden the more onerous. One of the more sinister aspects of modern China is that Mao Zedong, a man responsible for the deaths of more of his compatriots than Stalin, is still an official national hero. There is little discussion of the terror and brainwashing of the Cultural Revolution (1966-76); none of the Mao-made famine of the Great Leap Forward (1959-61). It is as if Russia still banned discussion of the Great Terror and gulags, or as if Germany had never undergone denazification. China's reckoning with its own history is likely to be far more painful and destabilising than anything that the tigers have endured. Whereas South Korea has been able to pin blame for the Kwangju killings on the generals who ran the country at the time, in China an entire system--built around the Communist Party--will be at stake.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;China's leaders may hope to take heart from the case of Taiwan. The ruling <font size=-1>KMT</font> operated a Leninist one-party system, but managed to preserve its grip on power, while moving towards democracy and allowing a limited reassessment of history. But the <font size=-1>KMT</font>, while no softies, were not responsible for the deaths of millions. Nor do Taiwanese leaders fear, as the mainland Chinese do, that liberalisation may unleash separatism in the country. In that respect, the position of China is more like that of sprawling Indonesia, which, significantly, has also not made any substantial moves towards political liberalisation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact is that China's immense size continues to haunt its politics. Great disparities of income divide the rich coastal regions from the poorer inland provinces. This makes the Communist Party reluctant to loosen the reins of power for fear of losing control, while simultaneously making central control harder to maintain. The more growth widens the disparities, the greater the dilemma. The reluctance of the central government to delegate power also makes it harder to collect taxes and maintain law and order--in short, to govern.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of this means that political liberalisation is impossible--or even unlikely--in China. But it does suggest that, when change does happen, it may be more violent and destabilising than anything that occurred in South Korea or Taiwan.
</p><p><b>Outside the Middle Kingdom</b></b>
<br>One last difference could distinguish China's political and economic path from that of the rest of East Asia, and gives the pessimists further cause for worry. This is the international context.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indonesia apart, the tigers are small and unthreatening; and they have all been closely allied to the United States. This has had two consequences. The first is that America has generally seen the growing prosperity of the tigers as in its own strategic interest. As a result it has been more inclined to open its markets to goods produced by "our friends" in East Asia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second consequence is that, at crucial points, America has been able to give liberalisation a shove in the right direction. In 1987, when the South Korean regime was faced with mass demonstrations and may have been contemplating another Kwangju, the fact that this would have gone down badly in Washington--and might have cost the country the 1988 Olympic Games--helped persuade the military to hold their fire. Similarly in Taiwan in 1990, the <font size=-1>KMT</font> must have wondered whether holding the island's first free election was really such a good idea. Knowing that moves towards democracy would bolster support for Taiwan in Washington was crucial in keeping the party honest. Most dramatic of all, America pulled the plug on Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines in 1986--even providing a helicopter to fly him out of the country.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How does China compare? China's leaders are convinced--or profess to be convinced--that America is out to thwart their country's development. And it is true that America is less inclined to compromise in trade disputes with China because China is a potential adversary. All the same, on trade, China is not so different from the tigers. Though America has protectionists aplenty, on China they appear to be outweighed by others--notably multinational firms and the diplomatic establishment--pushing for accommodation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The real difference between China and the tigers may well be that American voices will matter much less when China's political crisis comes than they did in Taiwan, South Korea or the Philippines. Unlike South Korean generals, the Chinese will not be listening to diplomats in the American embassy counselling restraint. No American helicopters are on standby to whisk China's president off to retirement in Hawaii. More's the pity.
</p><p><b>In the forests of the night</b>
<br>One day crowds may again be on China's streets demanding change, but it is hard to imagine such a confrontation ending with the government's quick retreat, still less with its leaders being rescued by American marines. The optimists are therefore making a leap of faith when they think of China as just another tiger. Tiger it may be, but certainly no ordinary one: domestic political uncertainty looms over the country far more than in any of its smaller neighbours. You cannot say of China, as some do of the tigers, that "the economy is all that matters; growth can survive any political upheaval." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the other hand, China seems to have enough tigerish characteristics for growth to continue; it has an emerging middle class with a stake in stability; and, though its rulers may be capable of mucking up development, that is a far cry from saying they are bound to do so. The contrast between economic opportunity and political worries is familiar all over Asia. It is sharper in China than elsewhere and the worries are greater. But on balance, optimism seems better grounded than the alternative.

<h1>In the name of St Ronald</h1>

<font size=1>SAN DIEGO</font><br><p>
THERE were streamers and balloons, party hats and upbeat tunes, and lots of wonderful sideshows. Bob Dole, the Republicans' presidential nominee, cruised into San Diego by ship. Newt Gingrich, their leader in the House, won a salute from friends in the city's spectacular aquarium. Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, appeared on a Harley-Davidson motorbike, part of a cavalcade of 7,000. "Bikers believe in conservative values," he said.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Republicans are hoping that this week's convention, ending on August 15th, will launch them on the road to victory in November. In previous weeks they had bickered over the platform that the convention would adopt, and had ended up with a harsh document liable to alienate mainstream voters. Moreover, most of the convention delegates held hardline views that risked costing more votes if aired freely before the television cameras. The extremism of the Republicans' 1992 convention is thought to have contributed to George Bush's humiliation that year. And so, to avoid another fall, the convention managers' first task was to bury both platform and delegates. They succeeded brilliantly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The convention opened on August 12th, and the platform was voted through almost unnoticed: the vote was left off the schedule the organisers handed out, and many people in the convention hall were too busy shaking hands and slapping backs to pay any attention. Party bigwigs paid least attention of all. Asked about the significance of the platform, Mr Dole replied that he had not even read it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Awkward delegates were hushed up just as efficiently. Pat Buchanan, whose fiery conservatism scared off mainstream voters four years ago, was denied a chance to speak, despite the fact that he had won more than 3m votes in the primaries. Two moderate Republican governors, Pete Wilson of California and William Weld of Massachusetts, were silenced too, because they had threatened to attack the party's right wing and thereby draw attention to it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those who did speak had their words vetted in advance, with one big exception. Colin Powell, the ex-general who might have won the nomination had he wanted it, refused to be cowed. The result was memorable. The son of black immigrants, he breathed passion into the Republican faith that diligence and ability can propel anyone to the top of American life. Himself the product of a modest, hard-working family, he made the party's rhetoric on family values sound more powerful than usual. A career soldier who led America to victory in the Gulf war, he could talk the Republicans' tough foreign-policy line without being accused of empty machismo.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Powell did more than play on stock Republican themes. He took a risk, and it paid off superbly. "You all know," he told the conservative crowd, "that I believe in a woman's right to choose and I strongly support affirmative action." A few delegates booed, and then a few more. But, before a hostile momentum could build up, Mr Powell danced back to safer themes. America, he quickly said, is "a country where the best is always yet to come, a country that exists by divine providence." And he ended in a way inconceivable anywhere else in the rich world. He punched his fist into the air and shouted out, "America!"
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The delegates were on their feet and cheering. And so, by the end of the convention's first day, the conservative platform was forgotten; and the conservative delegates had lost their heart to the party's chief moderate. The ensuing days reinforced Mr Powell's achievement. Speaker after speaker emphasised Republicans' compassion: their desire to help the weak, their sympathy for the poor. The party platform was harsh on immigrants: no matter, Republicans were now celebrating their own immigrant ancestors. The party had until recently attacked those who depended on the welfare state; now, misty-eyed Republicans were painting President Clinton as the chief enemy of caring government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, having apparently buried their harsh image of the recent past, what did Republicans have to offer? Back in the spring, when Mr Dole wrapped the nomination up, it was assumed that he would campaign on the quality of his character. He has overcome war wounds that might have killed a less determined man; Mr Clinton is a draft-dodger, an adulterer, a friend of crooked property dealers. But, six months on, the character issue seems to leave voters unmoved. So now Mr Dole has performed a startling reversal. He has compromised his integrity by abandoning old beliefs, and hopes to win voters by bribing them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This self-abasement has come in two parts. First, Mr Dole promised to cut taxes without cutting spending by as much, so abandoning years of fiscal responsibility. Second, Mr Dole chose Jack Kemp as his running-mate. In the past, Mr Kemp has insulted Mr Dole. He has disagreed with Mr Dole. And, before the campaign is out, he may humiliate him.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kemp fancies himself as a man of ideas, and thinks Mr Dole a dull pragmatist. He once said that Mr Dole's library had burned down and "both books were lost--including the one that had not been coloured yet." Mr Kemp was one of the first popularisers of the idea that tax cuts pay for themselves, and he derided doubters (who included Mr Dole) as gutless pessimists. From his first years in Congress, Mr Kemp had little respect for seniority or the art of compromise, Mr Dole's chief attributes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is true that George Bush was no friend of Ronald Reagan when they joined forces in 1980, and that the two went on to victory. Mr Kemp, too, is doing his best to fall in behind his new boss. He has backed away from his old support for racial preferences, and now declares (never mind what he said before) that the children of illegal immigrants should be denied schooling. And yet, despite these shifts, Mr Kemp is at heart a prima donna. Ed Rollins, who chaired his disastrous presidential bid in 1988, described his friend and boss this way: "He was impossible to discipline and simply wouldn't listen."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kemp has a redeeming feature, and it is a big one. He shares Mr Reagan's appealing optimism, his faith that rich and poor alike will prosper from America's freedom and openness. Thus he would keep America's markets open to foreigners and free of heavy intervention by the state, believing that this promotes the spirit of enterprise which will uplift the inner cities. This view flies in the face of the Republicans' pessimistic wing, which triumphed in the writing of the platform. But it appeals to Mr Dole. Having bet his campaign on Reaganite tax cuts, Mr Dole would love to wrap himself in Mr Reagan's aura.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will this neo-Reaganism work? It is a sure bet among the party's loyalists: there were tears on the convention floor when Nancy Reagan came to represent her husband, too frail to be there. Yet Reaganism may not be enough to win uncommitted voters over to Mr Dole. For one thing, he lacks Mr Reagan's charm, and his infectious confidence in the moral value of his policies. For another, Mr Reagan's tax policies are widely reckoned to have been disastrous. Already the Democrats are running television advertisements accusing Mr Dole of taking risks with the economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some Republicans argue that the Dole tax cuts will work where Mr Reagan's backfired, because times are different. Then, Mr Reagan's tax cuts were not balanced by spending cuts, because pro-spending Democrats controlled Congress. Now, Mr Dole could be pretty sure of imposing spending cuts, because anti-government Republicans control Congress. Besides, Mr Dole is armed with a line-item veto that did not exist in Mr Reagan's time, so he can cut egregious pork out of spending bills.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such arguments are unlikely to survive the rigour of the campaign. If Mr Dole proposes budgets that cut spending by only three-quarters as much as they cut taxes, as he says he will, the deficit will grow unless a truly miraculous burst of economic growth boosts tax revenues fabulously. Besides, Mr Dole may find it harder than Mr Reagan did to unseat an incumbent president by attacking his economic record. In August 1980 America was plagued by unemployment of 7.7% and inflation of 12.9%. In 1996 Mr Clinton can boast of an economy that has created 10m jobs, of an unemployment rate of only 5.4%, of dormant inflation. In choosing to fight Mr Clinton on the economy, Mr Dole reveals his desperation.

<p><b>Indonesia</b></p>
<h1>Red scare</h1>

<font size=-1>JAKARTA</font>
<p>THE slight, bespectacled face of a young man has stared out from the front pages of most Indonesian newspapers and magazines over the past week: that of 27-year-old Budiman Sudjatmiko, leader of a group of radical activists known as the People's Democratic Party (<font size=-1>PRD</font>). He is in the unenviable position of having been singled out by the government as the mastermind behind last month's riots in Jakarta. After two weeks in hiding, Mr Budiman and nine of his colleagues have been arrested, and are expected to be charged with subversion, an offence which can carry the death penalty. Another 52 suspected <font size=-1>PRD</font> members are believed to be in custody.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government is not restricting its sweep to the <font size=-1>PRD</font>. The head of Indonesia's only independent trade union, Muchtar Pakpahan, has also been arrested and charged with subversion. The police are questioning the ousted chairwoman of the Indonesian Democratic Party, Megawati Sukarnoputri--daughter of Indonesia's erratic liberation leader and first president, Sukarno--along with several of her colleagues. It was the government-inspired removal of Megawati from politics that provoked the riots in the first place.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even Indonesia's best known author, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, has been summoned to explain his role. Aged 71, nearly blind and in poor health, he cannot have been suspected of direct involvement in any violence. But as a former communist who spent 14 years on a remote prison island, his inclusion in the investigation fits the official argument that behind the riots lay a left-wing conspiracy to overthrow the government. President Suharto himself has accused the <font size=-1>PRD</font> of being a reincarnation of the old Indonesian Communist Party, which was banned in 1965 after it launched an abortive coup.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is unlikely that many people in Indonesia believe the claim that the riots were a communist conspiracy. But it is still a potent charge in a country where hundreds of thousands of suspected communists were killed in the aftermath of the 1965 coup, and where even those only faintly connected with the coup are still stigmatised. For several months the military has been talking about "formless organisations" lurking in the shadows of Indonesian life. Dissidents of various persuasions, including Islamic militants, have been accused of using "communist methods". The <font size=-1>PRD</font>, with its openly Marxist rhetoric and confrontational stance towards the military, was a particularly easy target.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Curiously no attempt was made to close down the <font size=-1>PRD</font> earlier this year, when it organised strikes and demonstrations in several industrial centres. The authorities stood by and watched the group build links with the pro-democracy organisations, which later rallied behind Megawati Sukarnoputri. There is, in fact, little evidence that the <font size=-1>PRD</font> played a significant role in the riots. But the fact that it has now been publicly branded as an enemy of the state has spread fear among students and intellectuals, who may at some time have had contact with the group.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That puts Megawati in a delicate position. She either has to disavow many of the disparate groups who had been supporting her, or risk being charged alongside the activists from the <font size=-1>PRD</font>. Of course there is a risk for the government too: it may provoke further demonstrations if it puts Megawati on trial. So far it has proceeded cautiously, allowing her to slow her interrogation by challenging its legality. There can be little doubt that President Suharto wants her punished for the embarrassment brought about by his own clumsy attempts to remove her from the Indonesian political scene. But after more then 30 years of constant use, the old "communist" scapegoat is beginning to wear out.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<h1>Trigger happy</h1>



<p>IT TOOK Thomas Hamilton, a 43-year-old former scout leader with a grudge, only four minutes to fire 105 rounds from two 9mm Browning pistols, killing 16 little children and their teacher in Dunblane on March 13th. The government's response was admirably balanced and deliberate. Rather than rushing into ill-conceived legislation, it established an inquiry under Lord Cullen, a Scottish judge, who is expected to report next month, and promised legislation soon after his report. But now a group of the government's own backbenchers have landed it in trouble by rushing to their own judgment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The six-strong Tory majority on the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee rejected a ban on the private possession of handguns in a report published on August 13th, a move which has been almost universally condemned. Instead of winning credit for the sensible and delicate handling of the gun issue in the wake of Dunblane, the Tories were made to look as if they were insensitive blunderers. Senior ministers quickly moved to distance themselves from the report. David Maclean, a Home Office minister, desperately pointed out that the committee's view was neither Conservative nor government policy. Indeed, the outcry over the committee's report has made it all but certain that John Major will have little choice but to endorse a total ban on the private ownership of handguns, a policy already adopted by the Labour Party, even if Lord Cullen recommends something less draconian.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are three theories as to why the Tory members of the committee, chaired by Sir Ivan Lawrence, a veteran backbencher, should have put their names to a report which was bound to infuriate the public as well as present opposition <font size=-1>MP</font>s with an open goal. The first is that they were simply nobbled by the gun lobby which has extensive links to the party. A second is that Sir Ivan, who is close to Michael Howard, the home secretary, was persuaded to float a trial balloon. Mr Howard is sceptical about the practicalities of banning the private ownership of handguns, in contrast to Mr Major and Michael Forsyth, the Scottish secretary, who both believe that tough action has to be taken. The final theory is that the Tories on the committee simply took leave of their political senses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The committee's report provides few clues as to how the Tory majority reached its conclusion. The report's chief argument--that banning the private use of handguns would be ineffective because most of the handguns used in crime are unlicensed--is less than persuasive. Both Thomas Hamilton and Michael Ryan, the madman who killed 16 at Hungerford in 1987, used legally held weapons for their massacres.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The committee's claim that the practical problems of banning the private possession of handguns are virtually insuperable is equally unconvincing. To claim, as the report does, that requiring all handguns to be used and kept at licensed gun clubs would cause difficulties for starters at athletic races is to invite derision.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, there would be obstacles to be overcome and a total ban on handguns at home would restrict the freedom of some perfectly sane and reasonable gun owners. But the public seems in the mood to accept nothing less. And the size of the gun lobby is easy to overestimate. Shooting is reputed to be the third most widely pursued sport after fishing and walking, with more than a million people taking part. But the vast majority are shotgun and rifle owners. Only 57,000 people have handgun licences compared to 723,000 shotgun-licence holders.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many gun-club members are off-duty policemen and women. Most of these would probably favour much tighter controls. The Association of Chief Police Officers has called for a ban on any handgun with a calibre above .22-inch capable of firing more than one shot without reloading. This would eliminate about 90% of the 200,000 handguns held legally in Britain. The Police Federation, which represents junior officers, renewed its call for a ban on the private possession of all handguns on August 14th after a 22-year-old man was convicted of a murder committed with a handgun bought through the post.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evidence submitted to the Cullen inquiry shows a close international correlation between gun ownership and gun crime. For example, 150 times as many handgun murders are committed in the United States as in England and Wales. Japan, which has fewer than half the number of gun murders than Britain, has the most restrictive gun laws in the world. No Japanese is allowed to keep a handgun at home and illegal possession of a firearm is punishable by 15 years in prison.

<p><b>Inner-city schools</b></p>
<h1>Lessons in self-improvement</h1>

<font size=1>BIRMINGHAM</font>
<p>CALLERS to Ed Doolan's phone-in show on <font size=-1>BBC</font> Radio <font size=-1>WM</font> in Birmingham now have, it seems, one thing less to complain about. When Mr Doolan gave evidence to the Birmingham Education Commission, an inquiry set up by the city's Labour council in 1993, he said his show got a constant stream of angry calls about the state of local schools. The commission's damning findings prompted the council to set up an ambitious school-improvement scheme. Now, says Mr Doolan, "it is very rare to get a complaint about the schools."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more conventional indicator of Birmingham's progress is the one used in the government's school league tables: the proportion of pupils who get at least five <font size=-1>GCSE</font> passes at grade "<font size=-1>C</font>" or better. By this measure, Birmingham's council-run schools are improving, but still have some way to go. The proportion of pupils with five passes rose from 26.8% in 1993 to 31.2% in 1995, when the national average was 43.5%. The council is hoping that this year's <font size=-1>GCSE</font> results, published on August 22nd, will be better still, and raise it from last year's 85th position in the league table of England's 108 local-education authorities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clearly it will take some years for the effects of any improvement in the city's nursery and primary schools to show up in better exam grades for those leaving secondary school. But there is little doubt that the schools are being transformed. The Birmingham Education Commission issued a follow-up report in October 1995, and according to Professor Ted Wragg of Exeter University, its chairman, the commission found that "remarkable progress" had been made in dealing with its earlier criticisms. David Blunkett, the Labour Party's education spokesman, has made a series of visits to Birmingham and has picked up some lessons for the party's education policy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The strategy to improve Birmingham's schools was the brain-child of Tim Brighouse, who became the city's chief education officer just as the commission published its first report in 1993. The most important in his long list of initiatives is getting each school to set itself an ambitious but achievable set of targets, and to keep raising those targets each year. Schools also have to make a series of guarantees to their pupils. For instance, primary-school pupils are promised a part in some sort of public performance (such as a play or concert), and secondary-school pupils are guaranteed work experience in a local business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The council has also responded to criticism that it does not spend a sufficient share of its income on schools: in this financial year the schools budget is &#163;316m compared with &#163;283m two years ago.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Grove Junior &amp; Infants' School in Handsworth is one of the star performers in Birmingham's improvement scheme. The school won national attention last year when four 11-year-old pupils took and passed their <font size=-1>GCSE</font> in maths--five years early. In a speech in January, Tony Blair, Labour's leader, cited this as an example of the sort of academic "fast-tracking" for able pupils that a Labour government would encourage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anybody visiting Grove school after hearing horror stories about violence and chaos in urban schools is in for a pleasant surprise. David Winkley, the head teacher, has created an oasis of relative calm in one of Britain's poorest inner-city districts. The school has a waiting list of parents wanting to get their children in--Mr Winkley boasts that he even gets applications from Sutton Coldfield, one of Birmingham's more affluent suburbs. The school's walls are covered in examples of good work, ranging from algebra to art. The school tests its 720 pupils three times a year and plots their results on a computer database, comparing how well each one performed with predictions based on results from earlier tests.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apart from fast-tracking for able pupils, Grove school is already carrying out several measures recently adopted as policy by Labour: children who fall behind get intensive coaching; plenty of homework is set, and there is a "homework club" after school for those who fail to hand in their work; all parents sign home-school contracts and are summoned to the school if their children misbehave. Pupils are tested as they start their compulsory schooling at the age of five, a Labour proposal which has now been taken up by the government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Wendy Davies took over as head teacher of Selly Park girls' secondary school in the mid-1980s, it was facing closure because of falling numbers. Now it is oversubscribed. In 1989 only 5% of pupils left with five or more <font size=-1>GCSE</font>s at grade '<font size=-1>C</font>' or better; last year 30% did so, and the target for this year is 35%. Since 83% of the girls do not have English as their first language, and most of them come from a Muslim culture where academic achievement has not traditionally been seen as important for girls, this is a considerable achievement.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour says it will make all local-education authorities draw up school-improvement targets, as Birmingham has done. The contrast between Birmingham's progress and the lack of action in other inner-city boroughs shows that it is also necessary to send inspectors to examine the quality of management at councils' education departments, as both Labour and the government are proposing to do. As one senior inspector puts it: "Tim Brighouse offers leadership where other chief education officers only offer management." Schools are under pressure to do better, but by getting them to set their own targets and letting them decide how to reach them, Mr Brighouse has avoided giving teachers the impression that an endless stream of impossible demands is being imposed from on high.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Blunkett could also learn a lot from this management style, which Mr Brighouse shares with successful head teachers like Mr Winkley and Mrs Davies: they somehow manage to combine iron resolve with an outward air of warm collegiality. None of them likes to talk about the messy business of removing people who are not up to the job. But each has the patience and determination to find ways of doing so without provoking bitterness. The heads of 80 of Birmingham council's 450 schools left their jobs or took early retirement in Mr Brighouse's first two years, and yet inspectors have noted a big improvement in morale among teachers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One lesson from Birmingham that Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, will find especially encouraging is that a great deal can be achieved in Britain's inner-city schools at little extra cost. It is true that Birmingham is spending more on its schools, but many of its successes have cost next to nothing: setting targets; involving parents; even Grove school's computer system for monitoring pupils' progress is fairly cheap.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour wants to put most of any extra spending on education into primary schools, where classes are larger and inspectors' reports have uncovered alarming shortcomings. Birmingham's experience suggests that it may be possible to convince secondary schools to accept this. Mrs Davies says she understands Birmingham council's decision to put most of its extra spending into primary schools because if these schools send her 11-year-olds who can read, write and do maths properly, then her job will be much easier.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It will be a few more years before the extent of Birmingham's success becomes clear. But the improvements so far should make it clear to Labour's leadership that it now needs to put pressure on other, Labour-run councils in Britain's cities to spend less time bleating about government funding, to banish the notion that little academic progress can be expected from the children of poor families or from ethnic minorities, and to take action.

<p><b>Social housing</b></p>
<h1>A conundrum</h1>


<p>IT SEEMED to make good sense. Switching housing subsidies from bricks and mortar to those in need, combined with the policy of allowing council-house tenants to buy their homes, was supposed to save money by getting millions of employed people to pay their own housing costs, and to target spending on those who really required help. The policy achieved these goals. But it has also had unforeseen consequences and landed the government in something of a hole.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The point has now been reached where savings from reducing government housing grants are offset by resulting increases in housing-benefit payments and, because higher rents increase the retail-prices index, in other government benefits which are linked to the index.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the past 17 years, council-house and housing-association rents have more than doubled in real terms as the government has almost halved capital grants to them. Since 1990, the proportion of costs of building new housing-association properties borne by government has declined from 79% to 58%. Another 2% cut in grant has just been announced for next year by David Curry, the housing minister. Spending on housing grants declined from &#163;12.5 billion in the fiscal year 1979-80 to &#163;4.9 billion in 1994-95. Raising rents to nearer market levels also enabled housing associations to attract &#163;10 billion of private finance and build many more homes for rent. But much of this saving has been offset by a rise in benefit payments. In the past five years, housing benefit, used to pay for these higher rents, has more than doubled in real terms to more than &#163;10 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The disadvantages of this rapid switch are now becoming apparent. New housing-association properties have to be let at such high prices--&#163;85 a week--that many poor families cannot afford them, unless they qualify for housing benefit. The result is a welfare trap. The perverse inter-reaction between housing and other benefits, which can involve withdrawal of benefit at rates as high as 97p for every pound earned, means that for many it makes little sense to work. A family with two children in a high-rent property might have to earn as much as &#163;250 a week to be significantly better off. Even then, the family would probably have to move to cheaper accommodation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dependence on housing benefit has also helped create a culture in which fraud, both by individuals cheating the system and by landlords milking it, has become endemic. A report by the House of Commons Social Security Committee, published earlier this year, estimated that a fifth of the housing-benefit budget, ie, &#163;2 billion annually, was being swallowed up in bogus payments.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact that an increasing number of council and housing-association estates are occupied almost exclusively by those on benefit is having a devastating effect on the social cohesion of many of these places. Research commissioned in 1993 by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an independent charity, found that the average income on large new housing-association estates is a third of the national average. One in two of the households surveyed was headed by a lone parent, three-quarters of the tenants had no job and child densities were three to six times the officially recommended level.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The case for digging no further into this particular welfare hole may be overwhelming. But there is no obvious way to get out. Ministers privately accept that rapid rent increases have now become counter-productive. And yet an increase in capital grants is not currently an attractive option for either government or opposition, who have both pledged spending restraint. Modifying earnings ceilings before benefits are withdrawn and smoothing benefit withdrawal rates makes sense, but any such overhaul drastic enough to matter much would also be extremely expensive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One way to lower rents on new housing, and thus housing-benefit payments and the poverty trap for new renters, would be to make housing associations pool rents across the whole of their housing stock. But this would raise rents for those in older properties, limiting the savings and the effect on the poverty trap. Building new housing to a lower standard, and so more cheaply, would also lower rents. But this threatens to produce the slums of the future and may be more costly in the long term.

<p><b>Microsoft v Netscape</b></p>
<h1>Freer than free</h1>
<p><b>The battle for control of the Internet is now about marketing pizazz, rather than technological prowess</b></p>

<p>IN THE Internet's distant youth--say, three months ago--bits and bytes were what counted. The software engineers at Netscape made Navigator, the fastest, whizziest "Web browser", and around 85% of all Internet surfers used the program. Confident that Navigator had a clear advantage over Internet Explorer, Microsoft's rival product, the stockmarket valued Netscape at more than $6 billion. Now Netscape's valuation is closer to $3 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason for this adjustment made its debut on August 12th: Microsoft's Internet Explorer (version 3.0). To cut a long technological argument short, this new version is on a par with Navigator. However, parity does not guarantee Microsoft anything. After all, Microsoft currently has a market share of less than 5%. Internet folk will desert an accepted standard only if they are bullied, bribed or seduced into doing so. These enticements are, in their legal form, known as marketing, a business in which Microsoft's boss, Bill Gates, is fearsome.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Observers may wonder what all the fuss is about. Certainly not direct revenues: both Microsoft and Netscape give their browsers away free (Microsoft to all users; Netscape to about half). Instead, browsers are a loss-leader in what could prove a rich Internet software market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Netscape already makes a third of its money by selling "server" software and services to people who run Web sites. These people stump up because of the ubiquity and reputation of Netscape's browser. Microsoft's strategy works in a similar way, but Mr Gates's mind is really on something bigger. Browsers implicitly challenge the traditional <font size=-1>PC</font> world that Microsoft dominates; like other Internet software, they can run on all sorts of computers, not just <font size=-1>PC</font>s using Microsoft Windows software. To protect its franchise, Microsoft needs to turn its browser, which uses Windows technology, into the standard.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over the past few months Mr Gates has struck a series of deals with leading Internet-access companies to give their subscribers Internet Explorer as the default browser. This arrangement now extends to the three main commercial on-line services, America Online, CompuServe and Microsoft's own Microsoft Network, as well as to the two biggest Internet-only providers, <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s WorldNet and Netcom. On August 14th, the two biggest British Internet service providers also said they were defecting from Navigator to Internet Explorer. Most of these deals have been waiting for Microsoft to release version 3.0 of Internet Explorer; now that it has done, the firms will start shipping the browser to subscribers. Between them they reach more than 13m subscribers--the vast majority of home users.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such ruthless marketing tactics may explain both Mr Gates's wealth and his lack of friends in the software industry. In fact, many current users may still stick with Netscape's browser out of habit. Anticipating that, Microsoft has found another way to turn their heads. It has signed a further raft of deals that will give users of its new browser free access to some popular services that otherwise charge a fee. These include the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> Web site (which now charges an annual on-line subscription of $49), <font size=-1>ESPN</font>'s sports site, and InvestorsEdge.com, a financial site.
</p><p><b>Charge of the byte brigade</b></b>
<br>Worst of all for Netscape, Microsoft controls the best marketing channel of all: the <font size=-1>PC</font>'s operating system. Most new <font size=-1>PC</font>s are shipped with Microsoft's Windows <font size=-1>95</font>, which now includes Internet Explorer. That will account for 46m copies in 1996 alone (although they will be useful only for the computers that are connected to the Internet), reckons Dataquest, a consultancy. The next version of Windows, which is not due until next year, will have the browser built in, eliminating the entire concept of a browser as a stand-alone program.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft makes more money from the interest on its $7 billion of cash than Netscape's total annual revenues. "Microsoft can afford to buy market share," says Martin Haeberli, Netscape's director of technology. "We can argue about the fairness of that approach, but we can't compete in the same way."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet even if the contest is purely about marketing prowess, Netscape has some things going for it--such as its own marketing innovativeness and brand loyalty. Thanks to its 85% market share, the firm has at least one version of its browser in the hands of virtually every user who might want one. Netscape reached its current position by letting the Internet do its marketing and distribution for it: word of its software brought millions of users to its Web site to download a copy. Now about 30,000 Web sites around the Internet sport a logo encouraging users to download the latest version of Navigator from Netscape's site.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But in its race to stay ahead of Microsoft, Netscape has loaded Navigator with so many features that downloading has turned into an hour-long ordeal. So Netscape is having to adopt more conventional (and expensive) methods to get the latest version of its browser into the hands of users: it is hard to buy a modem or e-mail software these days without a copy of Navigator being thrown in free. Netscape even bundles its software with Hewlett-Packard's popular consumer printers (which must have impressed Microsoft; the software giant plans to do the same).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Haeberli admits that Netscape's market share will shrink under Mr Gates's bombardment. Interse, a Web tracking firm, reports that the number of visitors using Internet Explorer at its site has doubled to 16% in the past month. Mr Haeberli claims that browsers are just one battle in a much bigger Internet war. He compares the marketplace to a sea of fog with a few hills visible nearby. Netscape dominates the browser hill; Microsoft may soon replace it. "People assume that this is the highest hill, but we're not making that mistake." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What might be a higher one? If Netscape knows, it is not telling. This sounds a little like putting a flag in front of a retreat and calling it a parade, but there are grounds for trusting Netscape. In the race for the next big thing, it is often wise to favour the firm that found the last one.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<h1><center>At last, the real race begins</center></h1>


PRESIDENTIAL elections have a habit of tempting candidates to perform somersaults. As the 1996 campaign gets properly under way, with the Republican Party convention in San Diego on August 12th-15th, followed by the Democrats' convention in Chicago a fortnight later, the displays of gymnastic and other forms of virtuosity are proving more spectacular than anything seen in Atlanta this past month. And the task for voters is coming down to this: to decide which of the displays reflects genuine abilities, and which might be the temporary result of performance-enhancing substances.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few months ago the race looked straightforward, the likely outcome even more so. It has always been foolhardy to predict the outcome and still is, even with Bill Clinton retaining a big lead in the opinion polls. But it is in the race itself that the surprises are coming. As the conventions open, the prevailing fashion is for role-reversal. The energetic incumbent, whose 50th birthday is on August 19th, is approaching November as the conservative, standing for moderation, for caution and for a safe pair of hands. Meanwhile his 73-year-old opponent, Bob Dole, who until recently had claimed that his greatest virtues were his experience, his track record, his steadiness, has suddenly started to present himself as the optimistic radical, eager to slash taxes and transform the American economy. A third-party candidate, whether Richard Lamm for the Reform Party or more likely the party's founder, Ross Perot, may yet manage to confuse the two-party picture. No matter: it is already confused enough.
</p><p><b>Bob Dole's political economics</b>
<br>If <i>The Economist</i> were an American voter seeking to make sense of the campaign, between now and November 5th it would be seeking evidence to help choose between two hopes: the hope that Bob Dole is lying; and the hope that Bill Clinton is telling the truth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To a Republican tactician, to hope that Bob Dole is lying will sound bizarre. This week Mr Dole released an economic plan called "Restoring the American Dream" which is designed to unite the fissiparous Republican Party (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>) and to act as the centre-piece of his campaign. In it, he says the American economy is growing much too slowly; if he is elected he will press on the accelerator by lowering personal income taxes, removing regulations, reforming the tax system and, while he's at it, balancing the federal budget. The middle classes are worried about high taxes and stagnant wages, so Mr Dole promises to deal with both. Since it is middle-class votes that win elections, this ought surely to be a winner.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It would be, if it made sense. It may do, in political terms. But in economic terms it is dubious, to say the least. Mr Dole's measures look attractive when each is viewed in isolation. In combination, the result looks ugly. Mr Dole proposes no serious cuts in federal spending, and has promised to leave Medicare, Social Security and defence, which together account for the bulk of the budget, untouched. That leaves his promise both to cut taxes and balance the budget dependent on magic. And it is better to save your tax-cuts until tax reform is well under way, for reform creates losers as well as winners, and some spare change is essential if the losers are to be persuaded to accept it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, the claim that tax cuts will boost the economy also invites scepticism: with unemployment already down to 5.3% of the workforce, growth is unlikely to accelerate for long without igniting inflation, the fear of which will lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Tax and regulatory reform might eventually help the economy to grow faster without boosting inflation, by encouraging investment and productivity, but a true budget-balancer would not count on it. He would wait, as the old Bob Dole used to say, to get his dividend before he spent it.
</p><p><b>Bill Clinton's political zig-zags</b>
<br>That is why the hope must be that the old Bob Dole is the real one, that decades of senatorial prudence have not suddenly been ditched. It is an awkward hope for voters, for you cannot expect a candidate willingly to offer evidence for the proposition that he is lying. But the other hope--that Mr Clinton is telling the truth--will also be hard to prove.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason why this hope matters is that Mr Clinton's greatest talent is self-transformation. More even than other politicians, he follows the polls and shapes himself accordingly. In his first two years of office he was an activist president, seeking to extend federal responsibilities in all sorts of ways. Since the mid-term congressional elections of 1994 he has taken a different stance, seeking to "triangulate" himself midway between old Democrats and rabid Republicans, trying to trim government back rather than extend it. His latest move, agreeing last week to sign a welfare bill that will end a federal guarantee of welfare benefits to poor families that was established in 1935, was his most dramatic yet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In one sense, this was merely a belated implementation of a promise he made in the 1992 campaign "to end welfare as we know it". Even on that level it was significant, as for three-and-a-half years he appeared to have changed his mind. Even more than that, however, it looked like a statement of future intent, a demonstration that the new Bill Clinton really does mean to cut government, to eliminate the deficit and to devolve responsibilities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the difficulty, with Mr Clinton, will be to judge whether he will mean this as much in 1997 as he does in the run-up to November 5th. The Democrats' convention may offer some clues, through his manner of dealing with intra-party opposition. Mr Clinton's stance, as an experienced president who admits to his mistakes and learns from them, is an appealing one, as the opinion polls show. Yet after November a re-elected Bill Clinton would be in what for him is uncharted territory: the chance to govern, without worrying about the next election. How will he behave then? That is what voters must decide.

<p><h2>Martian microbes</h2></p>
<p><p>Scientists at <font size=-1>NASA</font>, America's space agency, announced that they had found evidence of bacteria-like <b>life on Mars</b> inside a meterorite from Mars discovered 12 years in Antarctica. An excited President Clinton hailed this "most stunning insight into our universe that science has ever discovered," and promised to send lots of missions to Mars.</p>
<p><h2>Targeting Iran</h2></p>
<p><p>William Perry, America's defence secretary, said that American forces in Saudi Arabia had been put on<b> high alert</b> to prepare against a possible attack. Iran's foreign minister protested to the <font size=-1>UN</font> after Mr Perry charged Iran with being the leading suspect in some recent terrorist attacks against Americans.
<p>Bill Clinton signed into law a measure to <b>punish foreign companies </b>that invest more than $40m annually in Iranian or Libyan oil and gas. A violation of international trading laws, responded outraged governments in Europe; some threatened retaliation.
<p>The <b>"oil for food"</b> agreement between Iraq and the <font size=-1>UN</font> was given the go-ahead by the Clinton administration. Iraq will be allowed to sell $2 billion-worth of oil on a six-monthly basis to pay for food and medical supplies.
<p>Yasser Arafat tried to defuse <b>Palestinian anger</b>, including calls for a new <i>intifada</i>, after a prisoner was beaten to death in a Nablus jail and a Hamas demonstrator was shot dead by security forces. A Jericho court sentenced three police officers to 10-15 years hard labour for the beating, and more than 20 Hamas prisoners were released.
<p>Binyamin Netanyahu wants Israeli-Syrian peace talks to concentrate on Israel's possible withdrawal from<b> south Lebanon</b> before any discussion of the occupied Golan Heights. No, said Syria's President Assad.
<p>Supporters of Muhammad Farrah Aideed, the self-declared president of <b>Somalia</b> who died from bullet wounds in Mogadishu, declared his son Hussein "president" in his place.
<p>Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated government said it would not join other East African countries in imposing sanctions on the new Tutsi-led military regime in <b>Burundi</b>. The Burundian army was accused of massacres of Hutu civilians in a <font size=-1>UN</font> report.</p>
<p><h2>Over one hurdle</h2></p>
<p><p>The European Union persuaded Bosnian Croats in <b>Mostar</b> to accept the results of municipal elections held in June. The <font size=-1>EU</font>, which had been rebuilding the city, had threatened to end its mission unless the Croats stopped boycotting the Muslim-led city council.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Serbia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, and his Croatian counterpart, Franjo Tudjman, agreed to recognise each other's countries and restore <b>diplomatic relations</b>. The agreement, brokered by the Greek prime minister, Costas Simitis, is expected to help stabilise the Balkans.
<p>Separatist guerrillas in <b>Chechnya</b> launched an offensive to recapture the capital, Grozny, from Russian troops. A news agency reported that "the city is effectively controlled by the rebels." 
<p>Shortly after an Italian court had freed Erich Priebke, a former <font size=-1>SS</font> officer who participated in the <b>massacre</b> of 335 Italian civilians in the second world war, he was re-arrested because Germany had applied for his extradition.
<p>France's prime minister, Alain Jupp&eacute;, said his cabinet had agreed to cut <b>government spending</b> by 2% in real terms in 1997. Earlier speculation that France would fail to qualify for monetary union in 1999 weakened the French franc and lowered bond prices.
<p>Germany's finance minister, Theo Waigel, said the government would cut the <b>top income-tax rate</b> from 53% to 40% and further reduce a tax surcharge imposed to finance the country's unification.</p>
<p><h2>Tanking up</h2></p>
<p><p>Pakistan agreed to buy 320 Russian-built <b>tanks </b>from Ukraine, according to an Indian news agency. The tanks were said to be cheap and equal to any western model.
<p>Indonesian police arrested about 170 people said to belong to the opposition party of <b>Megawati Sukarnoputri</b>. The crackdown followed a riot, in which three people died, when security forces raided Megawati's party headquarters.
<p>The prosecution demanded the <b>death penalty </b>for Chun Doo Hwan, a former president of South Korea, who is accused of mutiny and treason in connection with an army coup and the massacre of opponents. Life imprisonment was demanded for Roh Tae Woo, another former president on similar charges.
<p>China launched a plan to reclaim 53m hectares (130m acres) lost to <b>desert</b>. About a third of China is desert.</p>
<p><h2>A cruel month</h2></p>
<p><p>Bob Dole, unveiling a tax-cutting economic policy, went into the <b>Republican convention</b> still about 20 percentage points behind Bill Clinton in the opinion polls. The Republicans fear such a margin could make them lose control of Congress, even though the Democrats' poll lead in House races is only about four points.
<p>Having decided to admit women, the Citadel, a military college in Charleston, South Carolina, will put latches on <b>bedroom doors</b>, and require people to knock.
<p>One of the alleged conspirators in the murder of <b>would-be Mexican president</b> Luis Donaldo Colosio in 1994 was freed for lack of evidence. Red faces in the government.

<p><h2>Of no import</h2></p>
<p><p><b>Malaysia </b>said that it might introduce quotas and higher import duties if the country's current-account deficit does not shrink soon. Like other South-East Asian countries, Malaysia is adjusting to a slowdown in galloping export growth.
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The rise in the <b>Swiss franc</b>, which seems to be the result largely of a flight by investors out of the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark ahead of European economic and monetary union, is causing problems. The Swiss central bank is under pressure to cut interest rates--but the inflow of capital is helping to push up monetary growth, risking a revival of Swiss inflation.
<p>America and Japan settled their differences, more or less, over their <b>semiconductor-trade row</b>, with Japan generally getting its own way. No new import targets were set, and the two agreed to set up a chip makers' committee to watch over the industry.</p>
<p><h2>Up and away</h2></p>
<p><p>Among several American get-togethers were <b>two big takeovers</b>. <font size=-1>GE</font> Capital, General Electric's burgeoning financial-services unit, paid $1.8 billion for First Colony, a Virginia-based life-insurance company with $11 billion in assets. Consolidation in health care continued with the agreed $2.1 billion takeover by PacifiCare Health Systems of <font size=-1>FHP</font> International, which has floundered since failing to buy WellPoint 18 months ago. PacifiCare will become America's fifth-largest managed health-care outfit.
<p>Two more <b>British life insurers</b> are to merge. Refuge Group and United Friendly Group, which between them have &#163;6.5 billion ($10.1 billion) under management, will form a company called United Assurance. They plan to shed 1,800 jobs.
<p><b>Rank Organisation</b>, a big British entertainment firm, plans to restructure itself. A new holding company, Rank Group, will focus on core activities--films, recreation and the Hard Rock brand. Rank will sell non-core interests, including its minority stake in Rank Xerox. Its pre-tax profits were &#163;128m ($196m) in the first half of 1996, down from &#163;444m last year.
<p>The full privatisation of <b>Stet</b>, Italy's telecoms giant, is to go ahead. The present centre-left government overcame the opposition of communists and unions to get one of the country's biggest asset sales off the ground by next March. Stet's shares fell sharply.
<p>The French government moved Yves Michot up from managing director to become chairman of state-owned <b>A&eacute;rospatiale</b>. He will oversee the proposed merger with Dassault Aviation and the restructuring of Airbus Industrie, in which A&eacute;rospatiale has a 37% stake.</p>

</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><p><h2>Bust-ups</h2></p><p><b>Europe Online</b>, which tried to establish a multilingual Internet service to rival CompuServe, was declared bankrupt by a Luxembourg court after talks with possible purchasers failed. Meanwhile, the world's biggest on-line service, America Online, suffered an embarrassing nine-hour blackout while it was loading new software.
<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Passengers on <b>British Airways</b> moved up-class in the first quarter, boosting pre-tax profits by 11% to &#163;150m ($330m). But its share price continued to weaken as relations with its American partner worsened. <font size=-1>US</font>Air, which last week launched an antitrust suit against <font size=-1>BA</font> over its proposed alliance with American Airlines, now wants the courts to sever its three-year link with <font size=-1>BA</font>.
<p>Japan's Sony and Philips of the Netherlands are to begin licensing patents for the next generation of <b>digital video discs</b>, saying they are fed up with endless talks in the consumer-electronics industry on the pooling of patents which has delayed the launch of a new range of <font size=-1>DVD</font>s.</p>
<p><h2>Embarrassing</h2></p>
<p><p>The <b>Bank of Japan</b> is to order several "major banks" to tighten up management of their operations abroad after an investigation in New York found, among other laxities, that many banks had not separated their dealing and settlement functions--a flaw that caused both the Barings collapse and the Daiwa debacle, when a lone trader in each case was found to be handling both functions.
<p>America's <b>National Association of Securities Dealers</b> is to spend $100m combatting abuses in the Nasdaq stockmarket, as part of a settlement with regulators. Under the deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which follows a two-year investigation, the <font size=-1>NASD</font> will make it easier for regulators to police dealers' trading practices.
<p>Despite a 76% increase in provisions for bad debt, <b>Union Bank of Switzerland</b>, the country's biggest, recorded first-half net profits of SFr1.11 billion ($932m), a rise of 33%. <b>Dresdner</b>, Germany's second-biggest bank, reported an even bigger profit rise of 44%, to DM1.4 billion ($950m).
<p><p>Strong growth in their Asian banking operations boosted half-year results for two London-based banking groups. Pre-tax profits at <b>HSBC</b> <b>Holdings</b> soared by 34% to &#163;2.3 billion ($5.6 billion), and at <b>Standard Chartered</b>, where business in the Middle East and Africa was also good, they rose by 27% to &#163;406m, excluding &#163;42m-worth of exceptionals.<b> Barclays Bank</b> also reported a profits increase of 15% to &#163;1.3 billion, triggering a &#163;470m share buyback.

<h1><center>The first extra-terrestrials</center></h1>
<p><b>The discovery of even provisional evidence of life on Mars is an historic event. But it is still a long way from the discovery of alien intelligence</b></p>


YOU are not alone--maybe. The search for extra-terrestrial life is the most compelling of all scientific quests. If life were found elsewhere, it would change humanity's view of itself forever. No longer the lone, brave experiment on a little planet, but a cosmic commonplace--and the ultimate knockdown. Copernicus told people they were not at the centre of the universe. Darwin told them they were not a divine creation. Now the risen apes are hearing that the same evolutionary process that created them may have gone on elsewhere. Analysis of a meteorite from the Allan Hills of Antarctica (see <a href="st1.html">page</a>) suggests that it may have happened on Mars.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The evidence is not water-tight. But it is the best that could be hoped for from such a source. The rock in question was blasted from Mars's surface by an asteroid impact, wandered in the vacuum of space for 15m years, where it would have been bombarded by powerful radiation, and then came screaming through the earth's atmosphere at breakneck speed, banging into Antarctica, where it sat through 13,000 consecutive winters. Rough handling of this sort is not conducive to the preservation of delicate biological features.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet such features still seem, according to the scientists, to be there. They have found what they believe is evidence that the rock in question was once inhabited by Martians. Not, to be sure, the malign, tentacled geniuses invented by H. G. Wells, but things a bit closer to terrestrial bacteria. But even bacteria would qualify as a scientific bombshell.
</p><p><b>The measure of mankind</b>
<br>True, Wells may have caught the public mood better. What most people want, and want to measure themselves against, are not bugs, but bug-eyed monsters. A couple of times, astronomers have thought they have heard them. When Jocelyn Bell first noticed a regularly pulsing radio signal coming from the sky in 1967, she nicknamed it "<font size=-1>LGM-1</font>" after the ubiquitous Little Green Men of <font size=-1>B</font>-movie science-fiction. The discovery a few weeks later of <font size=-1>LGM-2</font> somewhat dampened the idea that a first contact with extra-terrestrial intelligence had at last been made (the signals turned out to be coming from a new class of star now known as pulsars). A second radio emission, known as the "Wow Signal", also attracted fans of extra-terrestrial intelligence. The signal was heard in 1977 by astronomers at Ohio State University. It looked, to the faithful, like a radio beacon. Unfortunately, when they looked again, it had vanished.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And that, so far, is it. No reliable radio signal from an alien civilisation has been detected. Short of a visitation from such a civilisation's ambassadors, radio is the only way any such contact can be made.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For those who still believe in the uniqueness of Man, therefore, there remains a slim hope. If the evidence from the Allan Hills meteorite stands up in the court of world scientific opinion--and it will be vigorously contested over the coming months--it may mean that primitive life can evolve quite easily. That says nothing, though, about how easy it is to arrive at intelligence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is known of the history of the solar system suggests that the earth and Mars are probably the only bodies that have experienced the sort of conditions (moderate temperature, tolerable atmosphere, water and so on) that are needed to support life, at least as the term is understood by terrestrial biologists. If life originated separately on each of these planets--and there is a slim chance that one could have "infected" the other through a meteorite--this suggests that evolving life from non-living ingredients could be quite common.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there remains a large gap between bacteria and intelligence. Even on earth, a dispassionate history of life would, save for a brief appendix, be a history of bacteria. The oldest terrestrial fossils date back over 3 billion years. Multicellular animals have been around for barely a sixth of this time; modern human intelligence for a mere 200,000 years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On earth, the evolution of intelligence involved at least four giant leaps. The first, and in many ways hardest, was from bacteria to the more complex cells of which animals and plants are composed. The second came when these cells formed viable colonies (ie, bodies). This meant some cells giving up the sacred right of reproduction in order to specialise in other functions, something that goes strongly against the evolutionary grain. The third was for animals to become complex enough, and to develop sufficiently sophisticated nervous systems, to allow for intelligence. Even when this had happened, at the beginning of the period known as the Triassic, it still took around 250m years before the fourth leap, when man's ancestors started to develop a brain big enough to support such intelligence. It is quite possible, therefore, that the galaxy is teeming with primitive life, but that none of it, other than that on earth, is intelligent.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The message of the Allan Hills meteorite could, therefore, be somewhat paradoxical. If it does indeed contain the first evidence of extra-terrestrial life, that is tremendously exciting. But it may also suggest that the history of life is not one of automatic progress from primeval soup to potent primate. That is a somewhat different conclusion from the one the extra-terrestrial enthusiasts have been urging. Rather than telling us we are not alone, the Allan Hills meteorite may emphasise how utterly alone we are.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<h1>.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;to the grave?</h1>

<p><b>The Republican Party is in a mess. The Republican philosophy is healthy</b></p>


<p>A LITTLE over a year ago, America's Republicans were ecstatic. In the mid-term election of November 1994 they had won control of both House and Senate, ending 40 years of Democratic dominance of Congress. Once in power, they had defied predictions that they would squabble among themselves, remaining united behind their campaign manifesto, the Contract with America. Their leaders talked grandly of a rising Republican tide, of a new Republican age to match the six-decade-long "liberal ascendancy" that began with the New Deal in the 1930s (liberal in the American sense of social-democratic). There was little question in Republican minds that, come 1996, their presidential candidate would campaign on the merits of the Contract--and emerge victorious.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now a very different kind of tide is lapping round the Republicans as they gather for their party convention in San Diego on August 12th-15th. This tide is threatening to drown them. Their presidential candidate, Bob Dole, lags behind Bill Clinton in opinion polls; some Republicans fear that they might even lose control of the House this November. In May Mr Dole announced his resignation from the Senate to distance himself from his congressional colleagues, who had earned a bad name for themselves by pushing their campaign for spending cuts to the point of closing down the federal government for days on end. And over the next three months he turned the Contract's tactics upside down: rather than offer a list of clear promises, as the Contract did, he mumbled his way through a series of speeches that committed him to as little as possible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Mr Dole finally broke this pattern, on August 5th, he repudiated much of last year's Republican programme. He unveiled a proposed series of tax cuts, which may give his campaign a boost. But he abandoned the pledge, trumpeted loudly by congressional Republicans last year, to pay for these cuts by controlling the cost of defence and big entitlement schemes (health care for the elderly; pensions). Instead, he reverted to the old Reaganite line: that tax cuts to some extent pay for themselves by stimulating growth and revenues, while spending cuts to balance the budget need not be specified. Balancing the budget without such leaps of faith had been a big part of the Contract.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tensions within party ranks are bound to be visible through the cheerful fa&ccedil;ade of the Republican convention. Over the past few months the party has been riven by arguments over abortion which threaten to spill on to the convention floor. Colin Powell, whom Mr Dole wanted as his running mate, may use his speech in San Diego to defend affirmative-action plans to help blacks; if he does, opponents of racial preferences may stage a walk-out. Pat Buchanan, who challenged Mr Dole's nomination from the right, issues veiled threats of secession from the party.
</p><p><b>Triumph or tragedy?</b></b>
<br>Was this humiliating fall inevitable? Optimistic Republicans put their recent setbacks down to superficial mistakes, representing mere hiccups on the way to an era of Republican dominance. If Mr Dole were a better campaigner, they think, if he would stick to his message and smile just a little bit, he would stand an excellent chance against the tele-friendly Mr Clinton. Equally, if the congressional Republicans had played their hand more skilfully over the past year, if they had not alienated voters by bringing the government to a close, the entire party would be more popular. Republican believers still maintain that, by 2001, and perhaps even by next year, their party will control both the White House and Congress, and will be radically changing the way America is governed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sceptics, on the other hand, see last year's Republican unity, not this year's disarray, as the real anomaly. They see the party as a muddled alliance of libertarians and moralists, tax-cutters and spending hawks, technocratic visionaries and anti-Internet reactionaries. On their view, Mr Dole's unfocused campaign reflects more than his personal flaws; it reflects the confusion within his party. The sceptics predict that over the next decade or so the Republicans will shamble along, unable to bring about big change. American government will continue to hand out favours to interest groups; it will remain highly indebted and increasingly unpopular.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sceptics' case starts by emphasising the most obvious split in Republican ranks, that between social moderates and conservatives. Exit polls taken after the 1994 landslide showed that the Republicans had made their biggest gains among two intensely conservative groups, Southern whites and born-again Christians. White evangelicals cast one in three Republican votes; two in five came from religious conservatives, a group that includes members of mainstream churches as well as evangelical ones. These voters had little in common with the libertarians and socially tolerant business elites who had earlier made their home in the Republican Party.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The resulting split made itself felt in the Republican primaries this spring. Then, Mr Buchanan carried the banner of the religious right to victory in the New Hampshire primary election, promising to protect the right to life of "the innocent unborn", attacking gay marriage and calling for prayer in government schools. At the opposite end of the spectrum was Steve Forbes, a tolerant billionaire: he refused to support an abortion ban, avoided most social issues and was criticised for owning a photograph by Robert Mapplethorpe, a gay artist. Mr Dole himself acknowledged the seriousness of this split when he declared the primaries "a struggle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He won the nomination by steering a middle course, and Republicans hoped for a quick healing of party wounds. They did not get one. When Mr Dole proposed that the party's anti-abortion plank be tempered with a passage emphasising tolerance of dissenting views, the religious right rebelled. When Mr Dole then backed down, Governors William Weld of Massachusetts and Pete Wilson of California, who both oppose an abortion ban, mounted their own protest. On the eve of the convention, the religious right seem to have won this battle: they reckon the party will run on a strict anti-abortion policy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If so, the Republicans will find themselves in a trap that can cripple parties for years: a zealous minority has won control of policy, alienating the majority whose support is needed for electoral victory. The best that moderate Republicans can hope for is that abortion will not sway many votes. Those who care about abortion generally oppose it, and so will like the Republican platform; other voters pay little attention to the issue. The trouble with this defence is that, on other issues, the Republicans may not be much more united.
</p><p><b>Moral militants</b></b>
<br>The fight over abortion reflects a wider split in Republican ranks between libertarians and moralists. In this struggle, the moralists include not only the religious right, but a group of intellectuals who worry about the corrosive power of "liberal relativism"-- ie, Americans' reluctance to pass judgment on socially destructive forms of personal behaviour. Divorce, illegitimacy and other sorts of family collapse, they argue, have been allowed to spread unchecked; these have in turn brought about a rise in poverty and teenage delinquency. Gang leaders in the ghettos have no sense of right and wrong. Even middle-class children have been depraved by the diet of sex and violence served up by Hollywood.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In defiance of their party's libertarian, anti-government wing, the moralists conclude that too much freedom has proved dangerous. To restore discipline among children, they support the curfews imposed in several cities. To curb family disintegration, they argue that divorce should be made more difficult. They oppose gay marriage, a practice which they fear will undermine the traditional family still more. They favour strict censorship of pornography and regard the anarchy of cyberspace with despair. Even though many are not practising Christians themselves, they favour school prayer and government support for Christian social work, on the argument that religion instils moral values.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some moralists espouse a distinctive view of foreign policy as well. In a recent issue of <i>Foreign Affairs</i>*, two eminent Republicans attack the isolationists and tepid internationalists who dominate their party, and urge Republicans to throw their weight behind a crusading foreign policy. Mr Buchanan, they point out, wants American troops withdrawn from Europe; the congressional Republicans have cut the foreign-policy budget to its bare bones; Mr Dole and some of his advisers are uncomfortable with this but do not dare propose a return to the foreign policy of the cold war. The moralists are not so shy. The defence budget should be boosted by a quarter, they declare, and America should loudly proclaim its commitment to spreading democracy abroad. If democracy is a moral good, they say, there can be no justification for doing otherwise.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such policy prescriptions may be controversial but at least the boundaries of debate are relatively well defined. The much larger discord that the moralists have stirred up concerns the party's view of human behaviour. During the 1980s Ronald Reagan preached that liberty was both an economic and a moral good: in an atmosphere of free competition untrammelled by the state, people would be thrifty, disciplined and diligent. This 1980s Republicanism represented a backlash against the social policy of earlier years, which was based on the idea that human beings could be improved by enlightened government activism. But now the moralists are reviving a variant of that old view. Freedom does not breed virtue, they insist: this can be done only by social institutions such as the family and church, backed up by a sympathetic government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the party that attacked social policy a decade ago is now reinventing it. The party that celebrated the swash-buckling individualism of American myth now emphasises the need for stable communities. The party that worshipped Mr Reagan's cowboy style is now led by Mr Dole, who invokes the neighbourly values of rural Kansas. This confusion has frustrated Republican attempts to articulate a consistent view of the world, and so to rise above the squabbles on censorship, school prayer and abortion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many Republicans openly concede their divisions on social and moral issues. But they claim that opposition to economic statism unites them. The essence of Republicanism, they contend, is hostility to the expansion of the welfare state wrought by Democrats in the 1930s and the 1960s. So long as Republicans can remember this, their other divisions will not matter.
</p><p><b>Enemies of the state?</b>
<br>This claim is based on an edited version of history. Although it is true that Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, Democrats both, presided over the legislation of the New Deal and the Great Society, it is also true that Republican presidents have done their bit to expand the state. Between 1901 and 1909 Theodore Roosevelt created the Commerce Department and the National Park Service, quadrupled the federal government's land holdings, and brought the railways under federal regulation. In the 1950s Dwight Eisenhower backed federal aid for education, housing projects and interstate highways. Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and new safety rules for workers. Most recently, George Bush raised taxes, promoted a new public-education effort called Head Start, and presided over a massive increase in regulation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anti-statism, meanwhile, has often been just an undercurrent in the Republican Party. Robert Taft, an anti-statist, failed to secure his party's presidential nomination repeatedly from 1940 until 1952. Barry Goldwater, a Republican of similar beliefs, won the nomination in 1964 but lost the election so heavily that anti-statism was buried for a decade.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The only Republican to attack the state and do well was Ronald Reagan. In 1976 he campaigned for the nomination on a Goldwaterite platform and was rebuffed; but in 1980 and 1984 he was resoundingly victorious. Why this change? Because, between 1976 and 1980, Mr Reagan's anti-statism had been transformed. Instead of promising to scrap government spending programmes, Mr Reagan was promising to cut taxes. Anti-statism had become code for letting people keep more of what they earned: hence its popularity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In office, Mr Reagan was true to his word. Taxes were cut, but government spending grew--and Mr Reagan was a hero. On a state level, other Republicans have since repeated the same trick. In New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman spouts anti-statist rhetoric of which Mr Reagan might be proud; she has cut state income taxes by 30%--but has done little to cut spending.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seen in this light, Republican fortunes over the past year hardly come as a surprise. For a brief period, the party tried to rein in government: like Taft, Goldwater and the Reagan of 1976, it soon found that this destroyed its popularity. Learning from the experience, Mr Dole has shifted to anti-statism of the more electable sort. He lays out promised tax cuts in loving detail. There will be a 15% cut in income tax, a 50% cut in capital-gains tax, and a $500-per-child tax credit; overall, a family of four making $35,000 a year would see a 56% drop in its federal tax bill. At the same time, Mr Dole assures voters that he will not cut popular government programmes to pay for all this. More than half of the spending cuts that his plan entails are not spelled out at all; the rest are alluded to in vague, soothing terms. The biggest proposed cut, purportedly worth $90 billion over six years, will come from "non-defence administrative costs". Nice to hear that it's so easy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the anti-statism that supposedly binds Republicans together is not really anti-statism at all; it is anti-tax populism. This can work wonders, as Mr Reagan's record shows. It may revive Mr Dole's hopes too; together with the publicity gained from his announcement of a running mate and a good speech in San Diego next week, it might, just possibly, make him electable. But, as a mechanism to unite Republicans over the long term, anti-tax rhetoric will hardly do. America's budget deficit, though shrinking now because of steady economic growth, will expand again when the economy turns down. As baby boomers retire in vast numbers a decade or so hence, the deficit could balloon. America can ill afford tax cuts, so Republicans can hope for only short-term gains by pushing them.
</p><p><b>The Eisenhower principle</b>
<br>In sum, the Republicans' critics are mostly right: the party is fundamentally divided. The unpopularity of the Republican Congress reflects the political unsellability of its radical anti-statist creed. Mr Dole's lacklustre campaign reflects the dearth of binding Republican ideas, not just his limited skills as a campaigner.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet, in another sense, the critics go too far. The Republicans may well hold on to Congress despite their internal splits, just as the Democrats held on for decades despite equally profound divisions: the advantage of incumbency is formidable. Although Mr Dole's prospects look poor in this election, future Republican contenders may prove charismatic enough to overcome the party's lack of a common philosophy. After all, Eisenhower made the White House Republican for eight years without, it seemed, standing for any kind of Republicanism at all; until he announced his candidacy in 1952, nobody knew which party he belonged to. Equally, the Republicans could have been riding high this year had another anti-ideological ex-general, Colin Powell, sought the party's nomination.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, even if Mr Dole and his party bicker their way to defeat this year, a Republican era may still be at hand. Mr Clinton's strong showing in the polls reflects his adoption of various Republican ideas, from fiscal conservatism to a crack-down on crime, from welfare reform to rhetorical attacks on Hollywood. Though Republican moralists may push the point too far for most Americans, many think that their country's infatuation with freedom needs to be tempered by some mix of private and public authority. Although there is little support for a radical pruning of the state, even Mr Clinton accepts that the reach of government cannot be blatantly extended.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the height of the liberal era, Dwight Eisenhower managed to hold the White House for the Republicans because he was free of Republican ideas. Equally, Mr Clinton may govern in a Republican era because he has ditched (for the campaign season, at least) traditional Democratic opinions. In each case, the battle of ideas may matter more than the battle among men. Let that console the Republicans as they fight it out in San Diego.

<p><b>Dole in California</b></p>
<h1>Going west</h1>

<font size=-1>SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA</font>
<p>WELCOME to California, Bob Dole: up to a point. On August 11th Mr Dole comes to San Diego in formal triumph to receive the Republican Party's nomination for president. He will thus be stuck for the better part of a week in a state where he is a daunting 27 points behind Bill Clinton. Even some of the state's top Republicans are muttering that, were it not for the convention, Mr Dole would be wiser to spend his time somewhere else.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Back in May, Mr Dole announced that he would fight Bill Clinton tooth and nail for California. That was sensible. If Mr Dole can deprive Mr Clinton of California's 54 electoral-college votes, Mr Clinton is probably finished. So Ken Khachigian, Mr Dole's planner for California, promised Mr Clinton "80 days of hell" after the San Diego convention. So far, it is mostly Mr Dole who has been getting Californian hell.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In late March, he was 21 opinion-poll points behind Mr Clinton among registered voters, but everyone expected that gap to narrow in the summer. Republicans insisted that California has a notoriously volatile electorate. John Herrington, chairman of the state's Republican Party, said at the beginning of June that he would target the south of California, Los Angeles and the area east of it known as the "inland empire". "We go back and get our base," explained Mr Khachigian in the local language in June. "Then we incrementally start rebuilding. Then, once that's done, we start going for swing voters--this I anticipate post-convention."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No luck, yet. Since then, despite a series of trips by Mr Dole to California, the gap has widened to 27 points, according to a poll on July 18th by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. Mr Khachigian has not yet nailed down his base. A quarter of California's Republicans prefer Mr Clinton; of Republican women, fully a third do. From Shasta County in the remote north to the Republican heartland of Orange County, Mr Dole has tried to punch every usual Californian button: talking angrily about cuts in the defence industry, blasting illegal immigration, making a tepidly conciliatory speech about Hollywood, saying that Mr Clinton's environmentalism has hurt loggers in the north of the state. Nothing has helped. Mr Clinton had already hit all those buttons.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Democrats are gleeful. "Bob Dole's eight years older than Yeltsin, and unlike Yeltsin he can't do the twist," says Bob Mulholland, the campaign adviser of California's Democratic Party. Bill Carrick, Mr Clinton's planner for California, gloats about the effect of Mr Dole's five campaign visits: "I'm really disappointed Dole hasn't given us more time out here."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Dole people reply that they have not yet begun to fight. There is some plausibility to this. Mr Dole's campaign has been penniless so far this summer, and Mr Clinton continues to lavish attention on California; on August 7th he came to San Jose to kick off his 26th visit to the state as president. Mr Dole's coffers open up again after the convention, according to federal campaign spending rules. And the convention itself will give Mr Dole lots of free time on television. If the unruly Republicans can keep their convention conventional, the show in San Diego should bring Mr Dole a bounce in the polls.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It had better be huge. As the San Diego convention ends, the Dole people will be deciding whether it is worth buying lots of advertisements in California. With so many mid-western states in dispute, and with signs of weakness even in Republican strongholds in the South, Mr Dole can ill afford to throw his dollars at a massive gap in this state. "If the convention were in any of the other 49 states," says Dan Schnur, a former spokesman for Pete Wilson, California's Republican governor, "California could and should be a write-off." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But if Mr Dole bombs in California, he could drag the whole state-wide party down. Lots of California's Republicans are grateful to Mr Dole for not giving up on the state altogether, as George Bush did in 1992, but that gratitude is wearing thin. That same <i>Los Angeles Times </i>poll on July 18th showed the Republicans lagging in the race for Congress, with 40% to the Democrats' 51%. There are half a dozen vulnerable Republican members of Congress, including the fire-breathing Bob Dornan in Orange County, still weak after his failed run for the presidential nomination. In the state's legislature, the Democrats are expected to keep control of the Senate, and hope to wrest the Assembly from the Republicans.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Already, the Dole campaign's weakness is showing. Mr Wilson and Mr Dole are sniping at each other. Mr Wilson came back from the brink of oblivion in 1994 by linking his gubernatorial campaign to Proposition 187, a ballot initiative stripping illegal immigrants of social services; now he wants Mr Dole to try the same trick with Proposition 209, which would bar affirmative-action for minorities and women. Mr Dole is having none of that. Ward Connerly, a black Wilson man who is pushing Proposition 209, has been denied the chance to make a speech at the convention. For his part, Mr Wilson, who is pro-choice, is threatening a floor fight over abortion. If California continues to treat Mr Dole so well, he may come to wish he had had his convention in Massachusetts.

<h1>Deflating the bounce</h1>

IF AMERICANS hate politics, as has been claimed, they must loathe conventions. Television ratings suggest this is how things are going. The number of viewers watching these demonstrations of artificial exhilaration has gone down steadily in recent years. And the famous "bounce"--the rise in the opinion polls that candidates hope to get from the cheering at the convention--is no real pointer to election-day success (see <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1960, households watching the conventions of John Kennedy and Richard Nixon (nearly 84% of the total) tuned in for an average of 8.58 hours each; the more photogenic Mr Kennedy drew more viewers, and went on to win the election. By 1984, only 72% of the country was watching, for an average of only 3.05 hours; the less photogenic Walter Mondale drew more viewers than Ronald Reagan but--beware, Mr Dole--did not get elected. In 1992, only about 21% of households were tuning into convention coverage at any given moment, down from 28% in 1968.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What of the bounce? Does it help a candidate to victory? Not necessarily. Bill Clinton's 16-point bounce in 1992, the largest since such polls were begun, was followed by his election. But two of the three candidates who achieved the next biggest bounces of the past quarter-century--Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Walter Mondale in 1984--went on to lose the election. And, though Ronald Reagan's 1984 bounce was tiny, his presidential victory was vast.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the networks' planned coverage of the conventions is fairly skimpy, at least there will be no competition from a baseball all-star game, as there was in 1992. Given the presence of <font size=-1>CNN</font>, <font size=-1>MSNBC</font> and <font size=-1>C</font>-Span, which will offer convention coverage, much of it live, for 24 hours a day, interested Americans can watch all the speeches, balloons and placards they can stomach.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Republican faithful have still another option. Unhappy with the filter of plain independent journalism, Haley Barbour, the party's chairman, got private financing to air <font size=-1>GOP-TV</font> on the Family Channel, which is controlled by the televangelist founder of the Christian Coalition, Pat Robertson. If Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw cannot ensure a bounce, Mr Dole is hoping the political equivalent of infomercials will.

<h1>Arachnophilia</h1>

<font size=-1>BANGKOK</font>
<p>"WHEN spiders unite, they can tie down a lion." Thus the motto that adorns faxes from the Free Burma Coalition, a pressure group campaigning for the downfall of the military junta that rules Myanmar (which is still called Burma by the junta's opponents). The spidery metaphor is appropriate for a movement that, perhaps more effectively than any other overseas political campaign, has harnessed the potential of the World Wide Web and the Internet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For scattered political exiles and their sympathisers, the Internet has opened new vistas. More than just a cheap and immediate form of communication, it also offers a solidarity in cyberspace that may be hard to achieve geographically. It is especially useful in developing a student movement, now that so many universities provide access to the Internet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Activists have found several ways to use the computer network. Free Burma groups have established "home pages" on the Web (<a href="http://www.freeburma.org">http://www.freeburma.org</a> and <a href="http://danenet.wicip.org/fbc">http://danenet.wicip.org/fbc</a>) where those interested can find campaign material, a directory of the myriad organisations involved, copies of relevant American legislation, and a special section on the movement's heroine and Myanmar's opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But e-mail also offers a way of achieving rapid global mobilisation. Simon Billenness, an analyst with Franklin Research and Development, a "socially responsible" investment firm, has waged campaigns for outside companies to withdraw from Myanmar, and for United States sanctions against the country. He boasts that in the space of half an hour he can ask a couple of thousand activists around the world to write a letter or make a phone call.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of the activists will be very well informed. "BurmaNet", an electronic mail news service with about 700 subscribers, provides a daily digest of press coverage on Myanmar, as well as a forum for exchanging news, ideas, outrage and requests for help. On a typical day in early August, for example, BurmaNet sent out: a detailed report by a human rights group about the relocation of ethnic Karens near the Thai border; calls for action to mark the eighth anniversary of the 8-8-88 (August 8th 1988) uprising in Yangon, which led to thousands of deaths and the junta's seizure of power; lists of Free Burma songs that can be downloaded from the Web; and reports of the death in prison on August 2nd of a member of Miss Suu Kyi's party.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The campaign's main successes have been in persuading American companies to stop doing business in Myanmar, through a mixture of shareholder pressure and consumer boycotts. On August 5th London Fog, a clothing manufacturer, followed others, including Liz Claiborne, Eddie Bauer, Levi Strauss and Reebok, in halting production in Myanmar. In July, two European brewers, Carlsberg of Denmark and Heineken of Holland, also withdrew.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Doug Steele of BurmaNet attributes the comparative success of the Myanmar campaign to two factors: "Aung San Suu Kyi as a rallying figure, and the Internet as an organisational tool." The junta seems to be worried, despite the fact that nobody outside the government in Myanmar has access to the Internet. Yet the regime, too, has its own home pages on the Web. Its newspaper, <i>The New Light of</i> <i>Myanmar, </i>is no livelier on line. Exiles are nervous about the confidentiality of BurmaNet's subscription lists, although it is not clear what use a list of e-mail addresses would be to Myanmar's intelligence service.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But two immediate goals have eluded the activists: they have not persuaded the United States Congress or administration to introduce economic sanctions; and they have not brought about the withdrawal of the oil companies helping to develop and sell Myanmar's oil reserves. The longer-term aim, of course, is to see the junta lose power and a democratically elected government take office. That may take more than the co-operative use of the Internet.

<p><b>South Africa</b></p>
<h1>New York's finest</h1>

<font size=-1>JOHANNESBURG</font>
<p>WHEN William Bratton, former head of the New York Police Department, landed in Johannesburg this week, he was invited to a dinner party with the top official responsible for security. The daughter of the woman he sat next to had just had her car hijacked, at 8 o'clock on a weekday morning, as she drove with her two-year-old daughter (you keep the baby, said the hijackers, we'll keep the car--which, by South African standards, was better than she might have feared). "Everybody around that table seemed to be a victim of crime, or know one," he says. No wonder South Africans greeted Mr Bratton, under whom New York's murder rate fell by 40% in two years, with such enthusiasm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Crime has become an obsession in the new South Africa. Johannesburgers telephone local radio shows to advise others to aim between the eyes of an armed attacker and kill him first shot. Residents of leafy suburbs advise newcomers not to stop if their car gets an "accidental" shunt from the one behind--indeed even to ignore red traffic lights, if they want to be sure of avoiding a hijack. Houses are hidden behind high perimeter walls, topped with razor spikes, their alarms electronically linked to alert private armed guards.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This dread of crime is not unwarranted. The annual murder rate--about 50-55 per 100,000 people (there are statistical problems)--is one of the highest in the world, and, by any estimate, about five or six times that of the United States. South Africans own over 3m licensed guns, and many more illegally; at Johannesburg airport, passengers routinely turn up with guns, though the bullets must be taken out and the gun checked in. Nor does crime, or the fear of it, hit whites only. Rich blacks are no less afraid of housebreakers than rich whites and, of Johannesburg's 8,500 carjackings last year, around one in seven happened in Soweto. Rape is common there. In a survey of readers by <i>The Sowetan</i>, 80% claimed they had been victims of crime last year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In May, the government did launch a "national crime prevention strategy", followed by a police blitz. George Fivaz, the police commissioner, said he would hunt down South Africa's "most wanted criminals" within 30 days. Things did not look too hopeful: his list stretched to 10,000 names. But, lo, Mr Fivaz felt able in due time to declared that, after 30 days, his force had arrested no fewer than 7,099 of them. Which begs two questions. If it was that easy, why were they not caught earlier? Or could it just be that they weren't caught at all? Even the justice minister, Dullah Omar, cast doubt on the figures, remarking that there had been no noticeable increase in cases brought to court.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Enter Mr Bratton. He left his New York post in April, and now runs a security consultancy. He has had no firm offers from South Africa yet, and its police chiefs and politicians can be stubbornly proud about taking advice from outsiders. But South Africans, desperate for crime-fighting ideas, have hailed him.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In New York, Mr Bratton worked on two principles. In the office, he managed the police force like a business. He delegated responsibility to his "business units" (local police precincts), set them "profit" targets (reductions in crime), and changed a slow, bureaucratic culture into a snappy, entrepreneurial one in which policemen can take their own initiative.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the streets, he applied the doctrine of "zero tolerance". If policemen make arrests for petty offences, goes the logic, such as urinating on the street or drinking alcohol in public, it reinforces the idea that no crime is tolerated; and this, in turn, helps reduce more serious crime. Could it work in South Africa too? Yes, Mr Bratton claims: "Systems of policing are transferable and replicable."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of his ideas make common sense. South Africa's police force was structured to control and crush political enemies, not common criminals; over two-thirds of its time was spent undermining or hunting those who challenged apartheid. It is rare, for example, to see policemen simply patrolling the streets in Johannesburg. "I've never been to a city where policing is so invisible," comments Mr Bratton. To make it less so would help both to curb fear and to deter opportunists.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the prickliest obstacle for Mr Bratton, as he tip-toes across South Africa's political sensitivities, is the authoritarian tone of his tactics. Were South Africa's policemen to apply zero tolerance, they would be cracking down on small but precious liberties that blacks have only recently won. Pavement peddlers or the enterprising, if not always welcome, young men who wash windscreens in traffic jams might be swept away. And one idea--to introduce identity cards, to facilitate random street checks--has a very nasty smell in South Africa. To many blacks, it recalls the days when they had to carry pass books, and were banned from white areas at night, under the laws of apartheid.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<p><b>Policing the Internet</b></p>
<h1>Hard line on porn</h1>

<p>INTERNET providers have had a rough time dealing with zealous European authorities worried about the dissemination of pornography. In December, Bavarian prosecutors stormed into the German headquarters of CompuServe, an American on-line service, with a warrant to ban 200 allegedly pornographic newsgroups (public discussion forums). CompuServe complied, shutting off these areas to all its subscribers for several weeks. And in May, French police arrested two prominent Internet managers in France for allegedly distributing paedophilic images. The men were released a few days later, but only after, in true Gallic style, other providers had staged a cyberspace strike, switching off parts of their networks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How much more civilised, then, was the meeting on August 2nd between British Internet providers and members of Scotland Yard's Clubs and Vice Unit. Like the Bavarian cops, the police were worried about pornography carried on Internet newsgroups. A sizeable proportion of the perhaps 20,000 newsgroups on the Internet deal with sexual topics, ranging from support for victims of abuse to particular sexual fetishes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The guardians of the law explained that the alternatives were police action against the providers or self-regulation. Faced with this choice, the Internet Service Providers Association (<font size=-1>ISPA</font>), which represents most of Britain's providers, has agreed to take the latter course, and block 1,000 newsgroups which Scotland Yard has deemed to be carrying illegal pornography.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While there is much to be said for the softly-softly attitude of the police, the approach has a number of deficiencies. First, the vast majority of illicit material on newsgroups is not pornography but pirated commercial software. Second, hard-line pornographers might use innocent-sounding groups to distribute material. Third, Britain's obscenity legislation is incoherent. Until it makes sense, neither the police nor the providers will really know when the law is being broken.

<p><b>The Post Office</b></p>
<h1>Monopoly game</h1>
<p>

THE Post Office's exclusive right to deliver letters charged at less than &#163;1 was suspended on August 5th, a day before the latest in a string of 24-hour strikes by postal workers over pay and working practices. The suspension is a clear signal to the unions that the government is prepared to undermine the Post Office's profitability if they persist in their action. Already, in several cities, private companies are beginning to nibble away at the corners of the monopoly. This suspension will encourage them, and the nibbles may become bites.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until the suspension, the Post Office had the power to investigate and prosecute firms that broke its monopoly. In 1994 it won a High Court injunction to stop Deltec, a courier firm, from running a cut-price postal service in Edinburgh.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it has been slower to act against First Class Mail, which is charging 17p for next-day delivery in Portsmouth (the Post Office charges 26p) and says it is delivering "several thousand" letters a week. Ray Judic, the firm's general manager, says he got a warning letter from the Post Office when he started the service three years ago, but has heard nothing since.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dave Fowler, a director of <font size=-1>CCP</font>, which is offering cut-price postal services in Nottingham, says he was recently grilled for four hours by Post Office investigators. Since then, he has changed his pricing structure. He now charges each customer &#163;3.99 for the first letter, and then gives the next 20 deliveries free, which works out at the same 19p a letter he used to charge. Mr Fowler hopes this will get around the &#163;1 minimum charge imposed by law, though this seems unlikely. <font size=-1>CCP</font> handles 7,000 letters a day, mainly from businesses such as solicitors, estate agents and doctors, who send most of their mail to local addresses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Winning Post, of Chesterfield, delivers about 5,000 letters a day, charging 20p for first-class deliveries. Rather than claiming to have found a way around the monopoly, Paul Revill, the firm's manager, argues that all monopolies are illegal under European Union law. No doubt the Post Office and the other national postal monopolies across the <font size=-1>EU</font> would dispute this, but the matter has not been tested in the courts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cut-price postal services have also been set up in Mansfield and Derby, and, since the suspension of the Post Office monopoly, cheap deliveries have arrived in London: City Post, a courier firm, is offering its customers (mostly law firms, banks and other big businesses) same-day deliveries in the City and West End from as little as 25p.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Post Office argues that if it is to continue making daily deliveries to every address in Britain for the same price, then it must keep its monopoly. Competitors would undercut the Post Office for the most lucrative deliveries in towns and cities, leaving it the unprofitable business of delivering to remote rural areas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But its fledgling rivals cast doubt on its arguments. Mr Revill of Winning Post says the Post Office "wastes billions and is very inefficient" and reckons he could easily provide a cheaper service in rural areas, if allowed to. Whether or not he could, why should the vast majority of post users, who are based in towns and cities, pay a disguised tax in the form of higher postal charges, to subsidise daily deliveries to remote parts of the Outer Hebrides? It would probably be cheaper to give them all a fax machine.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government would like to privatise the Post Office, but in 1994 it was forced to drop its plans by backbenchers worried about cuts in services in rural areas. However, the same fears were expressed when telephone services were being privatised, and turned out to be groundless.

<h1>Wrong numbers</h1>

<p>ON AUGUST 5th, Oftel, the telecoms industry regulator, published a consultative paper which broke the news that many of Britain's biggest cities would need new telephone numbers before the end of the century. This latest upheaval--the fourth since 1990, when London was split in two, inner and outer--springs from the success of Britain's deregulated telephone industry. Demand is booming and competition is spreading. Some parts of the country have six operators touting for business. This, however, is no comfort to Britain's furious phone-users.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because of rising demand for lines, London, Cardiff, Belfast, Portsmouth and Southampton will run out of numbers within four years, as will some 30 more areas within 20 years. Oftel proposes scrapping these five cities' existing four- or five-digit telephone codes (that begin with 01), replacing them with a new set of three-digit codes (beginning with 02) and extending numbers to seven or eight digits. To make things easier for customers, old and new codes will run in parallel for several months before the old ones are phased out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British public is inclined to blame Oftel. Oftel is inclined to blame <font size=-1>BT</font>, the former state-owned monopoly. Oftel argues that it did not take control of telephone numbers from <font size=-1>BT</font> until 1994 and found itself holding a can of worms without enough time to sort them out before "ph<font size=-1>ONE</font>day" in April 1995, when a 1 was inserted after the 0 in most codes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oftel is now trying to stay ahead of the game. It has proposed some sensible uses for other phone codes, which will mean annoying mini-disruptions: 05 numbers for big companies, 07 for mobile phones, pagers and personal numbers, 08 for free and cheap calls and 09 for premium-rate services. These changes would make it easier for customers to tell how much a telephone call will cost before they make it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britons can comfort themselves that things are worse elsewhere. Telephone numbers in Germany and Austria have become an anarchic mess of between ten and 15 digits. Some numbers are now so long that some international calls to them fail. New Yorkers have had to put up with repeated telephone code splits: there will soon be 13 codes for the metropolitan area. The French telecoms authorities take no prisoners: on October 18th, when local dialling will be abolished entirely, new numbers will come in, and old numbers will be abolished, overnight.

<p><b>Traffic</b></p>

<h1>Accelerating</h1>



<p>AS LONDONERS fume in the capital's traffic jams, aggravated by this summer's tube strikes, they can ponder upon the fact that the future will probably be worse. A study to be published by the Automobile Association (<font size=-1>AA</font>) next month will reveal an unstoppable growth in traffic.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are now more than 25m cars in Britain, an increase of 20% over the past decade. In the last 40 years, travel by car has risen tenfold while travel by bus has fallen by half. Cars now account for 87% of all passenger miles compared to just over a quarter in 1950 (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). The government has done little to discourage this growth, other than to increase fuel taxes by a real 5% a year. Local authorities are shortly to be given powers to deal with the pollution that results, including closing roads and controlling the speed, volume and type of traffic.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to the author of the <font size=-1>AA</font>'s study, Stephen Glaister, an economist at the London School of Economics, some 47% of households now have more than one car, compared with 39% in 1988. Expenditure on motoring rises almost exactly in line with increases in income, so the numbers will depend on economic growth. The Department of Transport predicts that traffic will double over the next 30 years: ministers have been trying to massage this forecast downwards, without success.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The potential for growth in the nation's car fleet is huge. Britain's car ownership per head is in the middle rank of developed countries; much lower, for instance, than in the United States, Germany and Italy. This is likely to change. Only 37% of British women in their 60s have driving licences compared with 70% of those in their 40s. As these motoring daughters replace their non-driving mothers, car ownership and use is bound to increase.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain already has some of the most congested roads in Western Europe, with twice as many cars per road mile as France or Belgium. The average British driver now spends five days stuck in traffic jams every year. Motoring organisations claim this could treble within a decade.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are no obvious solutions in sight. The unpopularity of building new roads or charging for road space has terrified ministers into paralysis. Increased fuel prices have done little to ease congestion. Motorists are so attached to their cars that, according to a survey carried out by Lex, a big car dealership, even if the price of fuel were to double, fewer than a third of those who drive to work would stop doing so. Nor, apparently, will the prospect of ever-increasing congestion do much to help. Eight out of ten drivers who commute to work would still use their cars even if traffic delays doubled, according to the Lex survey.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Improving public transport would make much less difference than is often assumed. A 50% increase in rail use would reduce road traffic by 5%. A study of five British cities by the Transport Research Laboratory, an independent research agency, found that halving bus fares would reduce car use by less than 1%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So is there no hope of living peacefully with the car? There are some obvious ways forward if only the political will could be found. Most car journeys are short--more than half are under under five miles, a quarter under two miles. Many of these journeys could be done by bus, cycle or on foot if the right incentives were in place. A study on car dependence published by the Royal Automobile Club last year found that the use of a car was essential for only about a fifth of journeys. Persuading more drivers to leave their cars behind will require a shrewd mix of incentives such as free out-of-town parking and regulatory stick such as inner-city pedestrian-only zones. Charging for scarce road space might be even more effective. The idea terrifies politicians.

<p><b>On-line services</b></p>
<h1>Taking Europe off-line</h1>

<p>BEFORE it had really got going, Europe Online, a Luxembourg-based Internet provider, has gone bust. On August 2nd a Luxembourg court wound up the company, a month after Burda, its largest single shareholder, withdrew from the venture. The firm, which had a paltry 25,000 subscribers in France, Germany, Luxembourg and Britain, racked up bills of around LFr 1.4 billion ($45m) in less than six months of full service.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is the second such failure of a European Internet provider in four months: in April, the owners of Italy's Video On Line, an Internet service that operated in dozens of languages, from English to Chokwa, agreed to sell the loss-making venture to Telecom Italia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Does this mean that a pan-European consumer on-line service is always destined to fail? Not necessarily. CompuServe, an Ohio-based on-line service that has operated in Europe for ten years, boasts 800,000 European members. <font size=-1>AOL</font>, a joint venture between Bertelsmann, a German media firm, and America Online, the world's largest on-line service, has notched up 200,000 subscribers in less than a year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But these firms are in a different league from Europe Online. They have considerable experience, well-known brands and oodles of content--much of it tailored for each country. Europe Online at least avoided the mistake of treating Europe as one homogeneous market: each member country could gain access to its service (and content) in its own language. But it did little else right. Access was slow: in Britain, for example, the service used yesteryear's slow modems, when its rivals were already offering much faster Internet access.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Worst of all, Europe Online's owners did not really understand their own business model. Until November last year, the company planned to launch on <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s soon-to-be-defunct Interchange service, rather than on the Internet. A few weeks before its launch, Europe Online decided to switch to the Internet, with massive technical and, even more importantly, financial ramifications.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All its short life, Europe Online was plagued with boardroom squabbles. An offer from CompuServe to acquire the company was turned down in July; a rival plan that <font size=-1>ITT</font>, an American technology giant, should take a stake in the business and float it, also got nowhere. But the company, though clinically dead, is still on life support: as of August 8th, its subscribers could still get full access to the Internet, and the Luxembourg government is paying the firm's employees. (The Luxembourg State Savings Bank and the Luxembourg State Investment Bank both had stakes in the failed venture.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The game is not yet over. The company is still talking to Deutsche Telekom, Germany's main telephone company. But why should Deutsche Telekom, which already runs T-Online, a German on-line service with 1.2m members, be interested in a small, failed on-line service? The answer lies in politics.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Luxembourg government is proud of the country's role as the home of <font size=-1>SES</font>, which owns the Astra satellites from which much of Europe's pay-television is beamed; it is keen to be similarly central to Europe's on-line future. Deutsche Telekom has a sizeable stake in <font size=-1>SES</font>. And Christian Schwarz-Schilling, until a couple of weeks ago the chairman of Europe Online, was Germany's minister for post and telecommunications until December 1992 and is still a senior member of the governing Christian Democratic party.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With so much national pride at stake, Europe Online could yet return expensively from the grave. How its resurrection makes sense on any other grounds is hard to see.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a>

<h1>Sacred hearths</h1>

<p>AS ANY theologian will tell you, the best measure of a person's well-being is the sense of closeness that he feels to his divine creator. Unfortunately for economists, this is a tricky thing to measure. Instead, they may settle for a proxy: the value of one's personal property. As it turns out, these two measures may be more closely related than you might expect. For among a handful of academic economists, a debate has been raging over how proximity to a church affects the price of one's home.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The protagonists split into two camps. The first group argue that churches are a nuisance for nearby homeowners because they tend to introduce noise and bother into their immediate surroundings: clanging bells, lots of traffic, overly helpful neighbours and so forth. According to this school of thought, building a church in an area ought to have roughly the same effect as opening a landfill--giving new meaning, as one economist puts it, to the term "moral hazard".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other economists, however, believe that churches, like playgrounds or parks, bestow all sorts of positive externalities on those who live nearby, and should therefore help to raise local house prices. Who is right?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a while, the antis appeared to have the weight of evidence on their side. For example, one prominent study, published in the <i>Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics</i> in 1994, found that houses in Chula Vista, a small town in California, tended to sell at a bigger discount the closer they were to a church.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The devil, however, is in the details. In a new study in the same journal*, three economists from the University of Las Vegas examined house prices in Green Valley, Nevada. The good news: contrary to the previous study's conclusions, prices of houses tended to fall the farther away they were from a church.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How to reconcile these apparently contradictory results? The authors of the latest study offer a tempting explanation: that the value of a church depends on its location. In godly Chula Vista, which has 15 churches per square mile, normal folk cannot get far enough away. But in godforsaken Green Valley, which is close to Las Vegas, or "sin city", it would appear that every house needs a firm foundation.

<h1>Is there life on Mars?</h1>
<p><b>Maybe</b></p>

<p>IT MIGHT, as David Bowie once sang, be a God-awful small affair, or it might be the scientific discovery of the century. A group of American researchers, led by David McKay of the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, (a part of <font size=-1>NASA</font>, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has cut open a 2kg lump of rock and found evidence that it was once inhabited by alien life forms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rock is a meteorite, known as <font size=-1>ALH84001</font>, which was found in the Allan Hills in Antarctica some 12 years ago. The evidence comes in four parts. First, this particular meteorite started life as part of the Martian surface. Second, it contains organic compounds (by which chemists mean complex molecules based on carbon, not necessarily the products of biological activity), which seem also to have originated on Mars. Third, there are tiny crystals of iron oxide and iron sulphide that look as though they may be the products of biological activity. And fourth, there are small spheres of carbonate material that look suggestively biological in origin and may contain actual fossils.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This evidence will now be extensively probed. The first bit seems secure. Most chemical elements consist of several different sorts of atom, known as isotopes, that weigh slightly different amounts depending on the number of neutrons in their nuclei. In different parts of the solar system, any given element consists of slightly different mixtures of these isotopes. The oxygen in the Allan Hills meteorite has an isotopic composition characteristic of Mars.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rock, one of about a dozen reckoned to have travelled from Mars to earth, has clearly had an adventurous history. It was formed volcanically, some 4.5 billion years ago--close to the birth of the solar system. The bit of Martian surface that it inhabited was then smashed up every so often by asteroid strikes until about 3.6 billion years ago, creating a pattern of small fractures<b>. </b>At some point after that it seems to have been immersed in running water. It was then blasted away from the planet's surface by another asteroid impact about 15m years ago, which probably accounts for a second set of fractures. After that it orbited the sun until 13,000 years ago, when it ran into the earth, landing in Antarctica.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second piece of evidence relies on the presence of organic chemicals known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (<font size=-1>PAH</font>s). These are widespread on earth (they are found in coal and petroleum; naphthalene, the material used in mothballs, is an example). They are also found in other parts of the solar system, including certain meteorites. Not, it might be thought, strong evidence for Martian life. But the <font size=-1>PAH</font>s in the Allan Hills meteorite are unusual. They resemble neither common terrestrial ones, nor meteoritic ones. Instead, they look surprisingly like the sort into which bacteria dissolve when subjected to rock-forming processes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The particles of iron oxide and iron sulphide also look like the products of bacteria. The iron oxide is in the form of magnetite--a substance that is, as its name suggests, magnetic. Many earthly bacteria secrete particles of magnetite within themselves. These are known as magnetosomes, and are believed to help the bacteria containing them to navigate, by allowing such bacteria to orient themselves with the earth's magnetic field. Iron sulphide is also a common bacterial product, associated with those bacteria that do not need oxygen to respire.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most interesting evidence of all comes from the carbonate spheres. These, the researchers claim, must have been created before the meteorite arrived on earth because some of them are cracked by whatever last shocked the rock. Even if this did not happen when it left Mars, it could not possibly have happened after its impact in Antarctica.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That the particles of magnetite and iron sulphide are embedded within the spheres is therefore good evidence that these, too, were not formed on earth. But the spheres themselves are very suggestive. They seem to have grown by accretion, and the chemical details of the different layers, as well as the order in which they were laid down, are, the researchers say, what would be expected if they had been produced by living creatures rather than non-biological processes. And, perhaps most significantly of all, the researchers' eye of faith can see fossils of those creatures on the surface of the spheres. These "fossils" are a mere 100 millionths of a millimetre long; they are similar in size and shape to terrestrial nanobacteria, about the smallest known of all life-forms.
</p><p><b>It's the freakiest show</b></b>
<br>None of this amounts to proof, of course. But it is all very suggestive. Some words of caution are necessary, though.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, science has been here once before. In the 1960s many students of the origin of life became excited about a meteorite known as the Orgueil impact (it fell in France in 1864). Bartholomew Nagy, at the University of Arizona, in Tucson, found that it contained, besides abundant quantities of organic molecules, a variety of structures that he named "organised elements", but which were widely believed at the time to be microscopic fossils. They were not. One turned out to be a grain of ragweed pollen. Another was a particle of furnace ash. To be fair to Dr Nagy (who died a few months ago), he never himself claimed he had found traces of life. And most of his organised elements were, indeed, indigenous to the meteorite. But, since then, researchers have been extremely cautious in the claims they have made.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rightly so. The possibilities for terrestrial contamination of a meteorite are enormous. Antarctica is not Gascony, but industrial pollution is ubiquitous. Artificial organic chemicals can be detected even in the south pole's pristine climate. And the past few years have also shown that life is far more tenacious and tolerant than had been imagined. Bacteria have been found living in hot springs at the bottom of the ocean, in lakes under the Antarctic ice, even in the middle of rocks, apparently subsisting on the minerals they find there.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For those who favour the idea of life on Mars, this is all to the good. Although its history includes running water (and therefore an atmosphere thick enough to stop such water vaporising into space), by human standards Mars has never been exactly hospitable. The existence of earthly bacteria that could have thrived in Mars's past is, from this point of view, encouraging. But it also makes the possibility of contamination more plausible. Dr McKay's group's results were trailed at the Lunar and Planetary Science conference in Houston two years ago. No one was particularly impressed at the time, mainly because it was felt that the <font size=-1>PAH</font>s were probably the result of terrestrial contamination.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are still sceptics. Yet Dr McKay and his team feel they have now laid the idea that the <font size=-1>PAH</font>s are the result of contamination to rest. Apart from the low levels of <font size=-1>PAH</font> pollution in Antarctica, the concentration of the chemicals in the Allan Hills meteorite is higher in the middle than at the edges and not, therefore, likely to be the result of inward leakage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other evidence has come under scrutiny, as well. Ian Franchi, of the Open University in Britain, which has one of Europe's foremost meteorite research centres, points out that carbonate spheres tend to grow on rocks left lying around after they have been brought out of the Antarctic cold, though this would not explain why some of those spheres are cracked. Other researchers, such as Beda Hoffman at the Natural History Museum in Berne, Switzerland, fear that the evidence for nanobacteria may have been "over-interpreted". The origins of such tiny particles are hard enough to pin down in terrestrial rocks, let alone in meteorites. Almost all researchers, though, are united in a wish that Dr McKay and his team actually prove correct.
</p><p><b>The best selling show, too</b></b>
<br>Whether they do or not, their claim comes at an opportune moment. The past ten months have seen the emergence of a new discipline--the study of other solar systems. Though long predicted, the first of these (bar one freaky one around a pulsar) was not discovered until October last year. Now more than half a dozen are known or suspected. They are centred on nearby, otherwise unexceptional stars. Planets, it seems, are normal fare in the cosmos.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This puts a different complexion on the search for extra-terrestrial life. Though a few science-fiction writers, such as Fred Hoyle, have dreamed up creatures that live in interplanetary space, most anchor their imaginary charges firmly on the surfaces of planets. The more planets there are out there, the more "platforms" there are upon which life could evolve.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It will not, of course, be possible to visit these planets with the sort of spacecraft that current technology and budgets can build, but they may provide inspiration--something that space programmes the world over have been sorely lacking since the glory days of the 1960s and 70s. And visiting Mars, after all, is certainly possible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the red planet has harboured life in the past (and even if there is none there at present), fossils are likely to be widespread. It should not be necessary to send all that many robot landers to pick up rocks and bring them back to earth before the jackpot, if it exists, is hit. At present, the first <font size=-1>NASA</font> mission that will do this is not scheduled to take off until well after 2000. The agency plans to send the first of a series of non-returning missions there in November. But a report by America's National Research Council says that unless <font size=-1>NASA</font> gets more money to back up these plans, their scientific objectives could be "seriously undermined". <font size=-1>NASA</font> will be delighted that the new result prompted President Clinton to put America's "full prowess behind the search for further evidence of life on Mars." Looking at meteorites is one thing. But to be certain, the only answer is to go to Mars and bring back some rocks.

<h1><center>Reacting to terrorism</center></h1>

TRUTH, it is said, is one of war's casualties. In the case of terrorism, truth may more or less survive but to the list of tragically real victims must nevertheless be added some of the more abstract sort: consistency, on the part of politicians; and self-restraint, on their part and the part of commentators. Admittedly, each new outrage challenges the ability to respond with the right blend of credibility and determination. But, alas, there has been no shortage of practice--the pipe-bomb in Atlanta that killed two people on July 27th and the probable bombing of a <font size=-1>TWA</font> aircraft off New York on July 17th, killing 230 people, were but the latest in a long, bloody line. And in these cases, as so often in the past, consistency has been sacrificed to posturing, self-restraint to hyperbole.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second of these victims is the more understandable, if still regrettable. The whole point of the terrorist act is to provoke a reaction disproportionate to the act itself. The truest terror is the random sort, which carries the implication that anyone, anywhere, might find themselves the next target. America is a violent country, but most people think they can avoid the violence because they know roughly where, and in what circumstances, most violence takes place. Assassinations, too, pose a different threat: only a narrow category of people believe themselves to be vulnerable to them. Terrorist bombs, placed in parks, on aircraft or (as in Oklahoma last year) outside office buildings, spread their fear more widely. Whether they are placed by an individual or by a group, and whether or not the perpetrator discloses the motive for the bombing, the intention is the same: to cause panic.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which is why the greater the outcry, the greater the alarm, the more the terrorist will consider his risks to have been worth the reward. It is not possible, or desirable, to ignore a bomb. But to carry on as planned, treating the bombing as a marginal, criminal occurrence to be dealt with in the manner of other crimes, is the best way to limit that reward. That was the choice correctly made by the Olympic authorities. It was not the choice made by those who yelled that "something must be done", nor by the politicians, President Clinton among them, who reached in their drawers and dusted off their "tough on terrorism" files, proposing new legislation and demanding international action at a summit in Paris.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The implication of new legislation is perverse: if laws could control terrorism, why aren't they already there? This phenomenon is not new, even in America. Moreover, Mr Clinton's proposals could threaten civil liberties (see <a href="am1.html">page</a>), infringing the very freedoms (of speech, communication, movement) that terrorists thrive on attacking. And the implication of demands for international action, through trade sanctions, against "rogue nations" believed to sponsor terrorism (Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Libya) is more sinister: it reveals an instinct to find foreigners to blame, be they the rogue nations themselves, or the duplicitous Europeans or Asians who refuse to go along with sanctions.
<br>
<br>
<b>The trade-offs begin at home
</b><br>That is where the posturing comes in. America is not the only country guilty of self-serving inconsistency in its reaction to terrorism, but it is the latest, and perhaps clearest, example.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Terrorism can be countered even if, by its very nature, it can never be eliminated altogether. But there are awkward trade-offs to be made. If the terrorist is to be deprived of his opportunities to cause devastation then money needs to be spent on increased security measures at vulnerable locations. And not just money: the price of luggage screening, metal detectors and security interviews with air passengers, for example, is also measured in time, bad tempers and congestion. America's airports, and its Federal Aviation Authority, have in the past chosen not to ask their customers to pay that price. Perhaps rightly, for the price is high, relative to the risk. Yet instead of making that choice explicit, and defending it, they have sought to pass the price on, blaming foreign airports for terrorism and insisting on tighter security there. The result is absurd: although the risks are similar, a passenger flying on American Airlines from London faces tight security; one travelling on the same airline from New York is barely hindered.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This same habit, of seeking to sound tough but without paying the price for it, can be found in America's demand that "rogue nations" be punished through trade sanctions. Where there is hard evidence that a government is responsible, directly or indirectly, for terrorism, there could be grounds for retaliation, by military or other means. But where the evidence is vague or even non-existent, such a tactic is both counter-productive and dangerous. Counter-productive, because it fuels such countries' resentments and allows their leaders to forge unity out of adversity. Dangerous, because once sanctions are imposed they are hard to remove as pressure groups and protectionists come to find them convenient. Like laws that infringe civil liberties, they also damage something essential to a democratic society: the idea that justice requires hard evidence and due process of law.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At some point, evidence may be found, notably in the case of the <font size=-1>TWA</font> airliner. Then, and only then, punishments can be considered. For the time being, the response must be a mixture of caution and calculation: caution, so as not to over-react; calculation, about the gritty trade-offs that vigilance, security and detection entail.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?839026800,iss">Search</a>

<p><h2>Thunderous</h2></p>
<p><p>Responsibility for the Atlanta bomb, which killed two people and injured hundreds, increasingly seemed to lie at home. Painstaking recovery of the wreckage of <font size=-1>TWA</font> flight 800 revealed no hard evidence but a firmer belief that a bomb destroyed the aircraft. Bill Clinton and congressional leaders agreed that more must be done to prevent <b>terrorism</b>; and the Group of Seven countries plus Russia promised to draft by November a treaty to make terrorist bombing an international crime.
<p>Changing 60 years of political history, Mr Clinton at last signed the Republicans' bill that abolishes automatic
<b>welfare</b> entitlements for Americans. Welfare will now be a "second chance", not a "way of life".
<p>After 5.5 years as <b>Argentina's</b> globally respected economics minister, Domingo Cavallo was replaced, as pressure grew for less austerity and more growth. The job went to the--equally orthodox--central-bank president, Roque Fernandez. Policy would not change, he said, to financial markets' relief. But trade unions said a general strike already called for August 8th would go ahead.</p>
<p><h2>Fly-past</h2></p>
<p><p>Turkish <font size=-1>MP</font>s voted to let American warplanes continue to fly from bases in Turkey to protect Kurds in northern Iraq after Necmettin Erbakan, the new Islamist prime minister, reversed his earlier opposition to <b>Operation Provide Comfort</b>.
<p>A 69-day <b>hunger strike</b> by political prisoners in Turkey, in which 12 people died, ended after the government met some of the prisoners' demands.
<p>An American envoy, John Kornblum, went to <b>Bosnia</b> and won an agreement to strengthen the Muslim-Croat Federation. He also wanted to ensure that Radovan Karadzic has kept his pledge to step down as leader of Bosnia's Serbs. The European Union threatened to pull its mission out of the town of Mostar unless Croats there accept the results of municipal elections, won by Muslims.
<p><b>Pravda </b>("Truth"), founded by Lenin and as hardline as ever, was closed by its Greek owners. They accused the paper's journalists of drinking too much and of partisan reporting.
<p>Members of the European Union have failed to use 20 billion ecus ($25 billion) of <b>aid</b> available for poor regions, according to a commission report, with Italy the worst performer. Many governments are trying to meet targets for economic and monetary union and have difficulty matching <font size=-1>EU</font> contributions. Budget ministers, meanwhile, agreed to cut 2.5 billion ecus ($3.2 billion) from the <b>European Union's budget</b> next year.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Spain announced increases in <b>taxes on tobacco and alcohol</b> to cover an unexpected shortfall of 721 billion pesetas ($5.7 billion) in last year's public accounts.
<p>The European Commission proposed the slaughter of up to <b>2m calves</b> to support beef prices, which collapsed after mad-cow disease was linked to people. Part of the 2 billion ecu ($2.5 billion) cost would come from cutting subsidies to cereal farmers. A British study indicated that <font size=-1>BSE</font> could be passed from cows to their calves.</p>
<p><h2>African action</h2></p>
<p><p>East African leaders, meeting in Tanzania, agreed to impose full economic sanctions on <b>Burundi</b>. They called on Pierre Buyoya, Burundi's new military leader, to restore the constitution, parliament and political parties--but stopped short of demanding the reinstatement of President Ntibantunganya, ousted last week. Mr Buyoya, a Tutsi, made a bid to end the ethnic fighting by appointing a Hutu prime minister.
<p>In northern <b>Uganda</b>, armed members of the Lord's Resistance Army cult were reported to have killed 60 villagers and 40 soldiers.
<p>Fifteen commuters were killed in a<b> stampede at a railway station</b> near Johannesburg during a crackdown on people travelling without tickets.
<p>Lebanon's president put an end to speculation that a <b>Lebanese-Israeli peace</b> might precede a Syrian-Israeli one. An Israeli news report said a Syrian envoy had visited Jerusalem.
<p>The Palestinian Authority, having helped the Israelis find the<b> body of an Israeli soldier</b> murdered by Hamas seven years ago, appealed to Israel's prime minister to free Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the wheelchair-bound cleric imprisoned for life for ordering the killing. A Palestinian died after apparent torture in a West Bank prison.</p>
<p><h2>Testing</h2></p>
<p><p>China conducted a <b>nuclear test</b> and then said it would call an indefinite halt to all further tests. The announcement coincided with the re-opening in Geneva of talks aimed at completing a worldwide ban on future tests. Both India and China continue to express reservations about the proposed draft text.
<p>Troops killed at least three people in <b>Jakarta</b>, the Indonesian capital, after riots broke out. The cause of the disturbance was a government decision to evict supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri, an opposition leader, from the headquarters of the political party she had led until recently.
<p><b>Benazir Bhutto</b>, the prime minister of Pakistan, said she would appoint her husband to the cabinet, as part of a government reshuffle.
<p>China protested after Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister, made a visit to a shrine commemorating <b>Japan's war dead</b>.

<p><h2>Feeling buoyant</h2>
<p><p>
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>In America, second quarter <b>growth</b> was faster than expected: 4.2% at an annual rate. Annual wage inflation was 3.2% in the quarter. Consumer confidence rose in July to its highest level for six years. The latest monthly survey by the Conference Board, a business coalition, found that consumers were "clearly confident about current economic conditions and anticipate further economic growth in the months ahead".
<p>The central bank of Australia cut half a percentage point off the official <b>interest rate</b>, reducing it to 7%.
<p>The German state of Saxony refused to withdraw a subsidy to <b>Volkswagen</b>, even though the European Commission had ruled that the payment was illegal and is now threatening to go to the European Court unless the German car maker repays DM90.7m ($61.6m) immediately. Saxony says it is determined to save the thousands of jobs the state would lose if the car maker moved production elsewhere.
<p>In response to America's <b>Helms-Burton act</b>, which penalises foreign companies that do business with Cuba, the European Commission proposed legislation to make it illegal for European companies to comply with the act. Any similar bill would also be covered by the commission's proposed legislation.</p>
<p><h2>Cashing in</h2></p>
<p><p>Europe continues to struggle with its ailing state-owned banks. The European Commission's competition officials are investigating the rescue of <b>Banco di Napoli</b>, just as its shareholders approved a 2.28 trillion lire ($1.5 billion) bail-out by the Italian government. In France, meanwhile, the finance ministry denied reports that it would sell up to 25% of <b>Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais</b> by the end of the year.
<p>The recovery plan adopted recently by the <b>Lloyd's of London</b> insurance market faces a new legal challenge from a group of "names" who met their underwriting commitments, and who say the plan favours names who did not.
<p>Industrial Bank of Japan, the country's largest long-term credit bank, plans a &#165;225.7 billion ($2.1 billion) <b>rights issue </b>to bolster its capital-adequacy ratio. Britain's largest bank, National Westminster, made a &#163;450m ($700m) <b>share buy-back</b> despite being on the lookout for a life assurer and despite declaring a half-year net loss of &#163;111m. That came about from a writedown of &#163;690m on the sale of its American retail banking business and on restructuring charges.Russia has sealed hundreds of tonnes of Soviet rouble notes deep underground in decommissioned strategic <b>missile silos</b>. It reckoned it was cheaper than burning them.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><h2>Channel-hopping</h2></p>
<p><p>An epic battle to win control of Germany's digital pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> market was won by <b>Kirch Group</b> as <b>Bertelsmann </b>conceded on several humiliating points, including agreeing to use a common decoder developed by Kirch.
<p>First-half profits at <b>Glaxo Wellcome</b> rose strongly, boosted by a range of new drugs that more than counteracted a worse-than-expected slide in its flagship Zantac anti-ulcer drug. Pre-tax profits rose to &#163;1.55 billion ($2.37 billion) from &#163;1.16 billion a year earlier.
<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Britain's <b>Stagecoach</b>, a bus and train group whose growth has been built at the gallop, snapped up Porterbrook Leasing, owner of a third of Britain's passenger trains, for &#163;475.6m ($737m). Stagecoach plans to help pay for the takeover with proceeds from a &#163;111m rights issue and a &#163;550m bridging loan from the Union Bank of Switzerland. This is the second rail deal for Stagecoach since the government began privatising British Rail.
<p><b>Microsoft</b>, the world's biggest software firm, and <b>American Express</b>, its biggest travel agency, are teaming up to offer on-line travel services to business customers.</p>
<p><h2>Currents</h2></p>
<p><p><b>USAir </b>launched legal action in an American court against a proposed alliance between <b>British Airways </b>and <b>American Airlines</b>, just as the pact was endorsed by a British parliamentary committee, which believes that it would enhance the chances of an "open skies" deal between the two countries. British Airways holds a 24.6% stake in troubled <font size=-1>USA</font>ir, which alleges that an alliance between the two giant airlines would be anti-competitive and would breach the terms of a 1993 agreement between itself and British Airways.

<p><b>Fighting terrorism</b></p>
<h1>Do it with care</h1>

<font size=1>ATLANTA AND WASHINGTON, DC</font>
<p>LEGISLATE in haste, repent at leisure: it should be obvious that rushed legislation, like a rushed marriage, is liable to end in tears. But politicians can be just as foolish as young lovers. Bill Clinton is already living with the consequences, including an angry dispute with America's closest allies, of his recent decision to tighten the embargo against Cuba--against his own better judgment, but in response to many Americans' irritation about the exploitation by outsiders of nationalised property in Cuba, and their outrage over the behaviour of Cuba's government. Now, in a climate of fear and fury over both the bomb at the Atlanta Olympics and the crash of <font size=-1>TWA</font> flight 800, the president is in a hurry to pass a new law to combat terrorism.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In an election year, when the last thing Mr Clinton wants is to be accused of being soft on crime, this is good politics. But is it going to prove good sense?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same temptation to act fast followed the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City last year. Early professions of bipartisan resolve dissolved into disputes over the details as congressmen examined the proposals and a strange coalition of interests--from civil libertarians to gun owners--expressed their opposition. It took a year for the so-called Terrorism Prevention Act to pass, and when it did it excluded some of the main measures that the White House had originally proposed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now Mr Clinton sees an opportunity to resurrect those measures (or at least to remind voters of how tough he would like to be). He is asking Congress to provide money for a study of the effectiveness of adding chemical markers, or "taggants", to explosives, to make them easier to trace. He would like approval for various changes that would help law-enforcement agencies to keep tabs on suspected terrorists: readier access to hotel and airline records, and an easing of rules on "multi-point" wiretaps that allow the monitoring of telephone calls by a suspect wherever he roams, not just from a particular telephone line. Ideally, the White House would like Congress to do these things before its summer break begins on August 3rd.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this is happening before it is certain who or what caused the <font size=-1>TWA</font> and Atlanta deaths, and therefore what might have prevented them. Immediately after the pipe bomb exploded in the early hours of July 27th in the crowded Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta--killing one woman on the spot, indirectly causing the fatal heart attack of a Turkish cameraman, and injuring scores of others--suspicions fell on America's home-grown militia groups, which everybody has been peering at suspiciously ever since the Oklahoma City bombing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By July 30th, investigators were focusing on a burly security guard, Richard Jewell, who had spotted the suspicious backpack and been hailed as a hero for his life-saving efforts. But Mr Jewell, a former deputy sheriff in north-eastern Georgia and now an employee of a security firm hired by <font size=-1>AT&T</font> to patrol the company's pavilion in the Olympic Park, sturdily denies having planted the bomb.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even before the Atlanta Games opened, Olympic security officials were mindful of an incident at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, when a policeman "found" a bomb in a bus for Turkish athletes, only to admit later that he had put it there himself to attract publicity. On that occasion, fortunately, the bomb did not explode, but the episode was an example of what officials considered before the Olympics to be one of the main security threats in Atlanta: individual crackpots, not organised groups.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What caused the <font size=-1>TWA</font> explosion is not yet known, although the hypothesis that the aircraft and the 230 people on board were brought down by a bomb grows stronger as, bit by excruciating bit, bodies and debris are hauled out of the sea off Long Island. The pattern of the wreckage seems to fit the theory that a blast near the front of the aircraft blew away the cockpit and the first-class cabin. If so, it seems likely that the bomb was either in the cabin or in the cargo hold just below it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The extent of remaining uncertainty makes hurried counter-measures seem inappropriate. Each time an act of what is assumed to be terrorism is committed on American soil, Americans express shock that they are no longer immune from such horrors. But in truth they never were immune, and it is not obvious that terrorism against Americans, whether home-grown or foreign, is actually on the increase. Unmistakably increasing, however, are the often pernicious actions taken in the name of making a fight against terror.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The anti-terrorism bill enacted this year, for example, contained nothing that might have stopped the blast in Oklahoma City, but it did contain provisions--some introduced by Congress, but Mr Clinton signed it anyway--that could be held to restrict the rights of many ordinary people. Mr Clinton acquiesced in big constraints on the right of appeal against death sentences. He approved extra powers to deport suspect foreigners. He expanded the scope of the death penalty. These and other actions on his part, such as his support for Internet censorship and for the compulsory registration of sex offenders, have brought accusations that the president is trampling roughshod over some cherished American freedoms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even without any legislation, sensible things can be done to reduce the threat of terrorism. Security checks at American airports (which often appear cursory) can be made more precise. Greater care can be taken in the hiring of security guards (who are often badly paid and not notably efficient). Public vigilance can be encouraged. But, in passing new laws, there is a delicate balance between people's desire for security and their right to freedom. In choosing between the two, Mr Clinton, unsurprisingly, seems mindful above all of a third consideration: his desire for re-election.

<font size=1>ST LOUIS</font>
<p>A GENERATION ago the followers of any American oddball movement would have been content to mimeograph their manifestos and hand them out at gun shows or read them aloud over local radio stations. Now the same dark conspiracies and gleaming new certainties reach millions, instantly, through cyberspace. All points on the political spectrum, from far right to far left, have sites on the Internet. The "sovereignty movement", the phrase covering among other things a variety of tax protesters and private militias, is particularly active. It has many sites on the Internet, and files available for downloading with links to other "patriotic" sites.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The American Patriot Network (<a href="http://users.aol.com/dritus/apn.htm">http://users.aol.com/dritus/apn.htm</a>) offers the novel idea that the zip postal code is a conspiracy to subject the innocent to federal taxation; it adds that anyone who refuses to use the zip code on his mail is exempt from paying federal taxes. The Sovereign Citizen Resource Centre (<a href="http://www.caprica.com/~scrc/">http://www.caprica.com/~scrc/</a>), which argues that there is no such thing as a citizen of the United States of America, offers citizenship in the "Washitaw" nation plus freedom from all taxes and regulations. Entry into this electronic republic costs $65 for a new birth certificate and $150 for a passport, not to mention fees for car and driving licences.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More serious, perhaps, are the "common-law courts" springing up around the country. The movement's web site (<a href="http://www.nidlink.com/~bobhard/commnlaw.html">http://www.nidlink.com/~bobhard/commnlaw.html</a>) offers advice and encouragement to would-be claimants and judges itching to impose multi-million-dollar computer-world judgments and liens against public officials and tax collectors. One site offers the set of documents used by the Freemen rebels in "Justus Township", the compound in Montana whose long siege by the <font size=-1>FBI</font> ended in June.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The make-believe lawyers of the common-law courts tend to select a smattering of favourable quotations from real-world court cases, and build upon them fanciful illusions about what people can demand from the government. They are capable of resting their arguments on state rulings dating from before the 1861-65 civil war, or even on the constitution of the defeated Confederacy. Most Americans had thought those issues were settled more than 130 years ago. One group has sternly declared the secession of Texas from the United States, proclaiming the new republic on its site in both the English and Spanish languages.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In case words alone are not enough, some web sites offer "survival training", including instructions on how to offer armed resistance to officers of the law. It is a tribute to the generosity of America, as well as to the power of technology, that the Internet is open to the opinions of all these people. Whether they will in the end benefit from it is another matter. Once their ideas have been thoroughly exposed to the cybersunshine, they may find themselves retreating under the rocks from which they came.

<p><b>New York's fiscal future</b></p>
<h1>Here today...</h1>

NEW YORK
<p>LIKE many other American cities, New York spends much of each year struggling to close gaps that open up in its municipal budget. In January, for instance, the city predicted a shortfall of $800m in its $32 billion budget for the 1995-96 fiscal year. By year's end in June, however, the budget was balanced and New York even boasted a surplus of some $350m. How? In part, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani relied on round after round of cost-cutting. But he also leaned heavily on $1.1 billion of "one-shot" savings, mostly sales of city assets, and intends to make use of a further $1.5 billion-worth of new one-shots in 1996-97. Therein lies what may be a fiscal time-bomb.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One-shots cause several problems. First, because they cannot be repeated, such savings leave a similar-sized hole to be plugged in coming years: selling <font size=-1>WNYC-TV</font>, a city-owned television station, may provide $204m for the 1996-97 budget, but it cannot be sold again next year. Second, many one-shots merely defer costs. In both 1993-94 and 1994-95 New York refinanced bonds to cut its current debt-service costs. But as a result, notes Alan Hevesi, the city's comptroller, New York's cumulative debt-service costs in the five subsequent fiscal years will be $126m higher. One-shots can steal future revenues, too. To help balance its 1995-96 budget, New York sold $265m of municipal mortgages. This deprived it of $30m a year in future revenues. And the city still has to repay $193m of debt that financed the housing it no longer owns.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The long-term effects of one-shots and other short-sighted budgetary measures are dissected by Mr Hevesi in a new report, and in two critical studies by the state comptroller and the state's Financial Control Board. Mr Hevesi calculates that New York's heady budget mix of one-shots, bond refinancings and two-year pay freezes for city employees saved it a total of $1.5 billion during 1995-96, and will save it a further $591m during the current fiscal year and another $211m in 1997-98. The following year, in contrast, those same measures will raise the city's costs (partly as a result of cutting its revenues) by $516m. And in 1999-2000 New York will be $1.6 billion worse off as a result of today's short-term schemes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this shows up clearly in the city's own forecasts of probable future budget shortfalls. Early in each calendar year city authorities predict the likely budget gaps for the next four fiscal years. Mr Hevesi notes that, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the shortfall forecast for the fourth "out-year"--the year that is furthest from budget-makers' minds, in every sense--usually amounted to only a few percent of New York's total funds (ie, total operating revenues less state and federal aid). This reflected the city's then-cautious approach to one-shots and other measures that deferred costs. But in recent years the size of the gap projected for four years hence has soared (see <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>). Indeed, the forecast made early this year suggests that the shortfall in 1999-2000 could be as high as $5.2 billion--23% of the city's projected funds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the past, long-term forecasts of New York's budget deficits have often proved unreliable: the early-1992 prediction of a $2.9 billion budget gap for 1995-96, for instance, proved too pessimistic. And the city has, eventually, always been able to close its gaps. Today's forecasts, however, are likely to be more accurate, for a simple reason: New York's growing use of one-shots and cost-deferring measures means that tomorrow's revenue shortfalls are increasingly set in stone. With fewer options for closing bigger and more certain gaps, New York may face a millennium meltdown.

<h1>A cheer for Olympo-Americans</h1>

<p>AMID the golden exploits of stars such as Carl Lewis in the long jump and the sprinter Michael Johnson, you might not have noticed Konstantine Starikovitch. Few people did. His is one of the less glamorous Olympic sports, weightlifting. In the Atlanta Olympics, he finished well out of the medals, in 12th place. To do so, he heaved a bar weighing 177.5kg above his head in the "snatch", rock music blared out in the arena (as happened for a few seconds after all successful lifts), and the spectators gave an almighty roar (as they did for all American competitors).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is the point about Mr Starikovitch. He is from Russia, but he became an American citizen last April. To the crowds, he was just another American, to be cheered on at the top of their voices. It was the same with other naturalised Americans, such as Monica Seles, of tennis fame, originally from Yugoslavia. It was the same with all American Olympians, regardless of origin or race. The triumphant women's gymnastic team included an Asian-American, an African-American, and white girls with names like Miller and Moceanu. The enthusiastic fans were not interested in hyphens, but in Americanness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In its monopoly television coverage of the Olympics, <font size=-1>NBC</font> took this jingoism to absurd extremes. Were people from other nations taking part in these Games? At times it was hard to tell, as the cameras concentrated on the Americans. What was happening in events where Americans were winning no medals? It was impossible to say, for <font size=-1>NBC</font>'s coverage largely ignored them, preferring to show American successes and to devote much air time to sentimental "up-close-and-personal" life stories of American sportsmen and women.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hence one interpretation of the Games, heard among some grumbling foreigners, much as it was the last time America staged the summer Olympics, in Los Angeles in 1984. It is that they bring out the worst in America: arrogance, isolationism, a tendency to turn everything into soap opera. But a moment's reflection suggests a more charitable view.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>NBC</font> was rewarded for its coverage with audiences of as many as 95m people. That is a stunning proportion of the population. It represents one of those rare occasions--the trial of O.J. Simpson is the most recent other example--when much of this continent-sized country is focusing on the same thing, sharing a common experience. In that alone, the Olympics are serving a benign function: they bring a disparate nation together.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not often that Americans have a good excuse to belt out chants of "<font size=-1>USA</font>, <font size=-1>USA</font>, <font size=-1>USA</font>", as they have done in Atlanta these past two weeks. Along with the chants there are the patriotic clothes and the star-spangled banners, big ones for athletes to drape themselves in or smaller ones sold for fans to wave (or, in the case of Shell, given away with petrol to lure customers to the company's pumps). Soccer-obsessed Europeans and Latin Americans have ample opportunities, thanks to frequent international matches, to express patriotism-through-sport. But America is unusual in that it largely ignores foreign competition in its three most popular sports, American football, baseball and basketball. The pinnacle in these things is not some World Cup, but a purely American World Series or Super Bowl.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Olympics are the big exception. There is virtually no television audience for American athletes between these competitions, but for a few days once every four years the nation watches and cheers en masse. Basketball's "Dream Team" is a complete bore so far as sporting tension is concerned (it can run Olympic rings for boredom around most opposition), but Americans adore it because it represents perfection, a coming-together of the country's very best.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The jingoism would look particularly ridiculous if Americans were not beating the competition very often. But of course they are doing just that. They tower over the rest of the world in the Atlanta medals table.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The last time America was so dominant was in the Los Angeles Olympics, but that was thanks to the Soviet-led boycott. In Seoul in 1988, America came third behind the Soviet Union and East Germany. Four years ago in Barcelona it came behind the just disbanded Soviet Union, whose Olympians competed under the Orwellian name of the "Unified Team". Now, at last, the medals tally truly reflects post-cold-war geodynamics: America as the sole superpower, a few second-rank European powers behind it, China poised to emerge as a 21st-century force.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's friends, who think that America's geopolitical strength on the whole makes the world a safer place, should not mind about the jingoism in Atlanta. On the contrary, they should welcome it. For in a small but significant way, such a celebration of Americanness helps to keep the country strong. It is a powerful antidote to the forces of fragmentation that a lot of Americans spend a lot of time worrying about. The worriers fret about "multiculturalism" , about an America in danger of losing its common values and identity. They feel compelled to push legislation through Congress that would make English the official language. In a word, they see a danger of America succumbing to its own sort of Balkanisation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Events in the real Balkans show that it would be foolish to rely too much on displays of sporting loyalty as a reflection of political reality. Serbs, Croats and Muslims were once enthusiastic supporters of Yugoslavia's national soccer and basketball teams. That did not prevent Yugoslavia's murderous collapse.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But America, though it has had its own bloody civil war, is not threatened by such age-old schisms. From time to time it merely needs reminding of the things that hold it together, lest its divisions get out of perspective, and possibly out of hand. Part of the glue is a patriotism capable of transcending colour or creed. The strength of the patriotism that has been on display during the Olympic fortnight, embracing such new Americans as Konstantine Starikovitch, should give comfort to those who worry that America is in danger of coming unstuck.

<p><b>Argentina</b></p>
<h1>Dropping the pilot</h1>

<font size=1>BUENOS AIRES</font>
<p>IN THE end, it just happened. There was no stockmarket crisis, no run on the banks, no dramatic devaluation. Indeed, there was very little indication that the Argentine public even noticed. One day Domingo Cavallo was the minister in charge of the nation's economy; the next President Carlos Menem had said thank-you and goodbye and he wasn't.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rumours that Mr Cavallo, hero of the past five years' economic turnaround, was about to jump--or be pushed--have been around for many months. And with reason: the blunt-spoken economics minister has clashed with the president, other ministers and leading members of the ruling Justicialist (supposedly Peronist) party. Yet Mr Menem needed--and had repeatedly backed--his awkward subordinate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, the end had to come one day. Mr Menem is a politician, and his political background lies, however distantly, in Peronism: a tradition of populism, protectionism, open state purse-strings and state nannying, especially in creating industry and providing jobs. Mr Cavallo is an economist, and his practice was almost the opposite: economic and fiscal rigour, opening of markets, privatisation. This was the formula that defeated hyperinflation at the start of the 1990s, and then brought three years of spectacular growth (in output only, though, not employment). Argentines recognised his achievements. Yet, with memories of inflation fading, many were comfortable enough within the old tradition; not least those in the trade unions, historically linked to Juan Peron. And last year's sharp recession showed just how harsh the new reality could be.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economic indicators suggest that the recession has been and gone: money supply is rising, interest rates are back almost to where they were in late 1994, growth has resumed (see <a href="ir1.gif">chart</a>). But unemployment remains obstinately high, and voters were showing their discomfort. The demand for more growth was becoming a shout.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The end came on July 26th. After one argument too many, Mr Menem demanded Mr Cavallo's resignation. But there was no rancour. A relaxed Mr Cavallo said he had known for some time that the president had wanted a change, and had first discussed it with him several months ago. He admitted that feelings in Congress and the ruling party had lessened his effectiveness: "I was a spent force. Every time I said 'A', Congress said 'B'." Mr Menem, in turn, was swift to honour Mr Cavallo as "the best economy minister that Argentina has had in almost its entire history."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Financial markets blipped, but soon recovered, after Mr Menem named the central bank's president, Roque Fernandez, to take the reins. He is a respected economic technocrat, trained in economics at the University of Chicago, who won praise for his management of Argentina's banking troubles last year during the shocks set off by the Mexican crisis. He has promised to be tough: no devaluation, no meddling with market forces, no retreat from Mr Cavallo's latest unpopular measure--cuts in family benefits--and some tax-breaks for employees. Though Mr Menem unhelpfully admitted that Mr Fernandez was not his first choice, business leaders, bankers and the media were quick to endorse it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The head of the International Monetary Fund (<font size=-1>IMF</font>), Michel Camdessus, chimed in, saying he believed economic policy would continue, "not just because I trust in the men who manage it, but because the process is irreversible." He could have added a third reason: an early task for Mr Fernandez will be to win <font size=-1>IMF</font> approval for a wider fiscal deficit than the $2.5 billion--a bit under 1% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>--that was agreed earlier this year. An <font size=-1>IMF</font> delegation is due in Buenos Aires next week.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is one snag: a fair part of Argentina. Some Peronist legislators have shown readiness to offer Mr Fernandez help that they would not give to Mr Cavallo, but not all. The trade unions, already planning a general strike for August 8th, in answer to Mr Cavallo's attack on social spending, said it would go ahead. The 70% support for the change of minister found by one opinion poll was not just an expression of preference for one man over the other."If this is just a formal change, it is not enough," said Carlos Alvarez, a leader of the centre-left Frepaso coalition. "We must change the dog, not its collar."

<h1>Privacy and paedophilia</h1>

<font size=1>STOCKHOLM</font>
<p>QUEEN SILVIA of Sweden does not court controversy. The German-born former Olympic Games hostess usually maintains a royal circumspection and lets her folksier husband, King Carl Gustaf, do the talking. But, in a rare television interview on July 23rd, she sparked a public row by lambasting Sweden's liberal child pornography laws. Parliament had failed for years to outlaw possession of child pornography, she complained, and she suggested it might work faster if the 349 deputies saw its horrors with their own eyes. For good measure, she proposed that newspapers publish the names of convicted paedophiles rather than, as now, protecting their identities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most Swedes agree with her. Close to 1m, more than a tenth of the population, have signed petitions calling for a ban on the possession of child pornography. Publishing and distributing the stuff has been illegal since 1980, but, according to the Save the Children Fund, a charity, Sweden is the only country in Europe, bar Albania, where owning it is not. That makes it a haven for paedophiles, police claim.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Queen Silvia's sortie has attracted more outrage than assent; and it has shifted attention from pornography to the political influence of the monarchy. <i>Ex</i><i>press</i><i>en</i>, the biggest-selling daily, set up a telephone line for readers to render judgment on whether she should have spoken out. This seems odd. Sweden's monarchy has almost no power; the king's rare pronouncements--against Norwegian seal hunts and wage rises, for example--have been met with shrugs. In 1993 Queen Silvia called for censorship of childrens' videos, also a more controversial stand, without causing a stir.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So why the fuss this time? Personal liberty is almost as sacred to Swedes as are their coddled children. The constitution guarantees broad rights to freedom of expression, including the publication and possession of adult pornography. Debauchery behind closed doors, Swedes tend to believe, is a victimless peccadillo. Banning child smut without infringing other liberties is a balance Sweden is finding hard to strike.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hence its hesitant approach to reform. A parliamentary commission set up two years ago has become mired in dispute and controversy. One member did the cause no good by suggesting that possession of child pornography was no great crime since most new material involved foreign children. Another predicted the result would be an unenforceable fudge, banning only "unpublished" material. Even after law-makers agree to criminalise possession, two sessions of parliament need to ratify the measure, which means it cannot become law before 1998. Sweden's ambivalence is about to become embarrassing: this month it plays host to a world congress on the sexual exploitation of children.

<p><b>London Underground</b></p>
<h1>Down the tube</h1>

<p>LONDON commuters have been fuming in traffic jams caused by a series of day-long strikes by London Underground drivers. They would be fuming all the more if they knew what Fleet Street's finest have failed to tell them: that the drivers' case is as defective as a broken-down train.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (<font size=-1>ASLEF</font>), the drivers' main union, blames London Underground. It claims that its management has welshed on a deal it made last year to shorten the drivers' working week from 38.5 to 37.5 hours. <font size=-1>ASLEF</font> has turned down binding arbitration on the grounds that you cannot split the difference between implementing and not implementing a pledge.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They would have a point if there were such a pledge, but there is not. True, last year's agreement said that "a 37.5 hour week shall be introduced during 1996". However, it also said that "this improvement shall be contingent upon appropriate measures being designed and agreed to enhance business performance." No such deal has been struck.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the real criticism of London Underground is not that it has been too tough, but that it has been too accommodating. The drivers have in fact been offered the shorter hours without the productivity agreement, but only if they accept a pay increase of 2.4% rather than the 3.2% offered to other Underground workers, to help meet the cost. They refused. Talks to resolve the dispute were taking place at the official Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service this week, with a deal for even shorter hours a possibility.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet these are not oppressed workers. They get a basic &#163;24,647 per year for their 38.5-hour weeks compared with under &#163;18,000 earned by the average male manual worker in London. Their biggest grievance, other than having to do a job which combines tedium with stress, seems to be the performance bonuses paid last year to London Underground directors, which ranged up to &#163;24,079 for Denis Tunnicliffe, the managing director. As London Underground has been cutting its costs per train kilometre, he (arguably) earned it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>ASLEF</font> is not the only public-sector union now exercising its quasi-monopoly muscle. On July 30th the national executive committee of the Communication Workers Union turned down a deal made by its officials with the Post Office over the introduction of teamworking to make the service more efficient. Here, too, a series of one-day strikes have disrupted the business just as it is facing increased competition from private operators, foreign postal services, and from the fax and e-mail.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some ministers think the strikes buttress their arguments that both industries should be privatised. Unfortunately a third threatened strike suggests that privatisation is not a total solution.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Train conductors voted on July 30th to strike against privatised rail companies that refused to guarantee them their usual 30-minute "physical-needs" break between journeys, even when their first train arrives late. They had sought for more than 20 years to get the old British Rail to agree this, without success. However, some new train companies, for example Regional Railways North East, have now conceded the point. The unions are using their success with these companies to pressurise the rest--and are hoping that a strike vote will force other employers into line.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These disputes are manna from heaven for the Tories. Mr Major has Ian Lang, his favoured son and trade secretary, working on proposals to clobber such strikers, for inclusion in the Tory election manifesto. One-day walk-outs that impose pain on the public without hitting strikers' pockets may be a target. Unions might even be liable to be sued for damages by employers whose businesses they hit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sensing the danger, Tony Blair, Labour's leader, has called for binding arbitration on the tube strike. But union solidarity dies hard, even in New Labour. Some shadow cabinet members, including John Prescott, his deputy, and Clare Short, his erstwhile transport spokesman, have gone noticeably quiet.

<p><b>Politics</b></p>
<h1>Pain in the NEC</h1>

<p>CLARE SHORT may have been "hurt" by her demotion to overseas-development spokesman by Tony Blair. Ken Livingstone may moan that the parliamentary Labour party is like "the old Soviet Union". Lynne Jones may complain of Mr Blair's "Thatcherite agenda". But despite the grumbles of left-wing <font size=-1>MP</font>s, Mr Blair got away with his ruthless follow-up to his supporters' victory in July 24th's shadow cabinet elections--though his public approval rating fell to its lowest ever in a <font size=-1>MORI</font> poll.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has rewarded some of his strongest supporters. One is Alistair Darling, a young Scottish lawyer who did not stand in the election but has nevertheless joined Mr Blair's team in the pivotal post of shadow chief secretary, charged with stopping his colleagues making spending pledges. Yet Mr Blair has also had the sense to balance such promotions with an olive branch to the left. He promoted Peter Hain and Ian McCartney, two leftish but loyal Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s. This widened his base in the Parliamentary Labour Party without weakening his authority.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On July 31st Mr Blair began a trickier but even more important job: sorting out relations between a Labour government and the party's National Executive Committee (<font size=-1>NEC</font>), which includes representatives of the trade unions and of Labour constituencies. Typically, the <font size=-1>NEC</font> has moved to the left when a Labour government has been in power, acting as a focus for internal opposition. James Callaghan, prime minister from 1976-79, even complained in his memoirs that "some of the Members of Parliament on the <font size=-1>NEC</font> appeared to want to set themselves up as an alternative government."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Blair does not want to risk repeating that experience. As he currently commands a comfortable majority on the <font size=-1>NEC</font>, he has decided that now is the time to fix it. Tom Sawyer, the party's general secretary, has been at work on the nuts and bolts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One suggestion in Mr Sawyer's report to the <font size=-1>NEC</font> is that it should focus on organisational work, including communications with the membership, not on policy. Another is that its own membership be revised so that it includes more Labour councillors and fewer <font size=-1>MP</font>s. A third is that the party's annual conference should consider policy statements prepared in consultation with ministers, rather than often hostile individual resolutions from constituency parties.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Blair has already said that he is "not going to have a situation where the chancellor of the exchequer has to start going to committees to justify himself when he's got the country's interests to resolve." Some Blairites talk of banning ministers from sitting on the <font size=-1>NEC</font> altogether.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the eyes of some experienced party hands, that would go too far. Lord Callaghan refers to the "advantage" of "cross-fertilisation" between people who were both members of his government and the <font size=-1>NEC</font> and of the need for ministers and <font size=-1>NEC</font> to "run in tandem". Mr Blair's ministers would spend long enough in their Whitehall offices, surrounded by obsequious civil servants and seductive red boxes. A little time in the presence of supportive but critical party colleagues would do them and a Labour government no harm.

<h1>Hawks and doves</h1>

<p>IT WAS a very Liverpudlian verdict. On July 30th, a crown court jury in Britain's most anarchic city acquitted four women of charges relating to &#163;1.5m-worth of damage to a Hawk trainer jet that was owned by British Aerospace and due to be exported to Indonesia. The women did not deny the damage: they argued that they "had lawful excuse to disarm Hawk <font size=-1>ZH</font>955 because they were using reasonable force to prevent a crime"--the oppression of the citizens of East Timor. The defence of justification exists, but it is normally used only in cases of assault to prevent burglary.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet this acquittal is also part of a long British tradition. Juries have often returned perverse verdicts when they perceive that justice and the law are on opposite sides. This was most in evidence in the 18th century, when juries often acquitted people charged under the Black Act, a law that made it an offence punishable by death not just to poach but also to appear in any form of disguise on land where poaching might take place. Such verdicts required some courage: thwarting landowners in those days was more dangerous than is offending British Aerospace today.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More recently, a jury acquitted Clive Ponting, a civil servant, on charges of breaching the Official Secrets Act by leaking information on the sinking of the General Belgrano, an Argentine warship, during the Falklands War. Mr Ponting argued that his duty to the truth was greater than his duty to the government. The judge's summing-up pointed strongly to a conviction; the jury ignored it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;British Aerospace said, understandably, that it was surprised by the verdict, since it had licences to export the aircraft to Indonesia and no reason to doubt Indonesia's assurances that the aircraft would not be used in East Timor. The company may be wondering whether this verdict creates a general licence to nip into their factories and smash up their jets. Presumably not--so long as the vandals are not Christian women in sandals who leave a political video in the cockpit and ring a news agency to say they did it.

<p><b>Olympics</b></p>
<h1>Beaten by Kazakhstan</h1>

<p>WITH the British Olympics team threatening to turn in its worst performance since Helsinki in 1952, when it won only one gold and 11 medals in all, Britain's politicians indulged in some equally feeble competition of their own: allocating blame for the debacle in Atlanta. On July 30th, John Major invited Dick Palmer, secretary of the British Olympic Association, to meet him after the Games to explain the poor performance. No sooner was the prime minister out of the blocks than Tony Blair, the Labour leader, sprinted past, ordering an urgent inquiry of his own and hinting that this was one more effect of 17 wasted Tory years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Olympics have returned British sport, uplifted briefly by England's strongish showing in the European soccer championship, to its usual doldrums. By August 1st Britain, which finished in the top 15 in every Games since 1952, languished in 31st place in the medals table, below such giants as Belarus, Ethiopia and Kazakhstan. Worse, France had overtaken Britain to take third place in the all-time total of gold medals. Desperate for heroes, the British media adopted Michelle Smith, an Irish swimmer who won three golds, as an honorary Brit. A 400m silver medal for Roger Black was headlined "good as gold".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite Labour's determination to allocate blame, bad luck has a lot to do with Britain's failure. British success has always relied on the heroic feats of a few--it last won more than five golds in 1956, the Games that followed the 1952 disaster--as well as chance, such as America's boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games and the Soviet block's boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles Games. This time, there were few absentees and Britain's stars came a cropper. Neither of its track gold medallists contested their final: Sally Gunnell was injured, Linford Christie disqualified. Several Britons started favourites, but performed poorly, some through injury, others inexplicably.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tony Blair says that he will make Olympic success a "national priority" (along, presumably, with all his other national priorities). In doing so, he will be following in the tradition of such revered leaders as Adolf Hitler and Nicolae Ceausescu.

<p><b>Channel 5</b></p>
<h1>Tune in, turn on</h1>

<p>IF A total stranger knocked on your door and asked to retune your video-cassette recorder (<font size=-1>VCR</font>), would you let him (or her) in? No wonder the most difficult part of launching Britain's fifth analogue-television channel is organising the vast retuning exercise. The winners of the Channel 5 franchise, a consortium backed by Pearson (part-owners of <i>The Economist</i>) and United News &amp; Media, originally expected that the job would cost &#163;55m. Some well-placed observers think the cost could be almost double the original estimate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What has gone wrong? The need for the retuning exercise, which starts this week, arises because the frequency on which the channel will be broadcast in some parts of the country is close to the one that many <font size=-1>VCR</font>s use when they play videos (see <a href="br1.gif">map</a>). To check for interference, almost 10m homes will have to be visited.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the four rival bids for the franchise were drawn up last year, the retuning plans of Channel 5 Broadcasting, the eventual winner, were criticised by some of its rivals as "fragile" and "ambitious". Its estimate of costs was less than half that of New Century Television, a consortium backed by <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, Britain's satellite broadcaster, which calculated a figure of &#163;120m.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The differences appeared to result mainly from variations in assumptions about the number of homes a retuner could visit in a day, about the level of supervision retuners would need, and about the complexity of the problems that retuners would find in the homes they visited. At the time, the Channel 5 team insisted, to the apparent satisfaction of the Independent Television Commission which awarded them the franchise, that they were no more optimistic than the <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> consortium, and that the two numbers were not at all comparable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Channel 5 now seems to have abandoned some aspects of its original plans in ways that will increase the cost. According to Chris Goodall, a consultant who drew up the original Channel 5 retuning plans, the company took too long to turn its attention to retuning. Its current plans involve making appointments with home-owners who are not at home when the retuner first calls: given the notorious reluctance of people to stay in for a workman, that may be slower than the original plan simply to knock repeatedly on doors. They are also, says Ian Ritchie, chief executive of Channel 5, wondering whether to use the occasion as a marketing opportunity: understandable, but more time-consuming than merely twiddling a screw-driver.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The key change, though, may be the decision that big video-rental chains should retune their own machines. Originally, the idea was that one retuner should take full responsibility for an area of 2,000 homes, a scheme intended to ensure that every home was covered, to improve security and thus reduce the need for supervision.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Already, the share prices of the two main backers of the new company have fallen with a wallop. Worse may be in store if, in spite of the stringent security precautions Channel 5 is taking, retuning proves to be a "burglars' charter". Who coined that vivid phrase? Greg Dyke, now boss of Pearson Television, when he led an unsuccessful bid for the Channel 5 franchise in 1991.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Channel 5 may yet have the last laugh. As Mr Dyke also likes to point out, nobody has ever lost money on a television franchise (although some have come close). The franchise will run for ten years, and perhaps a further decade beyond that, through an era when digital television will be heavily promoted, and when <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> will become an aggressive contender for advertising, as well as for eyeballs. Yet it offers something unique: nearly nationwide coverage by a conventional commercial broadcaster. Neither the fragmented Channel 3 companies, nor Channel 4 with its obligation to cater for minority tastes, have that mix. If Channel 5 can predict audience tastes more accurately than retuning costs, it will prove Mr Dyke's point.

<h1>Oh what a lovely millennium bug</h1>
<p><b>Many computers think all years start with "19". This will cause havoc in 2000. The cure will be expensive, but will not cost as much as the "millennium bug" industry claims</b></p>

<p>AS THE previous millennium approached in Europe, hucksters persuaded gullible peasants to give up their homes and farms in anticipation of the coming apocalypse. A millennium on, the apocalypse business has become more lucrative still. A whole industry is flourishing on fears of a computerised catastrophe, caused by a nasty bug that makes many computers choke on any year that does not begin with "19".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Computer-systems managers have known about the problem for decades--indeed, some of them created it in the 1960s and 1970s when they decided to use only two digits to store years in database records, to save storage space. Most had assumed that their computer programs would have been superseded by now.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If you have a credit card with an expiry date of 2000 or later, you will know they were wrong. Many sales terminals will accept neither four-digit dates nor "00". Older accounting programs, payroll, banking, telephone, inventory and pension systems--indeed, almost any mainframe computer programs written more than a decade ago, when storage capacity was scarce--are all likely to read 2000 as 1900 or, more commonly, simply to gag on the date, potentially stopping businesses in their tracks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year, companies got a hint of what it might cost to put this right when the Gartner Group, a Connecticut-based computer consultancy, calculated that removing "millennium bugs" from the world's computers and software would cost anything up to $600 billion over the next four years, more than $10m per average medium-sized firm. Worse, the longer companies delay, the more the solution will cost. J.P. Morgan, an investment bank, reckons that the cost of rewriting a line of code will rise from $1 today to nearly $7 by 2000, as panicky companies fight over an insufficient number of competent mainframe programmers. For many organisations, such a bill would gobble up more than half their computing budgets for the rest of the century.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Faced with such numbers, companies alternate between shock and denial. The issue has already become a political football. In Britain the Labour Party is demanding that the Conservative government deal with the problem now instead of leaving a multi-billion pound problem for its successor. The state of Nebraska is footing the bill for fixing its own software from a two-cent tax on cigarettes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Waiting cheerfully in the wings is a phalanx of mainframe companies, computer consultants and services firms, and laid-off mainframe programmers, whose skill at reading old software code has gone from liability to asset overnight as companies grasp the problem. They are part of a burgeoning "Year 2000 industry". J.P. Morgan has assembled an index of the share prices of 20 firms in the millennium-bug business, ranging from software firms to consultants and contract programmers. Since the start of 1996, the index has risen 50%, twice as much as the rest of the software industry (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). The share prices of some of the purest Year 2000 plays, such as Viasoft, Computer Horizons and Data Dimensions, have risen as much as 20-fold over the past year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They are benefiting greatly from hype. After an <font size=-1>NBC</font> news report in April, which quoted the Gartner Group projections, J.P. Morgan's index rose by 20%. Other attention-provoking events--congressional meetings, articles in the financial press--have moved it too. Although computer buffs may have known about the problem for years, many companies are only just waking up to it. More than half of all European companies have not made plans to deal with the Year 2000 problem, according to a survey by <font size=-1>EDS</font>, a computer-services firm. Many have not even taken an inventory of the software programs they use, to know which might be affected. Yet the strange thing is that the massive costs that investors are anticipating may be wildly overstated.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Gartner cost estimates, taken at face value, defy common sense. The projected size of the world's entire systems-integration business between now and 2000 is perhaps no more than $300 billion. Gartner's upper cost figure, of $600 billion, is about half the world's total computer spending--hardware, software and services--over the same period. If each of the world's 5m programmers cost an average of $30,000 apiece in salaries and overheads, this figure would employ every one of them full-time from now until midnight on December 31st 1999.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, much of the Year 2000 spending will not represent new money. Most companies already devote a big chunk of their computing budgets to software "maintenance" and support, including removing bugs. The rest goes on upgrades, new projects and the replacement of old systems. Over the next four years, these investments may have to wait while the money is spent on millennium debugging. But overall spending may not go up much.
</p><p><b>Party like it's 1999</b>
<br>Indeed, much of the alleged cost will not consist of spending at all. It is opportunity cost: money that would have been saved or earned by the new projects that will be deferred or cancelled to make way for Year 2000 repairs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even the direct costs are unlikely to be as large as predicted. The Gartner Group reached its estimate partly by assuming that it will cost, on average, $1.10 per line of code to fix most common mainframe computer programs. It reckons that the world's companies have about 225 billion lines of such code between them. Assuming that virtually all of these programs will need attention accounts for more than $200 billion of costs (Gartner's $600 billion estimate includes, among other things, the cost of fixing the data files the programs use and other sorts of programs and computers).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem with this estimate is that it assumes that all existing programs will be repaired. In fact, many will simply be scrapped: either replaced by off-the-shelf software, or not replaced at all. Some companies will take the opportunity to upgrade their systems from mainframes and minicomputers to <font size=-1>PC</font>-based "client-server" systems, on the basis that, if they are having to spend a fortune on software, they might as well buy some improvements in productivity as well. Others may simply hand the jobs done by the problem programs--and the Year 2000 risks that go with them--to outside firms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A reasonable guess would be that perhaps half of all affected programs will be deemed not worth fixing, will have only cosmetic errors (printing the date wrongly on reports, for example), can be replaced easily with off-the-shelf software, or will disappear as part of the move away from mainframe and minicomputer systems. That could halve the cost of fixing the bug. Ignoring opportunity costs and other such notional expenses (which do not involve direct outlays) could "save" another $100 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That still leaves a problem that will cost the world's companies some $200 billion, most of which will ultimately find its way to the computer industry. The biggest winners are likely to be software firms offering programs that find Year 2000 bugs, and consultants and systems integrators such as <font size=-1>EDS</font> and Computer Sciences Corp. They can make a problem go away--albeit at high cost--with tools that can analyse and partially cure problem programs, plus programmers who can do the rest.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No company has yet devised a magic "Year 2000 solution". Most of the work is likely to involve mind-numbing manual labour, much of it done by the growing contract-programming industries in such countries as India, Ireland and Russia, where costs are half those in America and rich European countries. The computer industry as a whole may not make much extra money, but some of the stodgiest firms in the industry will benefit hugely. Mainframe programmers have not been on the cutting edge of computing for a long time, but they are quickly becoming one of the hottest commodities around. Perhaps their decision to save a couple of bytes with each date a few decades ago was not so short-sighted after all.

<p><b>Amex and Microsoft</b></p>
<h1>Tripping out on the Web</h1>

<font size=1>NEW YORK</font>
<p>WILL business travellers be willing to plan their worldwide trips on the Internet? American Express and Microsoft hope so. On July 29th the world's biggest software maker unveiled an alliance with the owner of the world's largest travel agency to provide on-line travel services to business travellers via both the Internet and private corporate intranets. The two firms' goal, says Ed Gilligan, president of American Express Corporate Services, is to "reinvent the travel process"--and, presumably, to win a bigger slice of the $145 billion American firms spend on travel each year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;American Express and Microsoft reckon that the key competitive advantage of their system, which should be up and running next year, is that it offers more than on-line airline, hotel and car-rental reservations and information. The system's software will allow firms to impose restrictions (eg, no first-class travel) on employees, to monitor expenses and to ensure that travellers take advantage of negotiated discounts and low fares. All this, says Bill Gates, Microsoft's boss, should "make purchasing travel easier and more cost-effective." Happily, it will also cut American Express's processing costs and allow the firm to reach the desktops of most of America's business travellers. It will ensure that yet more Microsoft software is used on those desktops too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The snag is that, far from reinventing travel booking, American Express and Microsoft are latecomers to a crowded market. In March Travelocity, a Web-based service offering everything from on-line reservations to customised travel guides, was launched by Sabre, the computer-reservations sibling of American Airlines, and Worldview Systems, a joint venture between Ameritech and Random House. Sabre also has a Web-based service aimed at business travellers in the works. Other Web travel services, such as Internet Travel Network, <font size=-1>PC</font>Travel and TravelWeb, abound. And thousands of independent travel agents around the world offer travel and reservation facilities on the Web.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such services, reckon American Express and Microsoft, appeal mostly to leisure travellers who have no use for the extra facilities promised by their new product. And, in any case, both firms have plans for the 11m or so travellers who, according to a survey by <font size=-1>CIC</font> Research, are currently using the Web to search for holidays. The American Express Travel site, aimed at leisure travellers, hit the Web in March; later this year Microsoft launches Expedia, a rival Web-based travel service unrelated to the company's deal with American Express.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The business- and leisure-travel markets do, however, share a key characteristic. In each, would-be travellers tend to shop around for the best deal and best service, and look elsewhere if they are not getting either. With the number of Web travel services soaring, many companies may be reluctant to lock themselves into American Express's offering (or into Microsoft's networking software). And a majority may prefer to leave their itineraries in the hands of a live travel agent.

<p><b>Video games</b></p>
<h1>Nintendo wakes up</h1>

<font size=1>TOKYO</font>
<p><b>Aroused from complacency, Nintendo has proved that it can still dazzle youngsters with a whizz-bang games machine. But can it regain leadership of an industry that has changed dramatically?</b></p>

<p>AFTER a month in Japanese stores, Nintendo's new video-game player, the Nintendo 64, is still drawing crowds to gawk at its dazzling 3-<font size=-1>D</font> graphics. The crowds are good news for the Kyoto firm, which has slumped from its dizzying heights in the late 1980s, when it was making more money than all the Hollywood studios put together. But the gawking teenagers are not enough. In the past five years, competition in the video-game industry has grown tougher, and the all-important game-software makers have become rebellious. Nintendo will need more than a hot box to regain its perch.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the whole of Japan's home-entertainment business was badly bruised by the protracted recession, Nintendo fared worse than most (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart</a>). Its sales slid disastrously two years ago, when the company failed to update its Super Famicom model (called Super <font size=-1>NES</font> overseas), which had been on the shelves since 1990 and could process only 16 bits of data at a time. Sega Enterprises, its Tokyo-based rival, snatched the initiative in late 1994 with a 32-bit game-player called Saturn that provided richer graphics and cleverer stunts. Then Sony entered the fray with an even more exciting 32-bit machine, the PlayStation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite initial prices of around &#165;40,000 ($370) for their new video-game machines, both Sega and Sony have had little difficulty in luring away Nintendo's customers. In the latest financial year, for the first time ever, Sega overtook Nintendo in total sales, ringing up &#165;384 billion during the year ending March 1996. Sega's revenue would have been even greater had it not got itself into a pickle in America, where marketing mistakes led to piles of unsold game machines. As for Sony, the PlayStation is reckoned to have contributed &#165;195 billion to the company's global revenue of &#165;4.6 trillion last year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new Nintendo 64 is the company's comeback bid. It uses a whopping 64-bit microprocessor specially designed by Silicon Graphics, a hot-shot computer workstation maker in California. Video-game addicts swear the wait (the Nintendo 64 should have hit the stores last December) has been worth it. Instead of the usual two-dimensional characters that slide back and forth or up and down, the Nintendo 64 provides fully rounded figures that can turn on their heels, rotating through 180-degrees on screen like animated characters in a cartoon film. Advanced "ray-tracing" tricks used in military simulators and engineering workstations add to the realism by providing proper highlighting, reflections and shadows. In prelaunch trials, the 64-bit version of Nintendo's classic game, Super Mario, left even hardened teenagers agog.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With preordering rampant and queues outside the stores, some 300,000 Nintendo 64 machines were snapped up by eager addicts on the first day. Over the past month, Nintendo has sold 800,000 of its new &#165;25,000 toys. Industry-watchers expect the company to sell 5m-6m by next March, by when they will have been launched in America and Europe as well.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, most observers believe that Sega and Sony will be hard-pressed to ship 3m apiece of their top-of-the-line game machines this year, despite aggressive price cuts. Sony slashed the retail price of its PlayStation from &#165;24,800 to &#165;19,800 (from $299 to $199 in the United States) in mid-May, following Nintendo's new product announcement. Sega promptly followed suit. Within a year or so, Nintendo will also have to drop the price of its 64-bit machines to below &#165;20,000--the most the average family is ready to pay for yet another electronic gizmo. The battle for the trigger-fingers of 14-year-olds everywhere is set to become even more brutal.
</p><p><b>Now, what will it play?</b> </b>
<br>Some of the smallest video-game makers, such as <font size=-1>NEC</font> and Sanyo, may have to drop out. It will be tough even for Sony and Sega. Both companies are thought to be losing money on each of the 32-bit machines they sell, but making it up with royalties from sales of games that run on them--a razor-and-blades model common in the industry. Nintendo will have to adopt the same policy, but software will be more than just a source of profit for the Nintendo 64. It needs plenty of popular games to show off the machine's capabilities: it was launched with just three. And Nintendo will have to sell them at lower prices, too. The Nintendo 64's first games were priced at around &#165;9,800 compared with &#165;5,800 for top-selling Sony and Sega games.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nintendo can create some of these games itself, but like other game-machine makers, it counts on independent software companies for most of its titles. Winning the best of them for the Nintendo 64 will be harder than it was with Nintendo's first hit machines, for three reasons.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first is that writing clever software that exploits the full features of Nintendo's powerful new game-machine is horrendously complex. Some 150 programmers were needed just to produce the latest version of a popular role-playing game, Final Fantasy, for Sony's PlayStation. Nintendo's new 64-bit machine is going to require bigger programming teams. On top of that, the company will have to rebuild its chain of software suppliers. Tired of waiting for the Nintendo 64 to arrive, a number of independent software houses--Namco and Square, in particular--started churning out titles for Sony's PlayStation instead.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, game-makers have an even bigger rival for their affections: the <font size=-1>PC</font>. When Nintendo's first machines came out, the <font size=-1>PC</font> was mostly a business machine, without the sound and graphics of dedicated games boxes. But today's multimedia <font size=-1>PC</font>s are a fair match for the games machines and, with more than 30m of them in homes, a much larger potential market for software firms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, Nintendo has to overcome its reputation for mistreating independent software firms with take-it-or-leave-it terms and steep royalties. Releasing a hot new machine was essential for Nintendo's survival--and certainly improves its chances with the software makers. But the battle to regain its dominance has only just begun.

<h1>Cloning California</h1>

<font size=1>TOKYO</font>
<p>WHY are there so few bright little software firms and other high-tech start-ups in Japan? Nintendo, Sega and the other video-game firms say the dearth of "code shops", capable of turning out exciting new video games, crimps their business plans. Many look longingly at California, where hundreds of new software and multimedia firms spring up each year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (<font size=-1>MITI</font>) in Tokyo think they have an answer. Henceforth, fledgling Japanese firms hoping to go public on the back of a wizard new product will be allowed to offer stock options to their employees. The aim is to let unlisted venture businesses in Japan offer their staff American-style rewards for all their long hours of little pay while the company is finding its feet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On July 15th the first of seven fledgling firms given the go-ahead by <font size=-1>MITI</font> handed two of its 16 employees contracts that allow them to buy equity at a given price in five years' time. <font size=-1>LTEL</font>, a maker of infra-red data-communications equipment in Omiya, north-west of Tokyo, granted its two star employees the right to acquire 10-20 shares in the company, with a par value of &#165;50,000 ($468), for &#165;250,000 apiece. If, after going public in five years' time, the company's share price exceeds the option price, the employees will be free to buy the stock at a discount and sell it for a profit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While common in America and elsewhere, such ways of motivating top-notch employees have been rare in Japan. Sony grabbed the headlines last year when it cleverly circumvented regulations by offering top executives a special incentive plan linked to the company's share price. By issuing &#165;1 billion of warrant bonds and then stripping the warrants (options to buy shares in future at a given price) from the bonds and handing them to the staff, Sony has been able to link executive remuneration to the company's overall performance. Konami, one of Japan's leading video-game makers, swiftly followed suit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In response to such gimmickry, <font size=-1>MITI</font> has revised Japan's commercial code. The time allowed for stock options to be exercised has been changed from six months to ten years. Taxation is now deferred until the option is exercised; it is then reduced by taxing the profit as capital gain rather than as straight income. For now, only privately held companies qualify for the scheme; and no more than a third of their outstanding shares can be offered to the staff as options.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All told, <font size=-1>MITI</font> expects to grant some 40-50 small, high-tech firms the right to issue stock options to staff by the end of the year. It has printed 1m brochures explaining the scheme and advertised it widely on television and in the press. Even if less than 1% of those brochures spark the founders of little start-ups into action, Japan could be on the way to cloning California.

<h1>Temporarily tight in Tbilisi</h1>
<p><b>The countries of the former Soviet Union seem to have made remarkable cuts in their budget deficits. Or have they?</b></p>


<p>CAST an eye over the public finances of the countries of the former Soviet Union and it seems that fiscal discipline has become <i>de rigueur</i> from Tbilisi to Tashkent. Egged on by, among others, the <font size=-1>IMF</font>, policymakers in the 15 countries have slashed their average fiscal deficit from 13% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> in 1992 to below 5% last year. For countries such as Georgia, whose deficit had reached 37% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> back in 1992, the transformation has been breathtaking. But is this performance as brilliant as it seems?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It may sound churlish to complain at such apparent prudence. The cost of profligacy is often high: in poor countries without domestic bond markets, governments usually pay for high deficits by forcing central banks to print money, thus causing galloping inflation. In the early 1990s inflation rates of hundreds of percent a year were commonplace. These days, although inflation is still high by western standards, the days of near-hyperinflation seem to be over--thanks in no small part to thinner deficits.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, the figures conceal plenty. For a start, the definition of a budget deficit in a once centrally planned economy is rather arbitrary. Under the previous regime, state-owned companies produced goods at prices fixed by the plan; usually, they also provided health clinics, kindergartens and other social benefits. During the transition to a market economy, a government's apparent fiscal health depends partly on which of these activities are incorporated into the budget. Small deficits mean little if spending on schools, say, is left out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Worse, a fixation with the deficit can slow down restructuring. Many of the governments in question, determined to cut their deficits, still support ailing state firms with cheap credit, which does not show up in the budget.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, these countries had little choice but to slash their deficits in order to conquer inflation. So far, they seem to have been successful. But will their fiscal discipline last? That depends in part on politicians' mettle. But it also depends on what lies behind today's smaller deficits. In a new paper* Adrienne Cheasty and Jeffrey Davis (both, as it happens, <font size=-1>IMF</font> economists writing in a personal capacity) argue that behind the figures lies a complex and troubling tale.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Strikingly, deficits have been cut despite a huge drop in government revenues. On average, these were about 33% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> in 1992. Last year's average was closer to 20%, with Georgia putting a minuscule 5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> into its public purse (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). There are several reasons for this: the poorer countries stopped receiving liberal hand-outs from Moscow; state firms, the traditional tax base, were hit hard by deep recessions; the new private sector proved difficult to tax; and endless tax exemptions for politically powerful firms made things worse.
</p><p><b>Fiddling the figures</b>
<br>Given this, how did these countries manage to bring their fiscal deficits down so fast? In short, through apparently swingeing cuts in spending. Government spending fell from an average of 45% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> in 1992 to 29% in 1995. But, say Ms Cheasty and Mr Davis, many of these cuts are neither politically sustainable nor economically sensible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One approach is deliberately to set aside too little cash to meet spending promises, by basing the budget on artificially low forecasts of inflation. In 1995, for instance, the Russian budget assumed an inflation rate that was one-third lower than the official inflation target. A similar tactic is to write conflicting legislation. In Ukraine laws on raising social benefits were passed by the parliament at the same time as a tough budget law which strictly limited the government's ability to finance them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the cash runs out, a common tool has been "sequestration", a fancy name for cash rationing. In some countries (such as Russia) there are rules governing who gets the money; in others (such as Ukraine) government spending depends on the decisions of individual bureaucrats. Either way, the result is that wages, pensions and so forth are simply not paid, and the government goes into arrears. In 1995 the Russians "saved" at least 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> this way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that this cannot last. Withholding wages and pensions is no way to win elections. Nor does running up arrears reduce fiscal deficits for good. It merely postpones the day on which governments must either print money to pay for them or, better but less popular, make permanent spending cuts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From a macroeconomic point of view, that is bad enough. Even worse, the strategy may ruin the government's control of economic policy. As government agencies learn that their access to cash is erratic, they begin to hoard money whenever they get hold of it. This means that the central government can no longer predict its own spending patterns. Also, local governments are more reluctant to pass on tax revenue to the centre.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ms Cheasty and Mr Davis also point out that there has been surprisingly little reorganisation of spending priorities by governments. In many former Soviet countries, much public money is still spent on state intervention in the economy through, say, subsidies for agriculture or energy rather than on economic restructuring. The authors argue that a successful transition to the market will require much deeper changes in the structure of public spending.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this makes the region's fiscal success less dramatic than it appears. So far, it is true, small deficits have helped to bring inflation down. But if this is to prove permanent, governments will have to use intelligent, longer-term fiscal policies, and not rely on short-term fixes.

<h1>Harder than a garden party</h1>

<font size=1>ATLANTA</font>

<p>IF ONLY the rest of the Olympics could have been as carefree as the bit that took place, not in Atlanta, nor even in Georgia, but across the state line in Tennessee. The Ocoee river, in the Cherokee National Forest, was the venue for the whitewater canoeing. It was a delight.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the school-bus shuttle there, through lush, rolling country and up the lovely river valley, Ron from Chattanooga introduced himself as "your shuttle ambassador" and described how the area had been an ecological disaster. Sulphur burned during the processing of copper mined upstream from the 1840s had produced acid rain, killing river life and leaving 50 square miles of barren moonscape. But conservation efforts in recent years had brought the vegetation back, and now $27m had been spent to shape a slalom course out of the natural flow of the river (previous Olympic courses were entirely artificial). Canoeists thought it among the finest in the world.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In these largely private-sector Olympics, here was something strangely unfashionable: a small triumph of state enterprise, masterminded by that child of the New Deal, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and by the United States Forest Service. It was also charming. On their way to their seats, spectators strolled past banjo-players, stopped at exhibits by Cherokee Indians and Tennessee craftsmen, and were shown a bald eagle. The biggest struggle at Ocoee was, as it should be, that between the Olympic competitors paddling furiously through "Humongous", "Slam Dunk" and other colourfully named rapids.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Back in Georgia, Atlanta was struggling with the humongous scale of the Games, and with the aftermath of an atrocity. The deadly pipe bomb planted in the Centennial Olympic Park, the main mingling area for Olympic visitors, was especially cruel because it came just as Atlanta was beginning to look beyond the troubles of transport and technology that had plagued the first week of the Games. There had been stories of lost buses, stranded athletes, an endurance-test subway system--and of <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s state-of-the-art information service that at times seemed a step back from the carrier pigeon. The organising body's initials, <font size=-1>ACOG</font>, stand for Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games. But mocking and disappointed members of the foreign press quickly suggested an alternative: Atlanta Couldn't Organise a Garden party.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Olympic spirit is resilient, however. American television specialised in schmaltzy profiles of Olympians who had overcome adversity--depression, injury, poverty, war, for example--to achieve greatness. If the competitors could triumph over their troubles, why not the Games themselves? Before and (defiantly) after the bomb people flocked to Atlanta to enjoy themselves, and by and large they succeeded. They enjoyed just being there, in the crowded streets lined with vendors of food and memorabilia. The Olympic sports provided plenty to cherish, including the fastest-ever 100-metre sprint, by Donovan Bailey of Canada.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By far the most popular off-track sport in Atlanta was collecting and trading commemorative pins, which came in perhaps 2,000 varieties and constituted a mini-economy of their own. Pins were sold for cash, exchanged for goodwill and bartered for other pins or even for Olympic tickets and hotel rooms. Limited-edition "Day Eight" pins soared in value thanks to the bomb, though since the bomb went off at 1:25 in the morning there was some dispute over whether the "Day Nine" pin should not in fact be the hot number.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ticket sales for the Olympic events were brisk, through both official and unofficial channels. (A consolation for Britons disappointed at their country's paltry tally of medals: the British are world-class scalpers, to judge by the confident touts with lots of international experience operating in teams along Atlanta's main street.) So the organisers were happy, because higher-than-expected ticket sales could help them end up in the black. And the sponsors were happy, because higher-than-expected American television audiences gave them value for their advertising money.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet these, the biggest-ever Olympics, would not have been the best even without the security lapses and the organisational glitches. Atlanta is no match for the architectural splendour of Barcelona, which held the Games four years ago, or for the sensational setting of Sydney, which will play host four years hence. It is rich in history, but it is physically dull, and has been sadly under-enhanced by the building for the Games. A brand-new stadium will remain, but the almost-new stadium next to it will be torn down.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>IBM</font> computer system had no trouble producing for this correspondent its official descriptions of past Olympics. The future record of Atlanta does not deserve to be as grim as that for Munich in 1972 ("what began as the Games of hope and harmony ended as the Games of terror and tragedy."). It is also hard to imagine Atlanta being remembered with such warmth as Barcelona, which "represented everything the Games were intended to be...joyful, beautiful, dramatic and boycott-free." These Games were a struggle. But there is nowhere better than Atlanta, city of Martin Luther King, to turn a struggle into a dream.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?839026800,iss">Search</a>

<h1><center>The hidden cost of red tape</center></h1>

BEING a politician would not be nearly as exciting if one did not have so much of other people's money to throw around. Many rich-country voters could be forgiven, therefore, for thinking that they had made their leaders' lot a dull one of late. In America, pressure from Republicans in Congress has forced the Clinton administration to scale back its spending plans. In Western Europe, where governments are keen to reduce budget deficits to qualify for monetary union, some semblance of spending restraint is at last beginning to appear. Bond markets everywhere are imposing discipline when voters fail. So will politicians lose heart, having lost their ability to spend to their hearts' content?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Far from it. They have two ways to spend your money. They can take it from you and spend it directly; or they can regulate. In other words, they can order you to spend it yourself, on something they have decided is good for you.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Suppose that a government wants to reduce pollution. It could do so by buying, say, $1 billion-worth of anti-pollution devices and giving one to every power plant, raising the money through taxes or borrowing. Or it could simply decree that all power plants must be equipped with anti-pollution devices, forcing power companies to fork out the $1 billion themselves. Either way, society would be consuming $1 billion of its resources in order to cut pollution.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nothing wrong with that, you might think: pollution is, after all, a bad thing. But there are differences between these two forms of spending. A government that spends directly must go through the reasonably transparent exercise of taxing or borrowing. A government that merely regulates passes these costs on to customers, employees and owners of power plants, making the costs hard to track and measure. Is there an even better use for that $1 billion? Since this spending is invisible to it, a government need not care; you can call any sort of tune if someone else is paying the piper.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This habit, already bad, will grow worse. In America, politicians find it especially hard to resist calls for training schemes, environmental laws, parental leave and much else (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>). Since they can no longer pay for these by taxing and spending, regulation is ballooning out of control.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On one estimate, the cost of complying with America's federal regulations has risen to 47% of its federal budget, up from only 40% in 1988. Other countries are faring no better. Japan may be a model of fiscal conservatism, but its regulators impose vast indirect costs on the country. European governments are just as bad. They not only spend more of their countries' <font size=-1>GDP</font>s but also regulate promiscuously, especially in the labour market. And on top of all of the costs of complying with the rules, there is the cost--unknowable but possibly large--that regulation imposes in the form of lost productivity. Many economists believe that over-zealous environmental regulation contributed to the great productivity slowdown that took hold in the industrial countries after 1973.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In theory, the simple solution is for governments to avoid all forms of indirect spending, and pay for everything directly. They would reimburse companies and individuals for the full costs of implementing their policies, paying for all of these activities with debt and taxes. But this sort of radicalism is impossible, for two reasons.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, many government policies are much simpler, and cheaper, to implement through regulation: it is easier to require firms to use good safety standards, for example, than to have government agencies implement them in every office and factory. And trying to reimburse each firm for its share of the burden would create a bureaucratic nightmare. Second, even if the government could compensate everyone for complying with regulations, this would create a huge incentive problem. Just think what would happen to wages if the government agreed to pay every employer the difference between the minimum wage and the wage that it would have offered to its workers in a free market.

Transparent tape would be better
Regulation, therefore, is here to stay. The question is how to deter governments from resorting to it as if it cost nothing. One solution often proposed is cost-benefit analysis: government agencies would be required to estimate the economic costs of implementing their policies, weigh them against the benefits they will offer, and implement only those policies that offer net benefits. But the benefits are often perilously difficult to measure. What is the value of a clean beach, or racial equality? Indeed, it is precisely in cases where the benefits are ephemeral that voters tend to look to governments for action. Even if statisticians were able to put a figure on the economic benefits of such things, would anybody take their estimates seriously? Of course not. It is not the job of economists and statisticians to tell people what they want.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They can, however, tell people how much the things they want will cost. And that is the beauty of a proposal that has been floated by the Republicans in Congress. It is to create a regulatory "budget" , parallel to the traditional spending budget, that would force a government to make the same sort of trade-offs when it is requiring people and firms to spend their own money that it makes when it is spending the money it has raised through taxation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This way, voters and their representatives would still have to decide for themselves what good things they want for society. But the budget would impose some discipline. Imagine what would happen if every year or two the party in power was forced to say how much it was going to spend on regulation, and how this spending would be allocated. The opposition would no doubt question the government's priorities, perhaps recommending more spending, perhaps less. Voters would benefit from hearing the sort of debate that they hear now when their tax dollars are being spent.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Naturally, this approach has some technical problems of its own. Though easier to measure than the benefits, the costs of regulation are often hard to quantify. Sometimes, doing so requires guessing the difference between what firms are spending under existing regulation and what they would have been spending if left to their own devices. Once a regulatory budget had been set, this process of reckoning and guesswork would quickly become politicised.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But so what? If the regulatory budget was in danger of being breached, those who felt strongly about the need for particular regulations would push for the budget to be raised. If the alleged costs of some regulation were exaggerated, the relevant interest groups would challenge the calculations. Attempts to codify them would spark furious debate about the true cost of regulation<b>--</b>precisely the debate, in other words, that democracies desperately need and presently lack.

<p><h2>Another Rwanda</h2></p>
<p><p><b>Burundi</b>'s governing coalition collapsed, its president took shelter in the American embassy, and its army denied carrying out a coup. The only certainty in the country, which borders Rwanda, was the continuing danger. A few days earlier, 350 displaced Tutsis, mainly women and children, had been murdered by Hutu peasants, allegedly encouraged by the rebel Hutu army.
<p>In a<b> swap</b>, arranged by a German intermediary, the bodies of two Israeli soldiers were exchanged for the remains of 123 Hizbullah guerrillas. In addition, 45 Lebanese prisoners were freed from an Israeli prison in exchange for 17 pro-Israeli Lebanese militiamen (who, it turned out, were reluctant to go home).
<p>Yasser Arafat, the Palestinians' leader, was at last allowed to meet a minister in Israel's <b>Likud government</b>. In a friendly exchange, David Levy, the foreign minister, also gave Mr Arafat, who was about to go to Damascus, a message for Syria urging a resumption of peace talks.
<p>An American sanctions bill, punishing foreign companies that invest in <b>Iran's and Libya's </b>oil and gas, passed through Congress and now awaits President Clinton's signature.</p>
<p><h2>Grudgingly</h2></p>
<p><p><b>Radovan Karadzic</b>, who has been indicted for war crimes, relinquished his job as president of the Bosnian "Serb Republic" and all other public duties, under pressure from the United States. But as the campaign for Bosnian elections in September gets under way, Mr Karadzic's party continues to speak in his name.
<p>Serbia and Bosnia agreed to restore <b>telephone and transport links</b> for the first time since the Bosnian war started four years ago.
<p>Fearing that mad-cow disease, <font size=-1>BSE</font>, could be transmitted to <b>sheep and goats</b>, the European Commission recommended keeping their brains and spinal chords out of the food supply. The suggestion risked stirring up a new panic about <font size=-1>BSE</font>, which has been tentatively linked to a fatal brain disease in people.
<p>Six leftist inmates in Turkish jails have died in <b>hunger strikes</b>. They had been protesting against maltreatment and the dispersal of prisoners to jails throughout Turkey.
<p><font size=-1>ETA</font>, a <b>Basque terrorist</b> <b>group</b>, planted a series of bombs in Spain that injured 35 people, most of them British tourists. Spanish police arrested three members of the group, who were allegedly planning an attack in Galicia.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Four <b>neutral members of the European Union</b>--Austria, Finland, Ireland and Sweden--have agreed to include peacekeeping and armed humanitarian aid in a revision of the Maastricht treaty. Diplomats claimed the agreement, which must be ratified by heads of government, is a breakthrough in the <font size=-1>IGC</font>, a round of negotiations to revise the treaty.
<p><b>Bulgaria's</b> constitutional court ruled that Georgi Pirinski, the ruling Socialist Party's candidate for president, is ineligible because he is not a citizen by birth. The Socialists said he would stay in the race.</p>
<p><h2>Going for growth</h2></p>
<p><p>The new Indian government presented its first <b>budget</b>. Amid various political compromises, it sets an aim of 7% annual growth in the economy and a reduced budget deficit. Meanwhile, the Indian courts deferred consideration of corruption accusations against Narasimha Rao, recently prime minister, and leader of the opposition Congress party.
<p>The Japanese prime minister said that a "massive" outbreak of <b>food poisoning</b> was spreading throughout the country. So far, 8,500 people have been afflicted and seven have died, with the epidemic not expected to reach its peak until next month.
<p>In Sri Lanka, the <b>Tamil Tiger</b> rebels dealt two big blows against the government. In some of the worst fighting in the 13-year civil war, they overran an army base in the north of the country, and set off a bomb on a train in the capital Colombo, killing more than 70 people.
<p>Despite European calls for sanctions against <b>Myanmar</b>, the military junta was admitted to the <font size=-1>ASEAN</font> Regional Forum, a grouping of nations dedicated to discussing security issues in Asia.
<p>In China <b>floods</b> killed more than 1,100 people.</p>
<p><h2>Limping Games</h2></p>
<p><p>The centennial <b>Olympic Games </b>got under way in Atlanta amid traffic chaos, computer glitches and simmering drug scandals. American gymnasts beat the weeping Russians, although the Russians stayed at the top of the medals table. The Chinese, caught out in wholesale drug-taking at a previous Olympics, put in tepid performances.
<p>The Senate overwhelmingly approved a <b>welfare bill </b>that would end a 61-year-old guarantee of federal aid for poor children, replacing it instead with block grants to the states.
<p>Bob Dole decided to make a tax cut, rather than deficit reduction, the centrepiece of his <b>economic plan</b>. Jack Kemp and Newt Gingrich, two influential Republicans who have been critical of Mr Dole's pathetic campaign, had held a conference to nudge the candidate towards a cut in tax rates.

<p><h2>Bearish</h2>
<p><p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>Tokyo shares</b> had their worst one-day fall this year, pulling the Nikkei average below 21,000 for the first time in four months. Investors continued to fret about a possible interest-rate rise in Japan and about a still-jumpy Wall Street, which also dragged down European and Asian bourses.
<p>The Bank of England announced changes in the way it will <b>regulate banks</b>, after recommendations made by Arthur Andersen, a consultancy firm. It will recruit more supervisors and technical experts, and is developing new ways of monitoring the risks that banks take. The &#163;35m ($54m) it spends each year on supervision could increase by up to 25%. The bank was criticised last year for its failure to prevent the collapse of Barings bank.
<p>Continuing its process of deregulating <b>Germany's financial system</b>, the government announced plans to encourage more institutional investors into the stockmarket. Insurance companies will be able to invest much more of their insured revenue in stocks, the period during which investors can sue firms over the contents of prospectuses will be slashed, and mutual funds will get more issuing rights.
<p>An unexpected rise in personal bankruptcies and late or non-payment of <b>credit-card bills </b>in America has prompted issuers to stop throwing money at people. In the first quarter 3.53% of bills were unpaid for two or more months, a 15-year high, with the picture worsening in the second quarter.</p>
<p><h2>Big deal</h2></p>
<p><p>With no white knight in sight, <b>Docks de France</b> succumbed to a sweetened FFr19.6 billion ($3.9 billion) offer from a rival supermarket group, <b>Auchan</b>, putting the new force in fifth place among distributors. Auchan's hostile takeover, a rarity in France, was a response to legislation curbing the number of hypermarkets and therefore retailers' potential for growth.
<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Profits and revenues soared at the world's biggest software maker. <b>Microsoft</b> revealed a 52% leap in fourth-quarter net income to $559m on sales up 39% to $2.26 billion, giving a record profit for the year of $2.2 billion, up from $1.45 billion a year earlier. But even Microsoft could not stop Wall Street, bearish on technology stocks and much else, from clipping its share price.
<p>In a $2.1 billion deal, plus assumed debt, Houston-based <b>Enron</b> added an electricity seller to its natural-gas and wholesale-electricity interests with the purchase of <b>Portland General</b>, positioning Enron to tap the giant California market. The new concern will be America's biggest gas and electric utility.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Maybe it's still peace: an <b>Egyptian-Israeli</b> <b>consortium</b>, Midor, signed a $1.2 billion contract to build an oil refinery at the Egyptian port of Alexandria. Israel's Merhav Group and the Egyptian General Petroleum Group formed the venture.
<p><b>Perrier</b> cancelled a poster campaign in Belgium after complaints from a women's lobby group. The advertisement for the bottled water featured a drawing of women with only the drinks company's bottle caps covering their nipples.
<p>The European Space Agency will not launch its next <b>Ariane 5</b> rocket until the middle of next year, heavily delaying a project aimed at retaining a lead in the commercial space-transport industry. The news came as an inquiry decided that faulty software caused the crash of the first Ariane 5 rocket last month.
<p>Shareholders approved a &#163;73.6m ($114.4m) rescue package for <b>Costain Group</b>, a British construction group which said a rejection of the plan would have meant receivership. But Costain's plans were later put in doubt after Lonrho, a British conglomerate, withdrew from the purchase of Costain's American coal operations.
<p><b>Rolls-Royce</b> is to shed two unprofitable power-generating units to concentrate on its core aerospace operations. Shaking off Parsons Power Generation Systems and International Combustion could cost &#163;248m ($385m), but investors were happy.
<p>Saks Holdings, parent of Saks Fifth Avenue, and Isetan, a Japanese department-store chain, are considering a restructuring of <b>Barney's</b> that would give Saks control of the upmarket clothing chain. Isetan, Barney's partner until a bust-up in January which led to Barney's filing for chapter 11 protection from creditors, would manage the property assets.</p>
<p><h2>A family business</h2></p>
<p><p>A new car project was launched by an Indonesian conglomerate, <b> Bimantara</b>, in co-operation with <b>Hyundai </b>of South Korea. The project will compete with the "national" car project of Timor Putra Nasional, which has secured exclusive tax privileges. Timor is owned by President Suharto's son, Hutomo ("Tommy") Mandala. Bimantara is also well connected. It is controlled by Tommy's elder brother, Bambang Trihatmodjo.
<p>The Clinton administration rejected a call from six American airlines to cool <b>"open skies" talks</b> with Britain until America's Justice Department has finished investigating the planned alliance between British Airways and American Airlines. The airlines reckon the British government will make only token concessions on slots for foreign carriers at Heathrow.

<h1>Tomorrow's economic argument</h1>
<p><b>America is failing to get a grip on "indirect government"</b></p>


 NEW consensus on economic policy has triumphed in America. It is based on two beliefs. First, that monetary policy should aim for stable prices and nothing else: gone are the days when the Federal Reserve Board thought it could secure high growth and job creation (some congressmen are even talking of revoking the Fed's formal mandate to promote full employment). Second, that fiscal policy should aim for balanced budgets, at least over the medium term: this year's federal budget deficit of $117 billion will be smaller in absolute terms than any since 1981; as a share of <font size=-1>GDP</font> (1.6%) the deficit is the lowest since 1974.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In terms of economic achievement, the consensus has been a triumph indeed: output has grown steadily since early 1991; unemployment is down to 5.3%, the lowest rate in six years; inflation is dormant. But in terms of economic debate, there has been not a triumph but a movement in the battle lines. Though tax-cutters and tax reformers continue to vie for influence at the court of Candidate Dole, debate about fiscal and monetary matters is gradually being overtaken by argument about the remaining tool of policy. That tool is regulation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The lines in this new argument are already drawn. On one side, Bill Clinton praises the worthy goals that regulation can achieve. As an emblem of his administration, and as a model for a second presidential term, Mr Clinton cites the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which requires employers to give 12 weeks of unpaid leave to new parents. Spurred by the election campaign, he has recently added two further proposals. One would guarantee parental rights to take unpaid leave to do things for their children: to visit a doctor, for example, or attend a parent-teacher conference. The other would allow workers to take time off in lieu of pay for overtime.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1993 Mr Clinton signed a law extending unemployment benefits by 20 weeks in states with a low unemployment rate and by 26 weeks in states with a high one. He may soon raise the minimum wage. He has defended environmental rules. He once proposed that firms be made to spend 1.5% of their payroll on training. And all this pales next to the most ambitious rule-extension of all: the president's failed plan to spread medical insurance by obliging employers to provide it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the other side, Republicans denounce the cost of all this meddling. In March they forced Mr Clinton to sign an anti-regulation reform by tacking it to a bill raising the government's debt ceiling; regulatory agencies can now be sued more easily by small firms, and their new rules are subject to review by Congress. Meanwhile both the Senate and the House have considered more ambitious anti-regulation ideas. These include appointing a commission to select hundreds of regulations for the chop; requiring that Congress ratify rules drawn up by regulatory agencies; and obliging the government to reimburse people and firms for the cost of complying with regulation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has all the makings of a lasting fight. Having accepted the wisdom of balancing the budget, Mr Clinton (supported by congressional Democrats) wants to find a way of pursuing social goals without boosting federal spending. Regulation, which shifts the cost of public policy to individuals and firms, is the perfect means of doing this. The Republicans understand that all too well. They know their efforts to restrain government will come to naught if new budgetary restraint is accompanied by new regulatory indiscipline. In short, regulation is as distasteful to them as it is attractive to Mr Clinton.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are high stakes in this battle. Some economists argue that the gradual decline in productivity growth in America (and other western countries) since the mid-1970s is partly attributable to the spread of regulation. Federal regulations impose costs on individuals and firms that are probably at least half as big as those imposed by federal taxes. The best estimate of the regulatory burden, compiled by Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester Institute of Technology, puts the cost of complying with federal rules at $668 billion in 1995, compared with $1.5 trillion in federal spending. Mr Hopkins's figures are conservative. They include only the burden of complying with rules for which cost studies have been done. Some costs, such as the loss of productivity caused when new regulation forces firms to adjust, are left out altogether.
</p><p><b>Japanese lessons</b>
<br>Using his conservative figures, Mr Hopkins estimates that in 1995 federal regulation cost the average American household $7,000 (more than the average income-tax bill, which was $6,000 per household last year). The burden of regulation has grown steadily since President Reagan's anti-government crusade gave way to the "kindler, gentler" Bush administration. Mr Bush signed mandates for cleaner air, greater generosity towards disabled people, a higher minimum wage, and more stringent product-liability laws. As a result, the cost of compliance leapt (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>). Mr Hopkins cites the example of Eastman Kodak, a photography company whose tax staff has grown by two-thirds over the past decade, partly because of the tax breaks allowed by under new regulations. The company's annual tax return has doubled in weight to 35 pounds over the same period.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Federal agencies scrutinise every aspect of a company's activity: the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (for the personnel department); the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (the factory floor); the Environmental Protection Agency (everything). These agencies are sometimes crass. In one notorious incident, a bank in Kansas City was ordered to put a Braille keypad on a drive-through cash machine.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the federal level is only part of America's regulatory problem. Multiple levels of authority produce endless reels of red tape, from the state, county and city governments to semi-autonomous local agencies charged with controlling pollution and other evils. All produce rules which overlap, replicate and, on occasion, contradict one another.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There have been periodic attempts by both Congress and the administration to roll back the frontiers of bureaucracy. Last year, for example, Congress voted to limit new "unfunded mandates"--federal rules and laws requiring state or local governments to take regulatory action while not providing them with the money necessary to do it. But so great is the political momentum behind regulation that its burden is likely to continue growing. When Republicans in Congress proposed another anti-regulation bill last year, Mr Clinton declared that it "would stop new protection from deadly bacteria in our drinking water, stop safer meat and poultry, stop safer cars, stop final implementation of the law that lets parents take leave to care for a sick child." This time, the Republicans backed off. Because the cost of regulation is indirect and hard to see, they did not have the stomach to take on the president.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The politicians' reluctance to do more to rein in regulation holds out the danger that America's government, while appearing to shrink, may actually grow. Anybody who doubts this is possible should consider Japan, where government spending as a share of <font size=-1>GDP</font> has been fractionally smaller than America's for much of the past decade (32.4% in 1980-95 compared with America's 32.9%). But Japan's government is hardly <i>laisser-faire</i>. A web of regulation slows business down, drives prices up, and (Mr Clinton might note) stokes popular disgust with government. In Japan, the consensus in favour of regulatory reform is almost as firm as America's consensus in favour of fiscal and monetary discipline.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The contrast with Japan teaches an important lesson. Having eliminated budget deficits during the 1980s, many Japanese are now willing to surrender this gain to wage war on regulation: they want to scrap rules protecting agriculture, say, and give farmers taxpayer subsidies by way of compensation. This suggests that future Americans may also undo current efforts to bring budget spending into line, unless regulation is kept in check also.
</p><p><b>Free the workers</b></b>
<br>How should regulation be checked? A necessary step is to simplify the confusing rules produced by multiple tiers of authority. That, though, is ultimately a constitutional not an economic question and is likely to take decades. Meanwhile, the various rule-producers can all try to distinguish between the justifiable and unjustifiable parts of what they do.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tariffs, licences and other competition-restricting rules are almost never justified: they subsidise producers at the expense of consumers and reduce growth by dulling producers' incentives. Happily, as the second <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a> shows, this point is widely recognised. Many price controls, rules restricting market access and other anti-competitive regulations were scrapped in the 1980s. Deregulation of interstate trucking, for example, has cut the cost of road haulage by $8 billion a year, according to Murray Weidenbaum, head of the Centre for the Study of American Business in St Louis, Missouri. The number of jobs in trucking and warehousing has risen by 37% since 1980.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Less obviously, many regulations in the workplace fall into the unjustifiable category, too. The president's family-leave law, his failed training proposal, and many other "mandates" on firms may do more harm than good. This is because these benefits are provided to many workers anyway, without the government needing to get involved. And, where they are not provided, there is good reason for this.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Left to themselves, firms and workers weigh the relative attractions of wages and non-wage benefits. Suppose, for example, that it costs a firm $10 to provide health insurance, and that employees value this insurance at $20. In such a case, the firm will provide the coverage and cut wages or other benefits by, say, $15: the bargain leaves both sides $5 better off. But now suppose that a particular benefit costs more to provide than employees think it is worth. In such a case, the company will obviously not want to spend $20 providing something that its workers value at only $10; and the workers themselves will not press for a change for fear that the firm will claw back the extra costs by cutting other benefits that they value more highly. In this example, both sides will feel better off if the benefit is not provided.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now consider what happens if the government steps in and (for example) orders all firms to offer training to workers. Most workers who set a high value on training are unlikely to be affected: the bargaining process means that they will presumably have taken jobs with employers who provide the benefit anyway. But workers who value training less will have it forced upon them. Some will no doubt find that they were underestimating the value of training and will appreciate the benefit. But even then it will not come as a free gift. For the most part, workers will find that their firms cut wages or benefits to recoup the newly imposed training costs. In effect, workers will have been forced to "purchase" a benefit they did not particularly want, and to sacrifice other things they liked better.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In some cases, the outcome may be worse than this. Firms may find it difficult to recoup the cost of government-mandated training. Minimum-wage laws may prevent them from cutting wages--and the more the minimum is raised the more jobs it will affect. Union-negotiated deals may prevent them from withdrawing other benefits. In these cases, firms will cut staff. In November 1992 Laurence Meyer (whom the president has just appointed to the Fed) estimated that the training mandate then proposed by Mr Clinton might cost 200,000 jobs over two years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a general rule, anybody whom a mandate is intended to help is likely to suffer disproportionately from the cost of providing it. Suppose, for example, that the government mandates parental leave, hoping to help parents. This will make parents more expensive to employ than other workers who do not take advantage of this benefit. As a result, firms may cut parents' pay or may simply not hire them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The broad presumption, therefore, should be against mandates. But there may be exceptions, and the Clinton team is good at citing them. Lawrence Summers, the number two at the Treasury, argues that employees may undervalue certain goods. They may, for example, underestimate the risk of falling expensively sick: in that case, mandatory health insurance might help them, even if it comes at the expense of other goods that workers believe they want more. The underlying justification for such intervention is that the government knows better what workers want than they do themselves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or the government might intervene because it knows that, if workers are uninsured, their medical costs will be shouldered by others. Doctors might treat them without pay, then recoup the money by overcharging insured patients. This would push up insurance premiums, which would in turn discourage workers from insuring themselves. Mandatory health insurance would clamp down on free riders.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These arguments may justify limited workplace regulation. Factory safety rules, and possibly health insurance, might reduce the medical bills that the general public must pay, so justifying a certain amount of public intervention. All the same, this gain must be weighed against the danger of forcing workers to "purchase" benefits they do not want. The free-rider argument certainly does not justify the extravagant list of rules proposed by Mr Clinton.
</p><p><b>Green grievances</b>
<br>The free-rider defence does cover some other types of regulation. Safety rules, such as laws that keep drivers off the bottle and behind seat-belts, might be justified if hospital costs tend to be paid by others. Environmental laws present an even clearer case. Firms can save money by passing the cost of pollution on to others. It is encouraging that, according to Mr Hopkins's second <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>, environmental and safety rules account for a much greater share of regulatory costs than they did in the 1970s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that, although the environment needs to be regulated, it can easily be regulated badly. Two environmental laws--one to protect endangered species, the other to protect wetlands--have begotten a host of rules that prevent people from building homes, ploughing fields, filling ditches, and even repairing fences on their own land. In one infamous case, a man who cleared 7,000 tyres from his property was prosecuted for destroying a wetland; the tyres had trapped water from a nearby stream, creating several pools which the regulators deemed worthy of protection.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clumsy rules can also lose sight of costs. An obvious point perhaps, but efforts to respond to it have failed repeatedly. During the Reagan and Bush years, the administration's Office of Management and Budget reviewed most big regulatory proposals; the <font size=-1>OMB</font>'s role has been weakened under Mr Clinton. Last year's Republican anti-regulation drive would have subjected all rules to cost-benefit analysis; this year the Republicans have retreated. Some laws explicitly lay down that their goals should be achieved whatever the cost.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because cost-benefit analysis has been carried out only sporadically, America labours under some outrageously expensive rules as well as some good ones. A so-called "trihalomethane drinking-water standard" , adopted in 1979, costs an estimated $200,000 for each life saved. On the other hand, restrictions on wood-preserving chemicals, adopted in 1990, cost an estimated $6.3 trillion per life saved.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Obviously, it is hard to put a value on a life (to put it mildly) but, because resources are not infinite, some calculation of costs and benefits is required. Robert Hahn of the American Enterprise Institute reckons that only about half of all environment, health and safety regulations imposed since 1990 for which data are available would pass a reasonable cost-benefit test. In a survey of 33 safety laws*, Kip Viscusi of Duke University, North Carolina found that just 13 save lives at a cost of less than $4m apiece, the highest price he reckons reasonable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To sort out effective measures from hideously expensive ones, regulators need to do more than just subject rules to a cost-benefit test. They also need to make sure that the same test is used by different agencies. At present, some agencies refuse to put a value on life--understandable, perhaps, but this implies that society should pay an infinite amount for safety. Others do value it, but at different prices. Transport regulators reckon a new rule pays its way if it saves lives at less than $3m a piece. Environmental regulators are often willing to accept a higher cost.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But in the end, argues Richard Armey, the House majority leader, the best way to make sense of America's tangle of rules would be to draw up a regulatory budget, rather than concentrate on cost-benefit analyses. Such a budget would cap the compliance costs that each agency could impose. The agencies would then decide which rules they could afford, much as they already decide how to spend their share of the government's regular budget.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Proponents of a regulatory budget argue that its greatest advantage is political. It would force Congress and the administration to take responsibility for the costs of new laws, and it would make these costs transparent. At the moment, Congress can pass feel-good statutes that promise clean air and so on; it does not have to answer for the expensive rules that regulatory agencies draw up to achieve these objectives. This would change if Congress had to specify the cost of each new law, and to make room for this cost in its regulatory budget.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given time, such a budget might make bad regulation as politically embarrassing as wasteful spending. It would make it possible to compare indirect government spending on clean air with direct spending on tanks or roads. This clarity would end the current temptation to see regulation as a cheap alternative to tax-financed programmes. Americans could see both for what they are: government interventions that may accomplish useful things, and that are certain to cost money.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few doughty congressmen think a regulatory budget ought to be adopted. Mr Clinton's recent victories in the regulation debate make their cause seem hopeless for the moment. A big Democratic victory in November would increase the chances that bad regulation will spread. If so, America's promising new consensus in monetary and fiscal policy will not be quite the triumph that it appears to be.

<h1>Po-li-tics on Route 66</h1>

<font size=1>KINGMAN</font>
<p>THE swimming-pool floor at the Quality Inn in Kingman, Arizona, is emblazoned with a giant sign saying "Route 66". In the lobby, Route 66 memorabilia, from <font size=-1>T</font>-shirts and caps to key-rings and maps, are on sale. Outside in the forecourt, in front of some old petrol pumps, a 1964 Corvette is being raffled for $5 a ticket. The proceeds are for Kingman's Route 66 museum, one of several springing up along the "Main Street of America", as early boosters called the road that twisted its way for 2,400 miles across eight states from Chicago to Los Angeles.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Growing numbers of people are heading back along it. Some 80% of the road has survived into the age of the Interstates. Now it is not so much a means of getting (slowly) from <font size=-1>A</font> to <font size=-1>B</font>, but a place to watch nostalgic baby-boomers, clutching their copies of Jack Kerouac and John Steinbeck and humming the lyrics of "Route 66". Since Bobby Troup wrote that song in 1946, it has been recorded by at least 66 other singers, among them Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Chuck Berry and, woe betide, Asleep at the Wheel.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This October in Vega, Texas, enthusiasts will gather to celebrate the 70th birthday of the fabled highway. In his splendid book, "Route 66: The Mother Road" (St Martin's Press), Michael Wallis notes that back in 1926 George Gershwin was all the rage, motion pictures were still a year away from finding their voice and Fred Astaire had yet to find Ginger Rogers. And, he might have added, in Russell, Kansas, a boy named Bob Dole was three years old.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps Mr Dole, who was back in Kansas on July 22nd to celebrate his 73rd birthday, could learn a thing or two from the renewed fashionableness of Route 66. The road signs that came down in the 1970s have become valuable collectors' items. In recent years the states along the road have been putting up new signs to mark "Historic Route 66" and to point the way to it from the Interstates. Shops are doing a brisk trade in Route 66 accessories (one advertisement urges drivers to "Get your 'ticks' with the Official Route 66 Watch Company"). <i>Route 66 Magazine</i>, a three-year-old quarterly, is growing beyond the wildest dreams of its publisher, Paul Taylor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Taylor points to the road's association with a world that seemed slower, easier, more innocent. People like to remember "a time of leaving the doors unlocked, of mom-and-pop diners, of taking your time." Route 66 is an American metaphor for mobility, freedom, progress, a sense of possibility.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is it not also an ideal metaphor for Mr Dole: Route 66, the thread that runs through his life? For a dozen miles, the road also happens to run through a corner of his native Kansas, carefully by-passing Bill Clinton's Arkansas in the process (though there is now a Route 66 museum in Clinton, Oklahoma). The Republican presidential candidate may of course fear that any reminder that he is older than this piece of American heritage might make voters think he himself belongs in a museum. But Route 66 shows that nostalgia is positively hip.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In one of his forlorn efforts to define the essence of this election, Mr Dole earlier this year ventured that "It's about the future, because that's where we're headed." Perhaps he should now head to Vega, Texas, and declare that "It's about the past, because that's where we're coming from."

<h1>Cut and grow--hope and woe</h1>
<p><b>Europe's economies are trapped between a need to cut and a need to grow. Without easier money from their central banks, it will be hard to do both</b></p>

<p>IN A political Olympic Games, it would be the most gruelling event: chopping budget deficits at a time when economies are wobbly, in pursuit of a prize that most people are not sure they want. The prize is European economic and monetary union (<font size=-1>EMU</font>), and the hot-heads chasing it are the politicians running most European Union countries. Nobody is sure they will reach their goal of introducing a single European currency, the euro, in 1999, though the odds may be marginally in favour. But either way, will the exercise pep their economies up or cripple them?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, the answer depends largely on central banks, which control short-term interest rates and influence the value of currencies. They are being unhelpful. On July 25th Germany's Bundesank missed a chance to cut interest rates before breaking for its summer holiday. Two days earlier the Bank of Italy, one of the toughest of Europe's big central banks, sliced its benchmark discount rate by three-quarters of a point to 8.25%. Industrialists had wanted a bigger cut. Without monetary medicine, many people, politicians especially, argue that Europe will not recover from its economic malaise.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the malaise is not a monetary one. It is deeper-seated than that. Although the economies of continental Europe differ, most are still suffering from policies, some now abandoned, that had for years encouraged an expansion of the state at the expense of private industry. That preference taints nearly every economic endeavour. Generous welfare programmes, financed mainly through payroll taxes, raise the cost of labour and impede job-creation. High public borrowing keeps interest rates up and discourages private investment. And so on.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The vagaries of the business cycle sometimes mask the problem. That happened in 1990, when unification triggered a 2.5-year boom in Germany. It may be about to happen again. Although forecasts are unusually divergent, most predict that Germany and France, Europe's two biggest economies, are about to recover from a mini-recession that took hold at the end of last year. Italy, the equal third-biggest (alongside Britain), may be about to slide into one. But it too should bounce back next year, while Britain is looking quite perky.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet recovery may not bring full relief. A pick-up in growth next year will not banish Europe's familiar plagues: an average unemployment rate that is double America's and more than three times Japan's; idle factories and offices and a reluctance to build new ones. By letting factories dawdle and by under-employing its people, Europe could continue to expand at rates well below its potential for non-inflationary growth. Worse, potential output growth may be falling. German investment in machinery and equipment has dropped.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rather than succumb to the temptation to coddle their sickly economies, politicians are wielding a whip. The Maastricht treaty, which tells countries that want to join <font size=-1>EMU</font> in the first wave to cut their public-sector deficits to no more than 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> next year, is the biggest reason for this brutality. The first-round candidates include Germany, France, the three Benelux countries, Austria, Ireland and Finland. Italy and Spain are hopeful, but hobbling; Britain and Denmark remain undecided.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The aspirants promise to impose unprecedented fiscal austerity. Germany's conservative government proposes to cut DM50 billion ($34 billion) from the projected public-sector deficit next year. Even after trade unions and opposition votes water it down, the savings package will not fall far short of 1% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. France is bracing for its first cut in real government spending, while Italy promises to shrink its public-sector deficit from 7.2% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> last year to 4.4% in 1997. The <font size=-1>OECD</font> frets that the Europe-wide effort to rein in deficits could in the short run be a "significant negative influence" on growth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is not the only dampener. Employers are squeezing wages, either to curb inflation, as Italy has done, or to boost employment, as in Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Denmark. Company restructuring, which in Germany alone has thrown another 400,000 people out of work since last summer, is another drag on growth. So consumer spending is unlikely to give European economies a big lift.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is nerve-racking for politicians, especially France's president, Jacques Chirac, and Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, who both face parliamentary elections in 1998. They would normally be thinking up electoral bribes, not demanding sacrifices. In a Bastille Day outburst, Mr Chirac demanded lower interest rates in place of the usual handouts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Central banks--the Bundesbank in particular--are apparently reluctant to grant Mr Chirac his wish immediately. At first glance this looks odd. Inflation looks under control. It is less than 2% in Germany and just above in France. Even in inflation-prone Italy it has apparently dipped below 4%. On a continent stuffed with jobless workers and factories at low-speed, there is little immediate threat that it will come roaring back. The Bundesbank admitted that the high level of monetary growth in Germany does not pose much threat of inflation. What makes its stubbornness on rates more surprising is that Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's president, so clearly wants the dollar up and--by implication--the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark down. He told a German newspaper this week he sees "no reason" why the dollar should not beat its recent highs against the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So why did the Bundesbank refuse to cut rates after raising expectations that it would? One reason may be the recovery most economists are expecting in the German economy. Another may be that central bankers are reluctant to cut rates based on mere promises by politicians. Mr Chirac has yet to carry out his plans to spend less. And the German budget savings package will not be wrapped up until autumn. It is, after all, the mix of fiscal and monetary policy that matters, not the mere level of interest rates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This points to two risks facing hopes of a revival prompted by looser monetary policy. The first is that the policy mix could again go awry, either before or after <font size=-1>EMU</font>. Some economists argue that monetary policy will be too tight. But the risk is as great that, after monetary union, governments could return to their spendthrift ways--especially if the rules are bent to let in such over-spenders as Italy and Spain. Hence German efforts to tighten <font size=-1>EMU</font>'s fiscal rules.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other risk is that the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark and currencies allied to it will go on getting stronger. The recent jitters on America's stockmarket coupled with the Bundesbank's refusal to cut rates helped spark a rise in the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark against the dollar from DM1.55 in May to its current level of DM1.48. Hard evidence of recovery in Europe could trigger another rise in the continent's currencies, blunting that recovery. Italy has already discovered that the foreign exchanges reward fiscal virtue by buying a country's currency--which is one reason why the Italian economy is slowing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some European leaders must be hoping that the euro will solve this conundrum. In theory, a European currency less prone to over-valuation than the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark could be a boon for the long-suffering <font size=-1>D</font>-mark zone, generating rather faster economic growth. But there are dangers ahead. One is that the euro might turn out to be too strong, especially if it lures foreign-exchange reserves to switch out of the dollar. Another, however, is that the markets may view the euro as fragile, leading Europe's future central bank to prove itself by pushing up interest rates. In either case, politicians who struggled to cross the Maastricht finish line might ask why they bothered.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?838422000,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>Politics</b></p>
<h1>Cheap cuts</h1>

<p>IN POLITICS as in life, those who pretend to be what they are not eventually get rumbled. This is now the single biggest threat to the career of John Redwood, a right-wing Conservative who resigned from the cabinet to fight John Major in last summer's leadership election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Redwood is clever, a former fellow of All Souls who as head of Lady Thatcher's policy unit in 1983-85 forced through privatisation by weight of logic. He has shown prodigious stamina in his undeclared campaign to succeed Mr Major. Yet his populist pronouncements this month on public spending cuts--three sets, in the Commons, <i>The Times </i>and the <i>Evening Standard</i>, all disconcertingly different in detail--reveal, at best, muddled thinking.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Redwood, like most voters, wants the state to tax less and spend less. Again like voters, he also wants to "have a first-class education service, defence, law and order policies and a health service, and to ensure they get reasonable increases." He affects to square the circle by arguing that &#163;7 billion can be cut from planned spending in 1997-98 without damaging any of these things.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, under scrutiny, his cuts turn out to be illusory. First, he wants to take &#163;2.5 billion off the chancellor's original reserve of &#163;5 billion set aside in his 1995 budget for unexpected spending in 1997-98. Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is likely do this when he resets the reserve in his November 1996 budget, as all chancellors provide less for the year ahead than for two years ahead. But this is not a saving, since the government is already committed to spending all of the &#163;5 billion, including at least &#163;2 billion for agriculture for its anti-<font size=-1>BSE</font> slaughter programme.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Redwood seeks to score a further &#163;2.5 billion by cuts achieved because inflation is 0.9% lower than the government expected, meaning that each pound of spending buys more. Mr Clarke is trying to do this too, but it is not easy. Many government contracts with the private sector have already been signed at a fixed price. They cannot be cancelled just because that price now looks more attractive, any more than the contractors could have cancelled them had inflation turned out faster than expected. Moreover, lower inflation affects both sides of the accounts, since the lower prices are, the lower is the revenue from <font size=-1>VAT</font>. No room for tax cuts here.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thirdly, he wants to save &#163;500m by cutting grants to the Housing Corporation, which provides public housing for low rent. But, as most tenants are not well off, higher rents would simply increase what the state pays out in housing benefit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, Mr Redwood wants to cut "bureaucracy" and increase privatisation to yield another &#163;1.5 billion in savings. So do ministers. But they have to answer questions on which Mr Redwood is curiously silent. What is it that they are not selling which they should sell? Is it right to use a one-off receipt from asset sales to finance tax cuts that go on from year to year? What bureaucrats should they sack? What functions, if any, should go with them?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government's target for public spending, reaffirmed by the cabinet on July 18th, is tough stuff. It implies a virtual freeze in real terms from 1994-95 to 1997-98. It has forced the cabinet to freeze public-sector pay for a fourth successive year. To hit the target in an election year would be an achievement. To beat it would be a triumph, requiring far more controversial cuts than those Mr Redwood suggests.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economists have taught us that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Serious politicians should teach a second lesson: that there is no such thing as a painless cut. The right has a case to argue for real cuts, achieved by cutting middle-class benefits such as child benefit and by privatising much of the welfare state. But the gain, lower taxes, cannot be achieved without pain. For Mr Redwood's country, and, in the long term for him personally, honesty would be the best policy.

<h1>Non-jobs for the boys</h1>
<p>NO DISRESPECT to Phillip Oppenheim, the perky little minister appointed by John Major to the Treasury in his July 23rd mini-reshuffle, but he should not have got the job--for the simple reason that there isn't one. The three junior ministers at the Treasury, David Heathcoat-Amory, who resigned over the European single currency on July 22nd, Michael Jack and Angela Knight had at most two jobs-worth of work. Mr Heathcoat-Amory filled in his spare time penning the anti-Euro pamphlet which he quit to publish.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You might have thought that Mr Major would by now have got the point that junior ministers are a mixed blessing. He has wasted time this summer trying to persuade Mr Heathcoat-Amory (unsuccessfully) and the foreign office minister, David Davis (successfully) not to quit, because of the political damage that ministerial resignations do the government. If they had not held office, their views on matters European need not have detained him. As it is, more juniors may quit over the months ahead, to establish their claims for preferment under a different leader in opposition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Mr Major remains addicted to junior ministers. Praise be, he cut the industry department from seven to six, though what even six do in a government that prides itself on leaving industry alone is a mystery. But the Foreign Office, which lost one post in last year's reshuffle, has since grabbed it back. Even excluding the 14 whips, 51 Tory <font size=-1>MP</font>s outside the cabinet now hold junior jobs, practically exhausting the ration of ministerial salaries that Mr Major is permitted by law to pay. There are 5% more junior ministers today than there were a decade ago.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If ever there was a time for a cut, it was this year. Ahead of the election, government business is minimal. Junior ministers also have less to do because they have fewer civil servants to supervise. Mr Major cannot even pretend he keeps them for training as potential cabinet appointees. Although every cabinet minister today, save Lord Mackay, first served as a junior minister, most junior ministers will not make cabinet. According to Kevin Theakston of Leeds University, 60% of the lowlier junior ministers are aged 45 or over, too old to have any real hope of making cabinet even in the unlikely event that the Tories win again.

<p><b>Ministers and Parliament</b></p>
<h1>Whose fault?</h1>

<p>A NEW code governing the way that ministers treat Parliament will be proposed by the all-party parliamentary Select Committee on Public Service in a report due out on July 30th. The code would lay down for the first time precisely what Parliament expects of ministers in terms of frank answers to questions and disclosure of information. Crucially, its wording will be decided by <font size=-1>MP</font>s, reducing the scope for the government to wriggle out of its demands by holding back information.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The code would supplement the government's own "Questions of Procedure for Ministers". It is Parliament's answer to Sir Richard Scott's report into the sale of arms to Iraq, which complained that ministerial accountability had been undermined because assorted ministers answered questions in ways that misled Parliament. Sir Richard blaming particular civil servants for drafting the misleading answers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the doctrine of ministerial accountability, ministers are answerable to Parliament not only for their own actions but for those of their civil servants. Sir Richard, by blaming civil servants as well as ministers, threw doubt on the viability of this convention.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some radical critics of the doctrine who gave evidence to the committee believe that it should be amended, so that civil servants, in some circumstances, answer directly to Parliament for what they have done. However, the committee, which is chaired by Giles Radice, a Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>, regards its proposal as a sensible "half-way house" between the status quo and changes that would mean bigger reforms in the constitutional convention.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The committee canvassed the code with two ministers, Tony Newton and Roger Freeman, when they appeared before it on July 17th. They made sceptical noises but did not entirely reject it. Mr Radice has been here before: the government was at first equally sceptical of his proposal for a code of Civil Service conduct, only to adopt it in 1995.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The committee's deliberations centred on the modern interpretation of the doctrine of ministerial responsibility. Advanced by Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, it draws a distinction between accountability as a constitutional burden that rests on the shoulders of ministers and cannot be set aside, and responsibility, which can be delegated to officials. If something goes wrong, it is not always necessary for the minister to take the blame. It is however necessary for him to sort it out, at least to Parliament's satisfaction.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This new orthodoxy has its attractions for all parties. Ministers like it because it gives them opportunities to shift blame on to officials, who are debarred from arguing publicly with them. A recent example was Michael Howard's sacking of Derek Lewis, the head of the Prison Service. Parliament likes it, because it can preserve the illusion that it can control the executive, summoning its highest representatives to account before it. Many old-guard civil servants like it because it provides a protecting veil, behind which they can as before exercise private power without responsibility.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Freeman, the minister responsible for the civil service, was roused to rare passion in defending the doctrine in his statement on July 17th. He said that diminution of the doctrine would be "giving unelected officials the political influence that can only be earned in a parliamentary democracy through election. Elected ministers would be eliminated from the accountability loop. I believe that the inevitable outcome would be the politicisation of the civil service."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This would be plausible if elected ministers were truly accountable now; but in practice they are not. When a minister is under pressure in the Commons, what matters is not whether he is doing his job properly, but whether the whips can arm-twist his party colleagues to back him. William Waldegrave, the minister in the dock after the Scott report, survived because the Tories in the Commons voted that he should, for reasons that had nothing to do with the merits of the case.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many civil servants find the present rules hard to live with. What do you do if the minister for whom you work asks you to draft a parliamentary answer in terms you regard as misleading? What if he seeks to transfer blame to you, as the home secretary did in the Lewis case? Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the First Division Association, the top civil servants' union, wants the doctrine to be changed so that officials can defend themselves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is one clear precedent for making civil servants more directly accountable to Parliament. Before the Public Accounts Committee, permanent secretaries are themselves responsible for what they say about the propriety of their departments' expenditure. The Pergau dam scandal broke in 1991 when Sir Tim Lankester, permanent secretary of the Overseas Development Agency, had formally warned ministers that spending aid money to secure arms exports to Malaysia was indefensible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That was a triumph for accountability, but a severe blow to the government, which had hoped to hush up the deal. That may explain why ministers want no further change in the doctrine.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The argument will not end with the publication of the committee's report. An incoming Labour government, committed to constitutional change, may be less conservative than the present administration. Meanwhile Sir Robin Butler, Whitehall's most powerful constitutional conservative, retires at the end of 1997.

<p><b>Educational performance</b></p>
<h1>Doesn't add up</h1>

<p>NOT only are English children among the rich world's worst at mathematics, but they have slid down the scale since the 1960s. This is the conclusion of a report published on July 25th by Ofsted, the schools inspectorate for England, which reviews the evidence from international comparisons of children's abilities. The fact that English pupils do rather better in science, while good news in itself, shows that the poor performance in maths is not all down to "cultural differences", such as the greater importance that East Asians are said to attach to education. If it were, East Asians would be as far ahead in science as they are in maths. So, Ofsted concludes, we cannot be teaching maths properly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As well as measuring how much English pupils lag behind those in other countries, the studies reviewed by Ofsted suggest some reasons for their weaknesses. A big study in 1990 (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>) noted that in England, pupils spend less time doing maths than in most other countries, and get less homework than anywhere except Scotland.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a comparison of two similar sets of tests on 13-year-olds, one in 1964 and the other in 1983, England slipped from fourth to ninth place out of ten countries taking part. Its ranking would have been even worse but for the fact that star performers such as China, South Korea and Taiwan did not participate in these particular tests. Since the 1983 tests, England has seen a steady improvement in the proportion of pupils passing their <font size=-1>GCSE</font> (and its predecessor, <font size=-1>O</font>-level) in maths. So has the gap with other countries closed? Probably not, says David Reynolds, professor of education at Newcastle University and one of the Ofsted report's authors, because other countries have improved even more.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Average test scores in England are brought down by its greater proportion of low achievers, compared with such countries as Taiwan. Schools in these countries test their pupils more regularly, and often insist that all pupils repeat the tests until they get adequate scores, giving them extra lessons and homework if need be. Schools in countries in which children do well at maths also spend more of their time on "interactive whole-class teaching", where the teacher lectures the entire class, constantly firing questions at pupils to ensure they understand what is being taught. In English schools, pupils are more often left to work through textbooks or worksheets on their own or in small groups.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;International comparisons of any sort always have to be treated with caution. For instance, one reason that Taiwanese children do so well in tests designed to measure international differences is that they are more used to taking tests than English children. But England's performance may be boosted by the high proportion of English schools that refuse to take part in such international tests: presumably the ones that do join in are the better ones.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As well as getting schools to spend more time teaching maths, to set more homework and to test their pupils more often, Mr Reynolds says more attention should be paid to teaching the teachers. He has recently been to study the education system in Taiwan, and says it seems to have successfully incorporated the best of teaching methods from countries as diverse as China, Japan and America. Trainee teachers in Taiwan get more intensive coaching in which methods work best; in England, argues Mr Reynolds, we have "failed to assemble a body of knowledge about what works in the classroom." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government has recently announced a string of measures to redress some of these failings: some teacher-training colleges are to be reinspected, because Ofsted suspects that its inspectors have been too lenient; tests of mental arithmetic are being introduced for 11- and 14-year-olds; more in-service training for teachers is being directed towards brushing up their maths. However, this drive will not be helped by the fact that, as a recent survey of teacher-training institutions by Oxford Brookes University found, there are now only 66 applicants for every 100 places on courses for training maths teachers. Falling unemployment has meant numerate graduates can find better-paid jobs which involve less hassle than teaching.

<p><b>Semiconductor trade</b></p>
<h1>A wafer-thin case</h1>

<p>FEW things in business move as fast as the semiconductor industry. Every couple of years it produces some new, cost-slashing item of wizardry. Although its sales are stalling this year, they almost tripled in the past five years (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). Yet even in such a zippy industry, trade politics evolves as slowly as ever. Ten years ago America browbeat Japan into accepting a semiconductor trade deal. A second agreement, signed in 1991, is due to expire on July 31st. That is now the deadline for a new deal into which the Americans are trying to push the reluctant Japanese.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best outcome for trade, although an improbable one, would be for the whole agreement to be torn up. Ostensibly, its aim was to open the Japanese market; but its effect was to bully the Japanese government into reserving some of the country's chip market for foreigners. That has helped both American and Japanese firms: carve up the market, and there is less need to compete.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the 1986 deal the Japanese government promised to try to push foreign chip makers' share of the Japanese market up from 8% to around 20%, a pledge they made again in 1991. Since the fourth quarter of 1993, Japan has hit the target consistently; in the first quarter of this year foreign firms' slice topped 30%, of which American companies accounted for about two-thirds. At the same time, the agreement has fostered plenty of co-operation between American and Japanese chip makers: several joint ventures have been started since 1991.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite this, the Americans are in no mood to call it quits.They worry that with no deal at all, their share of the market may slip back. American officials say that foreigners' penetration of the market is recent, and borne on the past few years' surge in demand for semiconductors; it may prove fragile, now that demand has turned down and many producers are left with excess capacity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The American government insists that it no longer wants anything as crude as a numerical target. Nevertheless, it says that both governments should continue to "monitor" the Japanese market and to publish market-share figures. The Japanese suspect, probably rightly, that this will amount to pretty much the same thing as a target: a sharp drop in American sales would surely provoke howls of protest.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until a few weeks ago, the Japanese were insisting that governments should at long last leave the industry alone. Lately, though, they have softened a little. They want to kick the whole thing into two grand talking shops--one, the "Global Government Forum", for bureaucrats, and the other, the "World Semiconductor Council", for companies. Both would be open to the European Union and other chip-making countries. The Americans, although they reacted sniffily at first, now say this "could be workable"--provided that their worries about monitoring are sorted out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of this suggests that a traditional trade-policy fudge will probably be served up when officials from the two sides are due to meet in Vancouver, Canada, on July 28th. (By then, being ambitious fellows, they hope to have sorted out another dispute, over a 1994 pact on insurance.) The Americans will be able to claim that they can keep an eye on the Japanese; the Japanese, that they have once again stood up to the Americans. And consumers? Well, what did they ever have to do with it?

<p><b>Electronic commerce</b></p>
<h1>Sign here</h1>

<p>"THE great thing about the Internet", runs a favourite geek joke, "is that no one knows that you're really a dog." The anonymity that the Internet grants users may be a splendid thing for some people, but it is now threatening the growth of commerce on the medium. The trouble is that if no one knows that you are a dog, they certainly cannot be sure that you are not. And if that is the case, they might think twice before giving you their money.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Internet users (be they shops, magazines, software firms or individuals) all have e-mail addresses; some even own sites on the World Wide Web. But it is simple for a person of malicious bent to forge an e-mail, or many other types of electronic orders. And it would not be much harder for a con-man to set up a Web site and attract orders, before switching off his computer and vanishing into the ether.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the moment a mere $200m worth of goods are sold across the Internet each year. All the estimates of this figure reaching $30 billion by the end of the decade will count for little unless somebody comes up with some kind of "digital signature" that gives users the same assurance that face-to-face contact, a physical address or even a driving licence does in the real world. Ideally, a digital signature should be guaranteed by some trusted third party--eg, a credit-card firm or a government body.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Next month, the American Bar Association will publish its guidelines on using digital signatures. Various organisations, including the <font size=-1>US</font> Postal Service and Bankers Trust, an investment bank, hope to become "trusted third parties". However, a small Californian firm called Verisign, which was founded only 14 months ago, seems to have stolen a march on them. On July 22nd, Verisign announced that it was working with Visa, a credit-card firm, to produce a scheme to authenticate card holders over the Internet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Verisign has already built a tidy business selling two types of digital signatures: personal and site certificates. Site certificates are for companies wanting to sell goods and services over the World Wide Web. Personal certificates, aimed at individuals buying these services, come in three levels of certainty, the toughest of which requires a visit to a notary before you can receive your new Internet persona. These certificates are downloaded into a specific <font size=-1>PC</font>, chosen by the shopper; under certain circumstances, they are presented to merchants to identify the purchasers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under Verisign's system, each site pays $295 for their first certificate and $75 for each year's renewal; consumer certificates cost between $6 and $18 a year. Verisign has issued 10,000 server certificates and 100,000 personal ones (although most of the personal ones have been given away free). The new agreement with Visa will allow Visa's member banks to offer digital signatures to buyers and sellers on the Internet--and add an extra level of security to on-line credit-card purchases.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just as there are fake credit cards and mix-ups over billing, there could be problems with Internet certificates. With credit cards there are set rules about who should be liable. Seeing that companies such as Verisign are merely authenticating somebody's identity rather than advancing money to them, several American states have passed laws that will exempt them from similar liability, provided that they follow a strict code of practice. It is not yet clear what effect these have had. In Utah, for example, the criteria for receiving protection from liability are so strict that no issuer yet qualifies, according to Michael Froomkin, an Internet expert at the University of Miami.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another difficulty with existing digital certificates is that they are trapped in a specific <font size=-1>PC</font>. Someone who uses different computers at home and at work will need two digital signatures. Ultimately, digital signatures may migrate on to portable "smart" cards. However, since smart cards will need devices that can understand their content, it may be years before those carrying digital identities are commonplace.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is an irony in all this. Although everybody seems so frightened of credit-card collecting hackers, there is still not a single recorded case of a card number being stolen during a transaction on the Internet. Maybe dogs are more creditworthy than they seem.

<h1>The property of the mind</h1>
<p><b>Digital technology and the development of the Internet are making it easy to copy or alter all sorts of information and art, from music to databases to computer software. Can copyright still be protected? </b></p>

<p>"THE Internet is one gigantic copying machine," says David Nimmer, a Los Angeles lawyer who spends his time advising owners of intellectual property on their rights to their evanescent assets. "All copyrighted works can now be digitised, and once on the Net, copying is effortless, costless, widespread and immediate."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For lots of the rich world's most successful industries, that is dire news. Intellectual property is big business. Many modern products sell, not for what the physical object costs to make, but for a price that reflects heavy research costs (think of drugs) or an ingenious idea (software) or spending on branding (perfume). High development costs, coupled with low production costs, make such products vulnerable to piracy. The low cost of each extra fake means that consumer and pirate share an interest in diddling the original investor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the past, copying intellectual products has been time-consuming and the reproduction sometimes worse than the original. But digital technology changes things in two main ways. First, the quality of copies is as good as the master. The difference between a fake Michael Jackson <font size=-1>CD</font> and the real thing is much smaller than that between a pirated audio cassette and the genuine article. Second, the border-disregarding Internet makes it easy to deliver works to a vast number of people.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once copyright works are widely distributed over the Internet, the conspiratorial interests of the pirate and the consumer blend seamlessly together. For any individual can, in theory, copy or alter any digitised work and distribute it at a few keystrokes to hundreds of friends. The new world that faces content industries is one in which the pirate and the potential customer may often be the same person.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Every year, the Business Software Alliance (<font size=-1>BSA</font>) compares sales of computers with sales of software. Working on a rule of thumb that a <font size=-1>PC</font> uses an average of almost three packages--a word-processor, a spreadsheet, and perhaps one other--it reckons that at least half the global market is supplied by pirated products. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (<font size=-1>IFPI</font>) reckons that one in five sales of recorded music is of a pirated copy. In the case of <font size=-1>CD</font>s, one in three sales by value is pirated.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Piracy figures that purport to show lost sales, as opposed to pirated copies as a proportion of total sales, are often overestimates. Many of those who buy fake software would never have paid the full price. Some defend piracy as a form of promotion, arguing that a generation of young Chinese has now grown used to (fake) Microsoft software. Neither argument disguises the fact that the "lost" market is huge, and the digital age will expand it (see <a href="wbsf1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One reason is that it will expand enormously what might be called the market for "altruistic" piracy. Many unauthorised copies, especially of software and music, are not sold by organised gangs but given away by people who do not think of it as a crime. PolyGram, a large Dutch recording company, reckons that three times as much music is privately copied as is legally sold. This article will probably be photocopied and passed around the offices of exactly the same organisations that queue up to denounce copyright theft.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This means that the content providers face a political challenge as well as a practical one: to convince people that stealing a piece of information is theft just like stealing a car. As Thomas Jefferson pointed out, somebody could take his idea and still leave him with what he originally had: "as he who lights his taper at mine receives light without darkening me." Many Internet fanatics like that attitude. But in Jefferson's day, legal copyright protection was young (the first statute was passed in Britain in 1709); and Americans, as Britain's authors endlessly complained, were notorious for pirating other countries' publications. Now that the United States is the world's biggest exporter of intellectual property, its politicians think differently.
</p><p><b>The force of law</b></b>
<br>A new report by Price Waterhouse, a consultancy, points to a scene depicting the 1963 March on Washington in that triumph of digital inventiveness, "Forrest Gump". It was filmed by taking a small group of actors, and digitally multiplying them into a crowd. Stored away for future use, the clip could be turned into a 1990s crowd scene with a few digitised haircuts. Who owns the rights: the original filmers, or the technician who transformed their work?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The point about this example is that, even when piracy is not involved, digital formats pose copyright conundrums. Even knottier problems arise once copyright material gets anywhere near the Internet. Copyright law confers two main rights: to authorise reproduction (ie, the making of copies), and to authorise the distribution of those copies. "The most basic question", says William Tanenbaum, a lawyer with Rogers &amp; Wells in New York, "is the nature of electronic transmission of a copyright work: is it reproduction or distribution or both?"
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far, nobody knows. Indeed, the digital age poses problems for traditional notions of both "reproduction" and "distribution".
<ul><li>Copyright law currently makes a distinction between reproduction for public use (which can be done only with the rights-holder's permission) and private use (which, within certain limits, is sometimes allowed to give users reasonable access to small bits of information). For instance, most publishers are happy for libraries to allow books to be copied by readers. However, now that everyone can download a perfect copy of a whole database or a video clip, should that distinction be allowed?
<li>If a surfer calls up a page of information from the Internet on to a screen, is that reproduction? After all, if the information is held merely in the computer's RAM</font>, or short-term memory, it will vanish if the user switches off. But lawyers now argue that it does infringe copyright. Mr Nimmer points out that "the RAM</font> can hold a work for a period of more than transitory duration, and that work can be held simultaneously in the RAM</font>s of 1,000 computers."
<li>Most people (and national laws) think of copyright in terms of an artistic or intellectual creation. A collection of addresses or credit ratings is hardly artistic, and yet it may cost a lot to compile. Do databases deserve a special, copyright-type protection?
<li>Under most copyright law, the distribution right controls the first sale of a copy, but not subsequent sales (so, for instance, a student can freely sell a second-hand textbook). But what if the initial copy can be perfectly copied again and again? "In a digital world", says Mark Turner of Garrett, a London firm of solicitors, "the key question is what copying is allowed."
<li>Current copyright law is based around national boundaries. The right to distribute copies of a CD</font> or magazine in one country does not allow those copies to be sold in another. Many content importers, especially developing countries, say this territorial restriction thwarts trade; America and Europe understandably want it to stay.
</font></li></ul><p><b>A harsher world
</b><br>Many expert groups are beavering away on new rules to deal with these points. In the United States, a group chaired by Bruce Lehman, the assistant commerce secretary, has drawn up proposals to revise copyright law. With an election imminent, they have run aground in Congress. In the European Union, another group last year drew up a green (consultative) paper on "copyright and related rights in a digital society", which may eventually become a directive. And the World Intellectual Property Organisation, a United Nations body based in Geneva, is trying to update the elderly Berne Convention which sets international standards for copyright laws.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In general the content producers and exporters involved in these groups are likely to take a tough theoretical stand, and try to extend copyright protection to new sorts of intellectual property. For instance, a new European directive extends copyright protection to databases. In particular, they are likely to argue that almost any kind of electronic reproduction or distribution of a copyright work requires the permission of the owner.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This means that the rights to free information that private citizens had in a pre-digital world will almost inevitably be diminished. Libraries will be an early target. Eric Gahrau of Bertelsmann, a giant German media conglomerate, deplores the holes in German law: "It's a complete catastrophe: vast exceptions for private copying allow a library to make a legal copy of a publication for its archives, and then to transmit it."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But what of the consequences of shutting such loopholes? Pamela Samuelson, professor of law at the University of California in Berkeley, argues that "people have a strong sense that what they do in their own home is nobody else's business; but the public's perception, and that of many publishers, is getting further and further apart."
</p><p><b>Pay me</b>
<br>Suppose that copyright provisions are tightened up. Can they be made to work? Clive Bradley of Britain's Publishers Association argues that it will become essential to have a payments system that can charge users of intellectual property for what they use: for the information in a database that is actually used, rather than for the database itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it will be immensely difficult. Part of the problem will be to monitor when copyright material is being used. That requires, in the first place, some way of identifying the owner of a right. Books have an internationally agreed numbering system, but it identifies only the physical volume and not its contents. Several competing schemes are being designed to identify the owners of other sorts of rights. Imprimatur, an organisation financed by the European Commission, is trying to keep track of such schemes, in the hope that common international standards will develop.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is all very laudable, but the difficulties are huge. Not until last year, says Chris Barlas, who runs the Imprimatur project, was there an internationally accepted system to identify films and television programmes. Even with an agreed numbering system, there has to be some way to attach an identifying sign, or watermark, to every copyrighted work. Such a sign has to appear on fragments of a work: a few bars of music, say, or a couple of stills from a film. Thorn <font size=-1>EMI</font>, a British music company, claims to have come up with a system that will work for music recordings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once a trade in rights can be identified, how should it be billed? Ideally, perhaps, every time somebody visited an Internet site that used a particular picture, the artist would receive a tiny payment; every time somebody looked at a page of a guidebook, the viewer would be billed a fragment of a penny. But this would require such a complex billing system that its cost might well exceed the revenue it produced.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Producers whose works combine several sorts of media--such as <font size=-1>CD</font>-<font size=-1>ROM</font>s--increasingly complain that conventional systems of clearing and paying for rights are cumbersome and expensive. They may have to contact different agencies for the rights to films, text and music. Worse, tariffs are linked to the number of copies that are made. In the case of new media, that is anachronistic: should the producer of a game pay an identical fee for a piece of music played right at the start, which every user will hear, and for a tune played only at level ten, which only the best players will enjoy?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Solving and simplifying payments problems is an essential part of persuading people to stick to the rules of copyright use. For if paying for something is easy and reasonable, people are much more likely to be law-abiding than if it is complicated and expensive.
</p><p><b>The thought police</b></b>
<br>How is copyright infringement to be curtailed? Content producers see three options: technology, law enforcement and public education. As a rule, the more low-tech an industry, the greater its faith in technological answers and vice versa. Charles Clark, of the Federation of European Publishers, likes to intone that "the answer to the machine is in the machine."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly a huge technological effort is being made to develop pirate-proof ways to transmit material. For example, <font size=-1>IBM</font> has developed a system of secure "packaging" for sending digital information over the Internet, and a clearing house through which commercial content providers can track delivery of and payment for contents held in such "packages". But most software companies are pessimistic. Ron Barker of Novell, which claims to lose $1 billion a year to the pirates, says gloomily: "Every time somebody comes up with a new technology, it takes just a week or two to get around it."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Companies such as Novell would prefer governments to clamp down on piracy. Thanks to the recent agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (<font size=-1>TRIPS</font>), governments have to incorporate international copyright agreements such as the Berne Convention into national law. But laws need to be enforced. The <font size=-1>BSA</font>'s Allen Dixon argues that a campaign in Italy has helped to reduce pirating of software from 90% in 1990 to 57% in 1994. "Even if you bring piracy rates down from 90% to 80%," he says, "you have doubled the size of the market." This strategy is fine as long as most pirates are businesses. But no government is likely to send the police to bash down doors at dawn in search of bootlegging by private citizens for their own use.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet helps the enforcers in one way. Piracy is easy to spot. Just type into one of the many search services a couple of sentences of a story from this paper, and you will be able to discover any pirated version of the piece. Sometimes, it can then be quickly rooted out. In April last year, a group of Norwegian students loaded several hundred music albums on to the Internet, using a server at their university, and offered them free of charge. The <font size=-1>IFPI</font> in Norway contacted their university and the site was shut down.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More often, cases are like that of Magicom, a German company selling thousands of bootlegged recordings through mail order, advertising them on the Internet. When their British Internet service provider was threatened with legal action, the page was withdrawn from the Net--but is now back, using a service provider based in Luxembourg. Luxembourg has so far failed to introduce laws to comply with either <font size=-1>EU</font> copyright directives or the <font size=-1>TRIPS</font> provisions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For enforcers, the Internet creates at least two problems. First, says James Lowe, Microsoft's head pirate-chaser, it may be hard to track down the source of illicit material. People put it on to the Net anonymously: "There's a hacker mentality in cyberspace." The server on which pirated "warez" <b></b>sic are held may be in one country, the server through which they are advertised in another, the seller in a third.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, once tracked, it may be hard to decide who is liable. One American court case (involving an infringement of <i>Playboy</i> magazine's copyright in some photographs) found the operator of the bulletin board that displayed them liable, even though he did not know of his subscribers' actions. Another, involving extracts from publications by the Church of Scientology, has reached the opposite view. Different countries will, in time, probably take different views of liability.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That creates scope for another problem: the evolution of copyright havens, where professional pirates will set up servers from which they can sell pirated wares. Garrett's Mr Turner claims to know of a large telecoms company which has been approached by a company wanting to set up an offshore base to sell bootlegged data.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will these headaches drive content companies out of business? Probably not, although they may destroy some of their profits. For one thing, however ingenious hackers may be, it will take a certain amount of time and ingenuity for the mass of ordinary people to benefit from their skills. Companies will face a trade-off: the higher the profit margin on their products, the greater the incentive for ordinary folk to crack encryption systems and buy from Luxembourg pirates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After all, Hollywood has survived for years even though television companies broadcast its films (admittedly months after their initial release). Most people trade off the bother of wrestling with the video recorder against the low cost of renting the same film from the nearest store.
</p><p><b>No solution</b></b>
<br>One answer to pirating is to make the real thing more valuable than the bootleg. Frequent updates may do that: not many people will bother to pirate a financial newsletter that is updated every day, or even every hour. Another answer, put forward (in a pricey newsletter) by Esther Dyson, an American cyber-guru, is for content providers to look for other ways to make money from their intellectual property. For instance, a company could give away its <font size=-1>CD</font>, but try to raise money from advertising or sponsorship. Or it can charge for spin-offs: the Grateful Dead, a pop group, has long allowed people to record its concerts, and made money from the admission tickets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This vision appeals to many Net folk. But there are doubts about its practicability. It might be fine for an entertaining speaker to give away his books, and hope to make the money back from seminars; but it is far harder for obscure authors. Netscape, a successful Internet firm, began by giving its Web browser away for free; now it charges $50 a shot. For the moment, at least, intellectual property's troubled encounter with the digital age is producing many more questions than answers.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?838422000,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>Financial regulation</b></p>
<h1>Old Lady, new problems</h1>


<p>SINCE Barings, a British merchant bank, collapsed in February 1995 after amassing &#163;860m ($1.4 billion) of trading losses, there have been many outside assertions that poor regulation by the Bank of England was partly to blame for the fiasco. Stung by the criticism, the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has been indulging in a little navel-gazing of her own.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On July 24th she revealed the results. The report, written by Arthur Andersen, a consultancy, considers how the Bank might become a better regulator. The Bank has agreed to the report's recommendations, trumpeting them as a "major programme of change". Sadly, they are not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The demise of Barings exposed several weaknesses in the way the Bank and other financial regulators keep watch over their charges. First, big banks have increasingly far-flung networks; national regulators simply do not have the resources to follow them. The trading risks that sank Barings occurred in Singapore, not in London. Second, the Barings group, like many other modern financial conglomerates, owned both a bank, which took deposits, and a securities firm, which took trading risks. Yet most regulators are still divided along traditional industry lines.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third weakness follows from the second: regulators are struggling to understand the complex trading risks that banks run. According to an official report into Barings' collapse published last July, regulators admitted to Barings executives in February 1993 that they did not "really understand" Baring Securities, its trading arm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fourth problem is more troublesome still. Until recently, regulators have relied mainly on totting up numbers (measuring a bank's capital, its biggest loan exposures, and so on) to do their job. But spotting weak management and poor controls is arguably a more important task. Barings suffered from both. On July 23rd Ian Hopkins, its former head of risk management, told a parliamentary committee that meetings of Barings' risk-management committee sometimes degenerated into "lots of table banging and lots of shouting."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The changes that the Bank announced this week should go some way towards tackling the last two of these problems. In future, it will recruit more supervisors, as well as experts in complicated financial instruments such as derivatives. It is also developing new ways to monitor banks' risks. And to help it judge the quality of a bank's internal controls and management, it will require its supervisors to visit their charges more often. (Astonishingly, the Bank's regulators never made a formal visit to Barings' offices before its collapse.) As a result of these reforms, the Bank reckons that the &#163;35m it spends on supervision each year could rise by &#163;7m-8m.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is little mention, however, of how the Bank might better supervise banks' international operations. Nor is anything said about how it could work more closely with securities regulators, such as Britain's Securities and Futures Authority (<font size=-1>SFA</font>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Michael Foot, the Bank's director of banking supervision, points out, it has been working hard to forge closer links with the <font size=-1>SFA</font>. But the dilemma is an acute one. There are few investment banks left in London without a commercial-bank parent; whether they own securities firms or not, most commercial banks now run big trading risks. Wholesale securities and banking regulation ought, many argue, to come under a single regulator.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Should that be the Bank of England? Possibly not. On balance, the <font size=-1>SFA</font> has a better claim for the job. After all, it has more experience in scrutinising trading businesses, where the biggest risks are often taken. A better solution still might be to create a new, independent regulator in which both the Bank's commercial-banking experts and the <font size=-1>SFA</font>'s investment-banking ones could be housed. The Andersen report does not address such issues.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More money and more staff should help at the margin. But if Britain's financial regulators seriously want to reduce the chances of another Barings, they may have to start thinking more radical thoughts.

<h1>How does your stockmarket grow?</h1>

<b>Emerging stockmarkets are often dismissed as little more than casinos. But new evidence shows that they can be important catalysts of growth

</b><p>LEGIONS of highly paid stockbrokers in London and New York pore over them. International fund managers bet billions of dollars on them. And investment bankers have made a fortune by organising the flotation of companies on them. But emerging stockmarkets still stir up a mixture of pride and fear among policymakers in poor countries. On the one hand, they see a blossoming bourse as proof that they are serious about pro-market reform; on the other, they worry that such markets might in some cases do more economic harm than good.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The recent gyrations of Wall Street are a timely reminder that stockmarkets are, by their nature, unpredictable beasts--and nowhere more so than in emerging markets, as investors who got their fingers burnt in the Mexican crisis that began in December 1994 can testify. Last week, Poland, Hungary and Brazil were among the markets that fell furthest in Wall Street's wake. Others, such as those of India and Turkey, have also been jittery lately.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In spite of this, says the International Finance Corporation (<font size=-1>IFC</font>), part of the World Bank, over 19,000 companies were listed on the stockmarkets of developing economies at the end of 1995, more than twice as many as a decade ago. Their share of world stockmarket capitalisation has also grown fast (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). But are poor economies benefiting from this?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At first sight, the answer seems obvious. By improving the efficiency with which money is channelled from savers to investors, stockmarkets should bring nothing but economic benefits. Companies have a new source of finance; savers have new investment opportunities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there are dangers, too. The biggest worry, which many governments have voiced incessantly since the Mexican crisis, is that opening up a domestic stockmarket to foreigners increases the risk that share prices will become more volatile, with footloose cash disappearing at the first sign of bad economic news. Such volatility, they fear, will deter local companies from making long-term investments. Big inflows and outflows of capital will also complicate the management of their exchange rates. Proponents of stockmarket liberalisation counter that the potential gains of foreign equity capital make such risks well worth running.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who is right? Surprisingly, there have been few serious attempts to measure the economic impact of stockmarkets in the developing world. In a series of recent papers* Ross Levine, an economist at the World Bank, and Sara Zervos of <font size=-1>BZW</font>, a British investment bank, have tried to fill the gap. They look closely at 49 countries (both rich and poor) between 1976 and 1993, and try to measure their stockmarkets' contribution to growth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To assess the stage of development that a market has reached, the economists use eight different indicators. One of the obvious measures gauges a market's size by looking at its capitalisation ratio, or the total value of shares as a percentage of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. But this alone fails to account for many other important features of stockmarkets. That is why Mr Levine and Ms Zervos also construct several measures of market liquidity, such as turnover ratios (which measure the total value of all trades divided by a country's market capitalisation). They also look at stockmarket volatility and the openness of countries' capital markets.
</p><p><b>Big</b>, <b>but not necessarily beautiful</b></b>
<br>The two economists then examine how closely these different indicators are correlated with economic growth. The strongest link is with liquidity: after adjusting for differences in other factors that can influence growth, such as education levels, inflation rates and openness to trade, they conclude that those countries with the most liquid stockmarkets tend to grow fastest. For example, they estimate that had Mexico's stockmarket been as liquid as Malaysia's in 1976, its economy would have enjoyed 0.4% a year faster growth per person until 1993.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the other hand, after accounting for liquidity and other factors, countries with large stockmarkets appear no more likely than those with small ones to grow quickly. Nor does there seem to be a strong link between stockmarket volatility and economic growth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why might liquidity matter so much? The most likely answer is that investors are leery of illiquid markets. Many profitable investments require a long-term commitment of capital; but savers might not want to tie up their savings for such long periods of time. Liquid equity markets allow savers to sell their shares easily if they want to, while allowing firms access to long-term capital through equity issues. Indeed, the study finds that those countries with the most liquid stockmarkets in 1976 both accumulated more capital and enjoyed higher productivity growth over the next 18 years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two economists also reckon that liquid stockmarkets encourage banks to lend, giving investment a further boost. This is because in poor countries a successful bourse can dramatically improve the information that is available about companies, which ought to give creditors confidence. That may be one reason why the ratio of bank loans to <font size=-1>GDP</font> tends to rise as stockmarkets become more liquid.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of these conclusions should be treated with care. Correlation does not prove causation. Fast-growing countries may simply be more likely to develop liquid stockmarkets. But the economists do make allowances for this, lending more credence to their findings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given that stockmarket liquidity is a useful catalyst, how can policymakers improve it? One obvious way is to open markets to foreign investors, the very thing that many emerging-market governments fear most. For them, the authors have good news. Not only does liberalising capital controls appear to boost liquidity, but the resulting increase in short-term volatility does not appear to hamper growth. That is something for poor countries to remember as their markets bob around in Wall Street's wake.
